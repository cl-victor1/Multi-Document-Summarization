EDITORIAL: OVERKILL ON DRUKEN DRIVING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesda, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, and the police
commissioner, Howard Safir, cannot be faulted for wanting to crack
down on drunken driving. In the hands of someone who is
intoxicated, a car is a deadly weapon aimed at members of the
public. Still, the sweeping new plan to confiscate the cars of
virtually everyone arrested for drunken driving within city limits
seems overly broad. It ought to be possible to have strict law
enforcement without one-size-fits-all justice.
</P>
<P>
   We would like to see stiffer punishments for drunken driving,
including more confiscations where appropriate. But there has to be
room for legislative and judicial input. Giuliani argues that
judges already have powers to overrule confiscations, and he
estimated that two or three out of every 10 seized cars would be
returned to their owners. He believes that the imposition of an
inflexible-looking basic policy has big advantages in public
education.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that New Yorkers are beginning to complain about
what looks like bullying law enforcement. Also, making officers
appear to be part of the punishment process threatens to undermine
public regard for a force that has done a good job of reducing
crime. Under the crackdown, which got under way this week, officers
will continue to seize the car of anyone arrested for driving while
intoxicated and found to have a blood alcohol level at or above the
legal limit of .10. Generally, the city will then hold the vehicle
while it initiates a forfeiture proceeding. The owner will have to
go to Civil Court to try to get it back, which may not happen even
if he is acquitted in the drunken-driving case.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutionality of such seizures is uncertain. For legal
authority the city cites a provision of its administrative code
that gives police the power to seize property that is the
``instrumentality'' of a crime. The city can plausibly argue that
the cars of drunken drivers fit that broad definition, since
driving with high blood alcohol levels is by definition a crime
that requires a vehicle in order to commit it. The plan would be
unlikely to offend the present forfeiture-friendly U.S. Supreme
Court. But New York's top court, the Court of Appeals, will
probably be more skeptical about pre-conviction forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the mayor's approach may turn out to be less rigid
than it appears. In the case of a repeat offender, or an egregious
case of a first-time offender involved in an accident or driving
with a blood alcohol level way above the state's already high
limit, loss of a vehicle can be a reasonable cost of protecting
public safety. But that approach seems too sweeping for first-time
offenders who were lucky enough not to have caused any injury or
are later acquitted of the criminal charges. In such cases, judges
will still have some general discretion to avoid inflicting
disproportionate punishment on the defendant. But their power to do
so is murky.
</P>
<P>
   The city says it wants to avoid hurting innocent third parties.
In some cases it may allow an innocent spouse who jointly owns a
vehicle to keep the car. In other cases, innocent co-owners may
petition for half the proceeds from the vehicle's sale. But that
may not be sufficient to avoid major hardship for some families,
including the loss of employment as a result of the vehicle's
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   We are sympathetic to the hard line taken by those who have lost
loved ones to drunken drivers. But New York City and state have
legislative and judicial bodies that need to be brought in to
produce law-enforcement solutions that will enjoy broad public
support. Stern executive edicts are part of running a complex city
like New York, but they are not the answer to every problem.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: PEACE ON HOLD IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations over a peace plan for Kosovo did not follow the
advance script, and have now adjourned for three weeks in a state
of great uncertainty. Whether the talks can be brought to a
successful conclusion depends on whether the two sides are prepared
to make compromises they have resisted and whether they refrain
from violence during this delicate interval.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian negotiators did their part Tuesday to make peace
possible by softening their unexpected demand that a political
settlement include a referendum on independence in Kosovo in three
years. If the ethnic Albanian delegation returns to France in three
weeks ready to sign the peace deal proposed by the United States,
its European allies and Russia, Serbia will be isolated in its
opposition to the plan. In that circumstance, NATO would be free to
initiate air strikes against Serbian military targets to force
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, to accept the proposed
deal. Serbia has balked at allowing NATO peacekeepers into Kosovo
as part of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much chance for both sides to undermine the peace
plan over the next three weeks. Having declared the need to return
home to test public opinion _ in reality, to try to persuade
hard-line guerrilla leaders _ the ethnic Albanians could shift
course by the time the talks resume next month, and once again
insist on a referendum. This would scuttle the chance for
self-government and the NATO protection that Kosovo's Albanian
population deserves and needs.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, the negotiating break is an invitation to more
violence in Kosovo. If ethnic Albanian guerrillas score some
victories, they may hope to persuade supporters that independence
can be won without a peace deal. Milosevic may decide to escalate
Serbian military attacks to try to defeat the guerrillas or anger
the ethnic Albanians and drive them away from any agreement. If he
can provoke the guerrillas to reject the plan, he will probably
avoid NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The West must do everything possible to keep the parties on
track to a workable accord. It must keep alive the bombing threat
against Milosevic and not allow him to dictate conditions that will
eventually undermine peace. If there is new violence or more
attacks on members of the international verification mission now in
Kosovo, NATO may have to use its air power in the days ahead to
prevent greater bloodshed. The prospects for peace are not good.
But they have not yet perished. &QL;

COMMENTARY: STREETCAR NAMED BETRAYAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 8th thru 10th grafs) (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Linda Tripp and Christopher Hitchens may be the most
famous canaries of the Starr war, but Elia Kazan was the most
famous canary of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   High in the Hollywood Hills, Bernard Gordon, a writer who was
blacklisted, is working to make sure that on Oscar night Kazan does
not escape his past. Gordon, now 79, is naming names. The name he
gives the dazzling director _ who will be awarded an honorary Oscar
by the Motion Picture Academy _ is Rat Fink.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon formed the Committee Against Silence and will picket the
Chandler Pavilion on Oscar night, wearing a tuxedo that he had made
for himself in Spain, where he had a successful career in movies
after his exile from Hollywood. Blacklist black tie.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the audience to fight silence with silence, and refuse
to acknowledge Kazan's award. ``It would be too much to boo or walk
out,'' he says. ``I got the idea of not applauding when I watched
President Clinton's State of the Union and the Republicans sat on
their hands. I think the same thing of Bob Barr and Elia Kazan. One
is not a good director and one is a good director. But they're the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon does not want to debate whether artists who commit
egregious acts in their personal lives can still be considered
great artists. He knows they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are giving Kazan a lifetime achievement award,'' he
says, ``and the major achievement of his lifetime was to contribute
to one of the worst civil liberties violations in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says he does not particularly like President Clinton, who
also gets lavished with high job-approval ratings despite egregious
personal acts. But he thinks the Republicans and Kenneth Starr have
engaged in sexual McCarthyism and flirted with a police state.
</P>
<P>
   He has attracted more media attention than Hollywood outrage.
Privately, some Hollywood liberals muse that Kazan's award is an
appropriate bookend to the lifetime achievement Oscar that Charlie
Chaplin was given in 1972 _ an award that was vigorously protested
by Hollywood conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that the co-chair of the Committee for Silence is
Leone Hankey, a 45-year-old lawyer and activist with no connection
to blacklisting or Hollywood. ``All the people who were blacklisted
died off or are incredibly old,'' she says. ``I'm dealing with all
these 88-year-old people who I have to yell at on the phone to make
them hear me. It's poignant that they want to get their message
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The political prism has shifted in the time since Elia Kazan
testified. The idealism that once enveloped the Old Left began
dissipating decades ago. History has a way of getting at the truth,
and it has brought out the terrible stench of Stalinism. These
days, it's hard to find serious people who will argue the innocence
of Alger Hiss or the Rosenbergs. Many find Kazan offensive now not
for his dim view of Communists, but for the scuzzy way he expressed
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton impeachment fiasco also began and ended in betrayal.
It started with Linda Tripp's treacherous taping and culminated
with Christopher Snitchens. But these impeachment betrayals lack
the grandeur of the Kazan betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp is no Whittaker Chambers, and Sidney Blumenthal is
no Alger Hiss. And the turpitude represented by Clinton is not
exactly world-historic. It's nice to live in secure times, when one
doesn't have to awake in the morning to questions of life and
death. Still, it isn't easy to be satisfied with the smallness of
our experience. We have developed a bad case of magnitude envy. In
a culture obsessed with entertainment, celebrity, buzz, spin,
market share, synergy, gestures, decaf skim lattes and cigar bars,
we feel diminished and puny. We have developed a craving for real
nobility, large principles, passions with scale and profound
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, audiences are still kindling to the 50-year-old
``Death of a Salesman,'' drawn to its outsize emotions. In movies,
Omaha Beach and grand Elizabethan epics rule. On television, the
60s mini-series became a nostalgia ratings bonanza by recalling
struggles over civil rights and the Vietnam War, fights that seem a
lot more compelling than an impeachment imbroglio that turned on
who touched whom where.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else, treachery ain't what it used to be.

MODANO'S HAT TRICK KEYS STARS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock wanted to burn the
game tape. Stars centers Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk wouldn't
mind using it as a training guide.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars last night threw away the shackles of the conservative
hockey endorsed by Hitchcock and defeated the Nashville Predators,
4-3. In their first trip to the NHL's newest expansion city, the
Stars rallied from a 3-1 third-period deficit _ the first time this
season they have come back in the third period to post a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Nieuwendyk scored his 800th career point and
Modano, who had a hat trick, scored his 300th career goal. It was
night of milestones as the Stars recorded a season-high 45 shots
and both teams combined for a season high of 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was good for us,'' Hitchcock confessed, his heart still
racing from the NASCAR-like pace of the game. ``Holy cow, it was
revved up. But we needed to find a way to beat a goalie who was
standing on his head, and we did that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Stars' NHL-best record to 36-10-9, good
for 81 points. They lead the second-place Phoenix Coyotes by 13
points in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars outlasted Predators goalie Mike Dunham, who was
spectacular from the opening drop, robbing Tony Hrkac, stoning
Brent Severyn and frustrating Jere Lehtinen _ all in the first six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had an 11-2 advantage in shots when Modano scored in
the slot off a smooth feed from Brett Hull for a 1-0 lead at the
9:50 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, the Predators electrified their fans and
stunned the Stars, scoring the next three goals _ all against the
line which had the biggest mismatch of the night _ Modano, Hull and
Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Atcheynum scored off a slick feed from Robert Valicevic,
just up from the minors. Then Scott Walker punched in two goals,
the second a spin-o-rama move down the slot that literally had the
Stars shaking their heads with a 3-1 deficit just 37 seconds into
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when the reconstruction began. Instead of panicking,
Hitchcock and his troops stayed with the same lines and most of the
same pairings.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was a blur as the Stars outshot the Predators,
18-8, but couldn't get anything past Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' second line of Nieuwendyk, Pat Verbeek and Jamie
Langenbrunner was buzzing all night, finishing with 12 shots. But
they didn't score until Nieuwendyk set up Verbeek for a rebound
goal at the 7:50 mark of the third period, and that changed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we got the second one, we'd win,'' Modano said.
``Nieuwie's line had been all over it all night, and eventually
they got the one we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's assist gave him 391 to go with his 409 career goals
_ and a total of 800 points in 813 games. Modano worked free for
two goals, giving him 300 in his 689th career game. Modano has two
hat tricks in the past three games and three on the season. He had
only four career hat tricks entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   His second goal, to tie the game at the 9:01 mark of the third,
was a fantastic effort as he stole the puck from Jamie Heward,
faked a backhand and slipped a wrister around a fallen Dunham. The
game-winner then came off a perfect feed from Lehtinen, who had
worked his way free on a wraparound attempt and left an open net
for Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Ed Belfour made several strong stops to hold that lead,
and the Stars left Nashville with one of their most exciting
victories. Now, they get to try to duplicate the result tonight
when the two teams meet in a rematch at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   So are you ready for another shootout, Brett Hull?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our coach would be very happy if we did,'' Hull
said, referring to the defensive style that Hitchcock prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm burning the tape,'' Hitchcock joked.

LAKERS RETURN TO SQUARE ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ So now, with a horrific road trip in their
past, Robert Horry rejoining them at present and Dennis Rodman in
their immediate future, the Lakers' season starts anew.
</P>
<P>
   In third-grader lingo, it's a do-over. Starting today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're gonna drop a bomb on this team,'' said Rick Fox,
``you might as well drop it now, when we're in disarray to begin
with. Let's get (Rodman) in here and somehow try to build some
rhythm from that point on.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding project starts with an impromptu practice at the
Forum this afternoon, right after introductions. And Team Chaos
might yet find some stability in the Worm Era.
</P>
<P>
   The team planned to have Rodman sign his contract after Tuesday
night's game _ thus delaying a roster move _ and Horry received
medical clearance earlier in the day after missing seven games with
an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Rodman revives a suddenly listless team or drags it
further into the abyss will soon be determined. Coach Del Harris
has consulted John Lucas, who coached Rodman in San Antonio, and
Chicago Bulls assistant Frank Hamblen, and has decided to use the
tried-and-true approach with Rodman _ the long leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has worked for Chicago and for John Lucas at San Antonio,
to allow Dennis a good deal of personal freedom,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that means Rodman's Rules are a little different than
those for his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on a team is a matter of give-and-take,'' Harris said.
``The key element is to be a team man . . . and on and off the
court. We will allow Dennis to be Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Fox said, ``The more of a collar you put on him, the more
his actions rare up. He's a product of negation.''
</P>
<P>
   And can this young team and its coach handle the Dennis Show?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's going to wear high heels and dresses and go off
to Vegas to get married,'' Kobe Bryant said, ``but I can put up
with that for a championship ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman will be in uniform for Thursday night's game against the
Clippers and will be the starting power forward as soon as he's
ready.
</P>
<P>
   __ Heartening diagnosis: Horry was cleared to play by team
doctors Tuesday, 10 days after being diagnosed with an irregular
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Tests did not pinpoint a specific cause for Horry's irregular
heartbeat, but doctors believe it was brought on by a viral
infection. He will be able to play without any restrictions or any
risk, team spokesman John Black said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: To make room for Rodman on the roster, the
Lakers will probably place rookie Ruben Patterson on the injured
list today. Patterson came down with a sudden case of right-knee
tendinitis Tuesday night and did not dress for the game.

Pack pushes pace, then Mavs hold on 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Aha, so that's how it's supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 1-6 road trip, the weary Mavericks stumbled onto
their blueprint for victory last night at Reunion Arena, getting an
up-tempo spark from Robert Pack, rugged rebounding from Gary Trent,
shot-blocking intimidation from Shawn Bradley and the key baskets
from Michael Finley in an 89-85 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Hold off on the championship parade for now, but the Mavericks
have their first victory over a winning team, two victories in
their past three games, and their first home victory since April
11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we can play better, but we found a way to
scratch out a win,'' coach Don Nelson said. ``It would've been
quite a downer to let this one get away.''
</P>
<P>
   They almost did.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (3-9) saw a 70-53 lead dwindle to 76-75 midway
through the final quarter and to 83-81 with 2:40 remaining. But
Finley drilled a 15-foot jumper from the left baseline for a
four-point lead then made a 20-footer from the right baseline that
barely beat the shot clock and gave the Mavericks an 87-81 lead
with 45 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later I knew we'd knock down a couple of big
shots,'' said Finley, who scored 16 of his game-high 22 points in
the second half. ``The great thing is I didn't have to create those
shots; my teammates found me. It's a step in the right direction.
Hopefully it will be contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were coming off an 11-day road trip, but it was
the Hawks who appeared to run out of energy. Playing without
injured leading scorer Steve Smith, Atlanta trailed 47-38 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Pack entered the game with Atlanta leading 15-7 and immediately
energized the Mavericks' offense, hitting two fast-break jumpers
and scoring off a steal from Mookie Blaylock to tie the score at
15. In the second quarter, Pack _ who scored 31 points in the
Mavericks' previous home game 12 days ago _ again raced past
Atlanta's transition defense. His drive-and-dish penetration set up
two Hubert Davis 3-pointers as the Mavericks took control of the
score and the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Robert coming off the bench,'' Nelson said. ``He really
energizes us.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pack: ``It's the role they've defined for me and if it
helps us win games, then fine. We're a better team when we play
up-tempo, and that's my game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pack lit Dallas' fire with 15 points and eight assists,
Bradley (nine points, four blocks) occupied Hawks center Dikembe
Mutombo, Trent (12 points, 10 rebounds) did the dirty work and
Finley carried his offensive load by making six of his last seven
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks finish a stretch of seven games in nine days with
three in a row vs. Denver tomorrow, at Utah on Friday and vs.
Sacramento on Saturday. /

POLICE ARREST MOTHER OF FIVE IN DISMEMBERING OF HUSBAND
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ A 37-year-old mother of five who claimed she
had been abused by her beer-drinking, cocaine-using husband shot
him in the head, dismembered his body and set the remains on fire,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladis Barreras Soto was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of
murder and the grisly dismemberment of Pedro Alba Barragan, 35,
whom she married in 1980. His head and limbs were found stuffed in
a smoldering garbage bag Monday night in a drainage ditch along the
Ventura River northwest of Los Angeles. His torso was found in her
garage during a search Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday folks find this stuff hard to believe. I find it hard
to believe,'' said Ventura police Lt. Brad Talbot. ``Just the
grisly nature of the crime is disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Police speculated that domestic violence was at the heart of the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sad homicide,'' Talbot said. ``We have a family
decimated by violence, a husband who is killed ... pretty tragic
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives identified Barragan through his fingerprints, which
were on file because of his 1996 arrest on charges that he hit Soto
and one of their sons, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Soto was granted a temporary restraining order against Barragan
in August 1997, after she claimed her husband was ``a heavy beer
drinker and also a crack cocaine user'' who beat her on several
occasions, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A judge quashed the restraining order in September 1997, when
neither Soto nor Barragan showed up for a court date.
</P>
<P>
   Barragan's body was found about 7 p.m. Monday when a transient
saw a woman setting fire to a plastic bag on a Ventura street, then
driving off in a dark, older model hatchback, police said. Thinking
it was burning trash, the transient went to investigate and
discovered Barragan's body.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary autopsy showed that Barragan died from a gunshot
wound to the head, said Jim Wingate, chief deputy coroner. More
tests will be conducted this week.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said this was Ventura's first homicide this year and
likely the first dismemberment case in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor George Mendoza said Barragan and Soto moved to their
apartment last fall, and that nothing seemed to be out of the
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really got to know them,'' said Mendoza, a substitute
teacher who recently taught one of the children, who range from 6
to 11. ``It seemed like a normal family. It seemed like a very good
family as far as I could tell from the short time they were living
here. It's shocking for me. I wouldn't expect anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he never spoke with Soto, Mendoza said she seemed
friendly when he regularly saw her take out the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a normal quiet person; friendly, too,'' he said.
``She was trying to blend into the neighborhood.''

THIEF WITH SWEET TOOTH STEALS CANDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Crime has never been so sweet.
</P>
<P>
   A burglar or burglars broke into The Candy Factory in suburban
North Hollywood over the weekend and hauled out 20 pounds of
luscious sweets _ including a bucket of chocolate roses, a giant
heart-shape box of Valentine's Day candies and four two-pound boxes
of gourmet chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'd think they'd bust in and steal bonbons?'' store owner
Frank Sheftel said Tuesday. ``They didn't touch any of the computer
equipment, the scales or any of the really expensive stuff, thank
goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   A helium tank and $50 in change also were taken. Sheftel
estimates his loss at about $400.
</P>
<P>
   Another mystery: The culprit or culprits apparently sampled two
cherry cordials out of a box of 10, rewrapped the box, retied the
red bow and put it back in the display case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liquor cherry cordials,'' Sheftel said. ``It must have
been kids. Maybe they didn't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police detectives stopped short of putting out an
all-points-bulletin for a couple of hefty, pimple-pocked bandits
with chocolate-smeared faces and helium-enhanced Donald Duck
accents, but they are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Officers were called to the store Monday morning after a
neighboring business owner noticed a broken window at The Candy
Factory, which is closed Sunday and Monday. The culprits were long
gone with their tasty loot.
</P>
<P>
   Sheftel puzzled that the thieves chose his store over a nearby
computer learning center, a pizza restaurant or a drug store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, it's a candy store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Detective Daniel Moran said the heist sounds like a typical
smash-and-grab burglary with an unusual sweet twist. He said the
suspects probably opted for a sugar buzz when they found the
register lacked serious cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get window smashes from time to time,'' Moran said.
``Usually, it's young adults who break in and take cash.''

PIT BULLS ATTACK 2 RESIDENTS IN L.A. NEIGHBORHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Animal Services officers have captured
two free-roaming pit bull dogs suspected of vicious attacks on
several residents, and officers combed the neighborhood for others.
</P>
<P>
   One man was bitten Monday night as he changed a tire outside his
home in suburban Granada Hills. A second attack occurred in the
same neighorhood where Veronica Arce was walking out of her
mother-in-law's home with her 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The two dogs were found roaming Robert Frost Middle School,
where maintenance workers confined them in a gated area until
Animal Services officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not uncommon,'' said Jackie David, spokeswoman for
Animal Services. ``It happens all the time. Dogs attack over food,
sex or territory. We're probably dealing with irresponsible pet
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   From her home, where she was recovering Tuesday, Arce described
how the dogs attacked without warning as she stepped onto the
sidewalk. One of the dogs clamped its teeth onto her arm and
wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, Oh my God, if I don't find a way to defend myself they
will kill me or destroy my arms,'' said Arce, 39, who was bitten
five times on her right arm, once on her left arm and several times
on her right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was about to faint,'' said 9-year-old Santiago
Arce, who stayed home from school because of the terrifying
incident.
</P>
<P>
   After Arce screamed for help, two friends inside her
mother-in-law's home came to her rescue, beating the dogs with a
pot to chase they off. She was treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Neither dog had a license, collar or name tag. One pit bull was
a neutered male, which leads officers to believe it has an owner,
said David. The other dog was a female pit bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hold them for a week or two to see if the owner
comes in,'' David said. ``If they don't come in, we're going to
(euthanize) the dogs because they are dangerous and therefore (not
adoptable).''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the city dispatched its Special Enforcement Unit _
three officers devoted solely to capturing the city's estimated
44,000 stray dogs _ and one animal control officer to the
neighborhood to look for other pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   A resident in the neighborhood said two dogs also attacked her
dog and pulled his head through a fence. Animal Services officers
believe the captured dogs attacked her pet, but they continued to
search for another set of dogs believed to have attacked the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dogs roam in packs so it's possible they separated,''
said David.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the captured dogs could face vicious-animal
complaints, said Animal Services Officer Jesse Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   Residents will hold a meeting about the neighborhood's loose-dog
problem Thursday and Animal Services officers will answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the stray dog population is concentrated in South
Central Los Angeles and the east and north San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Services General Manager Dan Knapp said ridding the
streets of stray and wandering animals is a top priority for the
city. He has asked for an additional $262,000 to hire seven
officers and one supervisor to battle the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gini Barrett, president of the American Humane Association in
suburban Sherman Oaks and a member of the city's animal regulation
board, cited Monday's attacks as yet another reason to improve the
city's animal law enforcement tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you dismantle your animal control
agency,'' said Barrett. ``The reason so many people let their dogs
run loose on the streets is because it's been 20 years since we
have had a substantial animal control presence to remind people
it's illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Health Department dismantled its dog bite
investigation unit in 1995, so dog bite statistics are not
available. In 1996, the city and county reported 878 animal bites _
dogs, cats and wild animals _ to state health officials, but many
consider this figure to be a low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Services currently operates on an $8.2 million annual
budget with 45 officers policing a city of 3.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the agency took in 33,000 stray dogs, of which animal
control officers caught 7,581.

ROAD-WEARY MAVERICKS SHOW SOME UNEXPECTED SPUNK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Suffice to say, they didn't return home as conquering
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a dreadful 11-day, seven-game, NBA-forced march, the
Mavericks returned to Reunion Arena last night in the throes of an
identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are (choose one, please):
</P>
<P>
   1. a young team in a desperate search for a winning combination,
</P>
<P>
   2. a young team on a suicide mission for a mad scientist of a
coach,
</P>
<P>
   3. a good waste of $24,
</P>
<P>
   4. Dennis Rodman's last choice.
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers here. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But, lo and behold, a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a kick in the teeth,'' coach Don Nelson
said of the alternative, after his Mavericks had knocked off the
equally discombobulated Atlanta Hawks, 89-85.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie's frequent fliers had arrived home from Monday night's
game in Phoenix sometime near 2 a.m., and after having played 48 of
their most listless minutes of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So how unexpected was this?
</P>
<P>
   This much: the Mavericks hadn't beaten a team over the .500 mark
since March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   That it happened last night may say more about the NBA's
vagabond schedule than it did about either the Hawks or Mavericks.
But after 11 nights of ordering room service, the Mavericks weren't
in the mood for labeling anything with an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows a lot of character to come off that road trip _ a
trip without a lot of wins (read: one) _ and come in here and
win,'' said guard Robert Pack, who scored 13 of his 15 points in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Pack is right. This was a game that they could have easily
mailed in. Having the finger-wagging Dikembe Mutombo in town will
do that to a struggling team.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pack, Gary Trent and Chris Anstey supplying a
second-period spark, the Mavericks asserted themselves as they had
never done this season. The strange brew continued in the second
half when Michael Finley suddenly started looking like the old
Finley, and Shawn Bradley again played like _ dare we say it? _ a
franchise cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   OK, a franchise brick.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley finished with nine points in 35 minutes, but that stat
remained one of the most misleading of the young season. A better
line for Bradley was the one that said he blocked four shots, and
the hidden ones that said he hustled and frequently disrupted the
Hawks in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The new-old Bradley isn't looking to shoot. It's been like
taking off his cap with the propeller on the top. He looks like a
real player out there.
</P>
<P>
   And this is with no practice to speak of. Unless somebody puts
in a court at the Denver airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' veteran A.C. Green said about the lack of practice
time. ``We're struggling with continuity, with chemistry, and it's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it's been hard for Finley. Amid great expectations, the
third-year pro's season has been a blur of hotel lobbies and missed
jump shots. He came into last night's game as the team's leading
scorer, but battling an apparently flagging self-confidence and
shooting only 39 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same reportedly rising star who was handpicked by
Michael Jordan himself to wear His Airness' new style of Nikes.
They're sharp. They sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, alas, couldn't have been helping the sales.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half against the Hawks, suddenly there was the
old Finley. He nailed five of six from the floor and scored 16 of
his game-high 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole demeanor of our team picked up in the second half,''
Finley said, deflecting the praise away from himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good I hit those shots, obviously. But that was more
because my teammates fed me.''
</P>
<P>
   So go figure. Mike, Mike, was it the shoes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was an excellent start \Rto the Mavs' next 10-day
stretch\S,'' Finley said. ``We were coming off a long, long, long,
long road trip. Hopefully, this will become a common thing for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's not get giddy, Mike. Somebody still has to explain
Nellie's mad scientist of a rotation, one that saw Green in the
middle at crunch time and Steve Nash, playing sick, getting most of
the second-half minutes instead of Pack.
</P>
<P>
   But that is another night's mystery in a season of intrigue for
the Mavericks.

WETTELAND EXPECTED TO BE READY FOR OPENER

<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers closer John Wetteland's injured
right ankle should heal in about two weeks and he is expected to be
available for Opening Day, the team's orthopedic consultant said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's ankle locked during a 10-minute bullpen session
Monday, but X-rays and a magnetic-resonance-imaging test revealed
no structural damage to the bone or tendons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely unlikely that John will have surgery during the
season for his ankle,'' Dr. John Conway said. ``He just has a
soft-tissue injury. In most cases, two weeks is enough for that to
heal.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ankle responds to treatment within two weeks and he
experiences no further setbacks, Wetteland will be available for
Opening Day, Conway said. The Rangers plan further tests if
Wetteland's condition doesn't improve by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who limped noticeably through the clubhouse
yesterday, began his rehabilitation with range-of-motion exercises,
muscle stimulation, ice and heat therapy and anti-inflammatory
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more strength in it today, and that's encouraging,''
said Wetteland, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, though, acknowledged a decrease in the ankle's range
of motion and an increase in pain. X-rays Monday revealed one loose
body in the ankle, and Wetteland could undergo surgery after the
season to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, a one-inning specialist, doesn't as long to prepare
for the season as starting pitchers, who have to build strength and
endurance for 120-pitch appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training is for starting pitchers,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Everyone else can be ready in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates declined to discuss his contingency plan should Wetteland
be unavailable for Opening Day, but the manager mentioned three
possibilities. The Rangers could utilize Tim Crabtree or Danny
Patterson as their closer or adopt a closer-by-committee approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it won't come to that,'' said Patterson, who
recorded two saves in two opportunities last year and yearns to
become a closer someday. ``This is not the way I would want to be
thrust into that role, but I definitely wouldn't shy away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree echoed Patterson's sentiments and said he would not be
intimidated by the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different than pitching the seventh or eighth
innings,'' said Crabtree, who went 2-1 with a 2.30 earned-run
average in his final 22 appearances of 1998. ``You just happen to
be pitching the ninth inning protecting a one-, two- or three-run
lead.''

COWBOYS ON SCHEDULE FOR CORYATT TOUR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Quentin Coryatt sweepstakes begins in
earnest Sunday, the free-agent linebacker's agent said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zucker said the former Texas A&AMP;M star has visits scheduled
with four teams, including the Cowboys. Coryatt's tour starts
Sunday in Chicago and he plans to visit Philadelphia and Carolina.
An official tour of the Cowboys' facility is set for ``the week of
March 8.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said Coryatt has fully recovered from pectoral and
shoulder injuries that forced him to miss the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker reiterated that the Cowboys are Coryatt's first choice,
however, he said he expects a strong market for his client and
envisions adding a few more teams to the shopping list before a
decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also are one of the teams Zucker plans to talk to
about a sign-and-trade deal for another client, Cincinnati
free-agent receiver Carl Pickens. The Bengals made Pickens their
franchise player so any team that signs him would have to give up
two first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also have expressed interest in Chargers restricted
free-agent receiver Charlie Jones, said his agent, Kendall Kremer.
Jones was the Chargers' second-leading receiver last season and
would only cost a fourth-round pick as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted free-agent receiver Raghib Ismail is considered to
be at the top of the Cowboys' list.
NFL EUROPE ASSIGNMENTS
</P>
<P>
   The six players the Cowboys allocated to NFL Europe for the
spring season were assigned to teams: Chris Brymer, Oliver Ross,
Jason Tucker and Robert Thomas to Rhein, Terry Billups to Scotland
and Brandon Noble to Barcelona.

   ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on
Tuesday, killing at least nine people and leaving dozens missing,
in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow
disaster in years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters
from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border,
where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of
snow and rubble for survivors. At least 30 people, some of them
critically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest snowstorms in 50 years set off massive avalanches
all across the Alps in recent weeks, killing dozens of residents
and ski vacationers in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In
Switzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had
risen to seven. Houses, railroads and highways were buried by
avalanches. Tens of thousands of tourists were stranded in some of
northern Europe's most fashionable resorts.
</P>
<P>
   In Galtuer, a town of 700 year-round inhabitants and about 3,000
tourists in Tyrol Province's Paznaun Valley, the avalanche
thundered though the heart of town near the village church at 4:00
p.m. instantly crushing four houses.
</P>
<P>
   The village, which has no hospital, had been cut off from the
outside world by heavy snows and high winds for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were drinking hot mulled wine, when suddenly it started''
Franz Wenko, a hotel operator in Galtuer, told Austrian television.
``he lights went out. It was dark. There was only dust and snow. We
got out of there as fast as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Thomas Schoenherr of the Austrian army, told Austrian radio
on Tuesday evening that about 55 people were feared missing in
Galtuer. Other estimates varied. Some officials said 20 to 30
people were still missing. Another government spokesman said that
only ``a few'' were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian army helicopters remained grounded in the town of
Landeck, about 20 miles from Galtuer, overnight. Schoenherr said,
``We will meet again at 6 a.m. to assess what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the village, witnesses said the residents were digging
for survivors. ``Some 300 people are looking for buried people in
the mass of snow,'' Lufwig Walter, a ski instructor, told the
Austrian Press Agency. Walter said that in some parts of the
village, snow was 17 feet high. ``There's no let-up,'' he said,
referring to the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, who is believed to be the only one in the village,
told an APA reporter by telephone, ``We are working in very basic
conditions.'' Snow fell heavily overnight, and the news agency
reported that another 20 inches were expected by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   All over Europe, the avalanches took lives and destroyed homes.
A 35-year-old German woman was killed when a snowslide ploughed
into a chalet in Sportsgastein, near Salzburg, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In the ski village of Morgex, in northern Italy, a 52-year-old
woman was killed when her house collapsed under an avalanche before
daylight. Three others in the house survived, but she was killed
when a steel beam pierced her chest.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, teams of rescue workers searching for survivors
found five more bodies on Tuesday, after an avalanche that crushed
chalets near Evolene on Sunday. Four of the victims _ one a child _
were French tourists. The other was a 28-year-old local man. Three
people were still missing as of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In France, blizzards hampered rescuers seeking French skiers and
hikers missing in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   In western Austria alone, about 20,000 tourists have been unable
to leave their hotels since last Wednesday. So much snow had fallen
over the last week that the Austrian Motoring Association
complained that its density monitors had been buried, making it
impossible to measure the snow fall. Swiss television reported that
as many as 60,000 people were snowbound in the resorts of Davos and
Klosters.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Europe, driving snow caused trains to be
canceled. Highways were blocked or traffic was backed up for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The recent avalanches, labeled by some newspapers as ``the white
death,'' were described as the largest and most terrifying in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   `'I've seen many avalanches, but not the type that come into
your house and blow it away,'' said Nathan Wallace, 28, from
Mammoth Lakes, Calif., whose chalet near Chamonix was destroyed by
an avalanche on Feb. 9. `'It was more like a California
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and his girlfriend, Alicia Boice, 21, were rescued two
hours after the roof of their chalet collapsed.

GILKEY'S DECI SION DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is Bernard Gilkey thinking?
</P>
<P>
   By single-handedly blocking the trade that would have sent him
to Pittsburgh for Tony Womack and Al Martin, Gilkey has placed
himself in a perilous spot with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   If Gilkey's in this just for the money, then Arizona's as good a
place as any to collect it. But if he's a baseball player, then
competing in Pittsburgh was the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   This is a player who may find himself buried so deep on the
Diamondbacks roster that the club may need to send out a search
party to find him in its own dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for this to turn into a nasty situation down the
road is great.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the Diamondbacks were exploring other ways Tuesday
to trade for Womack, which would further push Gilkey down their
depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the idea to change some language in his contract
(which would not have cost him a cent), Gilkey has basically forced
his will on the Diamondbacks, who badly wanted to add Womack's
speed to the top of their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be a genius to recognize that the Diamondbacks
spent most of the winter trying their darndest to trade Gilkey
anywhere. It's quite obvious Gilkey is not in the Diamondbacks'
plans, short- or long-term.
</P>
<P>
   To recap: The Diamondbacks agreed to send Gilkey to the Pirates
in exchange for Womack and Martin. In addition, Arizona was willing
to pick up Gilkey's $5 million in deferred payments and to split
the $1 million buyout of Gilkey's option year in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who need to dump some salary to meet their rigid
1999 budget, had agreed to every aspect of the deal. Even after
hitting a major snag _ one in which the commissioner's office
raised a red flag _ the clubs managed to work through that obstacle
and come to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The final hurdle was getting Gilkey to OK a change in the
wording of his deal, which actually further guaranteed Gilkey's
deferred payments more than in his original contract.
</P>
<P>
   Done deal, right? Not on this one.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey balked, saying he felt Pittsburgh's outfield was more
crowded and that after weighing all the factors, it was ``a choice
made totally for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey looked and sounded sincere Tuesday as he spoke of his
desire to be a part of the Diamondbacks' high expectations this
season. He also spoke of being determined to turn himself into the
club's right fielder (he has been a left fielder throughout his
career).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gilkey may very well be given a chance to become the
everyday right fielder. The reality is that Gilkey is now tainted
in the eyes of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Every player _ no matter who _ enjoys a clean slate whenever he
is welcomed into a new situation, and Gilkey was no different after
he was traded to Arizona from the New York Mets last July.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly he has diminished his standing within the club. After
undergoing corrective laser eye surgery in September, Gilkey agreed
with the club's advice to play winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks officials had to jump through a series of hoops to
secure Gilkey a spot on one of the Dominican winter teams. But when
it came time to leave, Gilkey decided against the idea and remained
at his St. Louis residence instead.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Gilkey, his wife was pregnant and delivered the
couple's second son last week. The Dominican regular season runs
from late November to mid-January. Even if Gilkey had gone for just
a few weeks, the club would have been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Another strike against Gilkey's case was his agent, Jim Bronner,
floating the idea that Gilkey would approve the trade if he could
receive a large portion of his deferred money now rather than
later, which tosses out the argument of wanting to play in Phoenix
over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey will need to play near-flawless baseball if he is to be
among the club's contributing players. Several sources within the
organization said Gilkey basically has committed baseball suicide.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the chance that Gilkey could change his mind and
the deal could be pulled off. It's true Gilkey will collect his
money no matter how much or how little he plays.
</P>
<P>
   But unless he returns to his 1996 form, when he hit .317 with 30
home runs and 117 RBIs, expect Gilkey to decay at the end of the
bench all season. &QL;

TRADE TALKS DIE AS GILKEY REJECTS CONTRACT TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ After all the phone calls, all the posturing, all the
legalese, all the words written in the newspapers over the past
week, we're back where we started.
</P>
<P>
   What a long, strange trip it's been.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey is still a Diamondback. Tony Womack and Al Martin
are still Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   No deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey's heart and mind told him to stay in Arizona, he said, so
he declined to approve language in his contract that would have
allowed him to be traded to the Pirates for Womack and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Gilkey's decision frustrated Diamondbacks
officials. Now comes the period of time when Gilkey and the team
attempt to dance around the disappointment issue, Gilkey's at being
the subject of a trade and the team's at not getting the leadoff
man (Womack) that they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey arrived at Tucson Electric Park at 7:15 a.m. Tuesday to
inform Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. of his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that I`` didn't'' want to go to
Pittsburgh,'' Gilkey said. ``It's just that this team stepped out
and got some players (over the winter), and I want to be a part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I weighed all the factors, I did what I thought was best
for me and my family. Regardless of what people think, regardless
of what people say, I'm here to play baseball. I'm ready to put all
the riff-raff, put everything behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who resides in Scottsdale, and Womack were divided on
their reaction to Gilkey's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. I don't know what else to say,'' Martin
told reporters at the Pirates' spring home in Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Womack was happy to be staying put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to go anywhere else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola left open the door for another attempt to acquire
Womack, saying he would call Pirates General Manager Cam Bonifay,
but was uncertain of the timetable. Gilkey obviously would not be
part of that, Garagiola said, nor would left-hander Brian Anderson,
who has been the subject of trade rumors over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Bernard that this was nothing personal, that it's my
job to analyze trade offers and do whatever it takes to help the
club,'' Garagiola said. ``You get calls, some are short, some are
longer and some are worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Look, I want to make a contribution.' If he were
upset by the notion of the trade, he would say, `Hey, you don't
want me, I don't want to be here.' But it's not that way. We as an
organization always said that we were looking for players who``
wanted'' to play for us, and now, in this roundabout way, we have a
good example.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who say that the best trades sometimes
are the ones you don't make. If Bernard has a season like he did in
1996 (.317, 30 homers, 117 RBIs for the New York Mets), he can be a
factor for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey met briefly with Manager Buck Showalter in the morning,
went through the first full-squad workout of the spring with his
teammates and then met again with Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck and I are fine,'' Gilkey said. ``The best manager I ever
had is the one who puts my name in the lineup, and that's my goal
here, to make this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said the smoke is clearing. ``We'll put this behind us
and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey is expected to move from left field to right. He
anticipates a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Dwayne) Murphy will help me out a lot,'' Gilkey said of
the Diamondbacks' outfield coach, who was a six-time American
League Gold Glove winner with the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Murphy: ``There are a lot of different angles involved in
right as opposed to left and it can be a difficult adjustment, but
Bernard is very capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Womack is out of the leadoff picture, Showalter will go
about the task of finding a man to fill the top spot. He said he
already has conducted preliminary inquiries of players to get a
sense of whether they would be willing to assume that role.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Luis Gonzalez, acquired in a trade from Detroit,
who is expected to start in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it five or six times, and I think I could do it,
yeah,'' Gonzalez said. ``The first time (at-bat) is really the only
one that matters. The only real thing that might affect you is
hitting behind the pitcher, but if they can move the runner over,
you've got a chance to drive them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really no big deal because we have a lot of scrappy guys
who could do it, just so long as it helps us win.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates are center fielder Steve Finley, infielder Tony
Batista, outfielder Dante Powell and perhaps even Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Gilkey hits in the lineup, he is hopeful of rebounding
from a pair of slow seasons in 1997 and 1998 that followed his big
year with the New York Mets. He had corrective laser surgery on
both eyes in September during the last week of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus and the clarity . . . I can pick up the spin and the
threads on the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he enters his 15th spring in professional baseball, Gilkey
says he hasn't lost perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never take anything for granted,'' he said. ``I enjoy each
day out there, because one day, I might not have another
opportunity.'' &QL;

REVOLVING DOOR SPINS AROUND BIG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending on how you look at Major League Baseball in its
present state, the Diamondbacks represent everything that is either
great with the game, or all that is lousy with it.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that a club with little to look forward to in the
short-term future can open its checkbook and throw money at its
problems is perceived as one of the game's evils by many purists,
who recall a time when a well-run farm system was the only way to
build a top-notch organization.
</P>
<P>
   Others, who don't care how their favorite club is built, as long
as it wins, could care less about the old-school ways. They're just
interested in getting behind a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tough on the fans,'' Boston General Manager Dan
Duquette said. ``The challenge is to build up a team. These days
you build it up and the economic pressures are such that as soon as
you build it and have great success, it drives up the cost of your
labor. You end up breaking down what you spent all that time
building up. It's like an endless challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have answered the challenge by investing
heavily in free agency, most notably pitchers Randy Johnson and
Todd Stottlemyre and center fielder Steve Finley. The result is a
roster loaded with new faces _ already 13 players who were on their
inaugural Opening Day roster are playing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Diamondbacks who have a revolving door to
their clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette and the Red Sox have seen two of that storied club's
biggest stars leave town in the past three years. All-Star pitcher
Roger Clemens left for Toronto after the 1996 season and has added
his fourth and fifth Cy Young Award since. Perennial All-Star and
former Most Valuable Player Mo Vaughn departed for Anaheim just a
few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The door continues to spin greater numbers of players in the
direction of new destinations each winter. It's getting to the
point where fans _ serious fans _ are having difficulty keeping up
with who plays where.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just an off-season phenomenon. Johnson and
Stottlemyre both were involved in midseason trades last year,
filling the role of temporary hired guns to help Houston and Texas
secure playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   The days of watching Los Angeles keep intact its infield of
Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey for 10
consecutive years (a major league record) are long gone, most
baseball officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the days of knowing your favorite player would remain
with the same club throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken, who has been with Baltimore since his rookie season
in 1982, and seems destined to stay there until his final at-bat,
may well be the last of his kind _ a superstar who spends his
entire career with the same organization.
</P>
<P>
   The financially stable teams have been able to withstand the
changing tide. It's the small-market teams that are hit hardest by
players seeking greener pastures each winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably good from a national standpoint because it
creates a lot of interest in a lot of cities,'' Oakland GM Billy
Beane said. ``But it's very tough on small-market teams. You get
someone who is, say, the rookie of the year and people are starting
to ask when is he going to leave? It's always the first question
when a guy has success in a small market. In a big market it's
``how do we keep him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question Beane hears often since his young and talented
right fielder, Ben Grieve, won the American League Rookie of the
Year honor last season.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better way to look at the current problem than to
put the Pittsburgh Pirates of the early 1990s and the Montreal
Expos of the mid-1990s under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates won three straight National League East division
titles from 1990-92. But after winning the final of the three
titles, the Pirates saw the core of their team fall apart when
Barry Bonds left as a free agent to San Francisco and Cy Young
Award winner Doug Drabek left for Houston. The year before, Bobby
Bonilla and Sid Bream left.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos? They had a major league-best 74-40 record the day the
1994 season ended when the players went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos roster that season had outfielders Moises Alou, Larry
Walker and Marquis Grissom. The pitching rotation had Pedro
Martinez, Ken Hill, Jeff Fassero and Kirk Rueter. In the bullpen,
Montreal had closer John Wetteland being set up by Jeff Shaw and
Mel Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Manager Felipe Alou had a special
group. There is also little doubt that Alou doesn't stop to think
about what that club could have achieved if it had been able to
keep the players together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, I try never to look back at anything,'' Alou said.
``But with that team I can't help but do so. We had a team that, I
think, would have gone all the way to the World Series. And then,
to see it all taken apart simply because of the financial structure
of the game, well, it definitely hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Because teams are in constant flux, today's general managers
must look beyond a player's skills and concentrate equally on what
type of person they are bringing into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that chemistry was created over five or 10
years,'' Beane said. ``Now, we're all trying to do the same on a
one-year basis. It's a roll of the dice whether those new
personalities will work together.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the small-market clubs that recognized potential problems
early was the Cleveland Indians, where GM John Hart has
orchestrated what is generally considered the model franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the Indians had yet to move into Jacobs
Field, which has become a virtual cash pump for a franchise on the
brink of bankruptcy 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hart saw young players who were on their way toward stardom:
Kenny Lofton, Albert Belle, Sandy Alomar, Charles Nagy, Jose Mesa,
among others. Instead of risking the loss of those players to free
agency or being forced to trade them because of escalating
salaries, Hart gambled that they would remain healthy and
productive and signed them to long-term deals through their
arbitration years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having to go to an arbitration hearing against Belle,
who might have a 50-home run season under his belt, the Indians had
locked him up for several years. The contracts were a gamble, but
the payoff has been enormous. The club has used similar tactics
with Manny Ramirez, Jim Thome and Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at it as two elements,'' Hart said. ``As an
executive or an operator, you have to scout well, trade well and
replace quality players. And two, you have to be creative with what
you do with contracts. That's the balancing act that is baseball
right now; one that, quite frankly, is more mobile than at any
point in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the game we all grew up with, but the rules are
completely different. We have a chance to be in the most exciting
era of baseball. It's the ability of fans to connect that worries
me. It really bothers me. Ultimately, the game is the only agenda
any of us _ owners, executives, players, unions _ should worry
about.'' &QL;

GWYNN HAS PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP  
 PARALYZED EX-DRIVER REMAINS IN RACING

<P>
   In his dreams, Darrell Gwynn is walking. In some of them, he
even is tucked inside the snug belly of the race car, shoulders
harnessed and hands tightly gripped around the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   They are good dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And they also are bad.
</P>
<P>
   When Gwynn wakes up, he can't move his feet or his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is paralyzed from the mid-chest down, the victim of a
horrible crash on Easter Sunday nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was at England's Santa Pod Raceway making an exhibition
pass when the Top Fuel dragster he was driving at a speed of 240
mph suddenly veered left and smashed into a concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   The car exploded upon impact, snapping Gwynn's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The mangled car skidded along the pavement with Gwynn's left arm
hanging out the driver's compartment. Later, massive infections
forced physicians to amputate Gwynn's arm at the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn needed 23 pints of blood in the first two days after the
accident. He couldn't eat or drink for more than 10 days, yet his
waist ballooned from 32 to 38 inches because of kidneys and liver
failure.
</P>
<P>
   When Gwynn finally was able to return home to Miami about five
weeks later, 14 seats on a 747 were needed to accommodate medical
personnel, life-support equipment and a bed specially designed to
absorb the shock of landing and in-flight turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was home, but home wasn't where his heart was.
</P>
<P>
   His heart still belonged to racing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why during Friday's first-round qualifying in the
Checker Schuck's Kragen Nationals at Firebird International Raceway
Park, a wheelchair-bound Gwynn will be sitting a few feet from the
starting line, watching driver Mike Dunn try to put a Gwynn-owned
Top Fueler into the starting field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though racing took away Darrell's ability to walk, it
also has given him all the happiness he could ever want,'' said
Lisa Gwynn, Darrell's wife and mother of their nearly 8-month-old
baby girl. ``Thank God, he's made this a success story when it
could have devastated his life. For Darrell, it was like, `Hey,
this is terrible, but life goes on. Let's live life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing really is all he knows. It gave him something to live
and strive for after the accident. It gave him purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   It gave Gwynn life, just a few months after it tried to snatch
it from him.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 36, was the sport's most promising driver before the
crash. Only a few days earlier, he had set NHRA elapsed-time record
of 4.909 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   But because Gwynn also was the team's car owner, duties still
had to be performed outside of driving. That is, if he was up to
it, mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   Mentally, Gwynn never struggled with the decision to return.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, it took a little time.
</P>
<P>
   Now he attends about half the circuit's 23 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been just a driver and didn't have my own team, maybe
I could have walked away from the sport,'' Gwynn said. ``But I had
great sponsors behind me and a great team. We were on top of the
world at the time, and I wasn't going to let one bad day in England
destroy what I had had in mind for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the future, however, Gwynn needed some help.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Bernstein stepped forward almost immediately, raising
$35,000 from the Professional Racers &AMP; Owners Association to
finance Gwynn's flight home from England. Bernstein also arranged a
benefit softball game between NASCAR and NHRA drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt in my mind, Darrell would have been one of the stars
of the sport,'' Bernstein said, noting that he and Gwynn are among
nine drivers who share the record for most wins (six) in a single
season. ``That gives you an idea how he could have been a major
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it doesn't surprise me to see him out there today, even
after that accident. I knew if there was any way he could function
after that crash, he was going to come back out here. It's his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But not his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's his wife, a former University of Miami
cheerleader who has known her husband since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our families were friends,'' Lisa said. ``We started seeing
each other seriously when I was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after the accident that they were married. She
graduated from medical school last year and is a pediatrician in
residency at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, which is where her
husband spent some time when he returned from England.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, the Gwynns
celebrated the birth of their first child last summer, a 5-pound,
9-ounce baby girl named Katie Brianne Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got pictures of my little girl all over my office,''
Darrell said. ``She gives me more reasons to go home at night
instead of staying here until 8 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Dunn winning the season opener three weeks ago, which
was the team's first win in three seasons, Gwynn felt it necessary
to attend the Firebird event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got momentum now,'' he said. ``I feel like I should be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dunn will be happy to see his car owner on pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been with Darrell, he's never complained once about
the cards he's been dealt,'' Dunn said. ``So when things are going
bad for me and I'm not winning races, I have no right to
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the paralysis, Gwynn still must constantly contend
with possible urinary tract infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can potentially be a very bad thing,'' Gwynn said. ``I just
don't have the immune system that normal people do.''
</P>
<P>
   But who's complaining?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have dreams about walking and racing, and fans even come to
me and tell me they have dreams about me walking and racing,''
Gwynn said. ``But I'm realistic. Even if a cure is found, you're
not suddenly going to walk one day. It takes time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know a cure will be found and people will walk again.
When it happens, I'll be one of the first ones in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if they just makes small strides to help guys like
me, maybe I'll be able to pick up a pen and maybe drive my van.
Maybe then I'll even be able to hold my baby.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ One day after Moises Alou was lost probably for
the year, the last thing the Astros' brass needed was Ken Caminiti
and Craig Biggio barreling through the training-camp gates on
sparkling new Harley-Davidsons.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti and Biggio might have been the ones on bikes, but
general manager Gerry Hunsicker and skipper Larry Dierker were the
Uneasy Riders.
</P>
<P>
   There were Cammy and Bidge, decked out in their leather jackets,
dark shades and biker-dude helmets, looking like some sort of cross
between Peter Fonda and Colonel Klink. They weaved through cars and
gates. They energetically waved at fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite the show of unity. It was quite the bold,
determined entrance into the 1999 season by these longtime friends
now reunited under the Astros' star and sharing an old dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same goal, different team,'' Caminiti said. ``We had this goal
a few years ago here, and now we're back. It's the same thing we've
always wanted to reach.''
</P>
<P>
   So let it be known that the road to maybe the club's first NL
pennant began with a rumble through the gates, then a reverberation
off the walls of the Astros' clubhouse as Biggio and Caminiti
pulled their bikes up to the door.
</P>
<P>
   There was the deep, booming sputter of the twin Harleys and then
the flawless, if deathly slow, idle. Glub glub glub.
</P>
<P>
   There was Hunsicker _ no doubt holding his breath and watching
closely with visions of ACLs dancing through his head. OK, guys,
hit the kickstand. Kickstand!
</P>
<P>
   And there were Caminiti and Biggio, pulling off their biker
helmets, pulling on their Astros uniforms for the first time this
spring and never looking more imposing _ or important _ for this
team.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the noticeable absence of the injured Alou, the
spring began with many of the same sights and sounds as always:
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima danced a sort of mambo in the outfield. Jeff Bagwell
stepped into the batter's box for the first time, fiddled with a
new swing and smashed pitch after pitch. Casey Candaele had them
laughing in the clubhouse. Derek Bell was late. Daryle Ward and
Russ Johnson looked like big-leaguers but probably had tickets to
New Orleans on the way. Biggio wore a clean uniform for all of two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed, except for the loss of Alou and the return
of Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to one power-hitting, 100-RBI Most Valuable Player
candidate, hello to another. This isn't the way it was supposed to
be _ Caminiti's powerful presence and impressive numbers were
supposed to add to the lineup, not replace those numbers gone for
the year. But that is how it must be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Alou certainly took some of the spirit away from the
first day of camp,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing Caminiti rumble through the gate with Biggio lifted
spirits again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caminiti's input may have been overstated in the beginning,
after we first got him,'' Dierker said. ``But now that we've lost
an RBI hitter, it makes getting Caminiti even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Alou, Dierker's batting lineup figures to take on all
sorts of different looks this year. He needs to find another player
who can get on base behind Biggio, so the likes of Bell, Bagwell
and Caminiti can work their RBI magic.
</P>
<P>
   Bell likely will bat in the No. 2 hole quite often, but any
number of players, from Richard Hidalgo to Glen Barker, Ricky
Gutierrez, Jack Howell, Bill Spiers and Tim Bogar also could get a
look.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury Dierker has in 1999 is Caminiti. He is confident and
comfortable. Without the signing of the popular Cammy, things could
have been much more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   But with him, the runs figure to keep coming. Caminiti reported
to camp in exceptional shape and, perhaps more important, was not
coming off offseason surgery for the first time since before the
1996 season. That's the year he was the NL's MVP, batting .326 with
40 home runs and 130 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see him, and you know he's ready to go,'' Bagwell said.
``To have him back, behind me with that lefthanded bat, it's great.
I wish it never had to happen when we didn't have him for three or
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   As he motored into camp with Biggio, it seemed like Caminiti
never left. The only difference was that back then, they usually
arrived quietly in a shared rental car.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt a little weird pulling up here,'' Caminiti said.
``Things have changed, but some things haven't. They put me in the
same corner (locker) that I was at five years ago. I have the No.
11 back (a product of the Brad Ausmus trade). It's strange, but
it's good.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets' guards are just going to have to find some big men who
can give them some help.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Rockets were struggling though another third-quarter
collapse Tuesday night, they turned to _ who else? _ Brent Price
and Cuttino Mobley. Price kick-started the offense with a bomb from
just inside midcourt, and Mobley took it over, driving the Rockets
past the Seattle SuperSonics 98-86 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   After a brutal road trip in which they lost three of four games
and most of their confidence, it was a win the Rockets said they
had to have. That the victory came on the strength of their
backcourt made it that much more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boosts our confidence,'' said Rockets forward Scottie
Pippen, who chipped in 19 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and
three steals. ``It gets our mindset back to where we can beat
anybody. It was a great win for us. We definitely needed this.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon had their moments early and
Othella Harrington came on late, it was Mobley who went through a
few unstoppable minutes to key the win. He scored nine consecutive
points in just 90 seconds of the fourth quarter and 11 of 12 in a
three-minute stretch that took the Rockets into the final 4:50 with
a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go from (playing against) Tim Hardaway to Penny Hardaway to
Gary Payton is like Disney World,'' said Mobley, who had 19 points,
five assists and six rebounds, all season highs. ``I was a little
nervous, but you've got to play basketball. I love one-on-one,
man-to-man. That's just basketball. Coach (Rudy Tomjanovich) had
confidence in me, and my teammates had confidence in me. And the
shots went.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley became the answer when the SuperSonics disrupted the
Rockets' offense in the third quarter by trapping the ball-handler
and rotating defensively. With Payton's ballhawking threatening to
take over the game, Tomjanovich went away from Payton by calling on
Mobley, who promptly burned a succession of defenders _ Hersey
Hawkins, Dale Ellis and finally Moochie Norris.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, I had a mismatch with Dale Ellis and
Hersey Hawkins switching on me, so I had to create,'' Mobley said.
``I love basketball, and I love pressure like in Golden State (when
he hit the game-winning 3-pointer in the first game of his
career).''
</P>
<P>
   That shot offered a clue to Mobley's nerve, but his role has
steadily increased to the point he has started the past two games,
exposing his bravado even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuttino is courageous, and he's talented,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Every game is a learning experience. He does have something
special _ not only his skills but the way he can see different
things out there. I'm amazed at how well he's doing at a different
position (point guard).''
</P>
<P>
   Before Mobley had his fourth-quarter run, the Rockets (7-4)
stared into the brink of another third-quarter fade. But contrary
to their lost weekend in Florida, they would not allow one bad
stretch to doom them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had control all of the game,'' Olajuwon said. ``When they
made their run, there was concern but there was no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a third-quarter meltdown, the Rockets abandoned
the scorers who had carried them in the first half and came up with
novel ways to turn the ball over, such as three-second violations.
After scoring nine points in Saturday's third quarter against Miami
and 10 in Sunday's vs. Orlando, the Rockets through nine minutes of
Tuesday's second half had scored six points, making three of 11
shots and committing seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who made his first six shots and had a 15-point first
half, went 21:46 between attempts. Olajuwon, who also had a
15-point half, took only two third-quarter shots. The SuperSonics
(7-3) rode that stretch to a 12-0 run and a 62-60 lead, their first
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Rockets would repeat the second-half fades of the
weekend, they scratched out a 9-0 run to end the quarter.
Harrington beat the shot clock with a hook in the lane, Olajuwon
made a pair of free throws, and Price sank a pair of foul shots
after an illegal defense and a technical on Seattle coach Paul
Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Price added to the degree of difficulty, giving the Rockets a
69-62 lead with a shot so unexpected that it blew out the
scoreboard. He ended the third period with a running, falling
3-pointer over Payton from a step inside midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price's 3 really deflated us,'' Westphal said. ``It shouldn't
have affected us that much, but I think it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he knew his shot would fall, Price (10 points, six
assists in 26 minutes off the bench) said, ``When it was in the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   But the element of good fortune did not diminish the production
of the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pippen, Olajuwon had 19 points and 10 rebounds, and
Harrington added 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting. But it was the
contributions out of the backcourt that put the Rockets over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``That style of play (when) the whole team, the whole offense is
moving, you don't know who is going to get the shot, and when, and
how,'' Olajuwon said. ``That's what I like about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big game, a big win for us. This is one of the top
teams in the league. To come back home and get a win like this, I
think, will boost the confidence of the whole team.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ An injury hurt Richard Hidalgo's chances of
becoming a regular Astros starter in 1998. A year later, an injury
has provided him a second chance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hidalgo, long hailed as the Astros' No. 1 outfielder of the
future, arrived for workouts Tuesday morning and found opportunity
awaiting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young player, you sometimes get frustrated because you
think you're being blocked by players ahead of you and not getting
the opportunities you feel entitled to,'' Hidalgo said. ``Then
there is a situation when you have to be ready to play at all
times. You never know what's around that corner. One day it looks
like you're being blocked, and the next day there is an
opportunity. Richard's time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   After splitting time in center field last year with Carl
Everett, Hidalgo will take over the duties in left for All-Star
Moises Alou, who is likely out for the season after suffering a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee when he fell
during a treadmill workout last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate circumstance that has created this
opportunity,'' said general manager Gerry Hunsicker, ``but we're
going to find out some things about Richard this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing the Astros already know: The 23-year-old with
the solid bat and shotgun right arm belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should certainly reinforce in his mind that he belongs
here, he's capable of playing here, and he's primed to take on a
greater role,'' Hunsicker said. ``Richard has always been a kid
that has stood out. There are just some kids from an early age _
they have that can't-miss label. He was one of those kids. He was
somebody that everyone in the organization felt early on had a
chance to be a special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, constantly mentioned in trade talks involving Roger
Clemens and Randy Johnson during the past eight months, finally got
his chance last season by making the club's major-league roster out
of spring training and opening the season as the starting center
fielder. He started 30 of the first 53 games before a separated
right shoulder, the result of a collision with the center-field
wall at Denver's Coors Field, sidelined him for seven weeks. When
he returned in late July, Everett had won the job outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Alou. He's one of my good friends,'' Hidalgo
said. ``When something happens, you have to be prepared for that
time and just go out there and be relaxed. Right now, I have an
opportunity. I'm going to be working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo hit .303 with seven home runs and 35 RBIs in 211 at-bats
last season. He has only 93 major-league games to his credit but
said inexperience wouldn't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous,'' said Hidalgo, once rated the best
minor-league prospect in the Astros organization. ``I've been
waiting for a chance to play for so long. It's time. This year is
the time for me to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite last season's crowded outfield, which included Alou and
Derek Bell, the Astros decided to break camp with Hidalgo on the
roster. The thinking was it would be easier to slowly adjust
Hidalgo to the majors on a contending club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to break in a young player is on a part-time
basis,'' Hunsicker said. ``That's what happened last year. It was
the perfect opportunity for Richard to make his debut in the major
leagues without putting a lot of pressure on him to play a vital
role on the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker plans to use Hidalgo primarily in left
field during spring training and will occasionally shift him to
center, his natural position, to allow him to remain sharp there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play left field, but if I have to, I'll do it,''
Hidalgo said.
</P>
<P>
   While offsetting the loss of Alou won't be easy, the Astros are
glad to get Hidalgo in the lineup. In their center-field platoon,
Hidalgo and Everett combined to hit .297 with 22 home runs and 111
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Alou hit .312 with 38 homers and 124 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carl and Richard) don't want Moises to be hurt. They just
want a chance to play and prove they are every-day players,''
Dierker said. ``I don't think Richard will feel any additional
pressure, because I think this is what he wanted all along. It's
what he wanted last year. He wanted to play more; so did Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   Said second baseman Craig Biggio: ``Somebody is going to have to
pull the weight that's gone. They are not necessarily going to do
what Moises can do, but they are going to go out and do the best
they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros don't want to fall into the pitfall of asking Hidalgo
to try to duplicate Alou's numbers. Hunsicker's advice to Hidalgo:
Be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we can't do, and it would be unfair for us to
do, is to label him as Moises Alou's replacement and try to compare
him,'' Hunsicker said. ``That's not realistic, and it's not fair.
He certainly has a chance to step in and be a very solid
major-league player for us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Hidalgo to seize the opportunity.

KIDD'S DURABILITY FACES STIFF TEST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arguably, Jason Kidd of the Suns is playing as well as any point
guard in the NBA so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the NBA with an average of 10.7 assists per game. He
ranks 30th in scoring with 17.4 points a game, and he's the Suns'
leading rebounder with an average of 6.7 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But he also ranks third in the NBA in minutes played, averaging
more than 40 a game. With 50 games in 90 days, can Kidd hold up
under that kind of demand?
</P>
<P>
   The Suns don't have a true backup point guard. Rookie Gerald
Brown is on the injured list. Shawn Respert can play the position,
but he's more of a scorer than a distributor.
</P>
<P>
   When Kidd needs a break, Coach Danny Ainge has been running his
offense through forwards Danny Manning and George McCloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm down on Gerald or Shawn,'' Ainge said. ``To
be honest, I'm trying to get more playing time for some of our
veteran guys like George, Danny, Cliff (Robinson).''
</P>
<P>
   The club has no immediate plans to go sign a veteran backup,
although the Suns have looked over the list of available players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the list of who's available, those guys would
be about the same as what we've got now,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   Trades aren't likely because the Suns have only two players they
can deal, Kidd and Manning. And the club isn't likely to give up a
draft pick of any value for a backup point guard.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ainge said he's willing to go with what he's got, allow
Respert and Brown to grow into the job and hope Kidd doesn't suffer
an injury that would cause him to miss an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those veteran guys can get us into our offense, and in some
situations they can even defend point guards,'' he said. ``If we go
get a backup point guard, it's going to cut into the other guys'
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is a guy who is going to play a lot of minutes. He's
going to get 38-40 minutes even if we have another backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an injury, then yeah, we would look at doing
something and Shawn Respert would get a lot more minutes. He might
get more anyway depending on the type of game it is.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Three men &QL; 
 &QL; 
McCloud is off to a terrific start from three-point range, hitting
17 of his first 33 shots from behind the arc to rank fifth in the
NBA with a 51.5 percent average.
</P>
<P>
   But guess who's atop the three-point shooting chart?
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' Robinson has made 7 of 11, 63.6 percent, to lead the
league. But he's barely on a pace to qualify for the leaders. He'll
have to make at least 34 three-pointers this season to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson rates 16th in overall shooting percentage at 50.5.
Manning, who is shooting better than 55 percent, would rank fourth
but lacks enough attempts to qualify. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kidd campaign &QL; 
 &QL; 
Suns President Jerry Colangelo said he's made calls to USA
Basketball to support Kidd for a berth on the U.S. Olympic team
that will compete in Sydney in 2000. Kidd isn't likely to be among
the first nine players picked. That group, which will include Tom
Gugliotta of the Suns, will compete in a qualifying tournament this
summer in Puerto Rico and then in the Olympics. But Colangelo said
he'll do what he can to help Kidd land one of the three remaining
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he believes Kidd would excel in the wide-open style
of the Olympic tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason definitely belongs on that team,'' Ainge said. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Somebody call a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   The never-say-do Los Angeles Clippers continue to serve up
straight lines for stand-up routines. They are dressed to the
nines, the oh-and-nines, and the fashion police have hit the siren.
</P>
<P>
   With Billy Crystal, Norm Crosby, James L. Brooks and 8,685 other
innocent humans as their courtside Sports Arena witnesses, the
Clippers fell to Golden State 94-89 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers are nine up and nine down, zero wins in nine
starts. They are the NBA's only winless, untied team. Their magic
number is one. One over anybody. Their chase of coach Bill Fitch's
0-16 opening run is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there was a morsel of pregame excitement inspired by a
rumored trade between these two teams. Yeah, while the Lakers were
attempting to reel in a cross-dressing power forward, the Clippers
reportedly were zeroing in on a point guard named Bimbo.
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo's payroll name is Coles, and if Arn Tellem _ the agent for
Clippers point guard Pooh Richardson _ had his way, Bimbo and
Warriors forward Duane Ferrell would have been swapped for
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. The game, however, was far more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' would-be heroes were forwards Lamond Murray (30
points, nine rebounds) and Maurice Taylor (23, 11).
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors villain was ... Coles, who had six assists and
scored 15 points, including four free throws in the last 18.4
seconds, to ice the win.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The victory needed to be iced. In fact, the
Clippers held a four-point lead while within sniffing distance of
the two-minute warning.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' first-quarter run began with the patented
preamble, a self-inflicted 9-0 lead for the opposition. The ice
finally was cracked on a five-foot jumper from Taylor, who is
auditioning to be known as the Clippers' best player.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor's spark seemed to light a fire under teammates
Darrick Martin and Murray. The Clippers unleashed a 12-0 run and
led, 14-11, on Taylor's 15-footer at the 4:22 mark of the opening
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor finished the period with nine points and seven rebounds.
He and his Clippers teammates strutted to the bench with a 25-22
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Warriors could remember not being very good either,
they rallied behind reserve forwards Antawn Jamison and Donyell
Marshall. Jamison and Marshall combined for 14 second-quarter
points, as the Warriors outscored the home side 29-18 and took a
51-43 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who shot a rim-bruising 36 percent in the Clippers'
first eight games, was a madman in the third quarter. His 20-footer
at the buzzer completed a 14-point period _ one fewer point than
Golden State managed for 12 minutes _ and left the Clippers ahead
68-66.

SCHEDULE BENDS FOR PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter is a stickler for
precision. He doesn't like anything interrupting his club's
schedule, particularly in the spring when he needs to get as many
opportunities to evaluate players as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to bend for at least one day when President Clinton
visits the Diamondbacks' workout here Thursday afternoon after a
downtown speaking engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The club's two workouts, normally open to the public, will be
closed that day. Showalter will have his veteran players, who
normally practice in the morning, switch with the younger players
so they can visit with the president. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Good first impression
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Dante Powell wants to prove to the Diamondbacks that
they made a good decision when they acquired him in an off-season
trade with the San Francisco Giants for left-handed middle reliever
Alan Embree.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks vividly remember one occasion when Powell
tracked down a long drive to the left-center-field gap by Travis
Lee late last season at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Powell impressed outfield coach Dwayne Murphy during Wednesday's
first full-squad workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great first step, a great first two steps,'' Murphy
said. ``Steve Finley (Arizona's new center fielder) has it, and
Devon (White, Arizona's former center fielder) had it, and Powell
has it. In fact, he may be the most explosive I've ever seen.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sveum's the name
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Diamondbacks live in the Phoenix area year-round,
some even before they joined the club, but one of the newest has
lived there the longest.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Dale Sveum, 35, has been in the Valley since 1985. He is
attempting to earn a role as a utility infielder. He played with
the New York Yankees in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Third base will be his primary assignment, ``but I can do a
little bit of everything,'' said Sveum (pronounced Swaim). ``I feel
this club is the best fit for me. It would be great to help it
become a contending team.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tale of the tape
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have their version of the 38th parallel in
their clubhouse at Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   It is a piece of white medical tape that stretches on the carpet
between the dressing cubicles of third baseman Matt Williams and
jack-of-all-trades Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a problem here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if he stays on his side, and I stay on mine,'' Williams
said with a straight face. ``He's got size 14 feet, and the first
day he threw his shoes over here.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tabloid teaser
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Randy Johnson had a few differences with the media
in Seattle but is getting along fine with the Arizona contingent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he engaged in an amusing conversation with three
sportswriters the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson walked past them and said, ``Well, there they are, the
three beat writers for the (National) Enquirer, the Star, and . . .
what's the other one, the Globe?''
</P>
<P>
   Careful, Randy, you know how the truth can sometimes be
stretched. Like, say, ``The pitcher with four arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had four arms,'' he said. ``I'd renegotiate my
contract.'' &QL;

ROAD-WEARY LAKERS BITTEN BY GRIZZLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C _ If this is what post-lockout,
three-games-in-three-nights basketball looks like, NBA games should
come with an NC-17 rating to protect the fragile psyches of
innocent children.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of seeing an endless string of botched layups,
rim-rattling jumpshots and, well, anything involving Bryant ``Very
Big Country'' Reeves, must be considered a danger to kids. And
Tuesday night's game at General Motors Place should have been
censored, if not canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, your idea of good, clean, wholesome fun is a
bunch of guys shooting 30 percent and tripping over themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There was precious little action resembling professional
basketball as the road-weary Lakers dropped a 93-83 decision to the
lowly Grizzlies and ended their road trip with an unsightly 0-3
mark. Not only that, the Lakers lost to the Grizzlies for the first
time in 13 meetings since Vancouver entered the league.
</P>
<P>
   This much damage, maybe even Dennis Rodman can't fix. The Lakers
better lure Michael out of retirement too.
</P>
<P>
   The last minute of the game was representative of how far the
Lakers have fallen and how ugly things got Tuesday. Trailing 87-81
with 1:05 left, the Lakers close enough to salvage a comeback,
Derek Harper tossed an inbounds pass that missed a cutting Eddie
Jones and went out of bounds. Turnover, game effectively over.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Bryant fouled Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who sank
two foul shots for an eight-point advantage. And the end to that
losing streak to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim led Vancouver with 28 points and 14 rebounds.
Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers with 26, and Eddie Jones scored 15.
The Lakers shot 35.9 percent and looked every bit like a team that
played three games in less than 60 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And every bit like a team that's .500 (6-6).
</P>
<P>
   So what does three games in three cities in three nights feel
like?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in general is a little tired,'' Kobe Bryant
said before tipoff. ``Tired of the trip, tired of losing, a little
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back losses in Seattle and Denver will do that to a
team. And even a fresh-faced 20-year-old can't avoid the effects of
so much basketball in so little time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know me, personally, I'm sore,'' Bryant said. ``Hamstring,
knee. I'm getting old, man.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad were things Tuesday night? The Grizzlies shot 29.7
percent in the first half and forged a 41-41 tie, thanks to 18
points on 26 foul shots. The two teams combined for 33 personal
fouls in the opening two quarters. Such ugly play could be expected
of Vancouver, a team that entered the game with only three wins to
its credit, and only because it beat up on the Clippers and
Mavericks. But for the Lakers, the only explanation was fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain a second quarter in which they didn't make a
field goal until the 5:18 mark? But they were at least consistent _
shooting 37.5 percent in the first, 37.5 percent in the second and
36.2 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' only solace was a flight home, a day off to look
forward to and the knowledge that the next two games both involve
the Clippers. And even that matchup seems like less than a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Lakers take the court again, though, they will
be a changed team. Dennis Rodman will see to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new face coming in, it's a change,'' Bryant said. ``He
definitely is gonna give us a burst of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, the Lakers will take what they can get. Even if
it comes in a dress.

A DAY OF GIVE, AND NOT MUCH TAKE FOR A SMILING BONILLA

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ On the morning of his 36th birthday,
Bobby Bonilla began what could be a long and difficult healing
process by trying to reinvent himself in the eyes of the New York
news media.
</P>
<P>
   He was funny. He was engaging. He was relaxed. And this time, he
did not challenge anybody to wipe the smile off his face.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Bonilla, who often experienced stormy
times with the New York Mets from 1992 to 1995, had even created a
new role for himself, hitting instructor for the Mets' other new
corner outfielder, a 40-year-old left fielder named Rickey
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   If Bonilla, never known for his defense, can reinvent himself as
an outfielder, the Mets' pitching staff might not need to worry so
much about balls hit to right field.
</P>
<P>
   More than once during a surprisingly humorous group interview on
his first day in a Mets uniform since 1995, Bonilla poked fun at
himself, the news media and a remark made by his new manager, Bobby
Valentine, on the day he was reacquired by the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, after the Mets had shipped the disgruntled reliever
Mel Rojas to Los Angeles for Bonilla, Valentine said that with
Bonilla in the outfield, the ``risk is whether he catches the ball
when it comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bonilla quipped more than once, ``There's a good
chance that if I'm under it, I'll catch it.'' The question, of
course, is whether Bonilla will be able to get to the ball. But
even Bonilla, who had a little trouble shagging balls here in the
morning sun, had to admit: ``I'm not here to do sprints. I'm here
to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   What began on one of the Mets' practice fields with Henderson
seeking advice from Bonilla on his leg kick after the two had taken
their first rusty, supervised swings of the spring, gradually
evolved into a give-and-take between two top hitters.
</P>
<P>
   And long after most of the other Mets had retreated to the
showers after the day's workout, Bonilla was working overtime with
Henderson in an otherwise deserted batting cage, soft-tossing him
balls from behind a screen, giving Henderson tips on his stride and
on the proper way to hit the inside pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really being a hitting instructor,'' Bonilla said
after. ``It's just sharing what we've learned over the years. I'm
always up to talk about hitting with anybody who wants to. I just
don't know if the younger players do that as much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is just that, as Valentine said, ``A lot of guys
don't know enough about hitting to talk about it.'' Not Henderson
and Bonilla. Together, they have 32 seasons of major league
experience and three World Series rings. But both are coming off
down seasons, which may be one reason why they were both here
today, two days before the Mets' first scheduled full workout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is legendary for not coming to camp on time. But
despite leading the American League in walks and stolen bases last
season, he batted a career-low .236. He feels he has become too
passive at the plate. And that was why Henderson decided to seek
Bonilla out for a little advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two or three years, I've been hesitant at bat, not as
aggressive as I had been in the past,'' Henderson said, attributing
the tendency to his first experience in the National League, with
the Padres in 1996 and 1997. ``I got away from my leg kick in San
Diego. And Bobby has it down pat.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the two engaged in a hitters' discussion, much like
pitchers often do about their trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey was very receptive,'' Bonilla later said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the New York news media be the same?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in 1992, Bonilla got off to a good start on Tuesday. When
asked what went wrong in his first go-around with the Mets, Bonilla
cracked: ``What year? There were four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first year was probably the most disappointing. The Mets had
made Bonilla the highest-paid player in the game. But he hit just
.249, and the Mets stumbled to fifth place, 24 games behind the
Pirates, the team Bonilla had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at '92, people will say I struggled,'' Bonilla
said. ``But at the All-Star break, I had the same numbers I usually
have. And apparently they just weren't good enough. I think there
was a longing for Darryl Strawberry. And saying stuff like you
wouldn't be able to knock the smile off my face didn't help. I
think they took it literally, and tried their best to do just
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was referring to the comments he had made at his
introductory news conference in 1992. But this morning, the people
he talked to were smiling, too.

MILLER, WEBB DIFFER ON INFUSION OF ABL TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mercury coach wants the WNBA doors thrown open to all former
American Basketball League players, but one of her starters isn't
so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some boundary where people who started the
league and stuck with it should be rewarded for it,'' small forward
Umeki Webb said. ``It's going to be good (having one U.S. pro
women's league) once it evolves and the number of teams increases.
Right now, it's not good for the people in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb and teammate Brandy Reed are among more than 30 WNBA
veterans who finish a five-day training camp today in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has missed most of the workouts because of a bruised
shoulder that will be examined when she comes to Phoenix to join
Webb, Jennifer Gillom, Toni Foster and Coach-General Manager Cheryl
Miller for Saturday's Mercury Madness fan festival.
</P>
<P>
   Miller admits her advocacy of no limit on the number of ABL
players allowed into the WNBA this season is not popular among WNBA
players, who are in negotiations for a collective bargaining
agreement with the third-year league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the best players possible,'' Miller said. ``Whatever it
takes to strengthen the Phoenix Mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   But Webb, who started every game last season as an undersized
5-foot-10 small forward because of her defensive intensity, is the
classic example of a player threatened by the 20 to 30 ABL
front-liners who are without U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the two meetings so far between the National
Basketball Players Association, the union representing WNBA
players, and the WNBA say they think an ABL limit is a given and
would stand up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking to WNBA players, that's really important to them,''
said Evan Korth, vice president of business affairs for Bruce Levy
Associates, the agency representing the most WNBA players. ``My
understanding is there are certain categories you're not allowed to
discriminate against (age, race), but you can on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wasserman, NBPA director of communications, said: ``It goes
to the issue of job security. These players took less to help make
this league successful, and to turn around and replace them with
players who didn't make that sacrifice would be hypocritical and go
against the commitment they asked of these players in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Options include limiting the number of ABL players leaguewide or
per team (two is the number most often suggested), combined with an
increased roster (from 11 to 12) and accelerated expansion. An
extra roster spot plus the new teams in Orlando and Minnesota would
create 34 more jobs for this season, which begins June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, 23, was the Mercury's third-round draft pick out of North
Carolina State in 1997. She went overseas for the first time after
the Mercury's WNBA runner-up finish, playing point guard in Greece
for two months to improve her ballhandling. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
FOR a rookie playing out of position, he's playing pretty solid.
Every day becomes an excellent new adventure for Cuttino Mobley,
whose Sicilian grandmother named him, molded him and now, he says,
smiles down upon him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She's been (gone) since I was, like, 9 years old,'' Mobley
says, ``but I'm still trying my best to make her proud of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma, you should be. Houston says thank you.
</P>
<P>
   As an NBA player, the Cat is just a kitten, but his courage and
his chutzpah made the Rockets purr Tuesday night _ if not yet
perfect. Although he has no right to be lighting up a team of
Seattle's pedigree in the fourth quarter only three weeks into his
fledgling professional career, he simply doesn't know any better.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley sank a winning shot at the buzzer of his first game, a
fine omen. Now this: 13 points in 12 minutes of money time,
including nine in a row and 11 of the team's 12 over a crucial
stretch as the Rockets, having just staggered in off the road trip
from hell, pulled away down the stretch to defeat Seattle 98-86.
</P>
<P>
   For now, for at least another day, they have found their point
guard. So what if Mobley was a clearly defined two guard coming out
of college?
</P>
<P>
   ``His college coach (Jim Harrick at Rhode Island) told us
Cuttino was the biggest winner he'd ever been around,'' Rudy
Tomjanovich said of the second-round draft choice, who was only the
third pick of three rookie guards on the revamped Rockets roster.
</P>
<P>
   And to put such a statement in perspective, remember Harrick had
won a national championship at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley is, to be sure, a work in progress. Most conspicuously,
he jacks up some really dumb shots. Tomjanovich had to call a
timeout in Miami to berate him for one particularly atrocious
decision. But he's not afraid to try to make things happen, and
that instinct can't be taught. Nor can the ability to create
opportunities for oneself, which he does remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the full four seasons at Rhode Island and led the Rams
to the Elite Eight last spring. Sort of tells you the importance of
the maturity factor, doesn't it? He's young, but he's not that
young. At 24, he's spotting fellow rookie Rashard Lewis five years.
The Sonics' Lewis also started, but he lasted exactly four minutes.
His linescore was pure zeros, except for two fouls and a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, for his part, was on the floor 39 minutes, launching 13
shots (he made five), snaring six rebounds and accumulating five
assists. He had three turnovers, five fewer than his eminently more
accomplished counterpart, Gary Payton. But Payton had seven steals,
too, vs. none for Cat.
</P>
<P>
   For the bulk of the last quarter, Payton and Mobley were the
respective go-to guys. One prominent spectator in the usual
sold-out crowd at Compaq Center this evening, a certain large round
man who answered to Chuck, admitted: ``I love the kid's talent. I
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Barkley added: ``He's got to learn to harness it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another illustrious oldster who knows a little bit about great
guard play seemed to second the Chuckster's cautionary notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take away from his confidence,'' Scottie
Pippen said. ``But a lot of times, he feels like he has to take
advantage of every opportunity instead of controlling the game and
realizing those opportunities will be there throughout the game.''
</P>
<P>
   You suspect both stars remain suspicious of Mobley as a point
guard. And in a normal season, one featuring a normal training
camp, we might never have seen Mobley in there with Brent Price,
the veteran would-be point guard, occupying the two spot in a game
that counted in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudy is coaching by the seat of his pants these days and
experimenting on the run. There's no time to sort out the details
in practice. Uh, what practice?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that lineup,'' Tomjanovich said of the
Mobley-Price-Pippen-Harrington-Olajuwon combo that finished against
the Sonics, who came in 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   But don't make the assumption it's cut in stone. Rudy wouldn't
guarantee that's how he'll go against Atlanta on Thursday, although
he's probably just being his usual coy self.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Mobley had a fine effort in Orlando on Sunday,
scoring 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting in an otherwise dismal Rockets
effort, Tomjanovich made no announcement of his encore start
against the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley had assumed nothing, either. He's as amazed as the rest
of us by the sudden starring role he's in. Asked if, a few months
ago, he could have foreseen himself being a starting point man in
the NBA, he replied: ``I can laugh about that one. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, stranger things have happened. Just none comes to
mind.

DICTATING RULES OF BASEBALL NOT UMPIRES' CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ (Begin italic) RULES OF BASEBALL: The strike zone is
that area over home plate the upper limit of which is a horizontal
line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top
of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow
beneath the knee cap. (end italic)
</P>
<P>
   Printed in black and white, right there in your Official Rules
of Baseball handbook, are the words describing the vertical
confines of baseball's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   For any man, woman, child or major league umpire who still finds
this passage a bit too antiquated or too open to interpretation,
let's try a more elementary description: armpits to kneecaps.
</P>
<P>
   If this description sufficiently addresses the zone's vertical
limits, why does baseball's strike zone continue to float like a
butterfly and sting like a bee?
</P>
<P>
   Why does the strike zone shrink and expand more than a big
floppy sponge in the kitchen sink?
</P>
<P>
   Why is there one strike zone in the American League with its own
set of umpires and another in the National League, whose crew sees
things a little more generously in favor of the pitchers?
</P>
<P>
   And why does a major league umpire walk away from a game in the
1997 NL Championship Series after helping Marlins' pitcher Livan
Hernandez achieve a liberal 15 strikeouts and respond to criticism
by stating, ``Everyone should know my strike zone?''
</P>
<P>
   (It is not ``your'' strike zone, Mr. Eric Gregg. It is
baseball's strike zone. Or at least it should be.)
</P>
<P>
   The answers, my friends, are blowing in the hot wind emanating
from baseball's umpires' union: This is their game, they bluster.
</P>
<P>
   But something revolutionary is happening in the mad, mixed-up
world of major league baseball. With the 1999 season just a month
away, a higher authority from someplace called ``The Commissioner's
Office'' is making a bold attempt to wrest control back from a
radical splinter group, more commonly known as umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible, really.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to all 30 big-league teams, the new executive director
of baseball operations, Sandy Alderson, issued notice last Friday
that the official definition of the strike zone ``will be more
strictly enforced'' by umpires this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in a sport where the umpires' union could not be any
stronger if it were run by Che Guevera, Jimmy Hoffa and Norma Rae,
the new strike-zone enforcement edict has royally ticked off the
union chief, Richie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how anyone could say we're going to strictly
enforce a rule,'' Phillips was quoted by the Associated Press'
baseball guru, Ben Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umpires enforce all of the rules. That's been their job
for more than 100 years. It is deplorable of the commissioner's
office to indicate that the umpires have not strictly enforced all
the rules,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Who made Phillips keeper of the game?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Phillips did not venture an explanation about why
American League umpire ``Terrible'' Ted Hendry's strike zone has
more permutations than an episode of ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, umpires are unwilling to relinquish their
unrelenting grip on the game of baseball. They are by far the
strongest officiating union in the galaxy. They are overzealous and
so in need of being reined in that, miraculously, the players'
union and the owners are in agreement on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the union in baseball has much more influence than any
other officials in the NBA, the National Hockey League or the
NFL,'' NBA senior vice president of basketball operations Rod Thorn
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of influence, though it looks like (baseball
is) trying to move'' toward placing control of the rules in the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball must go the way of the NBA and the other leagues when
it comes to seizing control of the most fundamental aspects of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are the game. The rules are just as critical, if not
more so, than baseball's superstars, light shows and entertainment
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing them uniformly is tantamount to fair play. Just ask
tennis about its Cyclops machine, which is used to minimize human
error on line calls. Or ask the NFL about its need to reinstitute
instant replay. Or ask the NBA, which just fined Shaquille O'Neal
$10,000 for criticizing NBA refs for not calling fouls he feels
were committed against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the power for making sure the rules are interpreted
as uniformly as possible and that games are called as cleanly and
objectively as possible should not rest with a power-hungry bunch
of umpires, but with some higher authority, even if it is one as
historically slippery as baseball's office of the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any decisions about rules comes under the aegis of the
commissioner's office ... and anytime we make a rules change, we
don't consult with the referees. We give the referees the
interpretations and their leaders make sure those are carried
out,'' Thorn said, adding, ``They better adhere to them or they'll
get themselves fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine baseball exerting that sort of control in its own house.
What a novel idea.

ROCKETS SOCK IT TO SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Because Sonics coach Paul Westphal readily admits to
being a huge Bob Dylan fan, it is safe to assume that he can endure
any Dylan melody over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   If only Westphal could say the same for his struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Sonics seemed to be in tune, they again skipped a
beat, losing Tuesday night to the Houston Rockets 98-86 at a
sold-out Compaq Center. After seemingly striking offensive accord
and balance with Sunday's win against the Los Angeles Lakers, the
Sonics (7-3) fell victim to their early season problems.
</P>
<P>
   They stood around, watched Gary Payton take over and got very
limited production from anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It is to the point where Westphal can hardly stomach what is
becoming an annoying broken record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to think it's less of an aberration and more of a
trend,'' Westphal said. ``We've got to execute better on offense.
We're not cashing in on our opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's trials with the offense resulted in its third loss in
four games. And the Sonics play another tough Western Conference
opponent tonight in San Antonio at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Payton (11 of 22 for 26 points) and Detlef
Schrempf (9 of 16 for 20 points), no one shot better than 50
percent. The Sonics combined to shoot just 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't shot better than 45 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate the guys weren't hitting shots,'' Payton
said. ``We're not making shots a lot. It's going to be up to me to
keep getting them the ball. All I can do is keep getting them the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Payton seemed as though he was the only Sonic tuned
into the game. He nearly posted a quadruple double, finishing with
10 assists and seven steals to go with his game-high point total.
But Payton turned the ball over an unusually high eight times.
</P>
<P>
   That was more a product of his aggression than anything. If it
weren't for Payton, the Sonics would have never been in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Houston led the entire first half and most of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 60-50 with 6:14 left in the third when Payton
made one of his mini-runs. He scored eight straight points and got
the Sonics within 60-58.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Olden Polynice split two free throws and Schrempf sank a
3-pointer that put the Sonic ahead 62-60. The 12-0 spurt was all
the Sonics had left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets scored the final nine points of the quarter. Brent
Price's buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the third gave the
Rockets a 69-62 advantage. The basket deflated the already wilted
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never able to recover,'' Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics never got closer than six points the rest of the
game. They were stung in the fourth quarter by rookie Cuttino
Mobley, who made just his second NBA start. Mobley scored 11
straight points midway in the fourth and the Sonics trailed 85-74
with 4:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley's two free throws buried the Sonics 92-82 with 1:08 left.
He finished with a career-high 19 points, which tied Scottie Pippen
and Hakeem Olajuwon for the team high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood around and let them do whatever they wanted,''
Westphal said. ``We did a lot of good things defensively after we
let them get started. We just shouldn't have let them get
started.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Sonics had no answer for Rockets center
Olajuwon and forward Pippen. Olajuwon scored his first six points
within five feet of the basket. Pippen drilled his first six shots,
including three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in a little soft defensively, and that gave them
confidence,'' Polynice said. ``We were confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Polynice and Vin Baker were nonfactors.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice did not defend Olajuwon with the same energy he used
two days earlier against Shaquille O'Neal. He had nine rebounds,
but missed his three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was worse. He shot 4 of 13, settling mostly for outside
shots.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, the Sonics corrected their defensive
problems in the second half. Pippen and Olajuwon scored just four
points in the last two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, though, were even more flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still lots of time,'' guard Hersey Hawkins said.
``We're still not executing the second and third options.
Everybody's struggling. When you have two or three guys struggling,
for some reason it becomes contagious.''

 DAVIS DENIES INTEREST IN VICE PRESIDENCY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Gov. Gray Davis sought Tuesday to
squelch speculation that he will use his recent victory as a
springboard for national office, saying he would refuse any offer
to be a vice presidential nominee even if Al Gore picked up the
phone and asked him directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any national ambitions,'' said Davis, in town for
the National Governors Association meetings. ``I spent 23 years
preparing to be governor of California, and now that I have climbed
to the top of the hill, I don't want to leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Davis' big win in the vote-rich Golden State, his
name was being bandied about in national Democratic circles as a
possible running mate for Vice President Gore, the clear favorite
for the Democratic nomination in the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an honor, but I took an oath to serve four
years,'' said Davis at a lunch with reporters. ``I think it's very
important to keep your word in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who spent Sunday night at the White House with his wife,
Sharon, and met privately with both Gore and President Clinton,
said Gore's experience in two national campaigns gives him an
advantage in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``knows the difference between the Inland Empire and the
San Fernando Valley,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor also had kind words for the man he replaced,
Pete Wilson, who announced this week that he would not run again
for president for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he sent a note to Wilson saying he had a ``remarkable
career'' as a Marine, a mayor, and twice-elected senator and
California governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not too shabby,'' said Davis. Rather than being
disappointed by passing up another presidential bid, Davis said
Wilson ``should take time to reflect proudly on more than 30 years
of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis called Wilson the ``toughest kind of Republican'' for a
Democrat to beat, given his centrist views on abortion, the
environment and other divisive issues, and he lamented that the
Republican Party's right wing appears hostile to moderates like
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Davis characterized himself as ``a millimeter left of center''
and Wilson as ``a couple of millimeters right of center,'' and said
it is ``much harder to draw a contrast'' between Democrats and
Republicans who share moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think there would be some place for a moderate (in
the GOP),'' Davis said, ``but maybe there isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis went on to describe views hardly distinguishable from
conservative on a host of issues, from his opposition to taxes on
Internet sales, to his insistence that states should be freed from
federal mandates, to his support for allowing individuals to invest
part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market
``within certain guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' opposition to Internet sales taxes puts him in league
with Wilson and at odds with the vast majority of his fellow
governors, who see the Internet draining states' chief source of
tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just not the time to be raising taxes,'' with states
running big budget surpluses, Davis said, adding that taxing
Internet sales ``sends the wrong signal'' about government's
attitude toward the Internet and high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said that while he would urge legislative action in
Sacramento to crack down on health maintenance organizations that
fail to provide adequate care to patients, he does not think the
ultimate solution lies in ``more lawsuits and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he favors a ``two-track approach'' that would
threaten regulation but also acknowledge that the government is in
no position to practice medicine by telling providers how to treat
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding President Clinton's education proposals to reduce
class sizes for kindergarten through third grade, Davis said he had
already spoken to the president and four of his Cabinet secretaries
to ask for greater flexibility in using the money.
</P>
<P>
   California has already made a major effort, including passage of
a $9billion bond measure, to reduce class sizes in the primary
grades, Davis said, and the state should now focus on reducing
class sizes in the high schools. Davis wants to spend the money to
reduce high school class sizes instead, because the state had
already made a major effort in the primary grades.

 ENTERTAINMENT No. 422 - February 24, 1999  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. ELTON JOHN RIDING HIGH WITH 'AIDA' SET When Elton John
expressed interest in working on a second project with Tim Rice for
Disney he made it clear that he wanted something more ``dangerous''
than the Oscar-winning soundtrack to the animated film ``The Lion
King'' that the pair created in 1994. Disney suggested that he
adapt the Verdi opera ``Aida'' into a musical stage production,
complete with an accompanying pop/R&AMP;B soundtrack that would bring
its music to the masses. ``It's such a great story,'' says Elton
John, ``and it was too interesting and too challenging to turn
down. I'd never done anything especially for the stage before, so
it was a first for me, something completely different.'' The result
is a multi-tiered musical journey that evokes a new level of
artistic mastery. By Chuck Taylor. Billboard. 1,700 words + photo.
2. THE ANALYTICAL WORLD OF BILLY CRYSTAL In his latest film,
``Analyze This,'' Billy Crystal plays a psychiatrist who finds
himself treating a troubled mob boss (played by Robert De Niro.)
The timing of the film's release is why he turned down an
invitation to handle this year's Oscar-hosting duties. ``I work so
hard to make the Oscars look easy, but it is a lot of work,'' he
says. De Niro - who's had an Oscar night or two himself - may seem
an unlikely co-star for the irreverent comedian, but Crystal
insists that the two actually worked well together. By Cindy
Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo. 3. MAKING FRIENDS WITH LISA KUDROW
Winner of New York Film Critics Circle's best supporting actress
prize for hr role in the hit film ``The Opposite of Sex,'' Lisa
Kudrow (who plays Phoebe on the TV show ``Friends,'') shares her
thoughts on motherhood, sit-com salaries and the price of playing a
long line of blonde dimwits. By Christopher Bagley. From W
magazine. 1,000 words + photos. 4. A PINCH OF SNUFF Of all the
gruesome urban legends, the snuff film is perhaps the most
chilling. Supposedly, these are movies in which people are actually
killed in front of the camera's cold eye. But do they actually
exist? ``I hope not,'' says filmmaker Joel Schumacher. And yet his
new thriller ``Eight Millimeter,'' starring Nicolas Cage, is based
on the premise that they are real. Despite the unrelenting grimness
of its subject matter, it is a film with a definite moral core that
deals with extremes of human behaviour. By Joshua Mooney. BPI.
1,100 words + photo. 
____________________________________________________________________
____________ 5. PAUL ROBESON : AN AMERICAN MASTER His life has
practically been erased from American history because of his
revolutionary and outspoken views during the 1930s and '40s. Who is
Paul Robeson? He was a Renaissance man : a successful actor,
singer, athlete, linguist, cultural scholar, author and political
activist. He was an African American dedicated to furthering human
rights all over the world. Now, 100 years after his birth, his life
is once again being celebrated. By Tamara Conniff. BPI. 900 words +
photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
'INTENTIONAL' GROUNDING : SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR
</P>
<P>
   MOVES BEYOND 'BUFFY' Buffy the Vampire Slayer may need her mouth
washed out with soap after this. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played
Buffy on the TV show, curses like a trooper in Roger Kumble's
``Cruel Intentions'' and she says she relished every scandalous
second of it. Audiences used to Gellar beating up vampires on
``Buffy'' are in for quite a shock when ``Cruel Intentions'' opens
(it's a modern version of the classic French work ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses,'' set in Manhattan's ritzy Upper East Side.) By Ian
Spelling. 1,300 words + photo. 7. HOLLYWOOD OBSERVER : KIMBERLY
ELISE IS TAKING NOTES Kimberly Elise Trammel Oldham is an
up-and-coming star. She recently played Oprah Winfrey's daughter in
``Beloved'' (1998.) Her quiet but forceful performance is the
film's great revelation, a Newsweek review said. Today the actress
finds her race to be less of an obstacle, even in frequently
racially troubled Los Angeles. It's sexism that makes her angry.
``Maybe it's an industry thing, but you really have to fight for
your respect as a woman in this town,'' she says. ``And as a black
actress, there's the hurdle of having to fight for people to see
beyond your colour.'' She doesn't see herself as an overnight
success. ``It seems quick to other people, but I've known it as my
destiny since I was very young, and it's been years of learning, a
long process.'' By Jon Krampner. 1,300 words + photo. Please fax to

 &HT;    Gulf towns wary of casinos' boom
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GULFPORT, Miss. _ A developer wants to take control of a city
park and the only public marina and build high-rise hotels,
condominiums and a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Down U.S. 90 in Biloxi, a casino company plans to fill in 54
acres of the Gulf of Mexico for a six-casino, 12-hotel, mega-resort
unlike anything now on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another developer has proposed filling in more than 200
acres of water adjacent to small, forested Deer Island for a
casino-hotel project.
</P>
<P>
   As casinos eat up waterfront property in the two Gulf counties
where gambling is legal, and developers propose ever more creative
ways to squeeze in more slot machines and gambling tables, some
people, even some gambling supporters, are wondering: How much is
too much?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the proposed ``Millennium'' resort in the Gulfport
park, local lawyer Virgil Gillespie said, ``I am 100 percent pro
casinos, but this is a project I am not personally for. I don't
think the city should give away its only public space on the water
just because a casino comes around waving money.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort would displace the marina, the White Cap Restaurant
and Burt Jones Park, given to the city in 1935 by the family of the
founders of Gulfport. The developer, Alfred Dana Jr. of Florida,
has said the project would include a new park and marina. Some City
Council members have voiced support for the development, which has
not come up for a final vote, but the mayor and at least one
councilman oppose the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city gives away that property, it would discourage
other donors from ever giving property to the city,'' Councilman
Sam Albritton said. ``I'm not going to let anybody take control of
a park that's for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White Cap, a seafood restaurant and local hangout for
almost 30 years, folks are against the project. ``Even if we could
stay, the casino would bring in an influx of out-of-towners and it
could drive the locals away,'' said Josh Dibble, a restaurant
manager whose uncles own the White Cap. ``This place and the marina
are part of the heritage here. Why change it?''
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``no'' to the gaming industry isn't easy for the poorest
state in the nation. Thirty casinos _ 11 on the coast, the rest
along the Mississippi River _ employ 33,000 people. They generate
more than $167 million in state tax revenues. On the Gulf Coast,
once a notoriously depressed region, there are now more jobs than
people to fill them, and the cities and counties there make
millions from a 4-percent tax the casinos pay to local governments.
More than 24 million people gambled on the Gulf Coast last year,
according to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on the coast have the casinos been more welcome than in
Biloxi. Seven out of 10 voters said ``yes'' to casinos in 1990, and
today, eight casinos cover nearly every available square foot of
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Two proposed casinos on Back Bay are tied up in litigation. And
the City Council last week approved plans by President Casino to
fill in 54 acres of the Gulf to build a massive $2.5 billion
complex of six casinos and 12 hotels around a marina.
</P>
<P>
   But the council had to override a veto by Mayor A.J. Holloway,
who says he thinks the project goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely for development and business, but this is
something I don't think the area is ready for,'' he said. ``If they
fill in 54 acres, then where does it stop? Another one might come
in and want to fill in 100 acres.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Aylsworth, president of President Casinos, said support
for the project has been ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor-appointed Commission on Marine Resources voted 4-2
for the project. But Vernon Asper, a marine biologist on the
commission, voted against it, saying it would pave the way for more
casinos to ask to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project would be of no benefit to the citizens of
Mississippi or to the coast,'' Asper said. ``It would be different
if our economy was really bad and we still had 13 percent
unemployment. We have more jobs than we have people. Every time we
get more jobs, we have to get more people, and more
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some residents, there is no such thing as too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1992, my business has doubled. Biloxi was six months in
the red, and now it is really financially sound. We have to be the
envy of every city in the United States,'' said Bobby Mahoney,
owner of Mary Mahoney's, a landmark Biloxi restaurant.

 &HT;    Birds wade back into Everglades
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The word on wading birds for 1999:
Better. But not great.
</P>
<P>
   For wood storks, herons, egrets and ibises looking to feather
their nests this spring, the Everglades is once again rolling out a
soggy welcome mat. Fewer birds than average are flocking to South
Florida's marshes, where rain has pushed water levels nearly to the
brim for yet another year.
</P>
<P>
   One consolation: Scientists have found more than three times as
many birds as they saw in February 1998, when a wet El Nin(tilde)o
and a glutted drainage system led to a disastrous nesting season.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists often use wading birds as a barometer of the
Everglades' health, because nesting is disrupted by the same flood
control system that has turned free-flowing marshes into
bathtub-like reservoirs. Bird populations today are a fraction of
the super-colonies, hundreds of thousands strong, that darkened the
skies in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In aerial surveys early this month, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers estimated that 31,400 wading birds were flocking in the
state-owned Everglades marshes north of Everglades National Park.
That's more than triple the 9,000 they found a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was even more notable in the Everglades'
northernmost remnant, the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National
Wildlife Refuge in Palm Beach County. There, the numbers more than
quadrupled to more than 12,100 from 2,880.
</P>
<P>
   The overall total was still less than half the number of birds
that arrived in 1997 and less than half the February average since
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any really great years in the 1990s,'' said John
Ogden, a biologist and bird expert at the South Florida Water
Management District. He said it's too soon to predict how this
nesting season will turn out, but he said he expects a better year
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, two things will tend to keep birds away: Water
levels are still high, and a mild winter up north gives the birds
less incentive to fly to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   High water can make it hard for the birds to wade. It also
interferes with the winter dry spells that are supposed to make
waterways shrink, collecting the birds' prey into a concentrated
smorgasbord.
</P>
<P>
   Years of high water have also killed large stretches of trees
that serve as rookeries.
</P>
<P>
   Another disturbing sign: Some people are seeing the wading birds
in urban ponds, which could means the birds are finding the
Everglades less than homey.

 &HT;    Theory of everything + T-shirts   $
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm not much at physics. When I took it in high
school, I thought they said psychics and sat around waiting for a
palm reading.
</P>
<P>
   But let me try to explain this to you anyway. A Texas A&AMP;M
physics professor is trying to develop a formula that is both short
enough to fit on a T-shirt and complicated enough to explain
everything _ or at least every physical thing _ in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Duff, who has been working on finding the ``theory of
everything'' since he got his Ph.D. in 1972, says finding the
theory could be years away. But he's looking.
</P>
<P>
   This is A&AMP;M we're talking about here. What's this got to do with
sheep, football or maroon carrots? Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people in other fields or nonscientists think we're
being arrogant by claiming to have a theory of everything,'' Duff
said. ``So it's important to make it clear that when a physicist
talks about a theory of everything, he's talking about the
universe, the fundamental constituents of matter, the laws of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no matter what, you should still change the oil
every 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   No, seriously, scientists really have been busting their noggins
to find a formula that will explain everything. But this has been
difficult, Duff says, because of the incompatibility of the two
pillars of physics.
</P>
<P>
   These are quantum theory, which describes tiny subatomic
phenomena, and Einstein's theory of relativity, which says
everybody in Arkansas is a relative of everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Just joshing with you on that one. Einstein's theory of
relativity describes gravitational phenomena, Duff said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Duff said, breakthroughs have been made in the
search for the theory of everything because scientists have
determined that the tiny stuff that makes up matter isn't
necessarily ``point-like particles,'' as previously thought. Why
this matters I have no clue, because in college I majored in beer,
with a minor in girls.
</P>
<P>
   But Duff says another theory is that matter is made up of
one-dimensional string-shaped objects called ``super strings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like a violin string, these strings can vibrate, and each
different mode of vibration represents a different elementary
particle,'' Duff said.
</P>
<P>
   I think I saw that band on Austin City Limits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other scientists, including Duff, are leaning toward
the new ``M theory,'' which says matter is constructed of
``two-dimensional bubble-like objects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic that this M theory may indeed provide the
long sought after theory of everything, because it will incorporate
not only quantum theory, but also Einstein's theory of
relativity,'' Duff said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending their time on this high-falutin' stuff, why
don't they do something practical and important, like make a better
cream gravy or figure out why a dog's leg twitches uncontrollably
when you scratch its belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, I don't see any practical application,'' Duff
said of the everything formula. ``But history has taught us that
whenever we've had these major theoretical breakthroughs, in the
course of time they've been found to be of use in one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, in this case, might be T-shirt sales. If
Duff could write the theory of everything short enough to stick on
a shirt, he might could sell the snot out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Let me know when they're ready. I'll take an extra large.

 &HT;    Texas, Alabama lawmakers pushing to take over bedroom
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Not that long ago, out-of-state visitors were
appalled to see Texans openly swigging from Jack Daniel's or Lone
Star bottles while driving down the road with an arsenal of weapons
within easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors went from appalled to flabbergasted if they reported
this behavior only to be told that drinking and driving with loaded
guns was perfectly legal in Texas as long as things didn't get out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas lawmakers first started talking about the need to ban
drinking and driving, Texans from across the state urged their
elected representatives to vote against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials in major Texas newspapers said Texas already had a
law against driving while drunk. Another law was unneeded and would
punish Texans who simply wanted to drink a cold beer while driving
home after work.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers listened to their constituents and voted down
the repeated efforts to ban drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the increasing threats and pleas from the federal
government, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and traffic safety
organizations from across the nation won the day. Texas also banned
drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   That broke the dam. Texas lawmakers went from a reputation of
leaving people alone as long as they didn't frighten the horses to
a reputation for passing all manner of laws to control behavior.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, a lot of laws, rules and regulations have been
forced on Texans by federal lawmakers and bureaucrats who have made
it their life's work to uniformly regulate the behavior of
Americans from sea to shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas lawmakers became quite capable of passing silly,
intrusive laws on their own with absolutely no pressure from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Texas veggie libel law that allows citizens to be
hauled into court and punished financially if they insult a Texas
cow, chicken, carrot or other home-grown commodity.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Texas ranchers used their new law to try to punish TV
star Oprah Winfrey for saying she didn't like hamburgers. They
ended up looking like whining crybabies, which all but destroyed
the image of Texans as rugged individualists.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day I learned that Texas lawmakers passed another
silly, intrusive law that makes it illegal for Texans to use sex
toys such as vibrators behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   The first I heard that Texas had such a law came from a news
story that reported a lawsuit filed by a group of Alabama women.
The women are asking a federal judge to block a new Alabama law
banning sales of such items, sometimes referred to as ``marital
aids.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Alabama defended their law by arguing that
there is no fundamental right to a product used to produce an
orgasm. They also argued that Alabama's law is modeled after a
similar law in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That's a slam-dunk legal argument if I ever heard one. ``Well,
your honor, they do it this way in Texas.'' Case dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's American Civil Liberties Union is solidly behind the
constitutional rights of vibrator users and sellers. ACLU lawyers
told the judge that sex therapists recommend vibrators for women
who cannot achieve orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   A Feb. 23 Chicago Tribune editorial defended vibrator use. ``As
long as they (the Alabama women) pursue their activities behind
closed doors, they aren't likely to hurt property values.'' That's
darn reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this silly, intrusive law started in Texas, but the fact
remains that Texas women didn't feel a need to sue to stop the law.
If the Alabama women can't find what they're looking for in the
courts, perhaps they should move to Texas. Just don't frighten the
horses or insult the veggies.

 &HT;    Telemarketers, I'm a horror of hang-ups
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Over and over again during the Civil
War, soldiers noticed a strange phenomenon that came to be known as
``acoustic shadow.'' An eerie zone of silence seemed to descend on
the periphery of a battle, muffling all sound.
</P>
<P>
   On the field itself, men could be screaming, cannons booming,
rifles popping. The noise might be heard for miles. But on some
occasions, when atmospheric conditions were right, the terrible
sound of war simply evaporated, and people a mile away heard
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Union army very nearly lost the Battle of Perryville in
Kentucky on Oct. 8, 1862, because of an acoustic shadow. The Union
commander, Gen. Don Carlos Buell, had his headquarters in a deep
valley and was blissfully unaware that his troops were fighting for
dear life.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Palm Beach County in December, I've been living
in my own little acoustic shadow, a delightful one, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarketers, the bane of suffering humankind in the closing
years of the millennium, have not found me yet, thanks to my new
phone number. I feel like a dog that has been dipped at the vet's
and is completely freed of fleas and ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever the phone rings, it's somebody I know, somebody I
am often interested in hearing from, someone I enjoy talking to.
How long has it been since you could say the same?
</P>
<P>
   It amazed me how quickly the phone hucksters zeroed in on me in
1992, when I returned from nine years of living overseas. They
seemed so earnest, so polite. They must work very hard in the
daytime, I reasoned, because they always seemed to call me at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent in those days, I actually gave $15 to a local
firefighter's auxiliary and received a little sticker in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it on your children's bedroom window,'' the telemarketer
said knowingly. ``That way, if, God forbid, there should ever be a
fire, the firemen would know to break into that part of the house
first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I answered. Only after hanging up did I realize what
a numskull I'd been. I'm sure firemen carefully inspect a burning
house for Fire Fighters' Auxiliary stickers before deciding exactly
where to enter!
</P>
<P>
   Well, once burned, so to speak, twice shy. Skilled reporter that
I am, I soon learned to spot the telltale signs of a telemarketing
call: the uncanny timing, right in the middle of dinner; the
one-or-two-second pause between the time you pick up and say,
``Hello?'' and the click as the computer-autodialer passes the
latest bozo _ in this case, you _ to the pickpocket at the other
end; and the inevitable, cheery ``How are you?'' from the lips of
an utter stranger.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when the firefighters called, I was ready: ``I
decided to play it safe and have the house completely sheathed in
asbestos,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' the telemarketer said. There followed a satisfying,
nonplussed silence at the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   But they called back the next year, regular as clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   So began my Chameleon Period. Whoever called, I was the exact
opposite, the anti-person, the Bizarro thing they could never hope
to reach.
</P>
<P>
   If it was a religious organization, I was an agnostic. If it was
a political party, I was an anarchist. If it was a credit-card
company, I was Plastic Man, who owned so many credit cards he
rattled like a human castanet when he walked. If it was a hospital,
I was immortal and invulnerable. If it was the Police Benevolent
Association, I was _ well, not a criminal, but simply too poor to
help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, the word will get around,'' I thought. ``The
news will spread through the quays and marts, down the boulevards
and into the bistros and back alleys: `Don't bother with that
number. Dry well. Empty pockets. Bloodless turnip. Waste of time.'
Even hobos used to mark houses where it was useless to knock. My
fame as a miser will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't spread. The telemarketers never quit. If anything,
they redoubled their efforts. To my chagrin, the number of calls
seemed to increase.
</P>
<P>
   I fought back with horrible, imaginary diseases. ``I have
cholera,'' I told one telemarketer. ``I will be dead within the
week. So you see, I don't need a second mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see,'' she answered brightly. ``Well, thank you for your
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mortgage company called the very next evening.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I moved. I had the old number disconnected and got a
new phone, in a new county: a fresh start, like the immigrants at
Ellis Island. It was like burning the house down to get rid of the
termites, but it has worked. At least until the next phone
directory is published.

747 President Clinton uses? Does he ever fly on any aircraft other
than Air Force One?
</P>
<P>
   A: Previously published reports have quoted the White House as
saying the VC-25 (in civilian use, a 747) costs $35,300 an hour to
operate. The president will fly on any one of several aircraft in
the inventory at the 89th Airlift Wing, Andrews Air Force Base, in
Maryland. It depends on the mission, said Andrea Bittner, Andrews
spokeswoman. For example, when President Clinton flew to West
Jefferson, N.C., last year, and to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., he
used smaller aircraft, such as a C-9, Bittner said. The designation
Air Force One, by the way, refers to any aircraft the president
happens to be using, not just the VC-25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about Hillary Rodham Clinton's considering a
run for the Senate from New York, even though she isn't a resident,
have said Robert Kennedy did the same thing. Will you refresh my
memory about his circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: It started in June 1964 when some Democratic leaders in New
York urged Kennedy, then U.S. attorney general, to make the race.
At the time, Kennedy issued a statement saying, ``I will not be a
candidate.'' Just two months later, on Aug. 25, he announced his
candidacy for the seat held by Sen. Kenneth Keating (R-N.Y.). At
the time, Kennedy lived in Virginia but voted in Massachusetts. He
had resigned Aug. 23 as a member of the Massachusetts delegation to
the Democratic National Convention. On Sept. 1, Kennedy won the
nomination at the New York State Democratic convention in New York
City. In his acceptance speech, Kennedy, referring to criticism
that he lacked roots in New York, told the delegates that the
state's first senator, Rufus King, ``was from Massachusetts. And he
served this state well.'' Kennedy's candidacy was based, he said,
on his record of 13 years of public service. Kennedy returned to
Washington on Sept. 3 and resigned as attorney general, effective
that day. In the Nov. 3 election, he defeated Keating by a vote of
3,728,864 to 2,926,383.
</P>
<P>
   As Q&AMP;A has previously reported, New York has a very liberal
residency requirement for a candidate to run for the Senate. Such a
person needs only to have purchased or rented a residence by
election day. Q: Is any listing available of the most-stolen
vehicles?
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Insurance Crime Bureau says these are the five
most commonly stolen vehicles nationwide: Honda Accord, Oldsmobile
Cutlass, Toyota Camry, Honda Civic (and CRX) and Ford Mustang. For
comparison, these are some other ``top fives'' across the country:
Los Angeles, Honda Accord, Honda Civic (and CRX), Toyota Camry,
Toyota 4x2 pickup and Oldsmobile Cutlass; New York, Honda Accord,
Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima, Toyota Corolla and Acura Legend;
Atlanta, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Caprice, Honda Civic,
Cadillac De Ville and Jeep Cherokee. Those with Internet access can
get information at this site:

</P>
<P>
   Q: The man who won the $60 million Big Game jackpot in Georgia
recently actually got less than half that amount. Exactly where did
the rest of the money go?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winner had chosen a lump sum cash payment instead of an
annuity taken over 26 years. The $60 million was the estimated
annuitized payment amount, which would be the estimated cash value
of the jackpot and the interest earned over 26 years, based on
sales and current interest rates. The Feb. 2 winner, Jim Sheets of
Harrison, Tenn., selected the cash option when he bought his
ticket. So he received the cash value of the $60 million annuitized
jackpot, which worked out to $33,277,860. Because federal and state
income taxes were withheld, he received $21,963,387.60.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I recently returned from Maui, where we visited
Charles Lindbergh's grave. We were reminded of his wife, author
Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom we haven't heard anything about for a
long time. Can you update us about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 92-year-old widow of the famed aviator is famous in her
own right for her books, diaries and letters, and honored for
surveying trans-Atlantic air routes and working as a co-pilot and
radio operator. She maintains the family residence in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   She was born June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father, a
lawyer, became a partner in J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and later served as
U.S. ambassador to Mexico and as a Republican senator from New
Jersey. She graduated in 1928 from Smith College, where she won
several prizes for writing.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lindbergh became a worldwide hero in 1927 when he flew
solo from New York to Paris in the Spirit of St. Louis. Anne Morrow
met the aviator when he was invited by her father to Mexico as a
gesture of friendship toward that country. The two met while
Lindbergh spent two weeks at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. On
Feb. 12, 1929, Ambassador Morrow announced their engagement, and on
May 27, 1929, the couple were married in Englewood. Adopting her
husband's cause of aviation, she took flying lessons and in 1930
became the first woman in the United States to obtain a glider
pilot's license. She received her private pilot's license the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindberghs had six children. The kidnapping of their
first-born from his nursery in March 1932 created a worldwide
sensation, which continued long after his body was found two months
later. A daughter, Anne Spencer, also died. Her husband died of
cancer on Aug. 26, 1974, at their Hawaiian home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought of Mexico as sort of a man's country, and
was surprised to see that its foreign minister is a woman, Rosario
Green. What is her professional background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Green became the first woman in Mexican history to head the
Foreign Relations Ministry _ her country's equivalent to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ when she replaced Jose
Angel Gurria in January 1998. Named to the post by President
Ernesto Zedillo, Green is the highest-ranking woman in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   She holds a degree in international relations from the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, with a master's in economics from
El Colegio de Mexico. She obtained a second master's in economics
and a certificate in Latin American studies from Columbia
University in New York, then studied at the Institute for Latin
American Integration in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   After stints as a professor at several universities in Mexico,
she turned to government, serving as ambassador to the German
Democratic Republic, executive secretary of the National Commission
on Human Rights, undersecretary of the Ford Foundation's Commission
on the Future of Mexico-U.S. Relations, and Mexico's representative
at the World Bank, among other positions. In 1994 she went to the
United Nations, where she was a consultant, assistant secretary for
political affairs and coordinator for women's issues. She resigned
her U.N. post in January 1997, and was elected a senator six months
later. She gave up that seat to take her post with the Foreign
Relations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by the term ``right-to-work'' law?
</P>
<P>
   A: A right-to-work law is a state law making it illegal to
refuse employment to a person unless that person is, or becomes, a
union member.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly is the national debt, and to whom is it owed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The national debt is the amount of money the government owes
because of money it has borrowed by selling bonds or other
securities. So the debt is owed to those who buy those government
bonds or other securities. Banks and private individuals are the
largest ``owners'' of the debt, but about one-fourth of it is held
by government agencies. Banks and insurance companies buy
government bonds as a safe investment and to earn interest on funds
not used for other purposes. Individuals also buy bonds for family
security and for patriotic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``getting off
scot-free''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like hopscotch, this term for ``absolutely free'' has no
connection with frugal Scotsmen. A scot or sceot was a municipal
tax in 12th-century England, and someone who went scot-free was one
who succeeded in dodging these taxes. The term later was given
wider currency when scot was used to mean the amount that one owed
for entertainment, including drinks, in a tavern _ anyone who had a
drink on the house went scot-free. The scot in this version was
reinforced by the fact that all drinks ordered in taverns were
scotched, or marked on a slate, enabling the landlord to make a
reckoning of how much a person owed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported some time ago that independent counsels were
investigating Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman. I haven't seen anything in the news lately about
either case. Who are the independent counsels, and what is the
status of these cases?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both investigations are continuing, according to Justice
Deparment spokeswoman Michelle Bishop. The Babbitt inquiry was
assigned to prosecutor Carol Elder Bruce; the Herman case to Ralph
Lancaster. Both are in Washington. There's little else to report,
Bishop told Q&AMP;A.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDITORS: THIS IS PART TWO OF A TWO PART FILE)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article reported that members of the
Merchant Marine during World War II had been granted veterans
status. I would be in the group affected, so it seems an honor that
I am due. How do I go about obtaining this status?
</P>
<P>
   A: As the article indicated, it wasn't until 1988 that Congress
granted the merchant seamen of WW II the status of military
veterans. And then it applied only to those who sailed between Dec.
7, 1941, and Dec. 15, 1945. Last Veterans Day, President Clinton
signed a measure extending the cutoff date to Dec. 31, 1946, the
same as that for those in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact a regional office of the Department of
Veterans Affairs. When applying for medical care, seamen who
qualify must present their DD-214 discharge certificate from the
Defense Department to the VA medical facility. The VA regional
office can assist you in obtaining a certificate, if you don't
already have it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that four Boeing 757s were added to the fleet
of aircraft operated for the U.S. vice president. How many aircraft
in total are in his fleet?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the 757s _ designated C-32s by the Air Force _ are used
primarily by the vice president and congressional delegations, they
aren't specifically for the vice president, according to Andrea
Bittner of the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland. And three, not four, have been delivered to date, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and the congressional delegations also use
other aircraft. In addition to the three C-32s, the fleet is
composed of three C-9s, one VC-137 and seven C-20s, Bittner said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a Lyon College listed as being rated among the best
regional liberal arts institutions in the South. I'm not familiar
with Lyon College, and haven't been able to find any information
about it. What can you tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Founded as Arkansas College in 1872 in Batesville, Ark., the
name was changed in 1994 to Lyon College in honor of Frank Lyon
Sr., 84, a long-time member of the board of trustees. As reported
in 1994 at the time the college was renamed, Lyon's family had
donated more than $10 million to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The private, coed school is affiliated with the Presbyterian
Church USA. It has 43 full-time teaching faculty members and an
enrollment of 450 full-time and 100 part-time students, and its
library contains more than 140,000 volumes, said spokesman Bob
Qualls. It has consistently been rated _ under both names _ as
among the best in its category in the South by U.S. News &AMP; World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its scholastic accomplishments, Lyon has another
distinction: It claims to be one of only two colleges in the nation
with its own specially designed tartan registered in Scotland. The
college offers scholarships for pipers, drummers and Highland
dancers as part of its Scottish Heritage Program. It also is the
site of the annual Arkansas Scottish Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Lyon College, P.O. Box 2317, Batesville, AR 72503
(870-793-9813). Or, on the Internet, http://www.lyon.edu Q: How can
Hillary Rodham Clinton run for the Senate from New York when she
doesn't live there? Aren't there any residency requirements?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right in thinking that the first lady has no roots in
New York. Here's the deal. Residency requirements vary among
states, but in most of them the requirement is 30 days or less. In
New York, a candidate need only have purchased or rented a
residence by election day to meet residency requirements for
running for office, according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the
New York Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My newspaper recently printed a short obituary for Ben
Margolis of Los Angeles, saying he was an activist lawyer connected
with the racially tinged Sleepy Lagoon murder case. I'm 65 and I've
never heard of that. Can you tell me about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sleepy Lagoon was one of two celebrated cases in the 1940s
and '50s in which Margolis was involved. The other concerned the
blacklisted ``Hollywood 10,'' screenwriters and directors accused
of being members of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Sleepy Lagoon case took its name from a East Los Angeles
rock quarry and reservoir, which in turn took its name from a
popular song. On Aug. 2, 1942, 21-year-old Jose Diaz was found
beaten to death there. Fueled by a sensationalist press and
anti-Latino sentiment, some 600 youths were arrested in connection
with the crime; 24 were tried for murder and, despite no
eye-witnesses, 12 were convicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Margolis won a reversal of their convictions when an
appeals court overturned them because of lack of evidence, and
reprimanded the lower court judge for displaying prejudice and
hostility toward the defendants. The case later was dramatized in
Luis Valdez's play and movie, ``Zoot Suit,'' referring to press
accounts in the Sleepy Lagoon case calling the defendants ``zoot
suiters'' because of their long coats and wide pants.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis, 88, died on Jan. 28 in Portland, Ore. No one was ever
convicted in the Sleepy Lagoon case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the composition of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences? How does one become a member?
</P>
<P>
   A: The honorary organization has more than 6,000 members
representing varied branches of the motion picture industry,
including actors, art directors, cinematographers, directors,
executives, film editors, musicians, producers, publicists, writers
and those who work in short films, feature animation, sound and
visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate for membership must be sponsored by at least two
members of the branch for which the person may qualify. Each
proposed member must first receive the favorable endorsement of the
appropriate branch executive committee before his or her name is
submitted to the board of governors for approval. The board also
may invite people to become members-at-large and associate members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did Bill Clinton change his name from that of his
biological father? I believe his father's last name was Blythe.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the book Facts About the Presidents, William
Jefferson Blythe 4th was the only child of William Jefferson Blythe
3rd and Virginia Blythe. His father was killed in an auto accident
before his birth. In 1950, his mother married Roger Clinton, who
legally adopted her son, giving him his name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In October, at the Wye River Mideast summit, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the release of Jonathan
Pollard, who was convicted in the mid-1980s of spying against the
United States for Israel. In December, it was reported that
President Clinton would announce his decision on Netanyahu's appeal
in mid-January. It's now well past that. What's the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: The review process is ongoing, White House spokeswoman Julie
Goldberg told Q&AMP;A. There was never a deadline for its completion,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently that President Clinton's pension will
start at about $151,800 a year. That seems pretty steep for a guy
who had no prior federal service. How is that amount determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: Prior federal service doesn't figure into it. The
presidential pension benefit is called a pension by law, but it's
really more of an entitlement, stipend or system of payments, said
Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. To qualify for it, a
president doesn't have to have a certain length of service or a
certain salary level. The pay is for an active-duty member of the
Cabinet. All a president has to do is to qualify is to serve ``for
as little as one day,'' Sepp said, and not have been removed from
office by impeachment and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that actor Hal Holbrook is married
to actress Dixie Carter. I always thought that was just an act they
carried over from their days on TV's ``Designing Women.'' Is that
where they met?
</P>
<P>
   A: They already were married when ``Designing Women'' first went
on the air on Sept. 29, 1986. Carter and the twice-divored Holbrook
were married on May 27, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about Duncan Hines, whose name is associated so
closely with cake mixes. Can you tell me anything about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hines was born in 1880 in Bowling Green, Ky. His mother died
when he was 4. Years later, he said in an interview that the family
cook prepared home-baked bread, wild turkey, venison, fried
chicken, biscuits and sausage for him, his sister and their four
brothers. ``We ate all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, he and his wife traveled constantly on business,
but Hines found a barrier to his complete enjoyment of traveling:
``The library paste served as gravy in short-order places was a
personal insult.'' So they began making notes, then lists, of
places where they found good food, and before long Hines was widely
known as an expert on good eating. He turned his hobby into a
business, writing and publishing books on cooking, carving and
lodging. In addition to his staff, Hines relied on a network of
more than 300 ``foodies'' who would find places to be included in
his ``Adventures in Good Eating'' _ something like a mid-1930s
version of today's Zagat Survey.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, interest in convenience foods perked up, and
in 1948 Hines was approached by the director of a farmer's
cooperative who was entering the food marketing business. The
cooperative's first product was a cake mix that called for fresh
eggs instead of the dehydrated eggs usually included in box mixes.
Hines loaned his name to the product and Duncan Hines, the company,
was born. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought the cake maker in 1956, and in
1998 sold it to Aurora Foods, whose other lines include Aunt
Jemima, Log Cabin syrup, Mrs. Butterworth, Mrs. Paul's seafood and
Mama Celeste pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, who was married twice, died in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A referred to Duncan Hines' book ``Adventures of Good
Eating'' as ``something like a mid-1930s version of today's Zagat
Survey.'' What is a Zagat Survey?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are best-selling books that began in 1979 with Nina and
Tim Zagat's New York City Restaurant Survey. Started as a hobby,
their concept became so popular, and gained such an intense
following, that it developed into a full-time publishing business.
In 1988, the Zagats extended their reporting empire to include U.S.
hotels, restaurants and spas, and in 1990 to the airline and car
rental industries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other guides, the Zagat Surveys don't rely on
paid staff or freelance writers for their judgments. The surveyors
are about 100,000 consumers _ ``real people'' _ who submit their
opinions on places, which then are organized into a rating system
ranging from 0 (``poor'') to 30 (``perfect''). The pocket-size
Zagat Surveys, featuring more than 40 and foreign cities (including
Atlanta), can be found at any bookstore.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDITORS: THIS IS PART ONE OF A TWO PART FILE)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've seen several references in the news to a program called
Character Counts. What is it, and how can I reach the sponsoring
organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Character Counts! coalition describes itself as a
diverse, nonpartisan alliance of human-service and educational
organizations working together to strengthen the character of young
people by advocating ethical values that transcend political,
religious, class and ethnic divisions. It stresses what it calls
``six pillars of character'': trustworthiness, respect,
responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics, a nonprofit
teaching organization, helped organize the coalition in 1993.
Member organizations include 4-H, Little League, the National
Education Association, Boys and Girls Clubs, the YMCA and the
National Association of Secondary School Principals. Information:
Josephson Institute of Ethics, 4640 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001,
Marina del Rey, CA 90292-6610 (310-306-1868) or, on the Internet,
http://www.charactercounts.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who appointed Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, and when?
</P>
<P>
   A: President Ronald Reagan, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does it cost to operate Air Force One, the Boeing
747 President Clinton uses? Does he ever fly on any aircraft other
than Air Force One?
</P>
<P>
   A: Previously published reports have quoted the White House as
saying the VC-25 (in civilian use, a 747) costs $35,300 an hour to
operate. The president will fly on any one of several aircraft in
the inventory at the 89th Airlift Wing, Andrews Air Force Base, in
Maryland. It depends on the mission, said Andrea Bittner, Andrews
spokeswoman. For example, when President Clinton flew to West
Jefferson, N.C., last year, and to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., he
used smaller aircraft, such as a C-9, Bittner said. The designation
Air Force One, by the way, refers to any aircraft the president
happens to be using, not just the VC-25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about Hillary Rodham Clinton's considering a
run for the Senate from New York, even though she isn't a resident,
have said Robert Kennedy did the same thing. Will you refresh my
memory about his circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: It started in June 1964 when some Democratic leaders in New
York urged Kennedy, then U.S. attorney general, to make the race.
At the time, Kennedy issued a statement saying, ``I will not be a
candidate.'' Just two months later, on Aug. 25, he announced his
candidacy for the seat held by Sen. Kenneth Keating (R-N.Y.). At
the time, Kennedy lived in Virginia but voted in Massachusetts. He
had resigned Aug. 23 as a member of the Massachusetts delegation to
the Democratic National Convention. On Sept. 1, Kennedy won the
nomination at the New York State Democratic convention in New York
City. In his acceptance speech, Kennedy, referring to criticism
that he lacked roots in New York, told the delegates that the
state's first senator, Rufus King, ``was from Massachusetts. And he
served this state well.'' Kennedy's candidacy was based, he said,
on his record of 13 years of public service. Kennedy returned to
Washington on Sept. 3 and resigned as attorney general, effective
that day. In the Nov. 3 election, he defeated Keating by a vote of
3,728,864 to 2,926,383.
</P>
<P>
   As Q&AMP;A has previously reported, New York has a very liberal
residency requirement for a candidate to run for the Senate. Such a
person needs only to have purchased or rented a residence by
election day. Q: Is any listing available of the most-stolen
vehicles?
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Insurance Crime Bureau says these are the five
most commonly stolen vehicles nationwide: Honda Accord, Oldsmobile
Cutlass, Toyota Camry, Honda Civic (and CRX) and Ford Mustang. For
comparison, these are some other ``top fives'' across the country:
Los Angeles, Honda Accord, Honda Civic (and CRX), Toyota Camry,
Toyota 4x2 pickup and Oldsmobile Cutlass; New York, Honda Accord,
Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima, Toyota Corolla and Acura Legend;
Atlanta, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Caprice, Honda Civic,
Cadillac De Ville and Jeep Cherokee. Those with Internet access can
get information at this site:
http://www.giis.org/nicb-stolencars.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q: The man who won the $60 million Big Game jackpot in Georgia
recently actually got less than half that amount. Exactly where did
the rest of the money go?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winner had chosen a lump sum cash payment instead of an
annuity taken over 26 years. The $60 million was the estimated
annuitized payment amount, which would be the estimated cash value
of the jackpot and the interest earned over 26 years, based on
sales and current interest rates. The Feb. 2 winner, Jim Sheets of
Harrison, Tenn., selected the cash option when he bought his
ticket. So he received the cash value of the $60 million annuitized
jackpot, which worked out to $33,277,860. Because federal and state
income taxes were withheld, he received $21,963,387.60.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I recently returned from Maui, where we visited
Charles Lindbergh's grave. We were reminded of his wife, author
Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom we haven't heard anything about for a
long time. Can you update us about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 92-year-old widow of the famed aviator is famous in her
own right for her books, diaries and letters, and honored for
surveying trans-Atlantic air routes and working as a co-pilot and
radio operator. She maintains the family residence in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   She was born June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father, a
lawyer, became a partner in J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and later served as
U.S. ambassador to Mexico and as a Republican senator from New
Jersey. She graduated in 1928 from Smith College, where she won
several prizes for writing.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lindbergh became a worldwide hero in 1927 when he flew
solo from New York to Paris in the Spirit of St. Louis. Anne Morrow
met the aviator when he was invited by her father to Mexico as a
gesture of friendship toward that country. The two met while
Lindbergh spent two weeks at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. On
Feb. 12, 1929, Ambassador Morrow announced their engagement, and on
May 27, 1929, the couple were married in Englewood. Adopting her
husband's cause of aviation, she took flying lessons and in 1930
became the first woman in the United States to obtain a glider
pilot's license. She received her private pilot's license the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindberghs had six children. The kidnapping of their
first-born from his nursery in March 1932 created a worldwide
sensation, which continued long after his body was found two months
later. A daughter, Anne Spencer, also died. Her husband died of
cancer on Aug. 26, 1974, at their Hawaiian home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought of Mexico as sort of a man's country, and
was surprised to see that its foreign minister is a woman, Rosario
Green. What is her professional background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Green became the first woman in Mexican history to head the
Foreign Relations Ministry _ her country's equivalent to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ when she replaced Jose
Angel Gurria in January 1998. Named to the post by President
Ernesto Zedillo, Green is the highest-ranking woman in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   She holds a degree in international relations from the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, with a master's in economics from
El Colegio de Mexico. She obtained a second master's in economics
and a certificate in Latin American studies from Columbia
University in New York, then studied at the Institute for Latin
American Integration in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   After stints as a professor at several universities in Mexico,
she turned to government, serving as ambassador to the German
Democratic Republic, executive secretary of the National Commission
on Human Rights, undersecretary of the Ford Foundation's Commission
on the Future of Mexico-U.S. Relations, and Mexico's representative
at the World Bank, among other positions. In 1994 she went to the
United Nations, where she was a consultant, assistant secretary for
political affairs and coordinator for women's issues. She resigned
her U.N. post in January 1997, and was elected a senator six months
later. She gave up that seat to take her post with the Foreign
Relations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by the term ``right-to-work'' law?
</P>
<P>
   A: A right-to-work law is a state law making it illegal to
refuse employment to a person unless that person is, or becomes, a
union member.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly is the national debt, and to whom is it owed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The national debt is the amount of money the government owes
because of money it has borrowed by selling bonds or other
securities. So the debt is owed to those who buy those government
bonds or other securities. Banks and private individuals are the
largest ``owners'' of the debt, but about one-fourth of it is held
by government agencies. Banks and insurance companies buy
government bonds as a safe investment and to earn interest on funds
not used for other purposes. Individuals also buy bonds for family
security and for patriotic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``getting off
scot-free''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like hopscotch, this term for ``absolutely free'' has no
connection with frugal Scotsmen. A scot or sceot was a municipal
tax in 12th-century England, and someone who went scot-free was one
who succeeded in dodging these taxes. The term later was given
wider currency when scot was used to mean the amount that one owed
for entertainment, including drinks, in a tavern _ anyone who had a
drink on the house went scot-free. The scot in this version was
reinforced by the fact that all drinks ordered in taverns were
scotched, or marked on a slate, enabling the landlord to make a
reckoning of how much a person owed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported some time ago that independent counsels were
investigating Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman. I haven't seen anything in the news lately about
either case. Who are the independent counsels, and what is the
status of these cases?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both investigations are continuing, according to Justice
Deparment spokeswoman Michelle Bishop. The Babbitt inquiry was
assigned to prosecutor Carol Elder Bruce; the Herman case to Ralph
Lancaster. Both are in Washington. There's little else to report,
Bishop told Q&AMP;A.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com

<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article reported that members of the
Merchant Marine during World War II had been granted veterans
status. I would be in the group affected, so it seems an honor that
I am due. How do I go about obtaining this status?
</P>
<P>
   A: As the article indicated, it wasn't until 1988 that Congress
granted the merchant seamen of WW II the status of military
veterans. And then it applied only to those who sailed between Dec.
7, 1941, and Dec. 15, 1945. Last Veterans Day, President Clinton
signed a measure extending the cutoff date to Dec. 31, 1946, the
same as that for those in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact a regional office of the Department of
Veterans Affairs. When applying for medical care, seamen who
qualify must present their DD-214 discharge certificate from the
Defense Department to the VA medical facility. The VA regional
office can assist you in obtaining a certificate, if you don't
already have it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that four Boeing 757s were added to the fleet
of aircraft operated for the U.S. vice president. How many aircraft
in total are in his fleet?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the 757s _ designated C-32s by the Air Force _ are used
primarily by the vice president and congressional delegations, they
aren't specifically for the vice president, according to Andrea
Bittner of the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland. And three, not four, have been delivered to date, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and the congressional delegations also use
other aircraft. In addition to the three C-32s, the fleet is
composed of three C-9s, one VC-137 and seven C-20s, Bittner said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a Lyon College listed as being rated among the best
regional liberal arts institutions in the South. I'm not familiar
with Lyon College, and haven't been able to find any information
about it. What can you tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Founded as Arkansas College in 1872 in Batesville, Ark., the
name was changed in 1994 to Lyon College in honor of Frank Lyon
Sr., 84, a long-time member of the board of trustees. As reported
in 1994 at the time the college was renamed, Lyon's family had
donated more than $10 million to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The private, coed school is affiliated with the Presbyterian
Church USA. It has 43 full-time teaching faculty members and an
enrollment of 450 full-time and 100 part-time students, and its
library contains more than 140,000 volumes, said spokesman Bob
Qualls. It has consistently been rated _ under both names _ as
among the best in its category in the South by U.S. News &AMP; World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its scholastic accomplishments, Lyon has another
distinction: It claims to be one of only two colleges in the nation
with its own specially designed tartan registered in Scotland. The
college offers scholarships for pipers, drummers and Highland
dancers as part of its Scottish Heritage Program. It also is the
site of the annual Arkansas Scottish Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Lyon College, P.O. Box 2317, Batesville, AR 72503
(870-793-9813). Or, on the Internet, http://www.lyon.edu Q: How can
Hillary Rodham Clinton run for the Senate from New York when she
doesn't live there? Aren't there any residency requirements?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right in thinking that the first lady has no roots in
New York. Here's the deal. Residency requirements vary among
states, but in most of them the requirement is 30 days or less. In
New York, a candidate need only have purchased or rented a
residence by election day to meet residency requirements for
running for office, according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the
New York Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My newspaper recently printed a short obituary for Ben
Margolis of Los Angeles, saying he was an activist lawyer connected
with the racially tinged Sleepy Lagoon murder case. I'm 65 and I've
never heard of that. Can you tell me about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sleepy Lagoon was one of two celebrated cases in the 1940s
and '50s in which Margolis was involved. The other concerned the
blacklisted ``Hollywood 10,'' screenwriters and directors accused
of being members of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Sleepy Lagoon case took its name from a East Los Angeles
rock quarry and reservoir, which in turn took its name from a
popular song. On Aug. 2, 1942, 21-year-old Jose Diaz was found
beaten to death there. Fueled by a sensationalist press and
anti-Latino sentiment, some 600 youths were arrested in connection
with the crime; 24 were tried for murder and, despite no
eye-witnesses, 12 were convicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Margolis won a reversal of their convictions when an
appeals court overturned them because of lack of evidence, and
reprimanded the lower court judge for displaying prejudice and
hostility toward the defendants. The case later was dramatized in
Luis Valdez's play and movie, ``Zoot Suit,'' referring to press
accounts in the Sleepy Lagoon case calling the defendants ``zoot
suiters'' because of their long coats and wide pants.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis, 88, died on Jan. 28 in Portland, Ore. No one was ever
convicted in the Sleepy Lagoon case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the composition of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences? How does one become a member?
</P>
<P>
   A: The honorary organization has more than 6,000 members
representing varied branches of the motion picture industry,
including actors, art directors, cinematographers, directors,
executives, film editors, musicians, producers, publicists, writers
and those who work in short films, feature animation, sound and
visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate for membership must be sponsored by at least two
members of the branch for which the person may qualify. Each
proposed member must first receive the favorable endorsement of the
appropriate branch executive committee before his or her name is
submitted to the board of governors for approval. The board also
may invite people to become members-at-large and associate members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did Bill Clinton change his name from that of his
biological father? I believe his father's last name was Blythe.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the book Facts About the Presidents, William
Jefferson Blythe 4th was the only child of William Jefferson Blythe
3rd and Virginia Blythe. His father was killed in an auto accident
before his birth. In 1950, his mother married Roger Clinton, who
legally adopted her son, giving him his name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In October, at the Wye River Mideast summit, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the release of Jonathan
Pollard, who was convicted in the mid-1980s of spying against the
United States for Israel. In December, it was reported that
President Clinton would announce his decision on Netanyahu's appeal
in mid-January. It's now well past that. What's the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: The review process is ongoing, White House spokeswoman Julie
Goldberg told Q&AMP;A. There was never a deadline for its completion,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently that President Clinton's pension will
start at about $151,800 a year. That seems pretty steep for a guy
who had no prior federal service. How is that amount determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: Prior federal service doesn't figure into it. The
presidential pension benefit is called a pension by law, but it's
really more of an entitlement, stipend or system of payments, said
Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. To qualify for it, a
president doesn't have to have a certain length of service or a
certain salary level. The pay is for an active-duty member of the
Cabinet. All a president has to do is to qualify is to serve ``for
as little as one day,'' Sepp said, and not have been removed from
office by impeachment and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that actor Hal Holbrook is married
to actress Dixie Carter. I always thought that was just an act they
carried over from their days on TV's ``Designing Women.'' Is that
where they met?
</P>
<P>
   A: They already were married when ``Designing Women'' first went
on the air on Sept. 29, 1986. Carter and the twice-divored Holbrook
were married on May 27, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about Duncan Hines, whose name is associated so
closely with cake mixes. Can you tell me anything about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hines was born in 1880 in Bowling Green, Ky. His mother died
when he was 4. Years later, he said in an interview that the family
cook prepared home-baked bread, wild turkey, venison, fried
chicken, biscuits and sausage for him, his sister and their four
brothers. ``We ate all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, he and his wife traveled constantly on business,
but Hines found a barrier to his complete enjoyment of traveling:
``The library paste served as gravy in short-order places was a
personal insult.'' So they began making notes, then lists, of
places where they found good food, and before long Hines was widely
known as an expert on good eating. He turned his hobby into a
business, writing and publishing books on cooking, carving and
lodging. In addition to his staff, Hines relied on a network of
more than 300 ``foodies'' who would find places to be included in
his ``Adventures in Good Eating'' _ something like a mid-1930s
version of today's Zagat Survey.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, interest in convenience foods perked up, and
in 1948 Hines was approached by the director of a farmer's
cooperative who was entering the food marketing business. The
cooperative's first product was a cake mix that called for fresh
eggs instead of the dehydrated eggs usually included in box mixes.
Hines loaned his name to the product and Duncan Hines, the company,
was born. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought the cake maker in 1956, and in
1998 sold it to Aurora Foods, whose other lines include Aunt
Jemima, Log Cabin syrup, Mrs. Butterworth, Mrs. Paul's seafood and
Mama Celeste pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, who was married twice, died in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A referred to Duncan Hines' book ``Adventures of Good
Eating'' as ``something like a mid-1930s version of today's Zagat
Survey.'' What is a Zagat Survey?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are best-selling books that began in 1979 with Nina and
Tim Zagat's New York City Restaurant Survey. Started as a hobby,
their concept became so popular, and gained such an intense
following, that it developed into a full-time publishing business.
In 1988, the Zagats extended their reporting empire to include U.S.
hotels, restaurants and spas, and in 1990 to the airline and car
rental industries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other guides, the Zagat Surveys don't rely on
paid staff or freelance writers for their judgments. The surveyors
are about 100,000 consumers _ ``real people'' _ who submit their
opinions on places, which then are organized into a rating system
ranging from 0 (``poor'') to 30 (``perfect''). The pocket-size
Zagat Surveys, featuring more than 40 and foreign cities (including
Atlanta), can be found at any bookstore.

ON A TORTUOUS ROUTE, A SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCUSATION AGAINST CLINTON
RESURFACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The allegation was passed on to reporters for The Los Angeles
Times and The New York Times in the waning days of the 1992
presidential campaign. Regarding it as the kind of toxic waste
traditionally dumped just before Election Day, both newspapers
passed on the story _ that a nursing-home executive had been
sexually assaulted in 1978 by Bill Clinton, then the attorney
general of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor persisted in the shadowlands of the Internet, even
after a sworn denial by Juanita Broaddrick, the woman involved.
Mrs. Broaddrick reversed herself last spring, during questioning by
investigators for the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. Last
month, during the impeachment process, she decided to make the
assault charges public in an interview with NBC News. Then she
chafed because the interview was not broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Broaddrick has found a different avenue to tell her
story, giving several news organizations, including The New York
Times, an account of an encounter with Clinton in an Arkansas hotel
room. The interviews represent the first time she has spoken openly
about an accusation first made public last March. In the interview,
she describes a scene in which Clinton invited himself to her room
and then attacked her.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's personal lawyer, David A. Kendall, has
strenuously denied the charge. ``Any allegation that the president
assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely
false,'' he said in a statement released on Friday in response to
reporters' inquiries. ``Beyond that, we're not going to comment.''
The White House declined further comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with Mrs. Broaddrick's allegation are obvious.
There is no physical evidence to verify it. No one else was present
during the alleged encounter in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel room
nearly 21 years ago. The hotel has since closed. And Mrs.
Broaddrick denied the encounter in an affidavit in January 1998 in
the Paula Jones case, in which she was known only as ``Jane Doe No.
5.'' Through all those years, she refused to come forward. When
pressed by the Jones lawyers, she denied the allegation. And now,
she has recanted that denial.
</P>
<P>
   Her accusation has long been fodder for Clinton's legal and
political opponents; lawyers for Ms. Jones earned a stern judicial
rebuke last spring when they made Mrs. Broaddrick's name public in
a legal pleading based on unsubstantiated hearsay accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the problems with the accusation, it became part of
the background noise of the impeachment process in Congress, pushed
by conservative House Republicans even after Starr made only a
glancing reference to it in a supplement to his report.
</P>
<P>
   At least one senior Republican House investigator, pushing hard
for the president's removal, told some undecided Republicans that
Mrs. Broaddrick's story would probably become public and that they
would look bad if they voted against impeachment, two House
Republicans said. While it appears that the allegation swayed few,
if any, votes in the House or Senate, it hardened opinion against
the president among some of the dozen or so representatives who
were led to materials on the case in a secure room in the Capitol,
Republican officials said. In some cases, reading the Broaddrick
files ended the representatives' qualms and made them feel at peace
with their decisions to support impeachment, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said he was shaken by the
materials and at one point decided to vote for impeachment but in
the end changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material I saw was, if true, shocking, disgusting and left
a big pit in your stomach,'' said Shays, who become one of the few
Republicans to vote against impeachment. ``But it did not directly
relate to the articles of impeachment, which is why it didn't see
the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   The shadowy, subterranean path the allegation traveled also
illustrates the mechanics of national news organizations after a
year of White House sexual scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Never homogenous, the national press is divided in ever-smaller
slivers, with smaller outlets on the Internet and cable television
sometimes overwhelming the slower and more sober judgments of
mainstream news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Now some news outlets report on the investigations of other news
organizations even before they are published.
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Van Buren, Ark., Mrs. Broaddrick said in an
interview this week that she had decided to air her charges in the
NBC interview because she was exasperated by erroneous descriptions
of the encounter on the Internet and on a cable television talk
show last December. She was contemptuous of the national tabloid
Star, which in December raised the possibility that she and her
husband had been paid to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were talking about my life and they didn't know what
they were talking about,'' she said. ``It was so hurtful, to think
anyone would think we would take money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Broaddrick, who is now 56 and the prosperous owner of a
nursing home and an extended care facility, gave her account to The
New York Times over the telephone. It is the following:
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton came through Van Buren on a campaign stop in April
of 1978, she approached him and discussed nursing homes. He told
her that if she were ever in Little Rock, they could talk further.
</P>
<P>
   She attended a conference in Little Rock a few weeks later with
her friend and employee Norma Rogers, then the director of nursing
at Mrs. Broaddrick's nursing home. She telephoned Clinton, she
said, and agreed to meet him in a coffee shop. But when he phoned
back, he said he wanted to avoid some reporters and suggested
meeting in her room.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he arrived, she said, Clinton moved close to her
and tried to kiss her, succeeding only in biting her upper lip,
hard. Then, she said, he forced her down on to the bed and had
intercourse with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so totally surprised, totally shocked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she said, he got up from the bed, put on his
sunglasses, and while walking to the door, said, ``You'd better put
some ice on that,'' referring to her bruised and bitten lip. Then
he left.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends, Susan Lewis and Norma Rogers, said she told them of
the incident at the time. Ms. Rogers, then the director of Mrs.
Broaddrick's nursing home, said she entered the room and found Mrs.
Broaddrick crying and in ``a state of shock.'' Her upper lip was
puffed out and blue, and appeared to have been hit. ``She told me
he forced himself on her, forced her to have intercourse,'' Mrs.
Rogers said in an interview earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Broaddrick said she decided not to see a doctor about her
lip, because the swelling had gone down.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the incident, Mrs. Broaddrick said, she was
having an affair with a married man, Dave Broaddrick, who has been
her husband for the past 18 years. She told both Mr. Broaddrick and
Mrs. Rogers not to reveal what she had told them, because she was
convinced no one would believe her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was a respected businesswoman, what was I doing
in a hotel room with the attorney general?'' she said. ``No, I
never even considered coming forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Broaddrick had told a few friends her account, but it had
not seemed to leak out until she was approached during the 1992
campaign by Philip Yoakum, an opponent of Clinton whom she knew
from Arkansas business circles. He insisted that she make her
accusations public. She refused.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, she said, she was approached by lawyers for
Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee whose sexual
harassment suit against Clinton was settled last year. Mrs.
Broaddrick rebuffed them. ``I just didn't want to drag my family
through this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of her lawyer, Bill Walters, a Republican state
senator, she agreed to let him call a friend of his, Bruce Lindsey,
White House deputy counsel, she said. After the call, the
president's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, faxed Walters an affidavit
another woman had used to deny involvement with Clinton. She said
Walters changed the names and facts and Mrs. Broaddrick signed it
on January 2, 1998. Contacted on Tuesday, Lindsey and Bennett would
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit read, in part, ``These allegations are untrue and
I had hoped that they would no longer haunt me, or cause further
disruption to my family.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Lewinsky matter surfaced, she said she started to get
calls from reporters, but she refused to comment. Then she heard
that prosecutors in the office of Starr were going to approach her.
She discussed her options with her husband and her son, Kevin
Hickey, a lawyer, and they decided she could not lie to Federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   She recounted most of her story to FBI investigators for Starr,
breaking down when she got to the physical details and going no
further. She made it clear that no one from the White House had
ever tried to pressure her to stay silent.
</P>
<P>
   Around Thanksgiving of last year, Ms. Broaddrick said, she was
contacted by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who was one of the House
impeachment managers. He was interested primarily in what happened
after the attack. She told him that there had never been any
overtures of bribery or intimidation from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The white-hot partisanship surrounding the impeachment debate
insured that details of Mrs. Broaddrick's charges ricocheted around
Capitol Hill, where about a dozen representatives went to examine
the detailed account that Mrs. Broaddrick, then known as ``Jane Doe
No. 5,'' gave to House investigators. It also ricocheted around the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations, including The New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal, carried brief news accounts of the congressional
interest in the allegations of Jane Doe No. 5, without any details.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, Lisa Myers, an NBC reporter, arrived in Little
Rock with her producers and camera crew. Soon after the Internet
gossip Matt Drudge began putting out taunting reports on his Web
site that NBC was having cold feet about broadcasting the piece.
Fox News reported on the NBC interview and on at least one occasion
the anchor Brit Hume wore a ``Free Lisa Myers'' lapel button on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30, the CNN show ``Reliable Sources'' included a
discussion of the status of the NBC interview. Robert Bartley, the
editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal, saw the show and
decided to send Dorothy Rabinowitz, one of his columnists, to see
if she could interview Mrs. Broaddrick. She wrote a lengthy
article, which was published on The Journal's editorial page, one
of the nation's most conservative and a strident critic of Clinton.
The Journal's Washington bureau chief, Alan Murray, said he first
found out about the Rabinowitz article when it was mentioned on
Drudge's web site.
</P>
<P>
   After her piece was published, Ms. Rabinowitz stayed in touch
with Mrs. Broaddrick, and eventually persuaded her to repeat her
story to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   People inside NBC who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
there were long debates about whether to use the piece but that
network executives believed that the interview needed extensive
corroboration. One thing that gave them pause was the fact that the
father of a corroborating witness, Norma Rogers, had been murdered
and that Clinton pardoned the person convicted of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Rogers said Clinton's pardon decision, in
1980, had nothing to do with her corroboration of Mrs. Broaddrick's
story.
</P>
<P>
   For months Mrs. Broaddrick had been talking to another reporter,
Lois Romano of The Washington Post, off the record. When Ms.
Rabinowitz's piece appeared on Friday, Mrs. Broaddrick agreed to
let Ms. Romano publish her account as well.
</P>
<P>
   Was publishing an easy call? ``No,'' replied Leonard Downie Jr.,
the executive editor of The Washington Post. ``We talked it out.
Even when we saw the Rabinowitz column, I wasn't certain we'd be
publishing the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Downie added, ``Our aim was to provide the entire story _ a
story about something that she had said, that she had told some
journalists and some investigators and, a number of years ago, a
friend. And the role that the knowledge of that story had come to
play in various investigations and various media decisions is the
whole story as opposed to a specific accusation by one person 21
years ago with limited corroboration.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also hesitated about publishing the account,
because it had not interviewed Mrs. Broaddrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we did was assign some reporters to learn as
much as we could _ about the story, about how it emerged, about its
consequences,'' said the managing editor of The Times, Bill Keller.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Even then, we talked long and hard about whether to
publish anything. The merits of the allegations are probably
unknowable. Legally, it doesn't seem to go anywhere. Congress isn't
going to impeach him again. And frankly, we've all got a bit of
scandal fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these allegations played at least some small role in the
impeachment of a president,'' Keller said. ``And our readers, who
have doubtless encountered the story in other places, are entitled
to read our best take on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, NBC News announced that the Broaddrick
interview would be broadcast on ``Dateline NBC'' Wednesday night.
``We were never holding it,'' Andrew Lack, the president of NBC's
news division, said of the interview. ``We were working our way
through a process that was not completed until today.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the drumbeat of coverage of his network's
yet-to-be-broadcast interview, he added, ``It seems that these days
so many stories are getting far too much play before their
airing.'' He added, ``There seems to be a party line, like an old
telephone party line, involving everything you're doing'' in news
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 50 people on it,'' he added. ``It's all cross
talk.''

A NEW RULE: THE BEAUTIFUL ARE THE BAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening moments of the satirical teen comedy
``Jawbreaker,'' a voice-over narrator rhapsodizes in breathless
Valley Girl tones about her high school in-group of arrogant
teen-age beauties known as the Flawless Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted to be them,'' she gushes. ``You know them.
They went to your high school, too. They totally ruled!''
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, the regal foursome, wearing skintight dresses and
high heels, struts into view. Rounding a corner in a corridor lined
with shiny metal lockers, the four ooze the snooty hauteur of
pampered princesses who have never accepted the word ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' is the latest in a slew of high school comedies
aimed at the bulging demographic blip of millennial teen-agers.
Already we have had ``Varsity Blues'' and ``She's All That,'' each
of which has gobbled up nearly $50 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Friday is ``Cruel Intentions,'' an upscale Manhattan
teen version of ``Dangerous Liaisons'' that has much in common with
``Jawbreaker.'' After that come ``American Pie'' and ``Ten Things I
Hate About You.''
</P>
<P>
   A cursory look at the high school movies that have opened or are
about to open might reinforce the cliche that the more things
change, the more they stay the same. Now as in the 1950s, the
decade that invented the modern teen-ager, the American teen movie
portrays high school as a brutal social and sexual testing ground
whose pecking order puts handsome jocks and pretty cheerleaders at
the top and relegates misfits, nerds and arty types to social
serfdom.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the senior prom is an event capable of inducing
trauma in the girl who is either uninvited or forced to go with a
date less desirable than Prince Charming.
</P>
<P>
   But if the broad outlines of the basic high school drama remain
intact, there have been some significant changes inside the
picture. More than 40 years after he was invented by James Dean in
``Rebel Without a Cause,'' the stock image of the teen-age rebel
hero _ the sexy mixed-up kid searching for his identity _ has begun
to fade from the center of teen mythology.
</P>
<P>
   In movies as in pop music, the focus of attention has shifted
from boy power to girl power. On the pop music charts, Alanis,
Jewel, Mariah, Janet, Brandy, Monica and Lauryn rule under the
watchful eye of their mentor and role-model, Madonna. But in the
movies, much more than in music, the messages being conveyed about
girl power are decidedly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The typical male hero of a late-90s teen comedy tends to be a
bland, idealistic athlete-scholar whose bright future is clouded
only by a few minor problems.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Varsity Blues,'' James Van Der Beek is a good-looking
A-student in a football-obsessed Texas town who becomes an
overnight star when he replaces the injured quarterback on the high
school's championship team. Not even a girl offering herself in a
whipped-cream bikini can keep him from following a straight and
narrow path to a full scholarship at Brown University. His main act
of rebellion is standing up to the team's racist, megalomaniacal
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In ``She's All That,'' Freddie Prinze Jr. plays a modern-day
Pygmalion who, on a nasty bet, transforms the geekiest girl in his
senior class (Rachael Leigh Cook) into prom queen material.
Prinze's flawed but likable hero is so blandly nice he barely
exists on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cook's character, a bespectacled intellectual painter,
political activist and amateur performance artist, radiates
intelligence and spirited independence. Instead of swooning into
the arms of the dreamboat who has deigned to pay her court, she
becomes his mentor, introducing her conformist high-school jock
with a heart of gold to worlds he never knew existed.
</P>
<P>
   The ruthless female leading characters in ``Jawbreaker'' and
``Cruel Intentions'' are downright scary in the way they view boys
as trophies. Ryan Phillippe, who plays a teenage Don Juan in
``Cruel Intentions,'' is no match for Sarah Michelle Gellar playing
the vengeful, coldly promiscuous class president of an elite
private school in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of forerunners of these new teen movies
portraying girl power, two stand out. ``Carrie'' (whose sequel is
about to be released) opened the door in 1976 with its ferocious
portrayal of female adolescent peer group cruelty and telekinetic
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The movie helped spawn an entire genre of female-oriented teen
horror movies, from the ``Halloween'' series through ``Scream.''
More recently, ``Clueless,'' a clever contemporary adaptation of
Jane Austen's ``Emma,'' set the mode of adapting a piece of classic
literature for the teen movie market.
</P>
<P>
   But as girls seize the reins of power in high school movies,
alarms are going off. The leader of the Flawless Four in
``Jawbreaker'' is a cold-blooded psychopath who manipulates her
cronies into covering up the accidental death of a friend in a
sadistic 17th-birthday ritual.
</P>
<P>
   When the film's narrator describes her as ``Satan in heels,''
she isn't kidding. Ms. Gellar's character in ``Cruel Intentions''
is equally vicious, the power-mad incarnation of two words that are
bandied about a great deal in teen movies: bitch and slut. In
``She's All That,'' the prom queen (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) whom Prinze's
character deserts for Ms. Cook's made-over nerd is similarly
monstrous.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying message seems to be that teen-age girls, having
finally been given license to swear like truck drivers and sleep
with whomever they want, deserve to be punished. Being born
beautiful means being born bad. Only ugly ducklings who have turned
themselves into swans have a right to be happy.

 &HT;    Turner's genius, generosity don't excuse gaucherie
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Watching Ted Turner speak in public is like watching
some brave soul juggle four loaded pistols. It can be vastly
entertaining, but part of the fascination lies in wondering whether
he'll shoot himself in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one of those guns did go off, and Turner is again
hobbling around on crutches. The occasion was a speech to the
National Family Planning and Reproductive Association in
Washington. Turner was asked what he would do if he ever met Pope
John Paul II, whom Turner has repeatedly criticized for his
opposition to birth control.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the question, Turner cracked an adolescent Polish
joke, suggesting that the pope's ethnic background made him less
than competent. In a mere half-dozen words, he managed the
impressive feat of insulting the leader of a major religion and the
intelligence of an entire nationality. A few days later, he
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   For longtime Ted-watchers, such incidents are nothing new. Among
those he has insulted over the years have been Chinese political
dissidents (they asked for it at Tiananmen Square), Christianity
(``a religion for losers''), media tycoon Rupert Murdoch (he
likened him to Adolf Hitler), and victims of mass suicide (``There
are too many people anyway; it's a good way to get rid of a few
nuts; you gotta look at it that way'').
</P>
<P>
   Ted's a funny, irreverent guy, and I do like to hear the man
talk. He's blunt and honest, and it's exhilarating to try to keep
up with him as he flits from topic to topic, his mind unfettered by
the structures and restraints that hamstring the rest of us. It's
more than a freak show; that ability to simply let the ideas flow
freely has been the cornerstone of Turner's phenomenal success,
allowing him to see opportunity where others saw only obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   At times, however, you get the eerie sense that Turner is still
just a little boy thrilled at the idea of saying something naughty
to get a laugh. And the louder the laughs, the bolder he gets. You
can see him get revved up by the response of his audience, his
energy rising and his mind racing. And before you know it, he's
gone off and said something really stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's outbursts are perplexing because they so directly
contradict the causes he pursues. The same man who told the Polish
joke also banned the word ``foreign'' from the offices of CNN,
preferring the more neutral ``international.'' The same man who
spoke sympathetically about the Chinese government's violent
repression of student dissidents donated $1 billion to the United
Nations and contributes hundreds of millions more to social-justice
causes here at home.
</P>
<P>
   His accomplishments have undoubtedly made the world a better
place. His electronic brainchild, CNN, has reinforced the notion
that we share a planet and that our fates are interconnected. His
philanthropic mission, which is no doubt sincere, has provided the
financial seed money for many a progressive cause.
</P>
<P>
   But at root, the goals of world peace and social justice can be
addressed only through a basic and fundamental respect for one
another as individuals. Disagreements are not evidence of the other
party's stupidity; they cannot be resolved by ridicule or mockery.
The contribution of huge sums of money does not buy a change in the
rules of the game for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Ted Turner needs to put his mouth where his
money is.

 &HT;    Take the money, run?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The taxpayers of Waco public schools have already
heard from young Kalvin Farrow. It's time the lawmakers of Texas
did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kalvin, a fifth-grader, had the gumption to speak before the
local school board when his teacher at South Waco Elementary was
taken away. He didn't understand when the district explained,
``It's all in the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Kalvin and his classmates ought to bear on the
minds of lawmakers in Austin flirting with the idea of school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Kalvin is among the students who most concern lawmakers, those
who need extra help with basic skills. He started out the year in a
multi-age class for students like him. It had a 1-to-8
teacher-student ratio, a great chance for special attention.
</P>
<P>
   But when enrollment figures came down, the district had to
scramble. It suddenly found it couldn't afford Kalvin's small,
multi-age class.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It's pretty simple. Waco last year implemented one of the
state's strictest retention/promotion policies, basing it in large
part on passing the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills in every
grade it's offered or, in grades one and two, results on the Iowa
Test of Basic Skills.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter policy, plus the opening of Waco's second charter
school, undeniably was the major factor when 400 students left
WISD.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this school year lost enrollment has resulted
in $2.5 million in budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Waco schools are taking the enrollment-budget hit in
part because they are a step ahead of the state on student
promotion. The Senate last week voted unanimously to make promotion
from grades three, five and eight contingent on passing TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally neutral?
</P>
<P>
   The hits Waco schools have taken based on enrollment should make
one leery of vouchers, which are portrayed as fiscally neutral _
painless. With fewer students you need fewer dollars, right? Wrong.
Among policy mind-sets, that's called simpleton's dementia. It
disregards fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   Take away a smattering of students and public schools still have
the same airspace to heat and cool, the same light bill. They also
are left with critical staffing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the city were to cut funding to its fire department
when 400 scattered families were offered vouchers to have their
fire protection done by a private firm. Does anyone think the fire
department's costs would decline proportionally? Additionally, when
schools lose state dollars in this fashion they lose some of the
flexibility to group students based on ability and to tailor
programs to their needs, like Waco wanted to do with Kalvin's
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Waco would not be one of the districts targeted by the pilot
voucher bill proposed by Rep. Mike Krusee, R-Taylor. It would
involve low-performing students in major metro school districts
with 60,000 or more students.
</P>
<P>
   Their magic bullet
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of vouchers aren't going to be satisfied very
long with a ``pilot'' program. They see vouchers _ ``free
enterprise'' in education _ as the solution to all problems. They
disregard the fact that public schools always will be needed to
handle the toughest, costliest problems, particularly educating
students no private school will touch.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Austin indicate the voucher movement doesn't have
the steam some expected, though the pilot idea is supported by the
governor and lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, one reason is that public schools are doing what the
legislature has required of them _ emphasizing basic skills and
improving TAAS scores at rates that are drawing attention
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Texas legislators should be offended to hear voucher proponents
denounce public schools as failed. They only fail if we allow them
to fail.

 &HT;    De Niro an ex-Cold Warrior on a mission in `Ronin'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a postmodern action movie. This guilty pleasure
from director John Frankenheimer casts Robert De Niro as a member
of an ad hoc band of secret warriors, along with Jean Reno, Stellan
Skarsgard and Sean Bean. Former Cold War operatives cut loose from
their agencies, they're now free agents for hire. This time,
they've been recruited by Natascha McElhone, a mysterious
Irishwoman who wants them to get their hands on a suitcase. What's
in it? Doesn't matter. It's just the MacGuffin that gives
Frankenheimer an excuse to whip up some very tense, very cool
action scenes in some beautiful European locales. (The movie is
also on DVD, $24.98.)

 &HT;    An undeserved dearth of emotion
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first and last thing that grabs the ear when Kelly Willis'
fourth album is played is the voice. She may be diminutive, but the
pipes aren't. Willis can toss off a near-yodel, deploy classic
country twang, sing it low and slow or go for the
middle-of-the-road country-pop crossover sound _ and that's just on
virtually any one of the 13 songs on ``What I Deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is what Willis deserves (and lacks): songs that
reach out and cleverly stir some emotion, whether it's sympathy for
a loser at love, scorn for a jilter or an understanding of the fact
that nothing lasts forever. ``Heaven Bound,'' ``Not Forgotten You''
and ``Not Long for This World'' score points for quality, as does
the music on which Willis' voice rides. But lackluster phrases _
such as the title cut's ``Now time has left me feeling old and
losing hope/Hell, I've walked a long way just to find the end of my
rope'' _ weaken others. So you take your pleasure where you find
it. Here, it's in the voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I Deserve''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Willis. Rykodisc. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: No mystery about what Kelly Willis deserves:
stronger songs.

</P>
<P>
   ``A Prince Among Thieves''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Paul. Tommy Boy Music. 35 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Here's proof that the brain behind such early-'90s
thinking-man's rap acts as De La Soul can still come up with a
creative project. Too bad its individual parts aren't that
interesting. Producer Prince Paul's latest album is basically the
story of an aspiring rapper told over 35 tracks. Days before the
fictional Tariq (rapper Breeze) is supposed to meet with the
Wu-Tang Clan about a record deal, he promises to work a week for a
longtime friend/drug dealer to earn money for studio time. Along
the way, Tariq meets rapper Big Daddy Kane as the pimp, comedian
Chris Rock as the crack addict and rapper-turned-singer Everlast as
the crooked cop who busts him. The story line would actually be
easy to follow if it weren't for the only average rap singles
sandwiched in between.

<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ OK, the late 1970s _ Blondie was arguably the
coolest band in the world. Fronted by Deborah Harry, the perfect
new wave pinup girl, this New York combo churned out a string of
chart-topping hits, including ``Heart of Glass'' and ``Call Me,''
which thrillingly fused downtown hipness and pop hooks. ``No
Exit,'' Blondie's first album in 17 years, shows how much times
have changed. Gamely bopping through cheesy new wavers such as
``Screaming Skin,'' the group sounds more quaint than cool. But
``Maria,'' a soaring pop track that showcases Harry's ice-princess
vocals, will have you slipping on a skinny tie and pogoing around
your living room.

<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Multi-threat DJ Mocean Worker _ a.k.a. Adam Dorn, son of
longtime jazz producer Joel Dorn _ inhabits a sonic wonderland
where the already blurry boundaries of electronic dance music blur
even more than usual. This debut release for Palm Pictures, Island
Records founder Chris Blackwell's new label, slams and shimmies all
over the map: hypnotic washes of ambient noir, imaginative
drum'n'bass workouts and jazz-influenced tracks that jump off of
plucked bass grooves and catchy vocal samples. What holds it all
together is Dorn's appealing sense of craft. He's got an ear for
accessible hooks and odd little twists _ recycling the Neville
Brothers' ``Fiyo on the Bayou,'' for instance, on ``Jello Dart'' _
that makes these quirky instrumentals warmly engaging.

 &HT;    Westerberg shows new maturity
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can't be easy being Paul Westerberg. A Midwestern pop
classicist dressed down in garage-rock tatters, he brought heart
and soul to the sometimes heedless fury of the '80s post-punk,
pre-Nirvana scene as frontman for the Replacements. But while his
solo career has foundered for much of the '90s, the rough-hewn
sentimentality that was his trademark has worked wonders for
mall-rat avatars the Goo Goo Dolls, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicaine Gratifaction'' _ who knows what the title means _
marks a subtle reversal of ill fortune. Co-produced by Don Was,
who's usually busy pumping musical Viagra into creatively stalled
geezers like Brian Wilson and Bob Dylan, the album sounds
refreshingly loose and unfussy, especially for an angst-ridden
perfectionist like Westerberg. Lyrically, he's still the clever,
self-deprecating poster child for chronic underachievement. ``I'm
past my prime, or was that just a pose?'' he asks on the opening
track, ``It's a Wonderful Lie.'' But when he stretches for
narrative mood, Westerberg escapes his own beautiful loser cliches.
``Self Defense,'' which features just piano and French horn, is a
moving vignette of adolescent anomie, and ``Born for Me,'' a duet
with Shawn Colvin, is romantic wimp-rock at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   If not exactly prime Westerberg, these dozen songs suggest he's
finally writing his way out of the paper sack of Replacements'
infamy and finding a mature voice with which his longtime fans can
happily identify. Even mall rats get older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicaine Gratifaction''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westerberg. Capitol. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A near-gratifying solo effort from one of rock's
great songwriters.

 &HT;    Recipe for Corn Bread Salad proves elusive
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since no one has responded with a corn bread salad
recipe like one requested in December by Sheila Richardson of
Dahlonega (Ga.), we thought we'd reprint one that ran here in 1995.
It doesn't call for cucumbers, like the one Richardson raved about
after having it at a restaurant in South Carolina, but you
certainly could toss some in if you like.
</P>
<P>
   SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Corn Bread Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 18 servings Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 2
to 3 hours
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: varies according to corn bread recipe used
</P>
<P>
   1package (1-ounce) dry ranch salad dressing mix
</P>
<P>
   1cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   19-inch pan Tex-Mex corn bread, crumbled (see note)
</P>
<P>
   215 1/2-ounce cans pinto beans, drained
</P>
<P>
   3large tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped green pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   2cups (8 ounces) grated cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   10slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
</P>
<P>
   216-ounce cans whole kernel corn
</P>
<P>
   Tomato wedges
</P>
<P>
   Green pepper rings
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, combine the salad dressing mix, sour cream and
mayonnaise. Set aside. Place half the crumbled corn bread in the
bottom of a large (at least 5 quarts) serving bowl. Top with half
the beans. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, green pepper and
onions; layer half this mixture over the beans. Over the tomato
mixture, layer half the cheese, bacon, corn and salad dressing.
Repeat layers, using remaining ingredients. Cover and chill 2 to 3
hours. Before serving, garnish as desired with tomato wedges and
green pepper rings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To prepare Tex-Mex corn bread, add one 4-ounce can chopped
green chiles and a pinch of sage to your favorite corn bread recipe
or a prepared mix that yields one 9-inch pan of corn bread.

 &HT;    Mini movie reviews of movies released on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' (R) _ ``In the Company of Men''
writer-director Neil LaBute expands his canvas, dissecting the sex
lives, secrets and lies of several couples (including Ben Stiller,
Jason Patric, Aaron Eckhart, Catherine Keener and Nastassja
Kinski). It's a ruthlessly observed roundelay of bad relationships,
so keenly written and acted that you'll laugh uncomfortably with
recognition. Standout moment: the collision between the brusque
Keener and chauvinist Patric. It's like watching a pair of snakes
dance. Grade: A -
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Urban Legend'' (R) _ Some laughs, some scares, nothing
special. The latest spawn of ``Scream.'' The gimmick: What if a
serial killer decided to off college students by imitating urban
legends? You know, the baby sitter and the goon calling from
upstairs. The gang members driving without headlights. The
dog/cat/baby in the microwave. The movie is slick, amusing,
forgettable. Grade: C+ _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Pecker'' (R) _ Edward Furlong plays the title character, an
amateur Baltimore photographer whose documentary-style pictures
capture the eye of New York art dealer Lili Taylor. Writer-director
John Waters' jokes about the Manhattan gallery scene are about 10
years too old. The movie relies on shock gags (lesbian strippers)
and irreverence (Pecker's grandma plays ventriloquist with her
statue of the Virgin Mary). It's the usual mix of amiable poor
taste and ragged filmmaking that Waters has made his signature.
He's turned his own mediocrity into artistic self-justification.
Grade: C. +
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Permanent Midnight'' (R) _ This true-life story of a
successful sitcom writer (Ben Stiller) trying to kick his heroin
habit could use some time in movie rehab. Pretending to explore the
lower depths, Hollywood-style, it's actually a self-serving ego
trip that uses its shooting-up scenes as shock tactics and its
``insider'' Hollywood talk as an audience-flattering distraction.
Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Let's Talk About Sex'' (R) _ If Jerry Springer, Henry
Jaglom, a brain-dead Howard Stern wannabe and the folks who dreamed
up ``The Love Connection'' ever collaborated on a movie, it might
look a lot like this. Unfortunately, the film is actually the
creation of Troy Beyer _ an appealing actress who, like everyone
else in Hollywood, apparently really wants to direct. And write.
Before she tries it again, perhaps she should be locked up for a
week in a room with Don Simpson's corpse. Grade: D -

 &HT;    A civilized tradition: Tea sites steeped in good taste
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 13 original Colonies defied England and declared they
were no longer subjects of the king, they didn't chuck everything
British. Among other things, they kept the language, the literature
and much of English jurisprudence, all of which became part of the
fabric of the new country.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one very, very British tradition that never
caught on here that we might want to rethink: Teatime.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a simple ``cuppa'' taken alone at the kitchen table
or formal high tea served from a 200-year-old silver service, from
battlefields to boardrooms in cottages and castles, generation
after generation of Brits have stopped their earthly pursuits
around 4 in the afternoon to reflect over a cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we Yanks have our varied pauses that refresh, and happy
hours abound, but they don't come close to equaling the civilizing,
meditative, revitalizing, reflective ambience of taking tea.
</P>
<P>
   We can only speculate what all that cozy, civilizing daily
reflection would have done for us. At best, it might have calmed
things down a bit; at worst it might have diluted some of America's
famed nervous energy, robbing the world of a great invention. It
was, after all, an American who invented the tea bag.
</P>
<P>
   For the British, however, taking tea is intricately woven into
their collective personality and psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The cup of tea on arrival at a country house is a thing which,
as a rule, I particularly enjoy. I like the crackling logs, the
shaded lights, the scent of buttered toast, the general atmosphere
of leisured coziness.
</P>
<P>
   P.G. Wodehouse, ``The Code of the Woosters''
</P>
<P>
   It is over tea that many of life's problems, big and small,
become solvable.
</P>
<P>
   They were sitting at one of the tables now, where Daphne had put
out tea things, a cuppa being the true Englishman's cure for
everything, from tired feet to mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Grimes, ``The Man With a Load of Mischief''
</P>
<P>
   Teatime is time to calmly reflect on the events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been
a delightful, though unusually long day.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa May Alcott, ``Little Women''
</P>
<P>
   Taking tea helps one to gather one's wits _ to put things into
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   If you are cold, tea will warm you; If you are too heated, it
will cool you; If you are depressed, it will cheer you;
</P>
<P>
   If you are excited, it will calm you.
</P>
<P>
   William Gladstone
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 150 more tea quotes such as these at
http://www.teatime.com/, and if you read them all in one sitting,
you may want to jump up and sing ``God Save the Queen'' or at least
go have yourself a cup of Lipton's. This is a truly tea-riffic
site, though, to immerse yourself in all things having to do with
tea. Along with the quotes and a complete glossary of tea terms,
there is ``The Philosophy of Tea,'' tea reviews, a tea chat room,
tea and health information, recipes and more.
</P>
<P>
   At http://www.stashtea.com/facts.htm, you won't want to miss the
engrossing tale of tea through 5,000 years of civilization. There
are some enthralling, even pulse-pounding aspects to the story of
tea that will fascinate just about anyone, even if you are not a
history buff.
</P>
<P>
   If all this inspires you to have an English tea party, you must
stop at http://wwwiz.com/issue02/wizd04.html to learn about the
history and etiquette required for British high tea. You will learn
that the British Standards Institute has proclaimed that milk is
best poured before the tea, even though it's been reported that the
Queen herself recklessly enjoys her tea by adding the milk
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the crumpets? The English are as enamored of the
things that go with tea as they are the tea itself. Here, too,
there are finely honed traditions and rules to be followed. Visit
http://www.byerlys.com/bbag/bbag9804/recipes.html to learn the
proper English accompaniments to tea such as scones, tartlets,
petticoat tails, sandwiches, spreads and more.

<P>
   AARP'S 'THREE-STEP PLAN TO FIGHT MEDICARE FRAUD'
</P>
<P>
   STEP ONE: Answer these three simple questions about your
Medicare bill.
</P>
<P>
   1. Did you receive the service or product for which Medicare is
being billed?
</P>
<P>
   2. Did your doctor order the service or product for you?
</P>
<P>
   3. To the best of your knowledge, is the service or product
relevant to your diagnosis or treatment? (If you have a question
about a procedure or test, ask your doctor to explain the need for
it.)
</P>
<P>
   STEP TWO: If you spot something questionable, get a second
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   If the answer to any of the questions is ``no''
</P>
<P>
   _ Report questionable charges to your Medicare carrier, whose
phone number is on your statement.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are sure it's a fraudulent claim, call the Medicare
fraud hotline at 1-800-447-8477.
</P>
<P>
   STEP THREE: Keep Medicare costs down by staying up on fraud.
Common signs of fraud and abuse include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charging more than once for the same service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Performing inappropriate or unnecessary services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offering free services, equipment or supplies in exchange for
your Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing lower-cost or used equipment while billing Medicare
for new.
</P>
<P>
   _ A supplier completing a Certificate of Medical Necessity for
the physician.
</P>
<P>
   _ Routinely waiving patient coinsurance.

   WHAT AMERICANS THINK ABOUT HEALTH CARE FRAUD
</P>
<P>
   How widespread do you think health care fraud is in general?
</P>
<P>
   Extremely widespread ... 29 percent
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat widespread .. 54 percent
</P>
<P>
   Not too widespread ...... 12 percent
</P>
<P>
   Not at all widespread ..... 2 percent
</P>
<P>
   Don't know/refused ....... 3 percent
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of people agreeing with each statement:
</P>
<P>
   92 percent. It's my personal responsibility to report suspected
cases of health care.
</P>
<P>
   92 percent. I would report my doctor if I thought he or she had
committed fraud.
</P>
<P>
   72 percent: The Medicare program would not go broke if fraud and
abuse were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   63 percent. Insurance companies have no incentive to detect
health care fraud; they can always raise your premiums.
</P>
<P>
   fraud.
</P>
<P>
   49 percent. People to whom you report suspected health care
fraud don't really care enough to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   19 percent. Health care fraud is just built into the health care
system; there's nothing that can be done about it.

BISHOP URGES ARIZONA FLOCK TO TAKE HIGH ROAD IN SEXUAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Jesus called people by name, not by their race or
profession or sexual orientation, and the leader of the Arizona
Episcopal Church is asking his flock to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statement on human sexuality, Bishop Robert
Reed Shahan is calling on the state's 27,000 Episcopalians to be a
more inclusive, compassionate community that takes the high road in
the often-contentious debate on human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Epistle,;; Shahan shares his views on the blessing of
same-sex unions, the ordination of homosexual priests and the
church's current debate on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shahan believes that the denomination should ordain qualified
people regardless of their sexual orientation and should develop
rites of blessings for same-sex relationships. But, he added, the
Arizona Episcopal Diocese will follow current denomination rules
that prohibit the ordination of non-celibate homosexual priests and
the blessing of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to be disobedient,'' he said. ``What I am going
to do is call the people to a higher road. It's about what it means
to be a church. It's when people engage one another by name and in
the spirit of Christian fellowship and they are not trying to draw
lines of distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not sanctioning blessings of same-sex unions that resemble
wedding ceremonies, saying marriage is a male-female symbol. But it
would be appropriate to develop another kind of blessing for many
relationships, including same-sex partners seeking a blessing for
their lifelong commitment, in a church that already blesses cars,
buildings and animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Priests showed the videotaped statement to parishioners this
month, and the January-February issue of the diocese newsletter
contained the full text of the statement and a letter from the
bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from the Arizona diocese and the church nationally has
been mostly supportive, according to the diocese, parish priests
and parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all pray together, and you all worship together, and you
all take Communion together,'' said Daniel Richards, a parishioner
in Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Phoenix. ``This speaks more to
the gospel and to integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Frank Clark expected a negative reaction among his
parishioners at All Saints of the Desert Episcopal Church in Sun
City, he said, but it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Clark does not favor the ordination of non-celibate gays as
priests, but he supports the bishop's call to be inclusive and his
rejection of the debate's extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what I've seen is a lot of polemics on both sides of
the issue,'' Clark said. ``What Bishop Shahan has done is helpful
in encouraging people to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun City parishioner Dodie Evans is 81 and doesn't agree with
the bishop on all things, she said. ``The Epistle,'' though, is
something she can support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested and really relieved to hear him explain that
a blessing is very appropriate for committed homosexuals but that a
marriage is between a man and a woman,'' said the retired
elementary-school principal.
</P>
<P>
   A Valley group for gay and lesbian Episcopalians and Catholics
found Shahan's ``Epistle'' a good step, said Cheak Yee, a member of
Dignity/Integrity and a parishioner in St. Mary's Episcopal Church
in Phoenix. ``Frankly, the Roman Catholics are a little envious,''
Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other activities, Dignity/Integrity holds Episcopal and
Catholic worship services for its 30 Episcopal members and 150
Roman Catholic members.
</P>
<P>
   Many Episcopal parishes are wel coming, so fewer Episcopalians
feel the need to seek fellowship elsewhere, Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   Shahan had not taken a public stand on human sexuality in his
seven years as Arizona bishop until he voted against a resolution
on sexuality during August's Lambeth Conference, a worldwide
meeting of Anglican bishops in Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   The non-binding resolution said, in part, that homosexual
practice is incompatible with Scripture, that practicing
homosexuals should not be ordained and that same-sex unions should
not be blessed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for the resolution was 526 for and 70 against. There
was concern, Shahan said, that his vote signaled he would break
denomination rules. &UR; He said that he won't but that he wants to see
a denomination where ``faithful, healthy'' people are ordained and
being a homosexual in a committed relationship is not an automatic
disqualification for ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of ordination and same-sex blessings have been a point of
contentious debate in the Episcopal Church nationally and in other
denominations. Resolutions to change current denomination policy
are expected to be introduced and hotly debated at the July 2000
national Episcopal convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church has about 2.5 million members in the United
States. Integrity, the organization of gay and lesbian
Episcopalians, has about 3,000 members. Episcopalians United, a
conservative organization in the denomination, has about 30,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Todd Wetzel, executive director of Episcopalians
United, said the majority of Episcopalians in the middle do not
support the proposed changes. Homosexual practice is a sin, and the
church should not condone it, Wetzel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counseling someone to continue in a sin is a far greater sin
in itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Michael Hopkins, national president of Integrity
and vicar of St. George's Episcopal Church in Maryland, called
Shahan's statement courageous. Hopkins, who is in a same-sex
covenant relationship, sees the church becoming more accepting. ``I
think a lot of the moderate bishops are where he is,'' Hopkins
said. ``Maybe the harshness of what happened at Lambeth has helped
push some of them to be more vocal and more outwardly affirming.''
</P>
<P>
   Many gays and lesbians have been unwelcome in churches and have
left, said Lyle Miller, an ex-Christian who is executive director
for the Valley of the Sun Gay and Lesbian Community Center in
Phoenix. Miller found the bishop's comments warm and affirming, he
said. ``This letter opens that door again for those people who have
felt that they have not been welcome,'' Miller said. ``I hope the
bishop is true to his word and that he will continue to encourage
churches to be open to all members of their community.'' &QL;

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Home Smart Home  
 By Deborah Solomon   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think it's tough sharing the remote control, imagine
trying to share a computer, modem, scanner and printer with others
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cummins and his wife each have a PC at home. His has a
color printer and more memory, so they both store files on it. Hers
has a scanner and black-and-white laser printer attached.
</P>
<P>
   The couple found it a hassle when Cummins had to stop working on
his PC so his wife could access it for files or print something
from the color printer. And Cummins often had to interrupt his
wife's work to use the scanner or laser printer.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cincinnati couple decided to create a home network _
hardware and software that lets computers talk to each other _ so
they could share files and peripherals like printers, CD-ROM drives
and scanners.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the first users of Symphony Cordless Networking
Suite, a product developed by Proxim Inc., of Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made things so much easier. We no longer have to
interrupt each other or unhook and reconnect things to various
computers,'' Cummins said.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley companies like 3Com Corp., Cisco Systems Inc.,
ShareWave and others are anticipating that as more homes add a
second or third PC, consumers will want a way to link them.
</P>
<P>
   Their quest is buoyed by the growth in the number of homes with
multiple PCs. Between 15 million and 20 million homes already have
more than one computer, according to Dataquest, and that number is
expected to rise as the cost of PCs continues to fall.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, 1.9 million U.S. homes will have a home
network, according to International Data Corp. During the next few
years, IDC says, that number is expected to soar to 12 million or
almost 12 percent of all U.S. homes. Industry watchers anticipate
sales of home networking equipment will reach about $200 million
this year and $1 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a home network varies, but consumers should expect
to spend between $100 to $300 per computer.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers have gotten the attention of almost every
networking firm. Just last month, 3Com announced that it formed a
division devoted to home networking. And several startup companies
have staked their fortune on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing of resources is the key word,'' said Greg Naderi,
information technology market analyst for Frost and Sullivan in
Mountain View. ``The ability to share a printer, a fax, a scanner
or any other type of peripheral device is cost-saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Home networking can also do more sexier things _ like letting
computer users play games against one another on different
computers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the near future, home networks will be able to control
security systems, lights, entertainment systems and even microwave
ovens.
</P>
<P>
   But the main driver for home networking, industry watchers say,
is Internet access. As high-speed Internet services, such as cable
modems and digital subscriber lines, catch on, consumers will look
to home networking as a way to share those costly devices and
services among various PCs. Linking computers gives users the
ability to surf the Web at high speeds from any PC in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As cable modems and DSL become more widespread, that's going
to drive demand,'' said Roy Johnson, who heads 3Com's home
networking division. ``What makes sense is sharing that pipe. Not
many people are going to buy multiple cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of home networking is not new. Multibillionaire Bill
Gates and athlete Barry Bonds each networked his home, and several
developers have been building houses wired for home networks. But
the costs have been prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for
average folks.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, consumers who wanted to link their PCs needed to
drill holes and lay cable to make a connection. Today, companies
are either selling or getting ready to roll out home networking
kits that the average person can install and afford.
</P>
<P>
   The products work in three ways _ through existing phone lines,
over power lines or wirelessly via radio waves from an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless products work by attaching tiny antennas to every
computer a customer wants to include in the network. Using special
software installed on a PC, families can share a modem to surf the
Web from any PC in the house. With the use of set-top boxes, they
can also download video or music clips from the Internet to the TV
or the stereo. The speeds vary depending on the product and the
modem being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless is easy to use and install and it eliminates the
problem of not having a phone jack in the room where you want to
surf the Web,'' said Bob Bennett, a co-founder of ShareWave, an El
Dorado Hills, Calif., company that's developing wireless home
networking products.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's company is selling its technology to manufacturers
like Phillips Electronics, and products should be available in the
second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Sunnyvale's Epigram and Tut Systems of
Pleasant Hill, use existing phone lines to create home networks.
</P>
<P>
   With Epigram, customers buy a networking card at a retail store,
snap it into a slot on the computer and connect a traditional phone
wire between the computer and existing wall jack. The product is
about 200 times faster than a 56K modem. Tut's ``HomeRun`'
technology allows data to travel across phone wires at speeds up to
1 megabit per second, roughly 40 times faster than a standard
modem.
</P>
<P>
   The products, which are expected to retail for $100 to $200 per
computer, don't affect ordinary phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the home networking products being developed will hit
the shelves within the next year. Some companies, such as Proxim
and Sunnyvale's ActionTec, are already selling wireless networking
kits in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Are Networks Mainstream?
</P>
<P>
   While company officials predict the home networking market will
soon explode, some industry watchers are skeptical. The benefits of
home networking are clear for people like Cummins, whose wife runs
two businesses out of their home. But whether home networking has
broad market appeal remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mainstream product,'' said Paul Johnson, an
industry analyst with BancAmerica Robertson Stephens in New York.
``A lot of money is being thrown here, but not that many homes are
ready for a home network.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who installed his own home network, said while the
products are easier to set up than in the past, they still require
a good deal of time. And once up and running, they are often clunky
and unreliable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to put one of these things in place,'' Johnson
said. ``Early adopters may put this in, but until these things get
easier to set up at home and people see a need for it, the market
won't take off.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the industry argue that the popularity of the
Internet will drive home networking into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the Internet out there I would be much more
pessimistic about what this market could be,'' said Jeffrey
Thermond, president of Epigram and a founder of the Home Phone
Networking Alliance, a trade group. ``But there's a lot of
bandwidth in the home for people to share. It's hard for me to
imagine that a home that has the discretionary income to pay $50 a
month for cable (Internet access) has less than two PCs. They are
going to want to share that pipe through a home network.''

AND NOW, A FEW WORDS FROM ABOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Even if you're not particularly religious, you've got
to admit the sign announcing the Sunday sermon at Memorial
Presbyterian Church was intriguing:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus and the three-toed sloth.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a member of the church, I still found myself wanting to know
what on Earth (or above) the sermon was about.
</P>
<P>
   When told this, the Rev. David Hicks, who came up with the
title, laughed. ``That's good,'' he said of the sign. ``It did what
it was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is: engage you, catch your eye. Make you think. And, just
maybe, entice you to go to church. (Hicks' sermon, by the way, was
not a religious version of ``Wild Kingdom''; it discussed how
people want Jesus to be as unchanging as the three-toed sloth.)
</P>
<P>
   Church signs are a funny business _ sometimes literally. One
side of the sign in front of the East Mesa Christian Church
recently said, ``Keep using my name in vain and I'll make rush hour
longer _ God.''
</P>
<P>
   But more often, signs are the only means of regular
communication a church has with a community. It's doubtless unfair
to judge a congregation on something so shallow as the couple of
lines you read on a sign out front when you're driving past at 45
mph. But it's also inevitable. First impressions are lasting. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fire of faith
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it's impossible to think of St. Theresa Catholic
Church as a frumpy, formal place after having seen the sign out
front during the ugliest, brain-melting heat of August: ``If you
think it's hot here . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Can't imagine many Latin Masses at that church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was done when I was away on vacation,'' the Rev.
Charles Kieffer, the pastor at St. Theresa, said with a chuckle.
``I'll sidestep that.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Theresa's sign is used mostly for announcements for its
school, Kieffer said. But he occasionally ventures to try something
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's nothing particular happening, I'll put a little
scripture out there, or a little thought of the day, just to tickle
people's minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's more challenging than it sounds. Most churches change
their signs weekly; the need for new messages never ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always on the lookout for something, even just listening
to a sermon or a speech or whatever,'' said Dru Paine, chairwoman
for communications at Scottsdale United Methodist Church. ``All of
a sudden, it's, `Aha! I can use that on my sign.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tight fit
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are other challenges as well. Space limitations, for
instance. Paine has only two lines on one side and one on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can pick out an `and' or throw in a dash, but
sometimes it's hard to pare things down and keep the meaning,''
Paine said. A favorite she managed to fit: ``Ch_ch _ what's
missing? U-r.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, churches aren't just looking to entertain you.
They're looking to get you inside their doors. A sign's
effectiveness in that regard is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten calls from people who say they appreciate the
message,'' Kieffer said. ``Having the school sign has definitely
brought people in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not been the case for Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A church sign, I believe, is not really going to do much in
the sense of pulling a non-member into the church,'' he said. ``To
my mind, that's a very small part of church life. Church life is to
be part of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Paine doesn't worry about it either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows if somebody's going to come to the church and join
it because of the sign,'' she said. ``But at least it's there?''
</P>
<P>
   And will be next week, and the week after that.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing. You don't have to be religious to
appreciate a well-done church sign; in between underwear ads and
fast-food billboards, something to actually think about is a nice
break, even for atheists.
</P>
<P>
   And if they can throw in a three-toed sloth every now and then,
all the better. &QL;

INTEL DEBUTS NEW PENTIUM III CHIP, PROCESSOR BUILT FOR HIGH 
GRAPHICS
</HEADLINE>
 III-AZR  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By REBECCA ROLWING   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Watch a movie on your computer and you get to
pick the ending. Or surf the Web and see 3-D images. Or tour a
model home that hasn't been built.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. gave a preview Wednesday of some 200 applications
that use the strengths of its new Pentium III, the world's fastest
desktop processor.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker says the Pentium III and its
applications will add new life to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is very good and could be groundbreaking in
terms of graphics,'' said Scott Hudson, senior analyst for PC
technology at Scottsdale-based Cahners In-Stat Group.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others say the glitzy new features will be a tough
sell to business users who may balk at the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that people will be very impressed with this, but
most people will say, `That's nice, but I'd just as soon pass,' ''
Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate graphics, video and sound quality typically don't
prompt most businesses to plunk down big bucks for a new computer,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III begins rolling out of Intel's U.S. manufacturing
plants in Chandler and Albuquerque on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Software optimized for the new processor promises improvements
in voice recognition and in video streaming and 3-D animation for
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Pentium III will have a clock speed of 500 Mhz.
Intel is expected to release a 550 Mhz version in the second
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   With a background of bouncy swing music, Intel launched a $300
million marketing campaign for Pentium III, its largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz, including commercials promising that the Pentium III
will make the Internet ``a whole lot more fun,'' is more than just
an effort to sell the processor. It may also be a fight to curb the
trend of people prefering cheaper computers, said Van Baker, an
analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a pretty important campaign for Intel,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in computing, including Microsoft and
IBM, came out for Wednesday's preview in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image was there, showing off its Web site with 3-D
drawings of 25 products that users can move and turn around.
</P>
<P>
   If you have unique products, customers need to be able to see
what they are like, said Richard Thalheimer, The Sharper Image's
chairman and founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much more fun for the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Excite also showed its 3-D Web search engine, called
Excitextreme, that lets users pick where they want to go from a
rotating carousel of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the right way for people to navigate the Web,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   A space-age, 3-D, shoot-'em-up game by British-based Rage Games
Ltd. showed flowing water, cracks in the ground and other details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It added another level of realism,'' Rage sales director
Philip Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Several business applications were also on display, including
speech dictation products with greater accuracy, speed and
vocabulary. Pentium III-powered computers can learn a new user's
voice in about five minutes, while other machines typically take
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy concerns have overshadowed the processor's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Each chip comes with an identifying serial number intended to
enhance e-commerce security and help corporations track computers.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights groups were furious and demanded that Intel
change the signature setup, saying it would allow companies to
build detailed consumer profiles that could be sold. Intel
responded by changing the identifying system so that it can be
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The processor also comes with 70 new multimedia instructions
that improve graphics and video performance.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip will compete with Intel's own Pentium II, a 450 Mhz
processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively minor enhancement over the Pentium II,''
said Peter Glaskowsky, a senior analyst with ``The Microprocessor
Report,'' a newsletter published in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Pentium III does not make the Pentium II obsolete,
Intel argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Pentium II) is still a great machine,`` spokesman Tom
Waldrop said. ``This is the march of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel won't announce the processor's cost until it begins
shipping them. Typically, Intel starts its new processors at around
$800. That price results in a complete computer for about $2,000.
The processor price generally drops by half in about nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the Pentium III could start much lower than $800, as
competition among top-speed processor manufacturers drives prices
down.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is battling to prevent rivals such as Advanced Micro
Devices from stealing market share. Intel remains the world's
largest chipmaker, with $26.2 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   As prices drop, analysts expect the Pentium III to gain
popularity by the end of this year, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends on the wow factor,'' Hudson said. &QL;

 AOL to Offer Cheap Long-Distance Calls  
 By Jon Swartz and Jamie Beckett   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The giant of the Internet may be getting bigger. In a pair of
moves to extend its services, America Online will soon offer
long-distance phone calls over the Internet and also may get into
the Web auction business.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest online service said yesterday it will
incorporate sound into its popular ICQ instant-messaging system
next week. This will allow it to offer telephonelike service over
the Internet for a fraction of regular long-distance rates. At the
same time, AOL reportedly is in discussions with eBay about buying
a minority stake in the popular San Jose online auction company.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves could significantly increase the company's revenue
streams and customer base. It now reaches 16 million computer
users. AOL is in the midst of a fierce battle with other Internet
and media companies to gain the widest membership possible.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials are particularly interested in jointly developing
online content and services with eBay, according to a report in
yesterday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   AOL refused to comment on the report. ``We've been rumored to be
buying companies I've never even heard of,'' AOL CEO Steve Case
said in an interview yesterday, following a speech at San
Francisco's Commonwealth Club. ``This climate (of acquisitions in
the Internet market) is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, eBay agreed to pay AOL at least $12 million over
three years to advertise on AOL. Case has repeatedly called eBay
one of the Web businesses he most admires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at eBay called the rumored alliance ``pure
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although AOL is the better-known company and commands more than
half of the domestic Web audience, there's plenty to attract the
Virginia giant to eBay, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's most popular online auction site has 2.1 million users
buying everything from autographed baseballs to Beanie Babies. It's
one of the ``stickiest'' sites on the Internet, capturing an
average user's attention for 27 minutes per visit _ an important
selling point to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   One thing eBay isn't, however, is cheap. Its stock price has
soared nearly tenfold since it went public in September. Yesterday,
after initially jumping on news of the possible AOL alliance, eBay
fell $4.50 to close at $233 per share. That gives eBay a market
capitalization of nearly $9.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors evidently think an AOL investment in eBay would be too
costly. Its shares slid $6.50, to $153.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said eBay could provide a tremendous new source of
revenue for AOL. EBay ``is basically turning Beanie Babies into
bucks. People are buying and selling, and they (AOL) are going to
get a piece of that action,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst with Paul
Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   While AOL officials were mum on eBay rumors, they acknowledged
that they have melded voice technology into their ICQ
instant-messaging service, creating a cyber equivalent to the phone
system.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephony _ voice conversations relayed between two PCs
over the Internet _ is still in its infancy. It can suffer from
quality and reliability problems, and can be cumbersome to set up.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the Paul Kagan analyst, said the addition of voice to ICQ
could be a boon for Internet telephony, which currently has an
estimated 10 million active users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make the whole notion of Internet telephony more
legitimate,'' he said. ``For the most part, nothing on the Internet
becomes consumer-friendly until AOL does it.''
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (Internetese for ``I Seek You'') boasts 28 million
registered users and is adding an average of 90,000 customers a
day. The wildly popular real-time chat technology allows users to
exchange private pop-up messages that are instantly relayed over
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   AOL acquired Mirabilis, the Israeli company that created ICQ,
for $287 million last June.

SCANNING ISN'T UP TO THE JOB OF RESUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there a program that will allow me to scan a
resume and then store it in a database where it can be reached at a
later time by typing in keywords?
</P>
<P>
   _ Big-Time TV Guy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BIG: As a matter of fact, I once wrote just such a program,
but there was a lot of resistance to its use, merely because it
pulled up my own resume no matter which keyword you typed in.
People can be so petty.
</P>
<P>
   True, scanners can ``read'' text, but you'd probably be better
off hiring a temp to punch the resumes into a database program like
Access or FoxPro. A scanner simply takes a picture of a page.
Text-recognition software then tries to figure out what all the
letters are, then jams them into a text file. If you have enough
patience, you can teach the software to recognize different
portions of the resume as different fields for a database, but that
only works if every resume you get looks exactly alike. One frilly
font, and the whole thing blows up.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you might try is a database program that can store
images as well as text. Then you could scan the resume and stash
the image file along with keywords you type into other fields. Of
course, if you do it right, mine's still the only resume that
should pop up. Did I mention that I could use a job?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there more than one version of Win98 now
available? I would like to buy the latest with the most patches
installed. Can I tell by the package info?
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to Date
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DATE: The only thing you can tell from the package is that
you're about to spend 90 bucks. Don't worry, though. No matter when
you buy Windows 98, it will upgrade itself to the latest and
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   If you have some way to get on the Internet _ and any
self-respecting geek does _ Win98 will go out and check the
Microsoft Web site for updates. Just click on the cleverly named
``Windows Update'' shortcut at the top of the start menu.
</P>
<P>
   If it's your first time there, you'll automatically download a
couple of helper programs, then Microsoft can reach out and poke
around your computer. I know, it's not a pleasant feeling having
Bill Gates groping your gear and pawing your peripherals. It gives
me a new appreciation for what my prom date went through.
Nevertheless, they do a pretty good job of figuring out what you
ought to download. And you won't have to call up your pal Werner
von Foureyes for help, since most stuff installs automatically.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a deal you can download that checks the site for
updates whenever you're on the Net, in case you're too lazy to do
it yourself. Just don't get all paranoid and think that it's some
way for Microsoft to keep track of you. It's merely a way for
Microsoft to keep track of you. Hey! Wait a minute ...
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I only buy the paper to get your comments. The
rest of the paper is trash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wise Beyond His Years
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WISE: That's exactly what I keep telling the editors, but
they never listen. They seem really hung up on all that news stuff.
The ad people are no better, except they occasionally print pizza
coupons and lingerie pictures, which pretty much makes my life
complete.

NEW NOTES, DOMINO DELAYED AGAIN, LOTUS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Release of the new version of Lotus Development Corp.'s flagship
Notes and Domino software has been delayed again because of bugs in
the product.
</P>
<P>
   The delay contradicts a pledge at last month's Lotusphere trade
show, where Lotus CEO Jeff Papows promised to have the software
ready this month. Instead, the product, called Version R5, won't
ship until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has resulted from the realization that there were more bugs
to fix,'' said Lotus spokesman Paul Labelle. Trial versions of
Version R5 have been distributed to thousands of corporate computer
administrators, said Labelle, and they found some unexpected
problems which must be repaired before shipping. Labelle said that
Notes and Domino should achieve ``virtual zero bug status'' next
week, meaning it should be free of all serious bugs. It will then
take several more weeks to produce copies for shipment to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Version R5 of Notes and Domino are seen as vital for the future
of Lotus, a Cambridge, Mass. subsidiary of IBM Corp. Notes and
Domino are the leading brands of ``groupware,'' software that runs
on powerful server computers to help large groups of workers
collaborate on projects. Rival software company Microsoft Corp. has
launched an aggressive campaign to win this market with its own
groupware product, called Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said for delaying the release just to
ensure a better-performing product,'' said Mike Comiskey,
collaborative computing analyst at International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass.. ``I don't think that's going to be that
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But some customers aren't pleased. Rushi Shah, system
administrator for a nonprofit agency in McLean, Va., thinks Lotus
knew all along that the product would be late, and should have told
customers sooner. ``All this could have been avoided if they'd just
said it's going to be out at the end of March,'' said Shah. ``I've
got a server that's on order and it's going to be sitting there for
a month doing nothing.''

THE ART OF WAYFARERS GOES CHIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geometrically carved, layered, wood accessories and furnishings,
called Tramp Art, have gained in value since they were made between
1870 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
   These whittled one-of-a-kind wooden objects, often made from
inexpensive cigar boxes or orange-crates, were sometimes the
decorative works of immigrant artisans from Europe who used them to
barter for food and/or shelter as they traveled from town to town.
</P>
<P>
   The construction was humble, sometimes created by those with no
artistic skills. Wooden strips were notched out into a series of
geometric shapes with a pocket knife and applied layer upon layer
with tiny nails, or glue when available, until an eye-catching
design was created.
</P>
<P>
   Some were grooved together, without nails or glue. This
technique was used to create small pieces of furniture, such as
plant stands, chests, clock cases, birdhouses, dollhouses, mirrors,
jewelry boxes, frames and boxes. Many of the pieces were coated
with a dark stain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the larger pieces took several months or even years to
notch and construct. Because of this, most of the pieces that are
considered to be authentic Tramp Art today may put to rest the
notion that this craft was only practiced by drifters and hobos.
</P>
<P>
   Tramp Art was not always made from scrap wood. In some cases
items were ornamented with other salvaged materials, such as broken
pieces of glass, mirror and tacks.
</P>
<P>
   Tramp Art is considered a worthy form of Folk Art today and in
demand by collectors. It can be found at flea markets, antiques
shops, estate and yard sales. Depending of the size, condition,
intricacy and uniqueness of the object, authentic Tramp Art pieces
can cost anywhere from $100 to more than $1,000, particularly
pieces that are signed and dated.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent contemporary examples of Tramp Art can also be
purchased or commissioned today.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year-old Hermitage des Artistes in Troy, N.Y., makes some
2,000 pieces of Tramp Art a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a product line and one-of-a-kind pieces to
commissions,'' said Andy Stutter, president of the company. ``Most
of our work is made from scrap wood and grape crates from local
supermarkets.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices begin at $20 for a 2-inch-by-4-inch frame to $500 for a
four-shelf bookcase. All of the pieces are wood and dowel
construction.

10-STEP APPROACH TO A PERFECT CRUISE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely does a week pass that I don't hear the question several
times: What do I recommend for a first cruise?
</P>
<P>
   While I've never been one to pass the buck, my standard response
is: What are your priorities? Every traveler has different
interests, and I can't assume that others share mine.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I don't have a favorite ship other than the SS
Shattuck, and it exists only in my dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It combines the pool and sun decks on Carnival's Fascination and
the Sun Princess; the spa aboard Celebrity's Galaxy; the
entertainment on Crystal Harmony; the staterooms on the Silver
Cloud and Americana; the formal dining on Crystal Symphony and the
Zenith; the casual dining on the Sun Princess; the dedicated
service and intimacy of Radisson Seven Seas' Song of Flower; the
friendliness on the River Explorer; and the convenience of the
Norwegian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   And during a 12-day sailing _ my idea of the perfect duration _
it takes me to Scotland's Orkney Islands, Alaska's Glacier Bay,
France's Bordeaux wine region and the Caribbean island of Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   But back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   One mistake some potential first-time cruisers make is to place
vacation options in broad categories _ i.e., land vs. sea. That's
what I did almost 20 years ago when I naively told a travel agent,
``Just book us on a cruise that doesn't cost too much. They're all
the same, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   I was fortunate. Royal Caribbean's Song of America whetted my
appetite for future sailings. Over time I've come to appreciate
that a Vancouver-to-Anchorage voyage aboard the Regal Princess and
a Miami-to-Nassau excursion on Carnival's Ecstasy are as different
as, say, Fredericksburg, Texas, and Walt Disney World. And each has
its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If I were starting anew, here is a 10-step approach I would take
in selecting and purchasing a first cruise:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1. Make an honest assessment of your vacation objectives (and
those of any traveling companions).
</P>
<P>
   What matters most? An intriguing itinerary? Professional
entertainment? Gourmet cuisine? Spas? Sun? Scenery? Service?
Companionship? Children's activities? Wheelchair-accessible
facilities? Adventure-oriented shore excursions? Shopping? A
stateroom with private balcony? Or with the lowest price? An
opportunity to don tuxedo or evening dress? Or sneakers and gym
shorts?
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some preconceived notions, most cruises today are
not designed for the ultra-rich or the sedentary. As the industry
continues its rapid expansion, competition with land resorts for
the vacation dollar is so intense that cruise lines offer a wide
range of enticements.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2. See a travel agent or contact cruise lines to obtain
brochures. But don't make an early commitment. And use brochure
prices only as a guide; as with purchasing a new car, almost nobody
pays the published rate. Instead, look at the pictures in the
brochures; what are the ages and attire of the passengers
portrayed? Are any kids shown? Read the text; beyond the flowery
descriptive phrases you'll gain perspective on the line's basic
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3. Visit a bookstore or library to peruse new guidebooks that
evaluate each ship's specific features. Especially recommended for
first-timers: ``The Unofficial Guide to Cruises'' (Macmillan, $18)
by Kay Showker and Bob Sehlinger; ``The Complete Idiot's Travel
Guide to Cruise Vacations'' (Alpha Books, $16.95) by Fran Wenograd
Golden; and ``Stern's Guide to the Cruise Vacation'' (Pelican,
$18.95) by Steven B. Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Other good information sources are Internet addresses on which
passengers write reviews of ships. Recommended sites include
America Online's Cruise Critic (available to America Online
subscribers); www.cruiseopinion.com; www.travelpage.com and
www.sealetter.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4. Look closely at advertisements in your local newspaper and
elsewhere, especially if price is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   _ 5. Talk with friends who have cruised. Were their expectations
met? Weigh their input with your awareness of their preferences as
compared with yours.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6. Match your preferred destination to the dates you can
travel. This is a good time of year to cruise through the Panama
Canal or to Mexico. Alaskan itineraries are usually offered late
May through September. Most European sailings are in summer and
early fall. The Caribbean is busy year-round (more so in winter),
but keep in mind the potential perils of hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7. Are you concerned about feeling confined aboard a ship
(fears that usually are quickly alleviated)? Do you get bored
easily? Enjoy tours that emphasize nature or adventure? If so,
consider an itinerary that includes a port call on most days.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8. In choosing a stateroom, don't get confused by price
structures. On many ships, the higher the deck, the higher the
price. And in some instances (when balconies or butler service is
included) this differential is justified. But on most vessels,
standard cabins are all but identical; you pay more only for the
``status'' of a higher deck. You'll often get the smoothest ride in
a less-pricey stateroom midship on a lower deck. (But don't fret
about seasickness; it's rarely a problem.)
</P>
<P>
   _ 9. In firming your budget, allow for extra expenses beyond the
basic fare. These include shore excursions, spa treatments,
cocktails and gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   _ 10. Once you are prepared to make a decision, shop around.
With few exceptions, travel agents offer the best bargains; many
lines sell exclusively through agencies. But you could conceivably
approach five agencies and receive five different fare quotes.
Based on the percentage of business an agency does with a cruise
line, it may offer lower rates or special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you already have a strong, positive relationship with a
local travel agent, visit or call several agencies. Compare not
just prices but the interest the agent shows in you. Make sure he
or she explains first- and second-seating meal options. Inquire
about cabin upgrades and on-board spending credits; these may be
unavailable, but it never hurts to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, be prepared to tell a travel agent exactly what
you want from a cruise. If you follow Steps 1 through 9 first, Step
10 will be easier.

COMPANY MAKES LIGHT OF YEAR 2000 BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company in Clifton Park, N.Y., called COBIS sells a set of
novelties that poke fun at Internet and computer paranoia related
to the year 2000 computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes five types of products, among them rubber
critters bearing cute and jokey names. The Bug Spray and Virus
Killer is actually an anti-static monitor cleaner, on the back of
which is the note, ``Unlike users, contents not under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an Analog Bug Eliminator, otherwise known as a
flyswatter, and a mouse pad. The 4-inch-long rubber bugs resemble a
spider and a scorpion (arachnids), as well as a fly (insect), with
names like Millie the Millennium Bug and Vinny the Internet Virus.
</P>
<P>
   Stick 'em to your computer or populate the desk. A complete set
costs $19.99, or $12.99 for a smaller collection. Order for your
favorite computer nerd by visiting http://www.bugoff2000.com or

   BOVINE BALM: A few years after horse shampoo became a hit among
humans, at least a certain subset of humans, here's information
that another product aimed at animals has crossed the species
boundary. This time it's Udderly Smooth, an udder cream from a
company called Redex.
</P>
<P>
   The directions on the back of the tube say ``Wash udder and teat
parts thoroughly. ... Apply to the udder after each milking,
massaging into the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The cream also apparently works well even if you don't have an
udder; our colleague says quilters of her acquaintance swear by
Udderly Smooth because it's utterly ungreasy. We tried it, and now
we can't keep our hands off our hands, so supple are they.
</P>
<P>
   The cream is available at stores such as Kmart, Wal-Mart and
Rite Aid, where it retails for $4 to $6 for 10 ounces.

   POP FICTION: Drink enough Diet Coke by the end of March and you
will be able to have read the first chapters of six new books.
Included for free in 12-packs of the soft drink will be booklets
containing the opening segments of Elmore Leonard's ``Be Cool'';
Maeve Binchy's ``Tara Road''; ``Chicken Soup for the Couple's
Soul,'' by Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen; Barbara Taylor
Bradford's ``A Sudden Change of Heart''; Nora Roberts' ``River's
End''; and, by Lisa Scottoline, ``Mistaken Identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are printing 45 million of the booklets, about 20
times more than the first print run of even the biggest
best-sellers, such as John Grisham's new one, ``The Testament.''
About 30 million people drink Diet Coke, split 60/40 between,
respectively, women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Those drinkers also, according to Coca-Cola, buy seven hardcover
books per year, compared to one or two for those with allegiance to
other brands.

QUAKE III: ID SOFTWARE HOPES TO SHAKE UP REALM OF SHOOTERS WITH
MULTIPLAYER MASS APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
 &HT;    MESQUITE, Texas _ From high above, you can spy your enemy
approaching through the fog.
 &HT;    He moves quickly, but through the red mist he is only a vague
outline. You can make out the spines on his back, so you know he
cannot be human.
 &HT;    You also know that he's hunting you just as intensely as you are
tracking him.
 &HT;    He pauses to peer through the fog. As you get him in the sights
of your plasma gun _ and you wonder consider whether if your rocket
launcher might not be more effective _ you can hear the sounds of
other battles, in other rooms. There are explosions, grunts of
pain, even screams.
 &HT;    You're about to pull the trigger, adding another kill to your
count, when you hear footsteps from behind. You try to turn, but
it's too late.
 &HT;    Someone gives you a quick push and suddenly you are
somersaulting through open space, past the bridge, where your enemy
stands and watches you fall through the fog.
 &HT;    You plummet into nothingness. All you see is blackness and now
the screams you hear, well, they are your own.
 &HT;    But don't worry. Click your left mouse button, and you're back
in the game.
 &HT;     
QUAKE III: ARENA &HT;    The game is Quake III Arena from id Software, and it's the next
iteration in the kill-it-if-it-moves genre of first-person
shooters.
 &HT;    But there's a big difference between this title, due about
midyear, and the previous computer games that have borne the Quake
name. There will be no slavering monsters to kill, no endangered
worlds for individual players to save _ the hallmarks that have
characterized id's games since its early titles, such as
Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.
 &HT;    Instead, id is creating a game that focuses on what's known as
death-match play, in which the only fiend a player stalks is
another player, usually connected via the Internet. Doom, Quake and
Quake II _ along with a host of imitators _ all have this
multiplayer capability, but until now it's been secondary to the
single-player part of those games.
 &HT;    ``We think that ultimately, the most addictive form of game play
is death-match,'' said Todd Hollenshead, the chief executive at id.
``But, I believe that the majority of our customers have yet to
play death-match. The majority have never gotten online.''
 &HT;    Quake III Arena is a calculated risk for id, but not by much.
Game experts say that although the numbers of dedicated death-match
players are relatively few, it's this multiplayer aspect that keeps
id's titles on gamers' hard drives longer than most other games.
 &HT;    ``Anyone who still plays Quake II is not playing the
single-player game; they're playing death-match,'' said Gary
Whitta, editor in chief of PC Gamer magazine.
 &HT;    With Quake III Arena, the company hopes to create a breakthrough
title that entices a whole new audience to get online and play.
 &HT;    ``When you play against other people, it's like a different game
every time,'' said Whitta.
 &HT;    The new game will take advantage of several developments in the
home personal computer market:
 &HT;    _ More powerful video cards. Most personal computers sold in the
last 18 months have graphics cards with the ability to accelerate
3-D images, which Quake III Arena will require. The market also is
flooded with aftermarket add-on and replacement cards.
 &HT;    _ More people using the Internet. Online usage continues to grow
exponentially, and the No. 1 reason given for home PC purchases is
to connect to the Internet.
 &HT;    _ A move toward home networking. With the dramatic drop in PC
prices, many homes how have two or three machines, and their owners
are starting to link them into home networks.
 &HT;    _ Growing awareness of multiplayer gaming. Most games sold today
have multiplayer capabilities. Sometimes that features Internet
play, though occasionally it is confined to a computer network.
Game owners are used to seeing multiplay touted on the box, even
though they may have never tried it.
 &HT;    Quake III Arena will include features aimed at both veteran
death-match players, as well as those who've never tried playing
online. Newcomers will be able to hone their death-match skills
against computer-generated opponents _ called ``bots,'' as in
software robots _ that will have varying degrees of skill.
 &HT;    This will be the primary single-player aspect of the game.
Players can progress through ever-tougher opponents until they've
beaten the best of the bots. Hollenshead likens it to games such as
Mortal Kombat.
 &HT;    Once novices feel comfortable with death-match play, they'll be
able to use a simple Web page to find a server on which to compete
against others. Click on the server of choice, and the game
automatically launches and connects.
 &HT;    ``Our goal is three clicks, and you're online,'' said John
Carmack, the lead programmer on the game and one of id's
co-founders.
 &HT;    Carmack, working with fellow programmers John Cash and Brian
Hook, designed and programmed the game's engine, which controls the
overall look and behavior of the game. Designers Christian Antkow,
Tim Willits, Paul Jaquays and Brandon James built the levels in
which players wander. Paul Steed built and animated the models _
weapons, power-ups and players _ that populate the game. Artists
Adrian Carmack (no relation to John), Kevin Cloud and Kenneth Scott
designed the characters and created textures that are used to give
them a realistic look.
 &HT;    John Carmack, who is considered the best 3-D games programmer in
the world, has given Quake III Arena a new look.
 &HT;    The game is now capable of displaying curved surfaces, something
not possible in the previous Quake titles. As a result, Quake III
Arena is full of arched doorways, curving hallways, bridges and
circular windows.
 &HT;    The program also is better at displaying the textures that cover
surfaces, so they don't turn into a mishmash of pixels when viewed
up close.
 &HT;    The onscreen representations of players _ called player models _
are much more realistic. Rather than the cartoon-like characters in
Quake II, the models in Quake III Arena look almost like moving,
3-D photographs of real people. In fact, many of id's employees
have had their images digitized, and players may be able to pick
from ``skins'' that make them look like John Carmack, Steed or
Willits. The models also have an expanded number of moves. They can
nod their heads, bow from the waist and even do backflips.
 &HT;    The game also will have fog effects that can be controlled by
the designers of each level. For example, fog can be tinted a
color, can be a certain height and have variable thickness. This
adds a new strategy to the game because players can now use the fog
to hide, then pop up and start blasting away.
 &HT;    There are other graphic tricks, such as reflective surfaces and
even mirrors that move. One level features a maze with a mirrored
ceiling, allowing players a view of their opponents' location.
Walls pulsate, as though they were living.
 &HT;    But veteran players will recognize that this is definitely a
game from the Quake lineage. As with Quakes I and II, it's dark and
violent. The action is fast and furious. When players shoot each
other with a variety of weapons _ a shotgun, Gatling gun, rocket
launcher, even a railgun that fires plutonium slugs _ their
opponents don't just fall over. They explode into flying chunks of
pixellated flesh known as ``gibs'' _ as in giblets.
 &HT;     
 &HT;    As with Quakes I and II, anyone will be able to set up and run a
Quake III Arena server on the Internet. And id will once again
publish enough information about the game so that amateurs can
build their own levels.
 &HT;    The decision to do a game that focuses on multiplayer
competition came at a time when id had finished Quake II and was
looking for its next project. Like a rock star who only puts out an
album every couple of years or so, id does one game at a time,
working slowly and methodically. It then licenses its technology to
other companies, gaining revenues from sales of its own titles
along with those of others.
 &HT;    ``Originally, we were going to do a true sequel to Quake II _
the press release had even gone out,'' said Hollenshead. But at a
meeting to determine the company's next direction, the idea of a
multiplayer-focused game arose and captured imaginations.
 &HT;    ``Instead of concentrating on a story line, we said, `What if we
focused on game play, on the death-match game, the thing that gives
our games longevity?''' Hollenshead said.
 &HT;    Carmack said the decision made designing the game easier. Rather
than concentrating on what amounts to two different games _
single-player and multiplayer _ the id staff was able to focus on
just one component.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of duplicate code in there. If it's a
single-player game, do this; if it's a multiplayer game, do that,''
Carmack said.
 &HT;    Even though Quake III Arena is not due out until mid-year, the
game already is stable.
 &HT;    ``We could ship this today if we wanted to _ it's been playable
for months,'' said model designer Steed. ``We're just polishing and
polishing. We want to get it right.''
 &HT;    Tiny id _ only 14 people work at its offices in this northeast
Dallas suburb _ made its initial multiplayer game with Doom in
1993. The title, now considered a milestone in the PC game
industry, featured a lone space marine doing battle on a Martian
moon against creatures from Hell.
 &HT;    The single-player game, with its three-dimensional graphics,
realistic sound and lightning-quick gameplay, was impressive enough
to make it an instant best seller.
 &HT;    But the game made national news soon after its release because
college students were playing death-match Doom across campus
networks. A bug in the code caused some networks to bog down
dramatically, and as a result the game was banned at some
universities and businesses.
 &HT;    With Doom, death-match could only be played on a local area
network, or one-on-one via a modem connection. A company in
Houston, Dwango, figured out how to simulate a network, letting
players use modems to connect to file servers.
 &HT;    With its next game, Quake, id expanded the multiplayer
abilities. Like Doom, the single-player story featured a lone hero
battling a horde of monsters _ this time in a dimension that was a
strange mix of medieval and science-fiction themes _ with more
intricate graphics and a true 3-D perspective. Players had a
360-degree, free-motion view of the dark, dank and dangerous world
that id had created.
 &HT;    But the multiplayer part of the game added a new wrinkle _ play
over the Internet. No longer did players need a local area network
to play death-match with more than two people, because anyone who
had a copy of the game could set up his or her own server on the
Internet. Others could then sign on to the server to play _ for
free.
 &HT;    This aspect, along with the fact that id openly published the
design specifications for Quake _ allowing anyone to make new
levels for the game _ created an explosion of growth in an online
community that had already coalesced around Doom.
 &HT;    Fans of Quake used the World Wide Web to spread news about the
game, find opponents and propagate home-brew levels. Sites such as
Stomped (www.stomped.com), PlanetQuake (www.planetquake.com) and
Blue's News (www.bluesnews.com) quickly evolved from hobbies into
serious businesses. Jupiter Communications, a New York-based market
research firm, estimates game-related Web sites will earn more than
$58 million in ad revenues this year, and as much as $464 million
by 2002.
 &HT;    The game also allowed for group play. Almost immediately teams
formed _ calling themselves Quake ``clans'' and using the Web to
challenge each other.
 &HT;    But playing over the Internet required a level of computer
knowledge that the casual home PC user didn't possess. Those who
wanted to jump onto Quake servers had to find them first.
Quake-related Web sites offered lists of servers, but many who
bought the game weren't even aware that the sites existed.
 &HT;    In late 1997, id released Quake II, with even better graphics
and more advanced 3-D physics. It further improved on death-match
play by allowing players to keep a list of favorite servers in an
address book. But still, the game did not offer much help in
finding them.
 &HT;    The number of people playing Quake death-match games in their
various forms is hard to pin down. John Carmack said most market
research firms estimate there are around 50,000 dedicated players.
 &HT;    ``We think that's a low estimate,'' Carmack said. ``We think
there are a couple hundred thousand playing, and that's without any
direct pointers to the servers that are out there.''
 &HT;    Estimates of player numbers are hard to come by, but Jupiter
believes that consumer spending on online gaming will reach $110
million this year and rise to $622 million by 2002.
 &HT;    Fans of id's games will get their first taste of Quake III when
a technology test is released on the Internet in March. Tentatively
dubbed Q3Test, it will be used to test the game's networking
capabilities. As bugs are found and problems arise, the software
will be updated.
 &HT;    Shortly afterward, a larger demo version will be released, and
that will be followed by the full game, available for computers
running the Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems.
 &HT;    When it ships, Quake III Arena will not be the only game on the
shelves with a multiplayer emphasis.
 &HT;    _ Shortly after id announced Quake III Arena, Epic Megagames
said it would do a similar follow-up to its best-selling 3-D
shooter, Unreal. That game, Unreal Tournament, could ship as early
as this spring.
 &HT;    _ Valve Software is working on a version of its hit Half-Life
game called Team Fortress 2. The game takes its name from an
amateur-designed modification for Quake I called Team Fortress, in
which teams defend and attack each other's castles.
 &HT;    _ StarSiege Tribes from the Dynamix division of Sierra On-Line
is a multiplayer-only title in which teams or tribes defend their
land against invaders.
 &HT;    _ Ultima Online, an online-only version of the popular series of
role-playing games from Austin-based Origin, is now in its third
year and an update, The Second Age, was recently released.
 &HT;    Even if Quake III Arena's death-match focus means it doesn't
sell as much as Quake I or II, that's fine with id. Hollenshead
estimated that, because the company is so small, it need sell only
10,000 copies to break even.
 &HT;    By contrast, Quake II has just gone over the 1 million-copy
sales mark.
 &HT;    ``My expected-case scenario is that it will not sell as well as
Quake II, but maybe about 70 to 75 percent of what Quake II sold,''
Carmack said.
 &HT;    If it does flop, id likely will go back to making single-player
titles.
 &HT;    ``We've been toying with the name `Doom 2000,''' said
Hollenshead. ``What do you think?''

 &HT;    ONCE-RAUCOUS GAME MAKER TONES DOWN CORPORATE CULTURE
 &HT;    By DWIGHT SILVERMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ In 1994, id Software's office in this suburb
northeast of Dallas was not a place for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, the game company's employees and owners would
fire up the latest version of Doom for a game of death-match,
supposedly to test the latest round of code. In the heat of virtual
battle, they'd scream epithets that would make a sailor blush.
</P>
<P>
   A large open space had room for pool and ping-pong tables. Level
designers' stereos blared heavy metal music. And co-founder John
Romero's door had a hole hacked in it, the result of an encounter
with a medieval battle-ax.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, a work space only twenty-something computer
game developers could love.
</P>
<P>
   Today, id Software still occupies the same offices _ though
they've expanded to take up more of the sixth floor in the Town
East Tower office building _ but it's a different environment.
</P>
<P>
   The offices where its employees work are almost hushed. Gone are
the pool and ping-pong tables, replaced by a set of free weights
and a boxer's punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor can still hear music, but it's muted.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's time for a round of death-match to test the
upcoming Quake III Arena, there's a lot less profanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's just grown up,'' said Katherine Anna Kang,
id's director of business development and an ace death-match
player.
</P>
<P>
   The company's corporate culture now mirrors the personality of
John Carmack, the genius 3-D programmer who co-founded id and who
remains the soul of its creative efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After Quake I was completed in 1996, id saw an exodus of some of
its original team, including co-founders Romero and Jay Wilbur, the
company's original ``Biz Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero, known as much for his waist-length hair and rock-star
style as for his ability to design killer game levels, left the
company after Quake was released. He now co-owns Ion Storm, a
Dallas game company that aggressively seeks publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, Romero had the most powerful personality in the
company, and id was viewed by the public through Romero's
persona,'' said Todd Hollenshead, id's chief executive and Wilbur's
replacement. ``But John Carmack is not that sort of a person. When
the people changed, the dominating personalities changed. As a
result, id became more reserved, and that took over the apparent
culture of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, where the old id sought publicity, the company now
avoids it. In-person interviews are rarely granted, photographers
are seldom allowed in id's offices and Carmack doesn't release his
photo for publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one here is interested is being the poster boy for the
company,'' said Carmack, adding that he intensely dislikes what's
necessary to promote a game. He concedes that getting out in front
of the public is going to be more important with Quake III Arena,
because it represents a departure from id's past titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish this was the kind of a world where I just do my
work, we'd put out the game and everyone would just get it,'' he
said.

T-SHIRTS ARE A SURE FIT WITH NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. DOWD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you want to design your own T-shirt, mouse
pad, apron, drink coasters, or anything else with a special name,
logo, photograph, type face, color and so on, there is a computer
program that can help.
</P>
<P>
   Hanes T-Shirt Maker 2.0 seems like an ideal tool to accomplish
just about any T-shirt project. Apple users and some PC users are
left out, however. This version of the software program was
designed to work only with Windows 95 and 98.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.0 version (with a suggested retail price of $49.95) works
in a very simple way, using a combination of items in the software
package and some artwork imported from your own files.
</P>
<P>
   To create designs, you select the product you want it to appear
on _ T-shirt, apron, mouse pad, tote bag, pennant, cloth portfolio
and so on _ and work through a series of type faces, colors and
images offered by the program. You can import your own photos and
logos or other artwork rather than use the Hanes library of images,
or play mix and match.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible to foul up the creative process. The
program guides you step by step, and you can't go in the wrong
order or place things in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   You can view the finished product on the screen, make any
modifications you want, then print out a color proof on regular
printer paper. Or, you can go directly to the special transfer
paper that comes with the program. That transfer paper is used to
iron the image onto whatever product it is you're creating.
</P>
<P>
   Replacement packs of paper are available at most computer,
office supply and art stores. Once you get the hang of proper
placement of text and graphics, you can alter the placement of the
printed image: that is, you can shift the print image in different
directions, which can be helpful depending on the size, shape and
detail of the object on which you're going to finally place your
design.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an older version of the program and want to use
designs made with it in the new version, you can do so by
purchasing an Expansion Pack that will convert your old files to
2.0. Then you no longer can use them in a 1.x version unless you've
saved a copy of the original. Transfer paper can be used just once,
but you can maximize efficiency nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hanes folks note, ``During the ironing process, the ink
and the transfer film separate from the paper backing and stick to
the fabric. So you can only make one full-size transfer per page.
However, if you are making small designs, you can design them on
the same page. Then you can print all the designs onto a single
sheet of transfer paper and cut around each one.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want larger versions of your designs than you can print
at home, Hanes offers a ``Made To Order'' service from Austin-James
custom apparel manufacturing. You upload the design file to company
by Internet and receive the finished garment or embellishable gift
back by mail or overnight express.
</P>
<P>
   Hanes has wisely found as way to keep making its product useful.
It offers a forum for users to post questions, answers and
suggestions about how to use the product. Some people have found
ingenious ways to turn the hobby into a small business. Some have
found interesting artwork to accommodate interests the built-in
Hanes art library does not address. Others simply like telling
people how they use the product, and thus spur a little more
creativity among the pool of users.

DUKE CUTS LOOSE WITH CLASSY COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Kevan Hall of Halston and Randolph Duke,
formerly of Halston, showing their fashions a day apart, there was
a little compare-and-contrast exercise going on.
</P>
<P>
   Was Duke the brains behind the Halston brand's revival or was it
his design assistant, Hall? What would Duke do if he didn't have to
cleave to the Halston tradition? And could Kevan Hall design within
the Halston structure of super-linear, architectural shapes and a
minimum of glitz and still be original?
</P>
<P>
   All was revealed as Duke paraded a succession of tall,
pony-tailed models down the catwalk in an amazing array of
extravagant dresses, skirts and sweaters in both cashmere and
mohair, and proved, once and for all, that his design talent is not
a fluke. Freed from the Halston strictures, Duke created a
collection for the modern woman, not necessarily a glamour queen,
who wants to look special, classy and classic.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the sportswear direction of about a fourth of the
clothes, particularly the ``ice'' cashmere fleece skirt paired with
a flashy pave silver T-shirt worn with a mink-lined, double-faced
satin parka. Your basic vavoom without having to work too hard.
(And that was the just first ensemble!)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the collections, designers have been using knits like
cashmere and mohair in unusual places. Duke's extravagantly beaded
mohair and cashmere gowns, done up in tones of hematite or ivory,
were spectacular. So were the gauzy, cloud-like mohair sweaters
over satin-faced organza skirts and beaded tulle tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Cinematic Siren stuff that gets Duke on the front
pages of celebrity mags: Look out, Minnie Driver. Your stylist is
going to have a field day with Duke! Especially if you like a
little fur garnish, which Driver sported at last year's Oscars in
her red Halston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dress'' in this collection? A Prussian blue tulle dance
dress sparkled with a psychedelic pattern of pailettes, modeled by
Kimora, rap impresario Russell Simmons' wife. Come Oscar time, it
will be photographed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kevan Hall's second full collection for Halston was
hit and miss, although when he stuck to the formula _ clothes that
worship the body _ he scored. The sportswear/daywear in suede and
cashmere that opened the show was major and dramatic, particularly
a long, brown suede skirt sprinkled with studs in vertical lines,
worn with a black cowl-necked cashmere top. Hall is still doing
slip dresses, which are beginning to outlive their usefulness,
although women are as reluctant to give them up as they were their
Alexis-Carrington-on-``Dallas'' shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   But the prettiest clothes were the entrance-making gowns like
the signature columns of pailettes, which look like molten metal
with movement; the floaty chiffons, (one with a mink bodice in
copper will be very popular) or the ombre velvets, where amazing
colors have been dyed together on fabrics that move sensually and
change tonality in the light. Preferably candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   Hall turned out a group of ombres in shades of green or opal.
His piece de resistance was a garnet velvet column dress worn under
a huge and stagy opera coat trimmed with a massive self-dyed fox
collar and cuffs.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opera and symphony mob will also have a field day with the
rest of the designers who specialize in evening clothes. And,
happily to say, glamour does come in all price points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Badgley Mischka _ The Bead Boys are branching out into
full-skirted opera gowns with beaded bodices that are far less
``body-iest'' than their patented slip dresses. And it's about
time.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the collection is typically B-M with mysterious,
undefinable colors; body-loving velvets that have been cut a little
more generously and fall away from the body instead of strangling
it; exquisite bead and embroideries done in India that are almost
works of art.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carmen Marc Valvo _ If you can't see your way clear to shell
out the six grand that Duke or Halston cost, set your sights a
little lower (under $2,000) and opt for Valvo's high-voltage
glitter gowns. They're a lot of plastique for your pennies. Valvo
showed sparkled-up mohair or cashmere shells and sweaters with
satin skirts like an incredible Irish fisherman's tunic in mocha
with a matching satin skirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood goddess glitter dresses were sumptuous. A number
of them were slips in computer-generated bead patterns with solid
silver chain straps, or gunmetal ``Jackson Pollack'' lace patterns,
again with metal chain-link straps.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite gowns, however, were sexy black velvets, one a bias
pane, off-the-shoulder gown with a deep, face-framing decolletage
and the other was a sterling silver pane velvet set with glass and
Swarovski crystals that looked like liquid silver. Valvo is just
getting better and better all the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donald Deal _ Count on Deal to come though with great MOB
(Mother of the Bride) stuff. You know: conservative, always
lady-like, proper, and not too exciting.
</P>
<P>
   With this new fall collection, Deal has gone for shape, color
and fullness, particularly with a selection of full- skirted
entrance-makers that are not only quite regal, but girlish and
quite pretty. My favorite: A navy, silk taffeta ball gown with a
huge skirt, with Jackson Pollack-like splatters of abstract color
around the hem and a velvet tank top.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vera Wang _ Her fall palette is greens, browns and wheaten
gold and the clothes are, in a word, quite a departure from her
architectural and exacting wedding gowns. There are unfinished
tulle hems and selvages; fur like broadtail and squirrel, the
latter worked up into a T-shirt with a hem so chopped up, it looked
like something larger than a squirrel had been chewing on it.
</P>
<P>
   Beading is held to a minimum and usually tracing the numerous
images of palm leaves. Her major pattern: An Asian-themed print of
pagodas and other Eastern images. Very strange.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marian Clayden _ She is known for her sumptuous fabrics and
this collection is not disappointing, particularly in the Egyptian
hieroglyphic burn-out black on black velvet in three-quarter
jackets and cocoon and slouch coats worn over camis and satin
pants.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was small, but mighty, with Clayden's timeless
designs _ fashions that harken back to Clayden's hippie roots.

HOW TO GET KINDER, SIMPLER OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent column on the hazards and frustrations of using
programs that run in the background in Windows 95/98 struck a
nerve. I was flooded with e-mail from readers who either had
experienced problems firsthand, or who now had suspects to blame
for some of their woes.
</P>
<P>
   The column looked at the tradeoffs of using utility programs
that work in the background in Windows, including virus scanners,
crash protectors and installation monitors. I ran Symantec's System
Works _ which includes all these things _ for about a month, then
turned off the background components for another month. The result
was a faster, more stable system without all the bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma, of course, is that if you shut down these
components, you don't get their benefits. If you sacrifice the use
of a background virus scanner for the sake of improved performance
and fewer software conflicts, you must be willing to manually scan
all programs and some documents that are introduced on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to the Symantec products. Every
virus checker comes with an in-the-background component. And most
personal computers sold at retail are loaded down with background
components that do everything from controlling special keyboard
buttons to looking for patches and updates via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SACRIFICE BACKGROUND PROGRAMS
</P>
<P>
   Many readers appreciated my comments, but had an additional
question: ``So, um ... how exactly do I identify and disable these
things?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's no easy answer here. Each program handles
it differently. But there are some general places you can look and
strategies you can employ.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a feel for how much is running in the background by
doing a ``three-fingered salute'' _ hold down the Control, Alt and
Delete keys at the same time. This will bring up a box that will
show you just what's running on your system. The identity of some
entries, such as Explorer, will be obvious. Others, such as systray
(or system tray, the area on the taskbar that contains the clock),
will not be so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on the End Task button here will abruptly shut down the
program you've highlighted. However, the program will come right
back the next time you start your computer. What you need to do is
figure out which programs you don't want to run at start-up and
configure them so they do not.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's time for a very important caveat: If you don't know
what something is, don't mess with it. Every time you turn off a
background application, you are losing some functions, and shutting
down the wrong thing could be irritating at best and disastrous at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CAN'T GO WRONG WITH RESEARCH
</P>
<P>
   First, read any manuals or help files you may have for the kind
of programs that might have background components. The manuals will
discuss the software's different components and how to configure
them. Usually this will be through some kind of configuration
utility or control panel you can access through a program's primary
component. Find these main components under Start/Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Next, look in the Windows 95/98 system tray. The tray is the
area to the far right of the taskbar _ it typically includes the
clock and some icons, such as a speaker. Many background programs
place an icon in the tray. First, try right-clicking on it. You're
likely to get a menu, or a control panel might launch.
Double-clicking it also may bring up a control panel.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Norton AntiVirus 5.0, right-clicking on its tray
icon brings up a menu that includes the items ``Disable
Auto-Protect'' and ``Configure Norton AntiVirus.'' Clicking on the
former will disable its background activities, but it will remain
loaded and in system memory. If you choose the latter, you will get
a control panel that lets you completely unload Auto-Protect, and
it won't launch the next time you start your computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you use McAfee VirusScan 4.0, right-clicking on its tray icon
also will bring up either a menu that lets you disable or enable
different components, or a full control panel that lets you unload
the module altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs are even easier to prevent from loading when a PC
boots up. They launch by putting an icon in the Startup folder, and
preventing this is as simple as moving the icon out of the folder.
</P>
<P>
   To see what's in Startup, right-click on the Start button and
choose Explore from the menu that appears. Open the Programs
folder, then go to the Startup folder and look inside. Some
examples: if you have Microsoft Office, you'll find some icons
there that speed up its launch time; if you've got Norton
Utilities, the System Doctor places an icon here.
</P>
<P>
   Create a new folder on your desktop (right-click on the desktop,
choose New, the Folder) and name it ``From Startup.'' Drag the
icons of the programs you don't want to launch from the Startup
folder and onto this new folder. Restart your computer, and the
programs won't be running. If you want to run them manually, launch
them from the new folder on your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Some older programs may launch background components using a
line in the WIN.INI file, a legacy from the old MS-DOS/Windows 3.1
days. You can check here by using Sysedit, a configuration file
editing utility. Click Start, then enter sysedit and click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Find the WIN.INI file and look for a line that starts either
LOAD or RUN. If there is a program here you don't want to run at
start- &QL; 
up, place your cursor in front of the filename, hit the Enter key,
then place a semicolon in front of the filename on its own line.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs are harder to track down. They launch via the
Windows Registry, the big database of settings in Windows 95/98. If
you have Windows 98, you're in luck _ it has a nifty feature called
the System Configuration Utility that lets you turn on and off
anything that runs at start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Click Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools, then System
Information. Go to the Tools menu item and click on System
Configuration Utility, then click the Startup tab.
</P>

   From here, turning components on and off is a matter of clicking
a check box. You also can use the System Configuration Utility to
edit WIN.INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT and other configuration files. To me,
this application alone is worth the price of upgrading to Windows
98.

<P>
   Again, let me emphasize that if you are unsure about making any
of these changes, then don't make them. There's no sense killing or
maiming your computer in a neurotic hunt for any and all background
applications.

GAY WARNING LABELS: JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What a drag it is being gay on television. Not
only can you not have sex, or kiss without a month's worth of hype
preceding it, you can't wear purple and you have to be wary of
purses and triangles.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of religious zealots wants ``gay warning labels'' on
television shows. Apparently the hieroglyphics boom from a year ago
_ the V, S, L, D and MA thing, not to mention FV for fantasy
violence on shows for children _ just wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now we need a G, for gay. Or maybe SG, for super gay, if someone
is clearly over the top.
</P>
<P>
   This idea comes from the Christian Action Network which, on the
surface, sounds like one of those must-carry channels you never
watch. It is based in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Action Network isn't really a channel on digital
cable, it's a pack of people out to protect us all from gays and
their influence on television. Of course, if you're a fan of
``Ellen'' you may be thinking that the bottom-line minefield of
network television has already done enough weeding out, thank you
very much.
</P>
<P>
   If CAN _ the acronym the organization likes _ wants gay warning
labels, let's at least open the floor to some other suggestions,
such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ HP: Hackneyed plot. With this in place, we never would have
had to suffer through ``Murder, She Wrote.'' Not to mention most
made-for-TV movies, particularly those in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   _ WN!: Wacky neighbor. The ubiquitous sitcom guest is not always
a bad thing, even if they never knock. Lenny, Squiggy, Kramer _ all
good. But much of the time this is a lazy cast concept and we
should be told if one's coming.
</P>
<P>
   _ MFF: Moralizing father figure. A TV staple from the ``Father
Knows Best'' and ``My Three Sons'' glory days right through
``Cosby,'' ``Home Improvement'' and ``7th Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   _ NRA: Nebulous religious angels. ``Touched by an Angel,''
``Promised Land'' and anything on Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   _ GT: Groin thwack. For those of us who find a great deal of
enjoyment from ``inadvertent'' shots to the groin, such as those
seen on ``America's Funniest Home Videos''; this could be a real
ratings plus.
</P>
<P>
   _ BP: Bad premise. Sometimes a show can be good but you just
can't get past the idea of it. Like ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place'' or ``Early Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MNL: May not last. Perfect for a show like ``EZ Streets'' or
``Cupid,'' ``Profit,'' ``My So Called Life'' _ an endless list,
really. This stops viewers from getting involved and then being
disappointed later.
</P>
<P>
   _ ABOWPSAT: A bunch of white people sitting around talking. For
those who would rather not encounter the people from ``Friends,''
``Seinfeld'' or ``Felicity,'' this would be a valuable service.
</P>
<P>
   _ SD: Sweetheart deal. This alerts those people who don't read
industry trade magazines to bad ideas, like when a network gives
the green light to a show _ sight unseen _ from people who have
delivered hits in the past. This way viewers would know why
``Jesse,'' ``Encore! Encore!'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' got on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   _ CNM: Cheesy news magazine. Very important for people who are
channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   _ MSRP: Money-saving reality program. ``World's scariest''
anything qualifies, as do home videos from neighbors and the local
police department. Of course, it could be MSRP/GT _ if someone's
groin is injured.
</P>
<P>
   _ ISC: Illogical sweeps cameo. We've all seen it. The celebrity
guest in February or May who has nothing to do with the show and
only hinders the ongoing plot for quick ratings.
</P>
<P>
   _ TD: Tony Danza. Absolutely mandatory. We should be warned!
</P>
<P>
   _ ARD: Angst-riddled drama. Fairly essential for the likes of
``L.A. Doctors,'' ``Party of Five,'' ``ER,'' ``Chicago Hope,''
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ GEC: Gratuitous eye candy. We're going to see this a lot. A
staple of shows like ``Melrose Place,'' ``Ally McBeal,''
``Charmed,'' ``Magnificent Seven,'' ``Pacific Blue,'' ``NYPD
Blue,'' and others where low-cut blouses, men without shirts and
butt shots are the norm. Whoops, forgot ``Providence.'' How many
times can they show that doctor in her underwear?
</P>
<P>
   _ ORS: Obvious racial stereotypes. Sure, this will pop up a lot
for African-American shows on the WB and UPN, but let's not forget
the Irish and Italians _ TV's favorite ethnic whipping posts _ and
all those bad Asian accents across the dial.
</P>
<P>
   _ WAPOD: Wild animals procreating or dying. How many times have
you been sucked into some nature or pet show only to find the bunny
gets eaten by a lion, or two sea lions are in nauseating heat?
</P>
<P>
   _ CC: Cop cliches. This one's too tiring.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the start, of course. Why stop with warning labels
for gay content?
</P>

THE UNSINKABLE ELIZABETH TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Liz Taylor before her 1997 birthday party
and a black-and-white print of the actress in ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's one of the most famous women in the world, and on Feb. 27
she'll turn 67. She's lived virtually her whole life in the
spotlight, in a dog-eat-dog world where cynics abound.
 &HT;    Yet, her current boyfriend says, ``I'm amazed that for a person
who has been out there since she was 9 years old, she's so trusting
and naive _ in the best sense of the word.''
 &HT;    Oscar-winning actor Rod Steiger is talking about his friend
Elizabeth Taylor, and he insists that _ despite her much-chronicled
trials and tribulations, her many husbands and consorts, her
numerous health crises, the acres of newsprint devoted to her
so-called scandals _ ``She has not become a hardened person.''
 &HT;    The couple have become close friends, dodging the paparazzi to
slip away for a quiet lunch each week.
 &HT;    Their relationship began, Steiger says, when he met her to
discuss a film script and was stunned to discover that, except for
AIDS fundraisers, she hadn't been out to lunch in two years.
 &HT;    Despite the gossip columns, however, the actor insists that he
and the much-wed Taylor are not contemplating marriage.
 &HT;    ``Some of the papers have played it up as heavy romance,'' he
says. ``I have a great deal of respect for her and her courage.
We've both had a lot of pain _ we are sympatico.''
 &HT;    So much so in fact that, in her late 60s, Taylor is going back
to work to star opposite Steiger in a modestly budgeted movie
entitled ``Somewhere,'' which Steiger will direct.
 &HT;    The actor calls it, ``a little picture about Dorothy later in
life, wanting to go back to Oz at the age of 60.''
 &HT;    At 67, Taylor is bouncing back from her most recent back
problems and minor sinus surgery. At last count she has had more
than 30 major surgeries.
 &HT;    ``Elizabeth uses hospitals the way other people use resorts,''
her second husband, Michael Wilding, once said _ and that was when
she was still in her 20s.
 &HT;    Today Taylor is looking well again. She stays actively involved
with her AIDS charity work, and continues her efforts to promote
her signature White Diamonds and Passion perfumes.
 &HT;    Her seesaw life continues to captivate the world. One week she's
fat, the next week she's thin. One week she's glamorous in diamonds
and designer duds, the next she's in an ambulance being rushed to a
hospital. One minute she's giving an impassioned speech about AIDS,
the next she's flashing her $4 million diamond ring as if she'd
never had a serious thought in her life.
 &HT;    Taylor has made her whole life a study in how not to mature.
When she hit 60 she invited her assorted pals to live it up with
her _ at Disneyland. At 65 she was thrown a huge, celebrity-studded
birthday bash which became a television special to benefit AIDS.
 &HT;    And still she's the center of the tabloid universe. Whether it's
her relationship with Steiger or her public display of concern
after her former husband, 47-year-old Larry Fortensky, fell down
the stairs at his home and sustained a brain injury.
 &HT;    But privately she mostly stays home in her $5 million Bel Air
mansion, meeting with producers and filmmakers who want to entice
her back to the big and small screen. And she enjoys visits from
her extended family, grandkids and all.
 &HT;    She has little left to prove, having already lived enough for
six lifetimes. She's won Oscars for ``Butterfield 8'' (1960) and
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' (1966) and made dozens of other
movies, some of them great, some not so great. She's made
headlines, some good and some embarrassing. She's dumped husbands
and lovers and given us a vicarious ride with her yachts, her
jewels, her kids and her animals.
 &HT;    And with all that, it's been hard for us to accept that the
gorgeous little 9-year-old who showed up on screen in ``National
Velvet'' (1944) is on the Medicare rolls.
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Warner
Fortensky is no longer a box-office star. Yet she's a huge draw
when she makes personal appearances to peddle her perfumes or to
raise money to help lick the disease that killed her longtime
friend Rock Hudson.
 &HT;    The last film she starred in was the television movie ``Sweet
Bird of Youth'' (1989). The last time she worked on the big screen,
it was a mere cameo role in ``The Flintstones'' (1994).
 &HT;    Yet the world is apparently endlessly fascinated by this woman,
even if her main claim to fame these days is that she's more famous
for being famous than any other woman in the world.
 &HT;    She keeps bouncing back, more than earning her title of
Hollywood's Queen of Survival: There's not much she can't handle,
not even that curse of great beauties everywhere, aging.
 &HT;    ``I feel the same inside,'' she says. ``But, you know, that's
because I don't look in the mirror much. It depends on how I feel
in the morning on any given day. But I don't look back _ only
forward.''
 &HT;    She says she tries to think positively.
 &HT;    ``I don't live with regret in my life,'' Taylor says. ``I really
don't say, `Oh God, I wish I hadn't been under contract.' I don't
live to regret any of it. It's too late, anyway. I didn't realize
I'd go along for so long _ I'm like a bad penny, hard to get rid
of.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``I don't watch my old movies,'' she adds. ``No way. I never
look at them, and if one comes on TV I switch off quickly. It makes
me very self-conscious.''
 &HT;    Perhaps in her late 60s, forgoing the grand passions that always
seemed to get her in so much trouble, she seems to be settling for
companionship. At least that's what Steiger thinks.
 &HT;    ``We're like a couple of old gunfighters _ Wild Bill Hickok and
Wyatt Earp,'' the actor says. ``We've both been through a lot of
crap. I believe talented people should help and protect each other.
Whenever we see each other we have a nice time, because we've both
been there _ and back.''

FREE _ FOR ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, it looks like those grizzled old on-line libertarians were
right. On the Internet, information really does want to be free _
along with just about anything else that might entice consumers to
plug in.
</P>
<P>
   I figured the great Internet giveaway would be long over by now,
as companies would grow weary of pouring millions into on-line
businesses whose ``customers'' never coughed up a nickel. Not so.
The Web is turning all of us into high-tech moochers, eager to
satisfy our Internet desires on somebody else's dime.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence comes from Microsoft, which tends to give
away products only when it's getting beaten by a competitor. And
that's what Microsoft has just decided to do with its on-line
magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Slate. Founded in 1996 and edited by former New
Republic editor Michael Kinsley, it was one of the first attempts
to do serious journalism on the Web, with no less a firm than
Microsoft paying the freight. Slate had the eyeballs, the
mindshare, the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   And then, last year, Microsoft began charging for it. Now ask
yourself: When's the last time you heard people arguing about an
article in Slate?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with its bare-knuckled attacks on conservative
critics of Bill Clinton, the free Internet publication Salon has
become the most controversial magazine on the Web, quoted by
newspapers and TV networks around the world. And all this attention
should soon translate into profits. Salon's marketing director
Patrick Hurley tells me that Salon expects to make money this year,
by selling ad space and reprint rights to its articles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Microsoft's comic fumbling of its antitrust lawsuit, the
company isn't run by fools. If giving away Slate will get it in the
black, fine, they'll give it away. Now they just need to run some
mean-spirited, below-the-belt articles on Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Future readers of Slate may be doing their Web surfing on free
computers. When a California outfit called Free-PC.com announced it
would give away 10,000 of them earlier this month, 300,000 people
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The idea's not nearly as daft as it sounds. With PC prices at
$500 and still falling, computers are well on their way to being
almost disposable, just like cell phones. Free-PC figures to make
its money the same as Salon, by pumping ads over the Internet and
constantly flashing them on the computer screens. If it makes money
on the first 10,000 users, it will keep giving machines away.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers have ripped the idea, suggesting that
only low-income households will put up with a constant barrage of
Free-PC ads. ``By definition, these ads are reaching the wrong
people,'' industry expert Evan Schwartz told CNet News. Instead of
getting the sort of affluent geek who reads Wired magazine, Free-PC
might attract the kind of user who watches Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but where's the downside in that? There are about 8 million
Springer fans, and they've got money to spend. Besides, I'd rather
have them surfing the Internet than roaming the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Even investors have developed an Internet freebie fetish. They
bid up the prices of Web stocks that specialize in giving away
information and punish companies that look for old-fashioned
income. Consider the strange case of Lycos Inc. The Waltham-based
Internet company saw its stock soar as long as it stayed in the
business of handing out free information, free e-mail, and free Web
pages. Then Lycos does a deal with the Home Shopping Network and
Ticketmaster that would have the company selling real stuff for
real money, and what happens? Meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   This one leaves me confused. Eventually these Internet firms
will have to make money. They can't all rely on advertising;
there's only so many banner ads to go around. And as Slate has
proven, people won't pay for information, opinion, attitude, when
others are giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   The big profits for Internet firms will come from selling
traditional products and services, as Lycos hopes to do. Web
companies that want to justify their monstrous stock prices are
bound to head this way. But they must still woo us to their sites,
which is why I figure the Internet's freebie bonanza has only just
begun.

   Disintegration: Microsoft Corp. is spending a lot of money
defending itself against antitrust allegations in federal court.
The government contends that, among other things, Microsoft went
out of its way to do harm to Netscape Communications by giving its
Internet Explorer browser away and including it as part of Windows.
Microsoft has insisted that pulling its browser out of the Windows
98 operating system _ which uses the browser as a desktop interface
_ would cripple the system. But someone had better show Microsoft's
legal team the 98lite Web site at www.98lite.net. Here you can
download a program that purports to strip Internet Explorer 4 and
its components from Windows 98, then replace it with the original
Explorer from Windows 95. Programmer Shane Brooks has written some
software that removes IE4's files, folders and Registry entries,
then asks users to insert a Windows 95 CD, from which the necessary
Windows 95 components are extracted. 98lite lets you remove IE4
altogether, or just remove the desktop integration and keep IE4 as
a browser. He claims _ and user comments on an included message
board back him up _ that the result is a faster, more responsive
operating system that still has all the other benefits of Windows
98, including its improved stability. There are some known problems
in doing this, and Brooks is upfront about it on the site.

   _ Find the fun: The number of specialized search engines that
focus on one particular topic is growing by leaps and bounds. As
the Internet and its World Wide Web become a part of everyday life,
it makes sense to seek out a specialist when you're looking for
specific information. GameSpyder at www.gamespyder.com is one of
this new breed of search engine, devoted entirely to computer
games. Although it's a product of GameSpy Industries _ the company
that brought you GameSpy, which helps find 3-D, multiplayer game
servers on the Net _ it deals with all kinds of game sites,
including sports, simulation, strategy, adventure, classic games,
role-playing and, of course, first-person shooters. You can browse
the listings Yahoo-style, with a directory, or use the search
feature. It's a great place to find cheat codes, walkthroughs,
reviews and screen shots.

   _ All politics are local: A ``wonk'' is defined as someone who
takes great joy out of analyzing and possibly even crafting
government policy. What doubles as Sominex for most of us turns
these folks on with a vengeance. Chances are, serious wonks are
going to love Stateline.org at www.stateline.org, a Web site
devoted to politics and government at the state level. Billed as
``your source for news on state policy innovation,'' it looks at
breaking government news in individual states that normally doesn't
receive national publicity. For example, did you know that
Michigan's legislature is on the verge of passing a law mandating
drug tests for all welfare recipients? Or that Florida's governor
has berated the state's graduation rate as ``lousy''? Or that the
Milwaukee school board has approved a plan to give free laptop
computers to 24,000 high school students? The site generates its
own stories, as well as providing links to government-related
articles in daily newspapers and journals.
</P>
<P>
   _ A thousand words: Cheese Magazine at www.cheesemagazine.com
has nothing to do with dairy products or Wisconsin residents.
Despite its name, this is a showcase for amateur photographers. In
the intro, site operator Tim Kitchen explains why it's for amateurs
only: ``We believe that you don't have to be a photographer to be a
photographer and that sharing pictures bonds people together.''
Cheese takes the pictures it receives and then groups them to make
statements about life. It's very tastefully done. Prospective Web
site developers should check it out as an example of clean,
tasteful page layout.

   _ Morning toons: Saturday morning cartoons have been an American
cultural fixture since the 1950s, and millions of adults have fond
memories of the hours spent in front of the TV watching them. At
Yesterdayland at www.yesterdayland.com, you can literally browse
through your childhood, as one visitor to the site put it. Remember
``Roger Ramjet,'' circa 1965? Or ``Fireball XL-5,'' from the
mid-1960s? The ``Dudley Do-Right'' show, from 1969-70? Or ``The
Electric Company,'' from the early 1970s? You can search for
specific shows, or browse through individual decades, then call up
a synopsis and information about the show's production.

   A little more than a decade ago, Lotus Development Corp.
reinvented the spreadsheet. A small group of developers at the
company's Advanced Technology Group, including Pito Salas, Paul
Kleppner, and Lynda Urgotis, started with the mission of making
spreadsheets dramatically easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   A big problem that many people have building complicated
spreadsheets, they realized, was organizing the data. What should
go in the horizontal rows? What should go in the vertical columns?
Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 allow users to
put any number or any formula in any cell on a huge two-dimensional
array. Unfortunately, for most users, that flexibility provides
more power than is needed, and creates a lot of confusion in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after moving into an empty library in Cambridge,
Mass., the group had come up with a better way. Instead of making
the user type seemingly meaningless formulas like ``C1(EQ)A1-B1,''
and then having to replicate these formulas throughout the
spreadsheet, the group created a prototype that let the user type
meaningful formulas, like ``PROFIT(EQ)PRICE-COST.'' Many cells
could then be labeled as PROFIT, PRICE, or COST cells, and the
formula would automatically be applied to each one. Users might
create separate PROFIT, PRICE, and COST cells for each year that
they were analyzing. Or they might have one for each region of the
country. Or _ and this was the really radical idea _ they might
have different PROFIT, PRICE, and COST cells for different regions
and for different years, creating a three-dimensional spreadsheet.
The user might then add a fourth dimension, to investigate
different business scenarios, and a fifth dimension, to look at
different products.
</P>
<P>
   Salas took a demo of his ``Modeler'' program on tour to some of
Lotus's largest accounts in the spring of 1987 and got rave
reviews. In September 1988 the company committed to the project,
code-named ``Back Bay.'' The following month Steve Jobs visited the
company, and convinced Lotus Management to put Back Bay on Jobs's
new computer, a black magnesium machine called the Nextcube. The
product, which debuted in February 1991, was called Lotus Improv.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the story is better known. Jobs didn't do too
well with Next: he never sold more than 100,000 of the black
computers. So in 1992 Lotus ported Improv to Microsoft Windows 3.1.
But it didn't do too well there, either. According to Kate
Monaghan, a spokeswoman for Lotus, ``Improv won numerous awards as
an innovative spreadsheet tool but was discontinued in April 1996
due to low sales. Customers had a hard time deciding between 1-2-3
or Improv and so stuck with 1-2-3, the industry standard.'' Today
the standard is no longer 1-2-3: it's Microsoft Excel. While Excel
has a few of the features of Improv, it lacks the fundamental core.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't really think much about Excel's shortcomings until a
few months ago, when I started trying to build a series of
extremely complicated Excel spreadsheets. I was doing some
financial projections for a friend's company. I wanted to chart the
sales of several products over time, exploring different economic
and pricing scenarios. Then we wanted to look at different funding
scenarios. That's five dimensions right there. Excel has a feature
called ``pivot tables,'' but it only works with two dimensions. You
can also stack multiple Excel spreadsheets together to create a
third dimension. But after that, Excel is rather helpless.
</P>
<P>
   I am one of the few people who had a Next machine back in 1992,
and I got to be pretty skilled at using Improv. So after spinning
my wheels with Excel and buying more than $100 worth of books that
promised to solve my problems, but delivered far less, I started
hunting on the Internet. My Holy Grail was a 1993 copy of Lotus
Improv 2.0 for Windows 3.1. After a lot of searching I found
somebody who had an old copy, and I bought it for $75. I'm pleased
to report that the program runs like a champ under Windows '98. And
it's remarkably small: the entire program, including the help
files, the multimedia tutorial, and the example models, takes just
9 megabytes of space on my hard drive. I haven't given up on Excel,
but quite frankly I haven't found a need for it since switching.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's the end of the story. I'm legally
prohibited from making copies of Improv for my friends and
coworkers. Improv is protected by copyright, and even though Lotus
no longer sells or supports the product, that protection still
holds. In a very real way, this is a kind of crime against society.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of copyright under our legal tradition is to give
authors protection for their intellectual works, so that they will
be motivated to produce new ones. It is a bargain between society
and the inventor. If a company like Lotus reneges on its side of
the bargain _ and in the case of Improv, Lotus surely has _ I think
that the works that were protected by copyright should become
public property. That is, I think that they should go into the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this argument go far beyond Lotus and
Improv. In recent years dozens of software publishers have gone out
of business, and taken their wares with them. Just imagine what the
world would be like today, if instead of killing their products,
these companies had been forced to release their programs into the
public domain. Today there would be more than a dozen free word
processors and spreadsheets available for Windows, giving Microsoft
a real run for its money. And if the companies had been compelled
to release the source code for these products as well, then
enterprising hobbyists would have ported these applications to the
Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prime offenders in this world of dead software is
Apple, which has mothballed the Newton and all but given up on the
Nextstep operating systems. Ultimately, it would probably be in the
best interest of both Apple's shareholders and society as a whole
for companies like Lotus and Improv to release their failed
products to the public.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple reason that they do not: if the public did a
better job with the software, then it would prove that these
products died because of mismanagement, and not because of the
competitive environment.

IF YOUR MOUSE IS GETTING DRAGGY, TRY WINDEX AND COMPRESSED AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have looked in all of our manuals that came with the
computer and cannot find info about how to clean the mouse. It
seems to be dragging a bit and is one year old. Could it possibly
need to be replaced?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably just need to clean it, which is a fairly simple
task.
</P>
<P>
   A mouse uses a small rubber ball that sticks out of the bottom
of the case; this ball is in contact with a series of rollers
inside the case. As a mouse rolls around, the rollers sense the
ball's motion and communicate that to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   As it moves, a mouse picks up dust, crumbs, cat hair, etc., even
if it's on a mouse pad. You need to clean this out from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   Turn your mouse over and look at the bottom of its case. You'll
see where the mouse ball sticks out, and it's surrounded on most
mice by a plastic ring. Turn the ring counterclockwise and it
should come off.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mouse ball. Take an ordinary household cleaner _ I
like to use Windex _ and spray the mouse ball. Dry it well with a
lint-free cloth and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take a can of compressed air and blow out the inside of the
mouse case. (If you don't have a can of compressed air, get one at
any office supply or computer store. You'll also need it to blow
out the dust that gathers inside your computer's case, something
you should do every six months or so.)
</P>
<P>
   Put the mouse ball back in place and secure it with the plastic
ring. Your mouse should work fine now.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's a chance it might not. If it's still sluggish,
try replacing the mouse pad. The surface of a mouse pad can wear
smooth, which provides less friction.
</P>
<P>
   If it's still sluggish, check the connection to the computer. If
you have a cordless mouse, check the battery. If it remains
unresponsive, it may be time for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had tried Disk Defragmenter on my computer a couple months
ago without any problem, but when I tried it yesterday, my computer
froze at 10 percent complete. I reset my computer, turned off the
screen saver and tried it again, but it did the same thing. There
were no virus scanners in the background and no other program
running. What can I do next to accomplish the task? My computer is
a Compaq, Pentium II, 333-megahertz and using Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer to this can be found at the Microsoft Knowledge
Base at support.microsoft.com, in article
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q186/9/78.asp. But here's
the summary:
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you weren't patient enough. Windows 98 has a
different way of defragmenting a hard drive than Windows 95, and
part of the process slows the computer down to the point that it
appears not to be responding.
</P>
<P>
   With a traditional disk-defragmentation process, the files on
the computer are placed sequentially, one after the other, so there
are no gaps in between. But with Windows 98, the operating system
arranges your files so that the most-used items are placed on the
fastest part of the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Windows keeps a series of logs showing which
programs you use most. It then reads these logs and rearranges the
files accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   This takes some time, causing the process to appear to ``hang''
at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Your best fix _ go get a cup of coffee, take a jog around the
block or call an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   The more you use the computer, the more extensive these log
files become. That's why your first defrag effort went quickly, and
the next one seemed to hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to use the Norton Utilities' Speed Disk, which
does the same thing but much faster.
</P>

WEB CAMERAS LET SURFERS PEEK INTO EVERYDAY LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JONATHAN SIDENER   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a high-tech peephole into Pirkko Essen's kitchen near
Stockholm, Sweden. Fire up your computer and you can see her
teenage children staring longingly at the devil's food cake she
baked Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, spy holes expose nearly every nook of Alex
van Es' home, including a view of who's ringing his doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, you can get a pretty good view into the Chandler
computer room of Steve and Connie Fannon.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing phenomenon sweeping the Internet, people such
as these are broadcasting fragments of their lives into cyberspace
using digital cameras that cost as little as $59.
</P>
<P>
   This swarm of Web cameras, or Web cams, offers live images of
Rottweilers, ferrets, fish tanks, sushi bars, hair curlers and
computer rooms. Lots of computer rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And in an equally perplexing practice on the other side of the
peephole, thousands of computer users are spending hours watching
fully clothed strangers sitting in their living rooms or at their
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the Web cam world seems fueled by a blend of ego
gratification and performance art. But supporters say it's
simplistic to dismiss it as nothing more than exhibitionism,
voyeurism and street theater.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a face personalizes the cold electronic communication of
the Internet, they say. Others say this is a toddling step toward
the science-fiction future we've been reading about for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more personal, more interactive,'' says Sharon Rothe,
owner operator of the Early-Morning-Coffee Cam and the Curler Cam.
``It's not just a Web page anymore. People can see my face. I can
wave to them and say, `Hi'.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already serious applications in the wings. A fledgling
Tucson firm hopes to market virtual quality time with children by
bringing live video from day care centers to working parents.
</P>
<P>
   This whole Web cam thing began with the Trojan Room Coffee
Machine, set up in the Cambridge University computer lab in 1991.
It soon was followed by Netscape's Fish Cam, which offers live
video of a fish tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish Cam spawned other fish cams, dog cams and ant-farm
cams. Then Web cams branched out beyond the critters. One site from
an auto body repair shop shows the live restoration of a vintage
Corvette. A California student who lives across the street from his
high school has constant live video of the school grounds during
daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Club in Tucson offers nightly video of the music
acts on its stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Web cam craze has prompted satirical sites, such as several
litter-box cams, a cam cam that shows a purported live shot of
another Web cam and the Continental Drift Cam, which, broadcasting
from the Four Corners area, allegedly offers live video of the
movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web cam owners say that the video draws a striking number
of visitors to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rothe, a New Hampshire resident, went online with her Web cam
``on a whim.'' Then in an equally frivolous gesture, she launched
The Curler Cam, putting her hair up in rollers live on the Internet
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last fall, I've had 6,000 hits (visitors) on my page,''
Rothe said. ``I did it as a joke. But when I stopped, I got a lot
of e-mail from people saying, `Where's the Curler Cam?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She revived the Curler Cam.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Fuhrman of Avondale doesn't have a curler cam or any
other bells and whistles. The 63-year-old's Web cam just shows him
working at his computer. Still, his camera draws a lot of visitors.
He's had about 7,700 hits in the 18 months that the camera has been
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had people from as far away as China, Turkey and
England nag me about my smoking, as if the smoke was bothering
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I receive comments on what I am wearing, drinking, etc. It
really surprises me as to the number of people who look in daily or
many times.''
</P>
<P>
   While 6,000 or 7,000 hits may sound like a lot, it pales in
comparison with the traffic that clicks through the Essen's site,
one of the most popular cams on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to having it here as a member of the kitchen,''
Pirkko says via e-mail. ``I am the only one who is thinking some
days, `to open, or not to open.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Essens are not immune from Web surfers looking for sexual
content. They are frequently asked whether they are naked in their
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm, we are always dressed in our kitchen, with or without
the camera,'' Pirkko says.
</P>
<P>
   For computer whiz and fish tank enthusiast Jeffery Green of
Boston, the lure of combining the two technologies was
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it would be neat to have people be able to look
at my fish,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Green's Reef Cam included ``the robot cam,'' which
allowed people to move the camera left and right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a camera that was actually in the tank, the sub
cam,'' Green wrote via e-mail. ``My friends have always thought it
was kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Web cam owners run the demographic gamut, from middle-age
Japanese women to young urban American couples to Western ranchers,
though probably the largest number are young, Anglo males.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners tout the lack of purpose behind their Web cams,
calling them useless, goofy and pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But some others have specific objectives, such as the site
posted by 18-year-old Travis Kroh, who attends MacArthur High in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally just wanted to keep in touch with my friends
after I moved (from Wahpeton, N.D.), but I get e-mail from all over
the place.''
</P>
<P>
   A common refrain from Web cam owners is that this technology
allows them to go where no one has been before.
</P>
<P>
   One such pioneering site is the one run by van Es in the
Netherlands. Van Es has several devices wired into the gamepad port
on his computer, including his doorbell, his refrigerator and his
phone. Even his trash can, bathroom and cat's eating area are wired
in, though not all areas have Web cams.
</P>
<P>
   If you take a look at his site, you can see images of anyone who
has rung his doorbell or opened his refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the numbers of anyone who phones his house or a
photo of his cat each time she eats. A bar scanner tracks anything
he throws in his trash.
</P>
<P>
   Van Es is serious about the electronic fishbowl technology he is
developing and hopes to market it. ``This is the future,'' he
declares on his Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who is serious about making Web cams useful is
Steve Lacy of Tucson. Lacy has developed and is beginning to market
a system using Web cams to allow parents to peek into their
children's day care center from work.
</P>
<P>
   Called Window2Care, the system would be installed without cost
to the day care center. Parents would pay an estimated $19.95 a
month for access to the Web site where the video is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses passwords to keep prying strangers from viewing
the children. Lacy initially plans to market the service in the
Tucson area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives parents peace of mind,'' he said. ``It adds
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents also feel a little bit guilty about leaving their kids
in day care. This gives them a chance to check in. If they can
watch them play, it gives them the feeling that they didn't leave
them all day. At the end of the day, they can say, `I saw you
playing with little Johnny.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fannon installs high-speed video conferencing equipment as
part of his job as network administrator for a small company with
offices in Tucson and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He has a simpler Web cam in the computer room of his Chandler
home for friends and relatives to check in and see how he and his
family are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Watching video conferences connect far-flung offices at work
leads Fannon to believe that Web cams are more than a high-tech
toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to the point where we all have cable modems or
something faster, this is going to be extremely valuable,'' he
said. ``We're talking about a Jetsons scenario.'' &QL;

WITH TECHNOLOGY, CHUCK D FIGHTS THE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of Cornel West, he's ``a freedom fighter of his
generation.'' In the words of Spike Lee, he's ``one of the most
politically and socially conscious artists of any generation.'' But
forget the superlatives. Chuck D, founder of the rap group Public
Enemy, has roared about the Three E's: education, economics, and
enforcement (as in law). Now he's aiming at another alphabetical
trio, an Information Age version of the three Rs _ record
companies, radio stations, and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the person who waves a flag for the artists to have a fair
shot,'' Chuck D says during a phone interview from Atlanta. ``The
record companies hide behind bushes when I talk because I'm the
mouth that roars. They're full of `No comments.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His latest rap condemns the music industry. ``If you don't own
the master/then the master owns you,'' the song proclaims,
comparing the artist-industry relationship to slavery. ``Dollar a
rhyme/but we barely get a dime.'' Needless to say, you won't find
record company executives touting the tune, you won't hear it on
the radio, and you won't find it in retail stores. It's available
only on the Internet at www.public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   The provocative song is the latest salvo fired in Chuck D's
dispute with his former label Def Jam Recordings and its parent
company Polygram (now part of Universal Music Group). Now, you
could write this off as a typical artist-management skirmish if it
didn't involve a technological advance that is rapidly changing the
way music is produced, marketed, and distributed. The record
industry is facing its most monumental shakeup, more daunting than
what happened when vinyl gave way to the CD. It's all thanks to a
simple but groundbreaking computer format that rhymes with MTV.
</P>
<P>
   They call it MP3.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial format enables anyone with a modem and a mouse
to download digital copies of recorded music that sound almost
exactly like the originals. It's the hottest thing in cyberspace
these days, and companies like Lycos and JamTV are racing to come
up with products and services as fast as you can say, ``I want my
MP3!'' Depending on who you talk to, though, MP3 is either the
beginning of a brave new world of artistic freedom or a return to
the days when the pirates ruled the seas.
</P>
<P>
   Certain artists (including Public Enemy, Billy Idol, The Beastie
Boys, and the surviving members of the Grateful Dead) are way ahead
of the industry executives, who are scrambling to catch up with the
chaotic, constantly changing world of cyberspace. Public Enemy, for
instance, used the MP3 format to post recordings from its
unreleased remix album on its Web site late last year. Def Jam
demanded that the band remove the songs from the site, and Public
Enemy eventually severed its ties with the label, which has
produced every Public Enemy album since its debut in 1987. ``That
was the straw that broke the camel's back,'' says Chuck D.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the split, a Def Jam spokeswoman said, ``No
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Recording Industry Association of America is hardly
hiding behind bushes. ``With the touch of a button, any 13-year-old
can make music available to millions of people around the world,''
says Cary Sherman, the industry group's senior executive vice
president and general counsel. ``We're talking about a whole new
dimension of piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D, however, downplays these fears. ``They're trying to
come up with a two-minute offense,'' he says. ``That's what we say
in football when you're behind and you come up with some rush
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the play by play: The recording industry association has
been scouring the Internet to shut down illegal MP3 sites, and in
December, it launched the Secure Digital Music Initiative, or SDMI,
a plan to develop standards to protect copyrighted music in
cyberspace. When the Internet portal Lycos launched an MP3 search
engine last week, the industry association forced the company to
vow it would not link to illegal sites offering bootleg music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 files, after all, aren't scratchy cassette tapes with gaps
between tracks. They're high-quality recordings. Many Web sites,
including www.mp3.com and www.goodnoise.com, offer legal MP3
recordings to download for about $1 a song; the files are
compressed, so it takes only a minute or so to download a track
using a high-speed modem. Browsers can then play the tunes right on
their computer using one of the free players, such as Real Player,
that are readily available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is all the rage among today's technologically savvy college
students, who can easily use ``ripper'' software to copy their CDs
into the MP3 format and distribute it for free _ or for profit _
over the Internet. David Weekly, a 20-year-old Arlington native and
a computer science student at Stanford University, put his entire
music collection up on his Web site two years ago, and his site was
so popular it almost crashed the university's server. He took the
collection down after a representative from Geffen Records
contacted the school.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a computer science student to use the
technology, and you don't have to be glued to your computer,
either. In December, the first portable device designed to play MP3
files hit the market. Called the Rio PMP300, it's smaller than a
Walkman and retails for $200. You hook it up to your computer and
download your music files into its memory chip. Chuck D's
grandmother could listen to MP3 recordings on a Rio while she's
baking cookies in the kitchen. It's that simple. The device worried
the recording industry association, which unsuccessfully tried to
block its introduction in stores last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck D, whose longtime mantra has been ``Don't believe the
hype,'' thinks the paranoia about the technology is inflated. ``The
big five labels are going to catch up,'' he says. ``They're going
to develop their own supersites, and there will be updated
futuristic record clubs.'' However, he and other artists contend
that the technology can level the playing field, enabling musicians
to control their own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the demo is dead,'' Chuck D says. ``We're going to
have 500,000 labels and a million artists.'' Musicians might also
be able to leverage a better profit margin, more than the usual
dime-per-dollar percentage most artists receive from the major
labels. ``Every artist contract should be 50-50,'' Chuck D says.
</P>
<P>
   The prophet of this new cybernation is putting his modem where
his mouth is. He plans to launch his own interactive label _ one of
the projected 500,000 _ on the Internet. It's called slamjamz.com,
and is due to be up later this month. It will offer albums by such
bands as Hyenas in the Desert and Virus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Slamming the music industry is nothing new to this prophet of
rage, who has blasted record companies for making ``mad loot'' off
young rappers. As it turns out, he's not new to cyberspace, either.
Back in 1994, when most folks thought the Internet was some weird
thing that had to do with MIT and the military, Chuck D and Public
Enemy were aware that a cultural sea change was imminent. Its 1994
CD, ``Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age,'' includes a track called ``Harry
Ellis' Interactive Superhighway Phone Call to Chuck D,'' a
manifesto urging musicians to stay in tune with the changing
technology. ``We're talking about a shift in the way this music is
distributed,'' the track warns. ``The music companies are trying to
make sure that . . . they are ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   The track seemed like a bizarre rambling back in 1994: ``People
were, like, who, what, huh, duh,'' Chuck D recalls. But the
prophesy turned out to be right and wrong at the same time. The
technology has evolved, but it's the musicians who are ahead of the
curve _ so far. It's two-minute defense time for the industry, and
possibly by the end of the year, all the major record labels will
be offering encrypted MP3 songs for sale on the Internet. That's OK
with Chuck D, because the implications of the technology are
daunting. ``It means the beginning of the end of domination,'' he
says, announcing that he's roared enough for now. ``Just boost our
site,'' he adds before ending the interactive superhighway phone
call. That would be public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Chuck D is all over the technology, but that doesn't mean he
wants to give all of his music away free. MP3 provides a great way
to market albums by offering free samples, though, and a handful of
artists have been using it with varying responses from the labels
that own their distribution rights.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Idol, for instance, sold two singles on the popular
www.mp3.com site, but his label, Capitol Records, insisted that he
remove them. Ditto for The Beastie Boys, who received pressure from
Capitol after posting promotional tracks on their Web site,
www.beastieboys.com. Frank Black, formerly of the Pixies, is
selling his latest album in MP3 format at another popular site,
www.goodnoise.com. A few independent labels have jumped into the
fray, too: Salem-based Rykodisc has made 200 tracks available for
purchase on goodnoise.com, and Spin Art is selling its entire
catalog on line.
</P>
<P>
   If any band seems a natural for the technology, it's the
Grateful Dead, which has always encouraged its fans to tape its
concerts and share the goods with fellow Deadheads.
</P>
<P>
   The band, re-formed as The Other Ones in the post-Jerry Garcia
era, recently posted samples and a free single from its upcoming
album (``The Strange Remain'') at www.otherones.evolve.com. But
spokesman Dennis McNally warns that the band isn't eager to see its
music trade hands illegally in MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different from free audience taping because it's
digitally identical to what we recorded,'' McNally says. ``It's a
great marketing tool, but that doesn't mean the Grateful Dead has
decided to give up the rights to sell its music.''
</P>
<P>
   Great marketing tool, indeed. Some 10,000 fans have already
downloaded the free copy of ``Mississippi Half Step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dead has always been on the cutting edge of technology, but
when it comes to MP3, McNally is ambivalent, bordering on cautious.
``The ramification of digital copying is a headache that's going to
have to be dealt with,'' he says. ``We're watching it with interest
to see how it all works out.''

BLACK ENTREPRENEURS SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT `DIGITAL FREEDOM' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JANET STITES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though comparatively small in number, and nearly invisible in
the greater New York Internet and new-media industry, black
Internet entrepreneurs are organizing a support network, outlining
steps to success and finding their own role models.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy Friday evening earlier this month at New York
University, a group of black executives, professionals and students
met to discuss ways to use information technology for ``digital
freedom,'' as they put it. The event was sponsored by the Blacks in
New Media Association, a student group that was started last fall
in the university's interactive telecommunications program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playing field is as level as it's going to get,'' said B.
Keith Fulton, a technologist and lawyer who is now director of
technology programs and policy at the National Urban League. ``You
don't need a $10 million marketing budget to put up a Web site,''
Fulton said. ``But there is consolidation in the industry, and as
the Internet matures, new barriers are going to arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist was Bob Ponce, who wields a great deal of
influence in the new-media industry as president of the World Wide
Web Artist Consortium (www.wwwac.org), a grass-roots organization
that has a far-reaching e-mail discussion list and that is host to
numerous events for Web designers. Ponce, who is African-American,
is established in the broader business world, but he believes that
catering to the interests of black Americans might provide some of
the best opportunities for black entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we need to help get our community on line,'' he said,
referring to black Americans as a group. ``Then you help create
your future customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans definitely are coming on line, according to
research from Forrester Research of Boston. According to the firm,
2.7 million African-American households (out of about 11 million)
have access to the Internet, whether it be from home, work or
school. That is up from two million households at the beginning of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   What's important from a business standpoint, Ponce said, is that
people know that blacks are alive and well in the wired world. ``We
have to let people know we are technology savvy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Auriea Harvey, who is a Web site designer and
founder of Entropy8 (www.entropy8.com), is doing just that. She has
a digital camera pointed at her desk so that visitors to her Web
site can watch her work. ``I want to make a point that I'm here,
that I'm a woman and that I'm black,'' Ms. Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harvey, who has designed the Web sites of Virgin Records
America and PBS, among others, wasn't always so eager to emphasize
her race. ``At first, the anonymity was important to me,'' she
said. ``I wanted people to see my work and judge me solely for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Harvey said she had come to realize that working in the
virtual world offered her advantages as a black woman over working
in the real world. ``On the same day you'll be working with someone
on the West Coast and then someone in Switzerland,'' she said.
``They may not even know your color, and if they find out later,
it's just trivia.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to raising money for a new business, though, the
interpersonal may play a role, one panelist, Omar Wasow said. ``The
primary barriers are more just about being a start-up, not being a
black start-up,'' said Wasow, an African-American who is the
Internet correspondent for the cable channel MSNBC. ``But this is a
business where social networks count for a lot,'' he said, in an
interview after the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Wasow, a 28-year-old New York native and Stanford graduate, is a
Silicon Alley pioneer, having started New York Online
(www.nyo.com), originally a subscription-supported dial-up online
service, in 1993. He initially sought to create an online community
that would reflect the diverse personalities of the city. But as
community tended to take a back seat to commerce, Wasow shifted to
concentrate on Web site design.
</P>
<P>
   Wasow, who divides his time between MSNBC and his company, says
that the bulk of the challenges he faces as a businessman have
nothing to do with race. ``Because this industry is so young and
new and there's so much turmoil, it's still a wide open game with
plenty of opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be scant industry data about the amount of
capital that goes to black-owned new-media firms. But the consensus
of that Friday night discussion seemed to be that while the venture
capital door is open, it may not always be open wide enough.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the New York City Investment Corp., which is backed by
10 banks, has a mandate to finance minority ventures. The fund,
started in 1996, acts more like a bank than a venture firm, giving
out loans of $50,000 to $1 million in return for equity or
royalties. Though the $25 million fund does not necessarily focus
on technology companies, it has lent close to $1 million to two New
York-based black-owned technology firms _ Data Industries, a
computer personnel staffing company, and Axicom Communications
Group, an international telecommunications firm. Howard Sommer, who
manages the fund, says it is now focusing more on Internet and
new-media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a smattering of venture funds have been started to
take advantage of underserved, or overlooked, minority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations, like Blacks in New Media, are sprouting up to
help give African-American businesses a foothold in New York's
Internet economy. The New York new-media industry as a whole is
seeking ways to attract more minority entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the attendees at our events,'' said Alice Rodd
O'Rourke, executive director of the New York New Media Association.
``And we ask, `Where are the people of color?' We want everyone to
know this industry exists and what the opportunities are.''

FRICTION BETWEEN WEB STANDARDS EMERGES OVER MICROSOFT APPLICATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Web site developers were angered earlier this month when
they learned that the MicrosoftCorp. had received a patent covering
a fundamental technology adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium,
a nonprofit group working to standardize the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the furor arose because Microsoft, a member of the
consortium, had not told members that it had applied for a patent
covering aspects of a technology known as ``cascading style
sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   These style sheets are essentially templates that reduce the
cost of developing Web sites, make it easier to redesign a site on
the fly and cut the cost of maintaining a site.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft since has said that its failure to disclose the patent
application was inadvertent and, more important, that it will
freely license the patent. But technologists say that the Microsoft
patent is a worrisome symptom of a much larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has begun to issue a spate
of patents that were applied for several years ago when the
Internet was just becoming viable commercially. Some fear that
these patents threaten the very architecture underlying the online
world.
</P>
<P>
   While patents are intended to reward innovative work done
independently by individuals or companies, the World Wide Web is in
many respects the result of innovation that is by definition
collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works because everyone has some basic underlying
agreements about basic technical standards, not because everybody
went out and tried to make their own web,'' said Daniel K.
Weitzner, director of technology standards for the World Wide Web
Consortium. ``If everyone did go out and make their own web, we
would have no Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Resnick, associate professor at the University of
Michigan's School of Information, said the friction between patents
and standards was spurring a ``revolution in how we think about
property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both innovation and standardization create value for
consumers,'' he said. ``Patents are good for rewarding innovation.
But they can inhibit standardization. And the value that is created
by standards accrues to everyone. ''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's patent, No. 5,860,073, covers part of the technology
behind ``cascading style sheets,'' templates into which fresh data
can be poured repeatedly. The style sheets are used with HTML, the
common language of the Internet. The patent also covers a similar
template approach for XML, a next-generation language described as
``HTML on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   George Olsen is a design director at 2-Lane Media in Los Angeles
who heads up the Web Standards Project, a lobbying group for
developers who want to see Web standards broadly adopted, so that
virtually all sites can be viewed easily with any type of browser.
</P>
<P>
   When Olsen's group first heard of the Microsoft patent, they
hotly threatened to press the Patent Office to re-examine it. But
the group's tempers have cooled since Microsoft announced that it
would freely and widely license the patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're in a trust-but-verify mode,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Microsoft patent has been the subject of ire outside
the World Wide Web Consortium, also known as the W3C, a different
patent seems to be the main focus of concern within the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The IntermindCorp., a consortium member, did disclose to the
consortium that it had applied for a patent covering aspects of
``metadata,'' which is essentially information tagged to data so
that it can be sorted or classified. (An ``R'' rating tagged to a
movie, for example would be metadata about a movie.) The consortium
adopted a metadata standard known as the Platform for Privacy
Preferences, or P3P. But members were taken by surprise when
Intermind announced, after it had been issued patent No. 5,862,325
_ a huge, 130-page document _ that it would exact licensing fees
from fellow members, who had helped developed P3P.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reardon, a Microsoft program manager who is the company's
representative with the consortium, said his company was serving as
a model of how consortium members should treat their patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is currently absolutely zero patent policy at the W3C,''
said Reardon. Instead, each of the consortium's 300 members post
their own policy regarding licensing. Microsoft's is far more
liberal than that of any other company, he said, comparing it to
``much stricter terms'' offered by Sun Microsystems or IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think what we're doing is pretty striking,''
Reardon said. ``We're saying, `It doesn't really matter what the
patent says, you can have it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft is not giving away its patent for nothing.
In return, companies must grant Microsoft a reciprocal license for
any related technology. ``We're not going to give something for
free and then be held hostage by somebody we just gave to,''
Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if other companies follow Microsoft's example, other
thorny issues will probably emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Eolas Technologies,a company in Wheaton, Ill., that is not a
member of the consortium, recently sued Microsoft for infringing
its patent, No. 5,838,906. Mike Doyle, the founder of Eolas,
contends that the patent covers aspects of ``embedded technology''
_ the so-called applets and plug-ins that make it possible to
experience music, video and animated graphics on the Web. These are
used not just by Microsoft but by other software makers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Should Eolas and others not in the consortium be able to reap
the benefits of standardization while at the same time exacting
licensing fees for patented technologies?
</P>
<P>
   Resnick contends that such questions are going to require a
radical rethinking of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big issue; it's fundamental,'' he said. ``There's not
going to be an easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

MTV BRANCHING OUT BEYOND THE TUBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURA EVENSON   
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ If MTV Networks Chairman Tom Freston gets
his way, generations of couch (set ital)and(end ital) mouse
potatoes will soon be howling, ``I want my MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable network giant, whose channels include MTV, VH1,
Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite and TV Land, announced a major online
expansion Tuesday, including new music and children's World Wide
Web sites to further extend its reach ``from cradle to, well,
near-grave,'' says Freston.
</P>
<P>
   The online expansion will give MTV Networks' fans of all ages
more of what they want when they want it, including music, music
news and information, children's activities and a chance to
purchase a piece of American pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web sites and services also will extend the global reach
of MTV Networks, which already reaches a quarter of the world's
television households in 85 countries and territories ranging from
China to South Africa with shows geared to local languages and
customs. MTV plans to run both sites from new offices in San Mateo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we can count on is that entertainment and media will
become ever more individualized for people around the globe,'' says
Freston, 53, who worked as a bartender in the Caribbean and a
clothing merchant in New Delhi before helping to launch New
York-based MTV in 1981. ``That's the point of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks will launch its eclectic music site, tentatively
called the Buggles Project, in June, and its large secure site for
children, tentatively called Project Nozzle, in September.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also will soon be able to shop on all MTV's Web sites,
including its more TV-focused MTV.com and nick.com, thanks to the
networks' recent purchase of Red Rocket, an online toy retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The Buggles Project will provide a huge network of online radio
stations from which Web surfers can pick and choose to create a
station that suits their tastes and can flow, or ``stream,'' into
their computers around the clock. The new site is named for the
Buggles, a band whose music video, ``Video Killed the Radio Star,''
was the first to appear on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The network, which MTV acquired with Imagine Radio in Brisbane,
Calif., ``already is streaming 100 radio stations,'' says Freston.
``So if I like West African guitarists, hip-hop and classical
music, I could create a personalized radio station that reflects
those preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rugrats'' set can turn to Project Nozzle, which will
feature online activities and games created by and for kids. MTV
purchased Nvolve, a Web development company in San Mateo, Calif.,
to create a safe site for kids by requiring parents to register
them online for access to bulletin boards, chat and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks' new online sites will enhance its cradle-to-grave
appeal it started with its TV channels, where kiddies watch such
shows as ``Blue's Clues'' on Nickelodeon, teens and young adults
tune into MTV, Baby Boomers view rock documentaries on VH1 and
grandparents tune into ``I Love Lucy'' on Nick at Nite or ``The
Lone Ranger'' on TV Land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC;  To hold on to its
</ANNOTATION>
wide range of viewers, MTV Networks has already retooled at least
two channels and changed the way it reaches its core teen and young
adult fans.
<P>
   Instead of appealing to teens solely via the MTV channel, MTV
Films, with Paramount Pictures (both are owned by Viacom), is going
after them at the cinema. New movies include ``Varsity Blues,''
about high school football in small-town Texas. Released last
month, it already has taken in more than $48 million at the box
office. On Friday, Paramount and MTV Networks will release ``200
Cigarettes,'' a comedy set in New York's East Village on New Year's
Eve 1981. Its cast reads like a Who's Who of young Hollywood,
including Ben Affleck, Courtney Love and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV cable channel also underwent a makeover. ``It veered off
its mark in the mid-1990s,'' says Freston, as it moved away from
music and toward vapid veejays and game shows. To get back on
track, he says, MTV hired hosts who care more about the music they
present than what they look like. ``Carson Daly is not a glamour
boy, and that's the point,'' Freston says of the host who's dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand its viewers, the channel sent researchers
into the closets and record collections of 100 young adults last
summer to study their pop culture tastes. It also has set up a
studio overlooking Times Square that raised its profile with both
artists and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks turned Nickelodeon into a must-see channel for
children when it spent about $30 million in the early 1990s to
develop animated hits like ``Rugrats'' and ``Blue's Clues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed Nickelodeon to be more about entertainment, because
when it was `educational' kids didn't like it,'' Freston says.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Blue's Clues,'' live-action host Steven Burns never talks
down to his young audience. Instead, he and his animated dog, Blue,
enlist young viewers to help to look for clues and solve problems.
``Rugrats'' revolves around cartoon babies, but it is closer in
spirit to ``The Simpsons'' than ``Barney'' as it mocks the yuppie
behavior of parents Stu and Didi Pickles.
</P>
<P>
   The goal behind such programming, says Freston, ``is to develop
shows that kids like and will stay with until they know it's time
to move on to MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks' toughest task may be to figure out how to reach
Boomers past age 50. ``I don't know that a music video network is
an approach that will work for them,'' says Freston. ``In our
cradle-to-grave coverage, we're sort of missing the grave part. For
now, internally at MTV we're calling it VH2.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, MTV Networks will offer increasingly customized
entertainment for ever-larger audiences. ``The one thing we can
count on as we move into the next millennium,'' Freston says, ``is
the continued de-massification of the media worldwide.''

`SYSTEM ON A CHIP' AT HIGHER SPEED FROM IBM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM plans on Monday to announce its entry into the market for
technology used in making so-called system-on-a-chip
semiconductors. In recent years, as it has become possible to
squeeze more and more transistors onto silicon chips, designers
have gradually begun putting all the key components of a computer
system on a single chip _ sharply lowering the cost while
increasing the performance of computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Although by no means the first company to create such systems,
IBM will enter the market with transistor technology that computes
more quickly than current system-on-a-chip products, company
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, computers deal with information in two ways: as
memory (or storage) and as logic (or processing). Previous
system-on-a-chip designs have been based on the circuitry of memory
transistors, which tend to handle information more slowly than
logic transistors. IBM's new approach will be based on the
circuitry of logic transistors, which the company said should
create higher-speed processors.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, IBM's new technology will be capable of creating
chips with as many as 24 million transistors, by using the
company's semiconductor process that can etch circuits only 0.15
micron apart _ less than one-six-hundredth the width of a human
hair. The company said that such circuit densities could yield
computers with up to eight times the performance and as much as two
to four times the memory of the typical personal computer today.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives expect that the first application for the new
technology will be in data communications, but that it could be
rapidly applied to consumer products ranging from computers to
smart appliances.
</P>
<P>
   IBM would use the technology for its own chip-making operations
or sell it as a tool kit for other chip designers. The company
plans to make the first tool kits available in April and predicts
that the first commercial products containing the new chips will
reach the market next year.

   Linux, of course, is a Unix-based computer operating system that
is widely available free and is rapidly gaining at least symbolic
value as an alternative to Microsoft's Windows and Windows NT
programs. Last Thursday, IBM announced it would preload Linux on
certain of its network server machines, alongside Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   And as of Monday a small San Francisco-based start-up, Linuxcare
Inc., will be offering large corporations an around-the-clock Linux
support service.
</P>
<P>
   ``An uninformed user is a bad thing,'' said Arther Tyde III,
chief executive of Linuxcare. The company's customers will be able
to call for help at any hour, paying annual service rates up to
$150,000, depending on what options they sign up for.
</P>
<P>
   As word of Linux's reliability spreads and more corporations
adopt it, ``a technical support service like Linuxcare is
absolutely needed now,'' said Sandra Potter, a senior analyst at
the Aberdeen Group of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Linuxcare (www.linuxcare.com) does not sell Linux itself, but
supports a variety of commercial versions, including ones sold by
Red Hat and Caldera. Caldera is expected to announce this week that
it has been selected by several big hardware and software companies
to train and certify Linux engineers. As part of its new service,
Linuxcare has set up a Web-based system it calls Caretracker to let
customers trace the handling of their cases on line, much as
Federal Express enables users to track packages.
</P>
<P>
   And starting next month, Linuxcare intends to make its
``knowledge base'' of technical information freely available to the
public over the Web. That data base will be continually updated,
the company said, as new information pours in from its experience
providing technical support.

   THE ROAD PROVED DAUNTINGTO MAKER OF GAMES FOR GIRLS
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Laurel spent the last two and a half years creating
software for girls, a product intended to ``comfort while it
entertains.'' But competitive pressure and shrinking profit margins
in the computer game market made business anything but comfortable
for her company, Purple Moon LLC, which closed its doors last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to save the situation until the last possible
moment,'' Ms. Laurel, a 48-year-old executive who has spent much of
her computer career involved in game design and research into the
people who play them, said in an interview. ``Now we'll all try to
take what we learned and apply it elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Laurel, elsewhere might be another software start-up or
a job developing games software for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon, whose backers included the Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen, had a staff of 40. The company considered its games for
preadolescent girls, like ``Rockett's New School,'' a way of
addressing what Ms. Laurel sees as a gender gap between the action
games that prevail for boys and the fashion-oriented Barbie titles
from Mattel Inc. that are aimed at girls.
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon's games were designed for girls 8 to 12, and
addressed friendships, families and the pressures of growing up,
with the intention of increasing self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, Ms. Laurel plans to tackle gender stereotypes by
developing software for boys. ``I care about both boys and girls,''
she said. Before founding Purple Moon, she spent four years at
Interval Research in Silicon Valley studying the differences
between the ways girls and boys play. She says boys are interested
in more than the ``military metaphors'' that many computer games
offer. ``I'm going to spend some time looking at that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ms. Laurel was optimistic that Purple Moon, whose
first products came out in autumn 1997 and sold relatively well,
could hold its own in a market dominated by Barbie. But the
competition intensified. The number of titles in the girls'
software market doubled _ Mattel alone released more than a dozen
Barbie games _ while shelf space in computer stores dwindled as a
result of mergers and consolidations. At the same time, the average
retail price of computer games dropped $6.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a big company to absorb a hit like that,'' she
said. Purple Moon was not yet a big company.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the pioneering heart surgeon, is
accustomed to having an audience when he wields his scalpel. Since
he performed the first successful human heart transplant in the
nation more than 30 years ago, a steady stream of medical
professionals and students have watched him at work in the
operating room.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, Cooley appeared in front of a a wider audience than
he had ever had before. He performed a 3 hour 40 minute coronary
bypass procedure in Houston that was transmitted live over the
Internet. More than 150,000 people tuned in to the Webcast over the
course of the day. In the months since, tens of thousands more have
reportedly logged on for information about the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was one of nine medical procedures put on the Web in
recent months by AHN.com, the World Wide Web companion to the cable
channel America's Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   Since AHN.com made headlines last June with its Webcast of the
birth of a baby, the site has made a signature _ and a multimedia
educational experience _ of these live medical dramas.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of attracting attention and audience, Victoria's Secret
fashion shows they are not. But they do generate publicity for the
network. They also help overcome one of the primary difficulties
faced by independent ventures: getting carried on cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distribution is the most obviously challenging part of the
cable network business these days.'' said Webster Golinkin,
president and co-founder of America's Health Network, which is
based at Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. ``While people talk
about the 500-channel environment, it's not here yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the network started the site to extend its reach,
and, Golinkin said, to respond to a growing public interest in
health information on the Web. ``Most other media businesses kind
of have their priorities in one place rather than the other,''
Golinkin said. ``It's either an Internet company or a cable
network, and if they have the other thing it's a stepchild.''
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network is available in 9.5 million American
homes, and an average of 2 million people around the world visit
the Web site each month, where a live signal of the television
channel is available, said J. Tod Fetherling, president of the Web
venture. Its potential to reach a wider audience is limited only by
the availability of Internet connections. Twenty-two percent of its
users come from overseas, said Fetherling, who cites traffic from
places like China, Malaysia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When partnerships that place AHN's content on ABCnews.com,
Yahoo, ESPN.com and Real Networks are figured in, it is probable
that AHN reaches a wider audience on the Web than it does on
television. (A syndication deal with Katz Dimensions, a subsidiary
of Katz Media Group, puts AHN content on radio, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast surgeries, accompanied by the subdued play-by-play
of a narrator, have the voyeuristic, cinema verite feel of
behind-the-scenes emergency room shows.
</P>
<P>
   These broadcasts almost did not happen. The television staff was
concerned about showing the childbirth live, but the Web staff
jumped on the idea, Fetherling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being interactive folks, we said, `Heck, yeah, let's try it.'
We had 1.4 million people watch the video stream live, and it blew
everybody away,'' he said. ``It showed us health on the Internet
and what it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   While television can demystify and humanize medical procedures
for information-hungry viewers, Fetherling said, the Internet
allows ``on demand'' access about specific procedures and ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is episodic,'' he said. ``You go on a research
binge when you are diagnosed with cancer or diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the Internet as the digital age Dr. Spock is a
growing one. In addition to two coming cable health channels from
Discovery and Tele-Communications Inc., health resources on the
Internet have proliferated over the last several months. CNN.com
has just announced a partnership with an online health resource
called WebMD. In March, a private online service for doctors called
Medcast, which bills itself as the ``Bloomberg for the medical
profession,'' is being started by Greenberg News Network in
Atlanta. Alan Greenberg, a former publisher of Esquire magazine,
had built Medical News Network for Whittle Communications earlier
this decade before starting his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Another offering, the Seattle-based Onhealth.com, provides news,
columnists and data bases of health information, and features a
weekly audio talk show whose host is Brooke Gladstone of National
Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Two things have radically changed the way the public looks at
its health: managed care and the Internet, said Rebecca Farwell,
the editor in chief of Onhealth.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, you don't have to go to the library and look at
books published two years ago for information,'' Ms. Farwell said.
``You don't have to go to a support group, or talk to your doctors.
You can get everything in one place on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, increasingly, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals,
which can be purchased on line at the click of a button.
Advertisers are eager to offer their wares to a natural audience
for them. At the same time, doctors say they are eager to demystify
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting how little the average person knows about
physiology and anatomy,'' said Cooley, the heart surgeon, who added
that he was honored to perform a coronary bypass on the Internet.
``It helps people to know what goes on during the procedure, for a
person to see a beating heart.''

NET-SAVVY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE SHELVING LIBRARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ADAM PERTMAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To prepare a lesson for his students, Harvard Law School
professor Jonathan Zittrain recently turned to an Internet site on
Tunisia that looked reliable. There, he read about the North
African nation's exemplary treatment of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the information was posted by supporters of
Tunisia's autocratic ruler. They gave the site a deliberately
misleading name, www.amnesty-tunisia.org, even though Amnesty
International has lambasted the country's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the Internet rapidly has become the second
university library. Moreover, as a steadily escalating percentage
of students surf the Web rather than search the stacks, many
academics believe it could supplant the traditional library within
a decade or two as the primary destination for academic information
and research.
</P>
<P>
   But for at least the near term, even staunch supporters of the
Internet see major problems: Too much material in cyberspace is
incorrect, biased, or problematic in other ways. And while some
sites are easy to identify as the work of amateurs or advocates,
the veracity of many others that seem authentic or professional can
be difficult to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites also appear and disappear at an extraordinary rate,
making it nearly impossible to know whether information cited in a
master's thesis today, for example, will be available to future
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already a totally changed world . . . and it's still
changing,'' said James Stellar, dean of the college of arts and
sciences at Northeastern University. ``We're really still in the
infancy of this thing . . . but we're certainly headed in the
direction where the Internet, whatever its problems or limitations,
will be dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Stellar, like most college officials and professors nationwide,
said the lack of editing or peer review of World Wide Web sites _
processes that books and magazine articles typically undergo before
publication _ doesn't prevent him from encouraging students to use
the Internet. The academics say many traditional books and
periodicals also contain errors or are biased, and the job of
teachers is to help students assess and gather good information
regardless of its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, actually, it's a wonderful way of teaching kids what
we've been trying to teach them for years: critical thinking,''
said Zittrain, who is executive director of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard Law School. ``Certainly, there are
issues to resolve, but I think we have to look at this new world
more as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   This historic shift within higher education is unusual, and
perhaps unique, in at least one essential way: It is being driven
primarily by students rather than by professional educators. That's
because a growing number of students are so adept at using the Web
_ frequently more than their teachers _ that they regard it as a
routine place to answer their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with nearly two-dozen students at several campuses
around Boston underlined that reality. All of them said they use
the Internet for 15 percent to more than half of their research _
the younger the student, the higher the percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than going to the library, it's cheaper than
buying books . . . and there's no risk that it's going to be
checked out,'' said Rachael Goren, 19, a sophomore at Brandeis who
said she does about one-third of her research on the Web.``And it's
timing, too; if I want to find something out at 3 in the morning, I
can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released last month by the Higher Education Research
Institute at the University of California in Los Angeles showed
that 83 percent of college freshmen use the Internet as a research
and educational tool. It was the first national poll of its kind,
and the results surprised even its authors.
</P>
<P>
   They nevertheless agreed, as did other educators, that the
number seems in keeping with the steep trajectory Internet use has
achieved in the past few years. By the time today's middle-school
students reach college, most of those interviewed predicted, they
will be prone to do the overwhelming majority of their work on
computers rather than in the stacks of libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a stunning rate, I think, more and more students are
finding the Net to be a very convenient resource that they know how
to use, that they feel comfortable using, that they can use in
their dorm rooms or anywhere else,'' said Linda Sax, the director
of the UCLA institute and a proponent of Internet use. ``It's not
always at the college's encouragement, of course, and I think most
schools and libraries are scrambling to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   That they are. Although no colleges or universities appear to
have devised campuswide standards or guidelines, professors and
departments are discussing the issue and formulating ideas on how
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   As one of his first acts when he assumed his job last year, for
instance, Stellar established a task force at Northeastern to study
how professors and students should use the Internet and to evaluate
the hazards of this resource.
</P>
<P>
   Similar committees are being set up across the country. Even at
schools where they're not, debate about the Internet's benefits and
pitfalls has become commonplace at faculty meetings and,
especially, at libraries where staff members are routinely being
retrained to become Net specialists.
</P>
<P>
   It appears a majority of professors nationwide have decided to
allow at least limited Internet sourcing for research papers and
other projects, and some encourage very wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Many still prohibit the practice, however, because they fear
students will not use other important resources, such as books and
journals, and will be unable to adequately judge the value or
validity of too much of the Web content they find.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, which was last year, we didn't do things
quite in the ways we do now,'' said Stanley Dodson, a zoology
professor at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson said he encourages his students to use the Net to
acquaint themselves with a subject, find general information, and
get leads on pertinent journals and books. But he doesn't allow
citations to Web sites in their papers.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at other colleges have adopted similarly cautious
approaches, even as they seem a bit awed by the technological
advances they are watching and trying to keep up with.
</P>
<P>
   Several common threads connect the teachers who have banned
Internet sourcing: They still permit Web use in some circumstances,
they predict the Internet will become the dominant
educational-research tool despite their qualms, and they
acknowledge that one major reason for their reluctance to allow
more use of the Internet probably is their sense that students know
more about it than they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to encourage students not to fall into a trap of
the Internet making things much easier for them and not allowing
them to learn all the research skills that they should,'' said
James Mandrell, a professor of comparative literature and film at
Brandeis. Smiling, he added, ``But I've got a murky suspicion that
my own limitations dictate some of my reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Runde, director of the International Center for Computer
Enhanced Learning at Wake Forest University in North Carolina,
predicts that most of the problems of the Internet will be remedied
over time. He said guidelines for evaluating sites will be
established, peer review and editing for on-line journals will be
instituted, lists of acceptable and unacceptable sites will be
compiled, and individual schools and professors will learn how to
assess various sites' worth just as they do with books today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Runde said, many college classes
eventually will have Web sites or Internet components of their own.
Constructing and maintaining those presumably will build skills for
teachers and students that will help them evaluate cyberspace
information.
</P>
<P>
   The professors, students, librarians, and college officials who
discussed the Internet issue last week agree that their foremost
concerns relate to assessing Web sites and learning how to use them
well. But they list other potential problems. Those range from
serious copyright questions, such as who owns the completed
research or works in progress on the Internet, to deep worries
about the Internet making it too easy for students to plagiarize or
to buy completed research papers from the scores of companies that
provide the service.
</P>
<P>
   Their reservations pale, however, when compared with the glowing
future the academics foresee for computerized research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there will be scams and there will be victims,
and there will be crimes and punishments we haven't even conceived
of yet,'' said Richard Larson, director of the Center for Advanced
Educational Services at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But he predicted that these ``growing pains'' of the Internet would
abate, and the US education system would become more mature as a
result.

FTC NOW TURNS TO ITS ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST INTEL

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``Wintel'' duopoly, as some have described the
domination of the computer industry by Microsoft's software and
Intel's hardware, is about to come under government assault on a
second front.
</P>
<P>
   With the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the
Microsoft Corp. wending its way to conclusion in a federal court
here, lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission are preparing to open
their trial against the Intel Corp. in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel case may wind up having a lower profile than the
Microsoft trial, and any penalties _ if Intel loses _ may not be
nearly as severe as what government lawyers may seek for Microsoft.
But the stakes for both the industry and Intel, the world's largest
maker of personal computer chips, are considerable all the same.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the government and the chip maker disclosed their
list of possible witnesses, and later this week the two sides will
file briefs detailing their theories of the case. But a broad
outline already has been sketched out in court papers. Despite some
crucial differences, the Microsoft and Intel cases fundamentally
are similar to the extent they involve the competing policy
interests of antitrust law and intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of similarities between the cases,'' said
Eleanor M. Fox, an authority on antitrust who teaches at the New
York University School of Law. ``Each company has control of 80 to
90 percent of its market, and both cases involve high-technology
intellectual property markets. Both cases also allege the dominance
of a monopoly firm by using its monopoly leverage to build a moat
around its power to prevent challenges that threaten control over
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are important differences between the Microsoft and
Intel cases over the facts and the law, as well as in procedures of
the two trials. The government is seeking a far more limited remedy
in the Intel case than it is contemplating in the Microsoft case.
There, the most extreme measure under consideration is the breakup
of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In Intel's case, the government simply wants the court to order
the company not to withhold its technical information from
customers who are also developing rival technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Intel's corporate future is not at stake, some
experts believe that if the company loses, the new ground rules
could have a long-term effect both on the profits of Intel and its
competitors and on computer prices generally. Chips are a much more
expensive component of personal computers than the operating system
software and Internet browsers at the center of the Microsoft
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Microsoft and the Intel cases present stark clash _
between the protections that intellectual property law is meant to
give companies and the protection of the public that antitrust law
are supposed to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual property law gives the holder of a patent a kind of
monopolistic protection over an invention or process. But under
antitrust law, companies with a monopoly position in a market are
not supposed to abuse their power by chilling potential competition
or innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused Intel of a pattern of squeezing other
developers of chip technology who are also big customers of Intel
into surrendering technological advances to Intel as a quid pro quo
for receiving crucial information from Intel. Lawyers at the
Federal Trade Commission charge that Intel denied or threatened to
deny information about its chips to three companies that use those
chips in their own products _ Compaq Computer, Digital Equipment
and Intergraph _ as a way of coercing them to license their
innovations to Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's conduct threatened to injure, and did injure, the
ability of those targeted customers to remain competitive in
developing and bringing to market in a timely manner computer
systems based on Intel's microprocessors,'' the FTC said in its
complaint. Government lawyers assert that Intel's decision to
withhold the information stifled innovation and development of new
chip technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Agency lawyers announced on Friday that the witnesses they plan
to call include executives from companies that have been Intel
customers. One is Robert B. Palmer, who was chairman and chief
executive of Digital Equipment until it was acquired last year by
Compaq. Another is James W. Meadlock, chairman and chief executive
of Intergraph, a Huntsville, Ala., company that supplies computer
hardware, software and services for corporate and engineering
customers, based on Microsoft and Intel technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has not contested many of the facts of the case. Rather,
the company has said that antitrust rules do not outlaw its
decision to withhold technical information from anyone as a way of
defending itself from possible competition. Intel executives also
contend that the agency will be unable to show that the company's
decision to withhold information from its customers resulted in any
harm to competition or kept chip prices artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that is not a classic antitrust case but an
effort by the staff of the FTC to create new law,'' says Chuck
Mulloy, an Intel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that it would take a different tack than Microsoft,
Intel announced on Friday that its witnesses might include its
chairman and co-founder, Andrew S. Grove, and its chief executive,
Craig R. Barrett, executives who not only transformed the industry
but also personify the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, by contrast, purposely kept its chairman and founder,
William H. Gates, and president, Steven A. Ballmer, from taking the
stand. Gates' evasive deposition, played on videotape in court by
Justice Department lawyers to great effect, has dented both the
company's image and its legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Procedurally, the Intel case is also on a far different footing
than Microsoft's. The Intel proceeding will be heard by an
administrative law judge, James P. Timony, who has been on the
bench since 1976 and before that was a lawyer at the agency,
Administrative law judges, who work for the government's executive
branch, not the judiciary, are the professional referees of the
federal agencies. Both Intel and the FTC have won and lost their
share of pretrial skirmishes before Timony.
</P>
<P>
   If Intel loses in the administrative proceeding, and also at the
next level _ before the full commission _ the company would have
the right to select the federal circuit court in which to file its
appeal. ``Court shopping'' gives Intel to ability to select the
appeals circuit with the least stringent interpretation of
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is defending itself before a federal judge, Thomas
Penfield Jackson, whom it had sought to have removed from the case
because of his previous rulings against the company. If Microsoft
loses, it would have no choice but to proceed to the federal
appeals court in the District of Columbia _ not necessarily an
undesirable situation for Microsoft, since last year the court
handed Microsoft a major victory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beyond the contrasts of the two cases, and the similarities, are
some odd common threads _ including a six-degree-of-separation
aspect to some of the lawyerly relationships. A few years ago, for
example, Intel's main trial lawyer, Robert E. Cooper, beat David
Boies, the Justice Department's marquee lawyer in the Microsoft
trial, in a predatory price fixing case brought by Continental
Airlines and Northwest Airlines against American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Intel's public relations war with the government
has been at a lower decibel level than Microsoft's, its legal
maneuvering has been just as bare-knuckled. Court filings made
public this month show that Intel's lawyers secretly and
unsuccessfully attempted to knock the government's top trial
lawyer, Richard G. Parker, out of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had done legal work for the chip maker Advanced Micro
Devices Inc., an Intel competitor, before joining the government.
In that capacity, he was involved in responding to an FTC request
for information during the agency's investigation of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In denying Intel's request to remove Parker, Timony found that
the lawyer's participation in the proceeding would violate no
ethics rules, a finding that was also made by both the agency's
ethics lawyer and the Office of Government Ethics.

 Virus worms its way into heart of Eudora  
 By Jack Warner   
 c. 1999 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As physicians are wont to tell us when we drag ourselves to the
infirmary suffering from something they can't diagnose, there's a
nasty bug going around.
</P>
<P>
   It got into my computer's sinus cavities numerous times in the
past week or two, and eventually caused me considerable grief.
</P>
<P>
   This particular infection arrives via the Internet in a program
called Happy99.exe. If you spend much time in cyberspace, you've
almost certainly heard about it even if you haven't contracted it.
It generally gets into your computer by way of an attachment to an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It is not technically a virus, but a worm. Most of us don't care
whether it's a virus or a worm or a garter snake; to non-technical
weenies it's basically a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically at least, it can't hurt you unless you execute it.
If you do execute it, it quietly insinuates itself amongst your
Internet programs and attaches itself to every message you send.
You don't know it's doing this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Happy99 is not, apparently, destructive, but it has certainly
created a ruckus on some mailing lists to which I belong. Folks
kept passing it back and forth. Joe had no sooner got his system
free of the thing than Phil sent it to him. Joe got enraged with
Phil, who of course didn't know he had the thing in the first
place, let alone had passed it on. Joe didn't know he had gotten it
from Phil until he received an outraged message from Howard.
</P>
<P>
   My mail program, Eudora Pro, downloads attachments into a
specified directory automatically. It got to where I went to that
directory immediately after closing Eudora and looked for ol'
Happy. Sometimes I found two or three iterations of it. I simply
deleted them and went on my way. After a while, though, things got
more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   One evening Eudora was downloading a boatload of mail and I was
watching the process, slack-jawed and half asleep. I had barely
noticed it was downloading Happy when half my monitor went to black
and the rest to a gaudy pinstriped pattern and the entire machine
seized up like a rusty engine.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed, I rebooted, started up Windows Explorer and went to my
download directory to find Happy and delete it. The instant the
program scrolled into view, the machine seized up again. Rebooting
again, I tried the Quickfind feature. No sooner did it find
Happy99.exe than the machine froze.
</P>
<P>
   I've never heard of such a thing. After the next reboot, I
turned Norton Antivirus loose on it. When it found Happy99, it
singled the thing out as a virus, but could not repair it. It was
able to delete the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The agony was not over, however. It seems Eudora, having been
abruptly thwarted in its download, decided it hadn't downloaded
anything. It started from the top again, and when it got to that
infernal file, it seized up the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tech support at my ISP, MindSpring, could look into my mailbox,
but they couldn't tell which message had Happy attached to it.
Rather than dump the entire box full of mail, the tech rep steered
me to http://www.mailstart.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you provide this site your mail address and password, it will
go to your mailbox and present you with a list of your mail. It
doesn't download any of it, however, until told to do so. Thus I
was able to poke around and get whatever mail looked like it might
be of interest, and then dump the whole lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   If you slog around on the Internet and indulge in e-mail, you
might want to make a note of www.mailstart.com. In the meantime,
I'm going to see about updating Eudora.

 Case Study _ A Look at Mr. America Online  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who would be online king calmly leans back into a hotel
lobby sofa and politely explains how America Online became an
American icon.
</P>
<P>
   Without raising his voice or wagging an I-told-you-so finger,
AOL chief executive Steve Case clinically and succinctly describes
how AOL stuck to its long-held plan and proved a legion of
techno-snobs wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy has always been crystal clear,'' Case said.
``Consumers want a central location where they can find good
content. And they want someone to make it easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has the sheen of an overnight success, but in fact, Case's
willpower and years of persistance are what propelled it to the top
of the Internet heap.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, its revenues topped $2.6 billion, making it the most
profitable online company. The Dulles, Va., firm's market value is
nearly $75 billion, dwarfing Ford Motor Co. and vaulting Case into
the Parthenon of high-tech superstars. His stock holdings are
valued at more than $1 billion, based on AOL's stock price of
$160.38. And technology experts have anointed Case as the most
serious challenger to Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' mantle as high
tech's 800-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is a triumph of Steve Case's marketing skills,'' said Dave
Cassel, editor of AOL Watch, a Berkeley Web site. ``They have
flourished despite a series of technical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   What is all the more remarkable is that the shy, unassuming Case
has engineered a dramatic turnaround _ from a company in constant
crisis just two years ago to a dominant player that has some
whispering the ``M'' word.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's enormous clout allows it to charge retailers and
advertisers steep prices for space on its sites, sparking
speculation that antitrust investigators might consider it a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the one thing the world needs the least: another
giant, powerful and synergistic information hydra,'' online
essayist Jon Katz wrote following AOL's announcement that it would
buy Netscape. ``We don't finally have some competition for
Microsoft. We just have another Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a theory that rankles the normally stoic Case, who was in
San Francisco last week for whirlwind meetings and a speech at the
Commonwealth Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we were irrelevant, and now we're too powerful,''
Case said in what amounts to trash talking for him. ``I find that
argument silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything remotely monopolistic,'' he continued.
``We have a little over half of the online audience, and there are
plenty of competitors _ ranging from 5,000 (Internet service
providers) and startups to big-momma companies like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
and Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   With 16 million paying subscribers, AOL reaches as many homes as
cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc., and it adds about 12,000
users a day. On weeknights during prime time, the number of people
plugged into AOL peaks at 1 million, outdrawing CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, users spend an average of 55 minutes a day
logged on to AOL, compared with 14 minutes in 1996. All told, more
than half of the nation's cybersurfers use AOL in some capacity _
either by subscribing to the service or by visiting its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for Case, 40, who got his start developing
toppings at Pizza Hut before joining Control Video Corp., AOL's
predecessor, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many credit him with bringing the Net to the masses. Want
proof? The chirpy message with which it greets subscribers was the
title of the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan hit movie ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This company pioneered the model of content and access: You
spend $22 (a month) to get specific information,'' said Jim
Balderston, an analyst at Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City. ``A
lot of companies would kill to have anyone pay for their service.
This is a media powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9,000-person companyhas snapped up rival CompuServe Corp.,
whacked Prodigy's online service, fended off Microsoft and AT&AMP;T and
is on the verge of completing a $4.2 billion acquisition of
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's most recent deals showcase its caginess about where the
market is headed and what consumers want. It purchased cutting-edge
technologies that offer instant messages with sound over the Net
and soon will make the Internet available on TV sets. AOL also
reportedly is in discussions to buy a piece of eBay, the popular
San Jose online auction company.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, hardly anyone would have expected AOL to
be at the forefront of the Internet. It has weathered hostile
takeover bids from Microsoft and AT&AMP;T, several technical meltdowns
of its online service in 1996 and 1997, and persistent sniping from
the online elite who dismiss it as ``the McDonald's of
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   While others engaged in strategy du jour, AOL remained steady
and plowed ahead with the same game plan. For more than a decade,
Case has focused on building an audience by offering an easy-to-use
Internet service for the rest of us. AOL is not so much the
McDonald's of cyberspace as the Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Case is ``like a metronome,'' says an executive at a rival
company, who asked not to be identified. ``He stuck to his guns,
and now he's one of the most powerful people in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has become a bellwether indicator for the
Internet market, climbing more than sixfold last year, and should
continue its ascent on a wave of Wall Street lust for Net stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming its new blue-chip status, AOL has joined the
prestigious Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index this year, displacing
Venator, formerly Woolworth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the digerati, the Internet's elite crowd that
pooh-poohed AOL for catering to the masses, have dropped or toned
down their disdain after concluding that Silicon Valley companies
did not pay enough attention to what the average consumer wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were wrong about AOL,'' Marc Andreessen, the
Netscape co-founder who recently became AOL chief technology
officer, said recently. ``They gave the public what it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has mastered the technique of capturing _ and retaining _
the ``eyeballs'' of consumers by using a variety of chat rooms,
instant messages, e-mail and online shopping sites. Users of its
proprietary network and AOL.com site spend an average of 246
minutes a month on AOL, tops among online services, according to
MediaMetrix in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL could get even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   According to Case, about 25 percent of American homes _ or 60
million people _ are connected to the Internet, and their numbers
are growing fast. Seven years ago this month, when AOL went public,
only 3 percent of the country was wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in the second or third inning. It's still early,''
Case said. ``Three-fourths of the public doesn't have an Internet
connection, and we can't assume that they're going to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make things easier for those folks,'' he said.
``There is plenty of work to be done.''

ON-LINE JOB SEARCHES GIVE NEWSPAPERS A RUN FOR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GEORGE RAINE   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Mike Gnoss was looking for a job in
December, he turned to the Internet instead of the newspaper want
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude was that once it was in the paper, the job was
pretty old, and I didn't have time to look through the ads, to do
any of that leg work,'' Gnoss said. ``I just cut to the chase. I
told Career Central.com to send me what fits my criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnoss, 30, had just graduated with a master's degree in business
administration from the University of Southern California and knew
that he wanted to work in the San Francisco area, in the food
industry, in a finance-related position. He entered these criteria
in his posting at Palo Alto-based Career Central's Web site
(www.careercentral.com), and within a few weeks he accepted a job
in the corporate finance department of Chevys Fresh Mex. He now
forecasts the restaurant chain's future.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two years, the future of job and candidate
searching has changed with the extraordinary rise of Internet-based
services and employers' using their own Web pages to recruit
directly.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech workers and companies have been the first to adapt to
the new technology, eschewing print classifieds, threatening a
reliable newspaper revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   The American newspaper industry, with annual classified
advertising revenues of $19 billion in 1998, has watched the change
with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be newspapers,'' said Renee LaBran, vice
president for classified advertising, new media and print at the
Los Angeles Times. ``Are we immune from being affected by the
Internet? Not a chance. We will see some of our business migrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that help-wanted classified advertising sales have
dipped in the past four months at newspapers in technology-heavy
regions of the country for a variety of reasons. Ad sales are
cyclical in nature and are affected by economic forces, but one of
them is the rising tide of Internet-based services.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, we've probably dropped our print ad
budget by 60 to 70 percent,'' said Diane Schlageter, director of
employment at Adobe Systems Inc. in San Jose, the nation's largest
maker of desktop publishing and graphics software. ``A half-page ad
in the San Jose Mercury News may be $15,000 to $18,000. You can do
a lot of stuff on-line for that amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet as a human resources tool provides a more focused
applicant pool at less cost. This ``has been the most fundamental
shift I have seen in this business in 20 years,'' Schlageter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting group Forrester Research
Inc. issued a recent report, ``Goodbye to Classifieds,'' showing
that business will spend more and more money on Internet job
advertising. Of the 6 million businesses in the United States,
Forrester estimated that only 15,000 are recruiting on-line today,
but pervasive Internet access will drive the figure to 124,000 by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to conducting paid searches for prospective
employees through the growing number of Internet job service
providers, companies are posting positions on their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Industrial Light and Magic in San Rafael,
creators of marvelous visual effects, where Rick Ross, recruiting
manager for parent Lucas Digital, seeks gifted computer scientists
and artists from among the 100 resumes he receives daily. Some 75
percent of them arrive via the Internet (www.ilm-jobs.com).
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the Web has greatly expedited the recruiting process,
especially in assessing the technical skills of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing the impossible here, and it's important to have
people who can communicate both with a keyboard and verbally
because it's a team environment,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross added, however, that technology isn't very helpful in
measuring communications skills and judgment, so there is still
some conventional human resource filtering to do.
</P>
<P>
   On-line help-wanted services say technology allows them to match
candidates' strengths and interests to job openings quickly and
accurately _ faster and generally less expensively than advertising
in a newspaper. The services don't charge people who post resumes
or surf for openings. They earn their revenues by charging
employers who use the site to find workers.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is fierce in this fast-growing sector. Profitability
has so far eluded most sites as they pump revenues into keeping up
with the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders in terms of numbers of job seekers and employer
clients are Monster.com (www.monster.com), Career Mosaic
(www.careermosaic.com) and Career Path (www.careerpath.com).
</P>
<P>
   Hotjobs (www.hotjobs.com) and Monster.com spent millions of
dollars on Super Bowl advertising. For New York-based Hotjobs, that
was a reach: Its 1998 revenues were $4 million, yet it spent $2
million on advertising. It was necessary, said company president
Richard Johnson, because the Internet world is evolving rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, newspapers responded to the changing classified
industry by forming CareerPath.com (www.careerpath.com), which is
owned by the nation's eight largest newspaper companies _ The New
York Times Co., Times-Mirror, Tribune Co., Knight-Ridder Corp.,
Washington Post Co., Cox Newspapers, Gannett and the Hearst
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 300,000 job listings on the Los
Angeles-based site, by far the largest of any such service,
according to Stephen Ste. Marie, CareerPath's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In January CareerPath had some 8 million job searches, a 71
percent increase over searches completed a month earlier. It
offers, among other listings, jobs from 83 affiliate newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Its pitch to advertisers is that they can pay once to have their
message appear both in affiliate newspapers and on-line at
CareerPath.com. ``No one else can do that,'' Ste. Marie said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While heeding change, some newspaper executives are skeptical
about whether the Internet is truly revolutionizing recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every article about this reads, `Golly, gee whiz ... It's
incredible that somebody found a job on the Internet,' and they
forget that thousands of people are finding their jobs in
newspapers every day,'' said Charlie Diederich, director of
recruitment advertising at the Newspaper Association of America in
the Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Diederich considers Internet recruiting ``a wake-up call for the
newspaper industry,'' but he smells hype. ``I could be the guy who
is saying buggy whips will always be or men will always wear hats,
but radio did not replace papers and TV did not displace radio, nor
has cable displaced TV. All of these things have created new
opportunities for papers.''

BAHA'I DRAWS MULTIPLICITY OF WORSHIPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most intractable problems facing religious
congregations in America is a lack of diversity. As many scholars
and theologians have noted, weekend worship services remain one of
the most segregated segments of American society.
</P>
<P>
   It is still rare to walk into a house of worship and find an
audience that even remotely reflects the country's growing
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   But there is at least one small exception to this trend _
worshipers in the Baha'i faith, a religion founded in Iran in the
19th century that now has nearly 6 million practitioners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, 1,500 Baha'is are a veritable United Nations
of the faithful _ African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, and
immigrants from China, Japan, Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, and several
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Racial and ethnic harmony is one of the tenets of Baha'i, which
was founded by Baha'u'llah, an Iranian spiritual leader who sought
to establish a religion that could cultivate a more egalitarian
world without competing with other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all members of one family,'' explained Julie Pau, a
native of Malaysia who studies at Lesley College in Cambridge,
Mass. ``We all have the same color blood. The idea of world unity
is a very appealing aspect of Baha'i.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing core beliefs of the Baha'i faith
involve its teachings about the oneness of all religions. Baha'i
holds that God has revealed himself throughout history through
divinely inspired messengers, including Abraham, Moses, Jesus,
Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, and Baha'u'llah himself.
</P>
<P>
   The teachings of these messengers varied to meet the needs and
challenges of the times. Within this framework, Baha'u'llah claimed
that Baha'i is a reflection of God's message for our times. While
rituals and traditions may vary, Baha'is believe that they all
share common themes of social and economic justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read the Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Bible, native
American mythology, and so on, they all speak to the same
principles,'' said Robin Chandler, a professor at Northeastern
University who was introduced to Baha'i as a teenager. ``As Baha'is
we are being asked to return to those essential principles so we
can achieve the peace God expects of all of us. Baha'i principles
are marching orders from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those principles are the elimination of the gap between
poor and rich, the importance of education, and recognition that
science and religion can coexist. Baha'is are expected to embrace
chastity and monogamy, pray daily, and observe an annual period of
fasting. The faith has no clergy but is governed by elected bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Baha'is worldwide run environmental and economic development
projects as well as schools and literacy programs. In Boston, the
Baha'i community runs a school that teaches English as a second
language.
</P>
<P>
   Many practitioners find the Baha'i faith's utopian goal
particularly appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baha'i made so much sense to me in many different ways,
particularly the idea that we are to bring people together,'' said
Soroush Shakib, a computer engineer who was born in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shakib's parents were Baha'is, that did not
automatically make Shakib a Baha'i. Baha'i requires its followers
to choose the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told to investigate for ourselves and make sure that
our beliefs are in line with Baha'i,'' Shakib said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Changiz Geula, a professor at Harvard Medical School who
also was born in Iran, said, ``There was a newness and progressive
quality about Baha'i that made me feel I had no other choice but to
be a Baha'i.''
</P>
<P>
   Baha'i has been one of the fastest-growing religions of the past
century. ``We're just in the first 150 years of what we feel is a
new dispensation from God,'' said Chandler, the Northeastern
professor. ``We don't expect the achievement of what sounds like a
utopian world to happen any time soon. It will take several hundred
years before we even begin to see glimmers of solutions to the
world's problems.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Same-sex declaration
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 Massachusetts clergy representing different faiths
have signed a declaration supporting civil marriage rights for
same-sex couples. ``For a lot of people this is the next frontier
in the struggle for civil rights,'' said Rabbi Howard Berman, one
of the coordinators of the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to
Marry. ``Ultimately it's a test of how genuine the civil rights of
all Americans are.''
</P>

   The issue of same-sex marriage rights has become a major battle
between gay rights advocates and conservative religious groups. A
bill filed in December in the state Legislature would forbid the
recognition of same-gender civil marriages. A similar federal bill
was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton two years
ago.

MORE BAD NEWS ON THE IMPEACHMENT FRONT 
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yet another bad thing about that impeachment
trial: Strom Thurmond woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 96-year-old senator from South Carolina wants to triple
the federal tax on wine.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy strikes again. The conservative Republican who once
opposed the federal government when it came to integrating blacks
and whites wants to use the federal government to punish makers of
reds and whites. Bad priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond is mad at the wine industry, partly because his
daughter was killed by a drunken driver, but mainly because
vintners are putting labels on wine suggesting it has health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Health benefits, hell. If it weren't for wine, there wouldn't be
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, what do you suppose Thurmond considers a well-aged
wine? Something from Thomas Jefferson's cellar, perhaps. As for
Jefferson's ideas, he wouldn't have a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   This is America and everybody wants to pass a law banning or
taxing things they don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my idea: For every new law or tax that's passed, an old
law or tax has to be taken off the books. And anybody who claims to
be doing something for ``the children'' should be forced to watch
an endless loop of ``Teletubbies'' tapes.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Christian Action Network says it's launching
a national campaign to put homosexual content labels, ``HC,'' on
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead to problems. Would networks be required to put
an HC on ``Spartacus,'' ``Wizard of Oz'' or all those Charlton
Heston-in-a-Roman-skirt movies?
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Action Network also surveyed its members'
attitudes toward Disney. Sample questions and results:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe Disney should have `Gay Pride Days' at Disney
World in Orlando, Florida?'' Results: 0-Yes, 11,172-No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe Disney should assault religious faith?''
Results: 1-Yes, 11,172-No.
</P>
<P>
   Who was that one who voted yes? Strom, put down the
questionnaire and go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Where was this tidbit when we needed it? Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., points out that two of the leading House prosecutors of
President Clinton, men who kept lecturing us about sexual
harassment, opposed and gutted sexual harassment legislation in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., capped damages for victims of
on-the-job sexual harassment at $30,000. A Democratic congressman
then recalled the case of a woman whose co-workers exposed their
buttocks to her.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, according to the Congressional Quarterly Almanac
of 1990, Henry Hyde, R-Ill., added the distasteful comment that
``someone can show me their buttocks all day if I can get $30,000
per view.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who bemoans the decline of American
civilization. Well, he got his metaphorical mooning by the majority
of the American people, but not the $30,000. How does it feel now?
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is promoting a bill she has co-sponsored with Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif. The proposal would allocate $1.4 billion every
year to a fund to create parks, conserve open space and preserve
historic sites. The money would come from offshore oil fees already
collected by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Call it part of the impeachment trial recovery process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speakers kept getting up and saying, `This is the most
important vote you're ever going to make,''' Boxer said of the
impeachment vote. ```Really?' I thought. I don't want this vote to
be my most important vote.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she now wants to move on to bigger things in the fields
of education, gun control and, of course, the environment.
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask Boxer what it was like to be in the Senate during
Clinton's trial. It was bad enough watching it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being a prisoner of war,'' she said. ``If (Senate
Minority Leader Tom) Daschle and (Majority Leader Trent) Lott let
us out for a 10-minute bathroom break we were grateful to them the
same way prisoners of war are grateful to their captors for small
favors.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said Republican and Democratic senators felt the same way,
and grew closer. ``It was equal opportunity torture.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked if she had any advice for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
considering a run for the Senate in New York. ``Go ahead and do
it,'' she said she would tell Hillary. Then she added: ``I must
admit I am being selfish. I want her there. I don't know if it's in
her best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know either. Her opponent would be New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, and he's meaner than any vast right-wing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has already made the mistake of advocating a Palestinian
state, which in New York can hurt a candidate.

HE'S THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE SOX' HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The torch is officially passed. In the Red
Sox relay of this half-century, it has been handed down from Ted
Williams to Carl Yastrzemski to Jim Rice to Roger Clemens to Mo
Vaughn . . . and now to Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar is nothing like those who came before him. He is an
X-Games, on-line, World Cup kind of guy. The only things Old Timey
about Nomar are his haircut and his game. Sox manager Jimy Williams
said it best when he observed, ``It's like he's been here before.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is some Ty Cobb in the old soul of the Sox
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was be part of the first full workout for all Sox
players at the club's minor league complex on the Gulf Coast
Wednesday (Feb. 24). Tuesday he did the obligatory new year
stand-up interview with a couple of dozen members of the media
corps. Like Williams and Rice before him, he seems pained by the
process of spreading the gospel of baseball to fans in the frozen
North. Nomar would be happiest if he could just give us his game
and go home, but the resident Red Sox superstar is obliged to talk
baseball occasionally. Almost always, Garciaparra sounds like he's
probably going to miss Mo's protection in the clubhouse more than
in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind it,'' Garciaparra said when asked about his new
spokesman status. ``It's a matter of respect. I understand you guys
got a job to do. I understood the way it works over the years. As
long as everybody understands that I've got a job to do. There's
certain times I've got to be focused. I've got a job to do and
that's my first priority. As long as everybody knows the rules and
we all work together, we can be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you get used to or relish or get concerned
about. My concern is my job and I don't want to get taken away from
what I've got to do. I just don't like anything getting in the way.
My job's out there, it ain't in here. I don't think about it. I'm
not going to change. I'm out there to win a World Series. That's my
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra and Vaughn are close. Nomar said they've spoken
frequently since Vaughn's departure. It's too bad Linda Tripp
wasn't around with her handy-dandy wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can take Mo's spot, what Mo's done for
the team and the community and everything,'' said Nomar. ``You
can't replace a guy like Mo. But nobody's looking to do that.
Everybody's still themselves. We've still got a great ball club.
Everybody's got their personalities and there's no need to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the notion that he won't see as many strikes without
Mo in the lineup to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that at all,'' he said. ``I've got to
go out and play my game. I'm not gonna change anything. You just
make adjustments. We still have great people hitting in the lineup.
Last year it wasn't just Mo, it wasn't just me, it was everybody.
We didn't lose everybody. We lost Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra speaks in a nervous, quick cadence. Issuing his
standard answers, he sometimes breaks into a smile for no apparent
reason. He might be a candidate for John Dennis's interview
academy, but Tuesday he was at his best with the microphone folk.
He even made a little joke when asked if he heard about Clemens
going to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one I don't see how you could miss,'' he said. ``They
even said a news report in the middle of `Friends' while I was
watching. I thought it was part of the series, but it wasn't. What
are you gonna do? We can't worry about the Yankees. We have to
worry about ourselves. The hard thing is we don't have Mo. But
we've got the same attitude this year that we had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra went to Ted Williams's hitters museum earlier in the
month and spent time talking with the Splendid One. It was there
that Williams said Nomar has a chance to become one of baseball's
all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering,'' he said. ``Ted Williams is unbelievable. I
love talking to Ted. I have so much respect for him and just to be
next to him is unbelievable. I love old-school baseball. I don't
follow people's numbers or stats. I just love the way the game was
back then. They played hard and enjoyed it. I think it's coming
back that way.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Sox were eliminated by the Indians at Fenway last
October, Garciaparra was the last Boston player to leave the field
and didn't disappear until he had applauded the Fenway legions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tremendous year,'' he said. ``The end was
disappointing. We truly believed we were going all the way and at
the end we had that all in our hearts. People wrote us off, but
those fans in the stands were there every day, supporting us all
year, pulling us through. I just wanted to thank them. It was
really them that was showing the positive energy. They're there
every day supporting us and we appreciate that. I felt like it was
the fans and ourselves out there playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read headlines or reports. I don't need anybody else
to tell me how we're playing. I know myself. Last year the only
people who believed in us were ourselves and our fans. We shocked
everybody who was negative against us. I don't pay attention to it.
Why am I going to waste my energy on that when I know what's going
on myself?''
</P>
<P>
   So he won't read about himself. And he won't pay any attention
to where the media pick the 1999 Red Sox to finish. He'll just keep
working to improve his already glorious game. And that should be
enough.

BRIDGING THE WORLDS OF REAL AND DIGITAL

 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It only takes a split-second. The car hits the lamppost or the
brick wall or the other vehicle, and a set of microscopic silicon
fingers detects the deadly deceleration that could send the
driver's face smashing into the steering wheel. The silicon fingers
twitch just enough to release an electrical pulse. And just like
that, the car's air bags inflate and save somebody's life.
</P>
<P>
   The silicon fingers are part of an accelerometer _ a device for
measuring changes in speed. Accelerometers used to be bulky,
expensive devices, but this one is inside a microchip the size of a
thumbnail. And chips like this one are made by the millions at a
nondescript factory in Cambridge, Mass., by an unglamorous Norwood,
Mass. firm called Analog Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerometer chip takes a real-world event _ the slamming
impact of a car crash _ and translates it into an electronic
signal. That is Analog Devices' specialty _ chips that mediate
between the messy, imprecise world of sound and motion and the
sharp, precise universe of digital information managed by computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real-world signal processing,'' is how Analog's chairman Ray
Stata describes it. Stata cofounded the firm in 1965, back when it
focused on the comparatively simple business of amplifying analog
signals, like voices through a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Analog signals move in waves. But computers work with data in
sharply-defined sets of numbers. So if you want to pump sound or
motion or some other analog information through a computer, you've
first got to digitize it. The latest digital cell phones turn the
caller's voice into a stream of data packets. The voice on the
other end arrives as a stream of digital data which must be turned
back into analog sound. And there's a good chance that chips from
Analog Devices are doing the converting.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good business to be in. According to the Semiconductor
Industry Association, worldwide sales of analog chips should pass
$24 billion this year. Rapid growth is expected through the turn of
the century, as the chips appear in phones and personal digital
assistants like the 3Com Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analog industry is known to be the most stable in the
semiconductor business,'' says Stata, who's serving as chairman of
the SIA this year. ``There's just hundreds and hundreds of
companies that buy a little, but it all adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that Analog Devices makes about 800 different chip
products, each tailored to a particular application. ``The lion's
share of our products are proprietary and there are no second
sources,'' said Jerald Fishman, Analog's president and chief
executive. ``We don't make commodity products that five or six
other companies produce.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why Analog Devices was able to keep its head above water
in 1998, a nasty year in the chip business because of excess
production capacity. SIA estimates that industry revenues fell 10
percent during the year, but Analog's revenue of $1.23 billion was
only slightly lower than in 1997. Net income of $119 million was
down from $178 million in 1997 because of price pressure in some
parts of Analog's business.
</P>
<P>
   Stata is predicting an upturn for the entire semiconductor
industry this year, but thinks Analog Devices can do even better,
partly because of its intense focus on one of the hottest chip
markets _ the devices that process incoming signals after they've
been translated into digital form.
</P>
<P>
   These chips are called digital signal processors. Each DSP is a
computer in its own right. But processors like Intel Corp.'s famous
Pentium series are all-purpose devices, designed to do many kinds
of computing reasonably well. DSPs do just a few things with
stunning speed.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine someone making a phone call from his car. Today's
digital cell phones can filter out the extraneous noises _ the
humming of the motor and shifting of the gears, for instance. This
is possible because of a DSP inside the phone that detects the
noises and deletes them instantly. Doing this requires processing
speeds of a hundred million calculations per second, or more. Not
long ago, that would have required a supercomputer. Today it takes
one DSP chip that costs a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The electronics industry has a seemingly limitless hunger for
these chips. The SIA says industrywide DSP revenues grew an
estimated 23 percent in 1998 to $3.9 billion. They expect DSP sales
to hit $8 billion by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want DSPs,'' said Tom Starnes, a chip industry
analyst for Dataquest in Austin, Texas. ``They want cellular
phones, they want hard drives, they want modems. And they want them
to go faster and faster all the time. And to do that, you need
digital signal processors.''
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices is an also-ran in the DSP business, trailing not
only Texas Instruments Inc., but also Lucent Technologies Inc. and
Motorola Inc. But Analog is making a bid to enter the first rank of
DSP suppliers. On Feb. 3, the company announced a joint development
agreement with Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips.
The two firms will design a new generation of DSPs for small, cheap
computing devices, such as palm-sized computers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives Analog access to Intel's brightest chip
engineers, who will work with an Analog team at a facility in
Austin. Perhaps most important, it means that the thousands of
engineers and programmers worldwide who design products around
Intel technologies will also begin designing for Analog products.
``From a marketing perspective, it gives them a whole lot of
additional leverage,'' said technology analyst Drew Peck of SG
Cowen in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To further bolster its DSP know-how, Analog earlier this month
acquired White Mountain DSP Inc. of Nashua, and agreed to buy
Edinburgh Portable Compilers of Edinburgh. Both companies make
software tools are used in the design of DSPs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Analog is well positioned for the expected boom in
high-speed Internet services. The company makes chips used to
provide ADSL, a high-speed data technology that works over standard
phone lines. The nation's major phone companies are committed to
deploying ADSL services to millions of homes and businesses this
year. Much of the underlying technology was developed by Aware Inc.
of Bedford, Mass., which has a strategic alliance with Analog.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's micromachining _ the complex process of building
tiny machines in silicon. Analog's air bag sensor is a
micromachine, with moving parts thinner than a hair. Fishman said
that micromachines make up only a trivial percentage of the
company's income. Still, he notes that his company has about
one-third of the world market for air bag activation sensors, and
that the business will turn profitable this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Stata predicts a wave of new applications that could create
a vast market for the micromachines. Microsoft Corp. already makes
a game controller which lets a player move through the game by
tilting the device in his hands. The Analog devices accelerometer
chip inside is so sensitive, it can detect the changing position of
the controller and alter the action on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at the bleeding edge,'' said analyst Drew Peck. A
risky place to be, but often it's where the money is.

BAY AREA EYES WATER ROUTES AROUND ITS GRIDLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gleaming icons of the Pacific Rim, they soar
above San Francisco Bay in Art Deco majesty. As artifacts of
beauty, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge to Oakland are
impressive tourist destinations. But as commuter routes, these
60-year-old engineering feats are inefficient, mostly because they
are parking lots several hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, the petulant handmaiden of prosperity, is a favorite
topic of conversation in the counties surrounding the bay: Were you
stuck on the bridge the other night for hours? When does the rush
hour really begin now? Does it ever end?
</P>
<P>
   Few Californians rely solely on politicians for answers,
especially the business leaders who bankroll the Bay Area Council,
a private-public partnership that ``promotes economic prosperity
and quality of life in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the council hopes to revive the ferry system that
criss-crossed the bay In the 1930s. Before the bridges, ferries
carried 50 million passengers annually. After the bridges, highways
approaching them proliferated, as did traffic jams. By 1958, the
nadir of disinvestment in urban development in America, ferries had
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Increased traffic and natural disasters, like mudslides near the
Golden Gate Bridge, resurrected ferry service. Some 3.5 million
people used water transit last year, to and from Vallejo, Larkspur,
Tiburon, Sausalito, Alameda, and Oakland. Most were satisfied with
a smoother, safer, more reliable ride.
</P>
<P>
   Then, let's do it right, suggests a Bay Area Council study,
outlining a $2 billion plan for fast and frequent ferries early in
the new century. A two-stage program would begin with a $680
million plan for 28 new terminals with 75 ferries traveling 440
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will pay for all this?'' is the question most people ask
after admiring the concept. This question is seldom asked about the
massive highway building and rebuilding constantly underway here.
</P>
<P>
   Like the queen in ``Alice in Wonderland,'' Californians are
known to believe several impossible things before breakfast. Every
day since 1956, they have believed that freeways are free. That was
the year President Eisenhower signed the bill creating the
Interstate Highway System, providing 90 percent funding for major
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Highways depend on federal and state gas taxes, so it is
somebody's money, a total of $4.5 million, according to the
Metropolitan Transit Commission. Few holler about highway costs
because the commission estimates that traffic will increase by 249
percent in 2020 if current trends don't change. Maybe by then, a
trifle late, an alternative to automobile travel may be attractive.
</P>
<P>
   California loves the automobile so much that it spends billions
just to stay still. The Cypress Freeway in Oakland, replaced after
a 1989 earthquake, was finally finished last year at a cost of $900
million. This project did not add capacity to the Bay Area's
transportation system. Nor will retrofitting the east span of the
Bay Bridge, which will cost $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   No, freeways are not free, and they are notoriously fragile in
earthquakes, a fact of life here. In the council's study listing 28
new sites, a terminal's functions are often catalogued ``commuter;
recreational; disaster recovery.'' Boats can still travel after an
earthquake while some freeways turn to jelly.
</P>
<P>
   Many potential ferry docks are already available in abandoned
military bases, from Moffett Field near San Jose to the Oakland
Army Base to the Presidio in San Francisco and to the north and
east at Hamilton Air Force Base and Mare Island. These sites are
also being eyed by housing developers for some of the 10 million
new Californians demographers expect in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says that higher tolls and gas taxes should pay for
an efficient, pleasant alternative to the automobile, but to a
Californian, common sense can wilt at the first whiff of carbon
monoxide.

DEER HUNTING IN THE 'HOOD

<P>
   Even the dog is beginning to look askance when I wake him at
dawn to go deer hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz treasures nothing so much as his morning walk, but his
brown eyes have been full of suspicion lately when I rouse him from
his favorite chair at first light. He does not know what to make of
a mistress suddenly so obsessed with stalking deer.
</P>

   It's not clear when they arrived in this neighborhood of
quarter-acre lots. They have probably been here all along, living
quietly in the wooded cemetery on the hill. In the last week,
they've wandered down among us, their sleek, graceful movements
belying their enormous size as they bound through backyards and
graze in the small groves of trees tucked between rows of
center-entrance colonials and split-levels.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I've seen them myself, mind you. I am sustained by the
reports of others. From my spouse, who caught sight of an enormous
buck on a solitary run across the Berens' front yard. From my kids,
who at dusk saw four does slip out of the narrow stand of trees
between the Doyle and Donahue homes.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, you say. It is hardly news that the deer population is
on the rise in Massachusetts; deer are such a common sight in many
suburbs that some homeowners consider the magnificent creatures
nothing more than tick-carrying, traffic-stopping, shrub-devouring
nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   This is a personal thing, one urban woman agog that there are
big, wild animals roaming through her very own suburban 'hood! Grow
up in the city and a rat running along the railroad tracks or a
skunk snoozing under the back porch is what passes for wildlife.
There were no deer sightings on our dead-end street in North
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   As kids, my best friend, Frances, and I would sit on her front
porch in the summer fantasizing about the lives we would make in
the country someday. We collected stuffed animals, instead of
dolls. We did not begrudge Snow White or Sleeping Beauty their
princes; we envied them the rabbits and owls and deer that cavorted
with them in those technicolor glens.
</P>
<P>
   At our adjoining country homes, we imagined, Frances would raise
horses and dogs. I would raise dogs and sheep. Not that either one
of us had ever been to the country or knew anything about horses or
sheep. It was a city kid's fantasy of life at the other extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Frances actually got there. I made it only as far as the
suburbs, a kind of in-between place where there are no tenants
living upstairs, but there are no paddocks out back, either. A dog,
a rabbit, and two guinea pigs live here, but there is no mistaking
them for anything but the pampered pets they are.
</P>
<P>
   It is fashionable to trash the suburbs, to mock the trimmed
lawns, the driveways littered with bikes and basketballs. But,
among the sports utility vehicles and the soccer fields, there are
brooks to walk along, lakes to stroll around, woods to hike
through.
</P>
<P>
   I've always known the animals were out there, of course. I
didn't expect them to display themselves for my entertainment. But,
lately, I have begun to suspect they will show themselves to anyone
BUT me. It is as though they smell the city on me. It is my
daughter who sees the muskrat swimming in the brook on her way home
from school. It is my husband who spies the foxes on the local
nine-hole golf course. It is my son who finds the wild rabbit and
her newborn bunnies in a hillside burrow in his pal's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   They know that when they announce their wildlife sightings, it
is only an act of will that keeps me from shouting: ``What about
ME? Why do I see nothing but gray squirrels and black crows?''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer there were reports of a coyote in the neighborhood.
The police came around to warn us to keep our cats inside, to leash
our dogs on walks. At lunch with a group of neighbors, Jackie
Norton recounted hearing the coyote one night. His howl had sounded
like a baby's cry. When she went to her bedroom window there he
was, baying at the moon, right between the lawn furniture and the
rhododendrons. She lives only a few doors away. I'd slept through
the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   Now the deer have come, and I figure this could be my last
chance. Who knows how long it will be before the developers in my
town chop down what woods remain and carve up what meadows still
exist to build ever bigger houses on ever smaller lots?
</P>
<P>
   So, this week Fritz and I are rising early. We are moving
steathily through the dawn, one obsessed woman and one bemused dog,
deer hunting in the 'hood.

THE HIDDEN COSTS OF HANDGUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The booming economy of handguns is a boomerang. US gun makers
sold between $2 billion and $3 billion worth of arms last year. As
the gun makers show no conscience over the pain of their profits,
their consumers lock and load and unload onto America a staggering
bill that far surpasses the sales themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire leaves America with up to $4 billion a year in direct
medical costs, according to a 1995 study in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. While a name-brand handgun can cost
as little as $250 and a 9mm pistol magazine can cost $25, medical
experts estimate that the average cost of treating one gunshot
victim can cost anywhere from $14,000 to $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   That does not figure in long-term medical costs, police
services, lost wages, and lost quality of life. Published estimates
of all those costs can add up to between $300,000 and $400,000. The
Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan (HELP), based out of Children's
Memorial Medical Center in Chicago, estimates that each firearm
fatality costs $938,500.
</P>
<P>
   The annual total cost to the nation of gun violence is vague,
but every estimate is stunning. The 1995 study in JAMA estimates
$20 billion. HELP's estimate is $33 billion. A 1996 study in the
Textbook of Penetrating Trauma estimated $112 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the numbers, taxpayers directly or indirectly pay
80 &UR;  &LR; percent-85 percent of the bills because so many victims lack
health insurance. The bills are too much for the nation's mayors.
Chicago and New Orleans have filed lawsuits against the gun
industry. Boston and other cities plan to sue. They are suing
because they can no longer wait on the White House or Congress,
which regulate guns less than burgers, Barbie, and air bags.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Boston estimates that gun violence costs $10 million
a year. Hospitals and taxpayers in Philadelphia pick up $29 million
a year for uninsured victims of gunfire. Louisiana taxpayers lose
$6 million a year to treat uninsured gun victims. Gun control
advocates say the annual cost of firearm injuries in New York City
surpasses $94 million.
</P>
<P>
   To the mayors, gun violence is far more than an issue of crime.
Peter Welsh, a top aide to Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, said,
``We're riding a tidal wave of interest in this in terms of
consumer protection and public health. We want to hold handgun
manufacturers responsible the way car manufacturers and tobacco
companies are held responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   John Auerbach, executive director of Boston's Public Health
Commission, has added, ``The starting point for us is thinking of
this as a public health issue and not just a public safety issue.
Some would say it's a public health epidemic. So it makes sense to
think about the same interventions as you would with other public
health issues, like tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is a fitting comparison. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers last year said the national medical costs due to
smoking were $45 billion. The total costs of lost wages and
productivity, fires caused by smoking, and other costs led Summers
to estimate the total cost of smoking to the economy to be $130
billion. That is close to double the revenue of the two top
American cigarette makers, Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even keeping merely to direct medical costs, the cost of gun
violence and smoking to society would be enough to pay for over
half of the $112 billion that the General Accounting Office
estimates it would cost to repair or replace the nation's public
school buildings. Add in lost productivity and students would of
course have not only buildings but the Internet and afterschool
activities to keep them off the streets. Summers said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that all of these represent, in
the language of economics, real resource costs. That it is to say,
the $130 billion that smoking costs is much more burdensome to our
economy than the same amount levied in taxes, which impose a cost
on consumers, but provide offsetting revenues to our government. It
is proverbial that there is no such thing as a free lunch. But in a
sense, successfully preventing people from acquiring an addiction
they do not want to have _ by effectively combatting youth smoking
_ is a free lunch with real benefits for our economy as well our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   There same is true of gun violence. Put $2 billion to $3 billion
of gun sales next to $20 billion, $33 billion, or more in the costs
of those sales to society and you have an argument stronger than
ever before that handguns have no place in the hands of civilians.
For that reason, it is encouraging to see mayors stand up where
Capitol Hill trembles. Let them all attack with the same kind of
gauntlet thrown down by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. When Chicago
filed a $433 million lawsuit last fall against gun makers and
distributors, Daley said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If money is the only language they understand, then money is
the language we will use to make them understand that they have no
business in Chicago. We're going to hit them where it hurts _ in
their bank accounts _ and we won't stop hitting them until they
stop flooding our streets with guns.''

<P>
   A specter is haunting men's magazines _ the specter of Maxim.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Esquire, which for two decades
pretty much had the guy-mag field to itself. Oh, there were
barbershop favorites like True and Argosy and the Police Gazette,
but it was Esquire that invented the upmarket-male formula: flashy
writing, fashion, and a whiff or two of musk. The arrival of
Playboy in the '50s reconfigured things a bit. What had seemed very
risque in the '40s (the Post Office actually wanted to ban Esquire
from the mail) seemed very tame in a post-Hef world. So with
Playboy creating its own male-demographic niche, the flesh book _
Esquire and, later, GQ _ had to find another way to generate
interest. Under Harold Hayes, during the '60s and early '70s
Esquire became as exciting a magazine as America has known. Loosing
Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese (among others) on an unsuspecting
readership, it pretty much invented the New Journalism. Then in the
'80s, under Art Cooper, GQ, which had previously been a fairly flat
Pepsi to Esquire's highly carbonated Coke, upped its editorial
ratio of substantial to sartorial and, by so doing, made itself one
of the hottest (and ad-heaviest) titles in the Conde Nast stable.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the handwriting on the men's room wall appeared in the
early '90s, courtesy of another Conde Nast publication, Details.
Details started out as a downtown style magazine. Conde Nast bought
it and turned it into a men's magazine for guys in their teens who
wanted to fantasize about what it must be like to be guys in their
20s. Esquire and GQ had been, and still are, mostly for guys in
their 20s who want to fantasize what it must be like to be in their
guys 30s. Details was Fox to their NBC and CBS: higher energy,
lower rent, determinedly uncouth.
</P>
<P>
   Under James Truman, Details was an extremely hot book _ so much
so that, in 1994, Truman landed in the legendary Alexander
Liberman's chair as Conde Nast editorial director. That was then,
though, and this is now, and it's a sign of how much the times have
changed _ and how passe Details has become _ that the biggest news
it's made since Truman's departure came three weeks ago when it
hired away Maxim's Mark Golin to become its fourth editor in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim has been on US newstands less than two years but already
has a circulation of 950,000, twice that of Details. Its runaway
success has inspired at least one knockoff, Gear, and a less overt
influence has been discerned in a general unbuttoning (as one might
call it) among guy mags, the most frequently cited example being
Esquire's February cover story on ``Cleavage Culture,'' featuring
Pamela Anderson in high mammary mode.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim has the look of a supermarket tab on glossy paper _ lots
of reds, blacks, and yellows _ and the resemblance doesn't end
there. ``Sophistication's just another word for too much left to
lose'' could be the magazine's motto. Proudly prurient,
energetically sophomoric, it's Playboy's Party Jokes writ large,
the National Lampoon played straight: a canny reductio ad absurdum
of the guy-mag aesthetic. Maxim is for guys in their teens and 20s
who want to fantasize about what it must be like to be guys in
their teens. The March issue boasts (if that is the word) such
articles as ``Help! They Mangled My Penis'' and ``Pick Up Women
With a Sock Puppet!'' Now no one expects a men's magazine to be
Partisan Review (which, by the way, devotes its Winter issue to a
symposium on Czeslaw Milosz, with notable contributions coming from
Milosz's fellow Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney and Jack Miles, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ``God: A Biography''). But the
mass-market success of a magazine that informs its readers ``If you
make her drool, you rule,'' does make one wonder, at least a little
bit, about the fate of Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, let it be noted that the March issue also includes
a wonderfully loopy interview with overnight radio
talkmeister/nutcake Art Bell. The Q's (``Aliens in entertainment?
Would that explain Michael Jackson?'') are almost as funny as the
A's (``the outrageous success of (`The X-Files') leads me to
believe there's some force behind the scenes there, helping us get
used to the idea (of aliens among us). Helping further their
agenda. These are the things I wonder about in my most private
moments''). As for the things Maxim readers wonder about in their
most private moments _ well, let's say guys just want to have fun,
and leave it at that.

   The latest Paris Review (Fall) ``Writers at Work'' interviewees
are Mark Strand and V. S. Naipaul. Strand suffers for having
Wallace Shawn as interlocutor. All the latter's tics as an actor
are on display as interviewer (``I have to ask you one more
personal question. Well, I don't have to, but I will, because I'm
curious''). In the Naipaul, all tics are supplied by the
interviewee. The author of ``A Bend in the River'' and ``A House
for Mister Biswas'' may or may not be the greatest living novelist
in English, but he is undoubtedly the Alexander Haig of literary
interviewees, leaving no doubt who's in charge here. ``Let me know
the range of what you are doing and how you are going to approach
it,'' Naipaul informs his interviewer at the outset. ``I want to
know with what intensity to talk.'' By the time he's done, Naipaul
is wondering, ``Do you think I've wasted a bit of myself talking to
you?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Far silkier as interview subject is the late Isaiah Berlin in
The Wilson Quarterly (Winter). Lewis M. Dabney has long been
working on a biography of Edmund Wilson, and in 1991 he sought out
the Oxford don to discuss his friend, America's greatest man of
letters. Berlin is reputed to have been without peer as a
conversationalist, and even someone uninterested in Edmund Wilson
can see why, watching him dazzle Dabney. Part of Berlin's talent
was a dexterity with the blade no less deadly for being sheathed in
velvet. Contrasting the critic Lionel Trilling with Wilson, Berlin
says of the former, ``he was a delicate, sensitive, extremely
honest, and very communicative writer, but he understood far
less.'' What Trilling had to offer, Berlin adds, was ``just
intelligent sentences.'' It's hard to say which is more lethal:
``just'' or ``sentences'' (``pages'' or even ``paragraphs,'' fine,
but ``sentences''!).

<P>
   The New Yorker (Feb. 22 &AMP; March 1) devotes a double anniversary
issue to its hometown. David Remnick takes a highly entertaining,
if not especially probing, look at Metropolitan Opera impresario
Joseph Volpe. Mark Singer ponders the long silence of his legendary
New Yorker colleague Joseph Mitchell. Richard Avedon offers a
portfolio of New York notables (Grace Paley, peeking out a
Palladian window on Page 134, is our personal favorite). Best of
all, Rick Hertzberg celebrates the ``Topless Tabloids of Gotham.''
It would be difficult to better how he describes the contents of
the likes of The New York Post, The Daily News _ or, for that
matter, The Boston Herald _ ``Inside is a version of what appears
in other daily newspapers, but with bigger headlines, shorter
paragraphs, tough-guy columnists, and heavy emphasis on sensation,
sports, and entertainment. The writing, at its best, is as direct
and riveting as a ransom note.'' And at its worst . . . well, Maxim
needs a new editor, doesn't it?

HELPRIN SHOULD JUST MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Helprin is one of the greatest fiction writers in America.
His best work, in his short stories and in the novel ``Soldier of
the Great War'' is as good as the best writing of Timothy Findley
in his superb books ``The Wars'' and ``Famous Last Words.''
Literary conspiracy theorists speculate that both men are
underappreciated, Findley because he is Canadian and Helprin
because he is politically conservative. It is quite surprising that
Helprin has never bagged a Pulitzer nor a National Book Award, and
that Findley is never mentioned for a Nobel. Who knows? Even
conspiracy theorists have to be right sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Helprin has distinguished himself less for his
brilliant fiction than for his political broadsides thundering off
the op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal. Politics seems to be
the shiny stone that the youthful-looking, 52-year-old Helprin just
can't put down. He once told an interviewer he might run for the
Senate. During the 1996 presidential campaign, he briefly signed on
with Bob Dole as a speechwriter/Big Idea man, to little effect. Can
you recall a Bob Dole speech or Big Idea?
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Helprin has been exercising his considerable
rhetorical powers to dump all over the man who sent Bob Dole to
Viagra Sponsorship Heaven _ Bill Clinton. He has likened the
Clinton administration to the Cosa Nostra. He has called the
president the ``thinking man's Tawana Brawley.'' (Nasty but funny,
I have to admit.) In his pompous, house of burgess-era rhetoric, he
has ordered the president to resign: ``What will you do? I will
tell you, sir, what you will do. You will resign.'' Oddly, Clinton
seems not to have been listening.
</P>
<P>
   What I am suggesting here, respectfully, is that it is time for
Mr. Helprin to return to his day job.
</P>
<P>
   In his half-dozen anti-Clinton philippics, Helprin airs out the
grand martial themes that inform his best fiction: courage,
manliness, death, love, and honor. When he grants interviews _ and
when he curbs his penchant for self-invention _ Helprin waxes
Tolstoyan, and likes us to think that said themes suffuse his life.
After leaving Harvard, he volunteered for the Israeli air force. He
now complains about ``missing'' the Vietnam War: ``a regret that I
will carry to my grave.''
</P>
<P>
   I would forgive Helprin his incessant posturing, and much more,
but I would never forgive him for an article published last Tuesday
in The Wall Street Journal. In a lengthy, rambling essay called
``The Soldiers of Calais,'' Helprin compared the House impeachment
managers to the British Army's 30th Brigade fighting outside of
Dunkirk during World War II. Winston Churchill had to evacuate the
British Army across the English Channel, and he ordered the 30th
Brigade to hold off the pursuing Nazi Army at Calais, without
withdrawing or surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th Brigade withstood the Germans for three days, suffering
huge casualties. Churchill credited them with saving his army, and
possibly their country: ``Calais was the crux,'' he said. In his
essay, Helprin likens the House managers (Henry Hyde, Robert Barr &AMP;
Co.) to the dead soldiers at Calais: ``The House managers have died
a political death . . . by their sacrifices, their willingness to
risk, and their assumption of danger, (they) are the real senators
of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being wrong _ most of House managers are expected to
keep their seats in the 2000 election _ Helprin's analogy is
hideously twisted. Reasonable people disagree about the severity of
Bill Clinton's crimes and the resulting punishment, or lack of
punishment. But no reasonable person thinks the managers risked
their lives _ not even their political lives! _ for their country.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle, the kind of author Helprin loves to invoke for his
baroque arguments, wrote at great length about the appropriateness
of metaphor. For an analogy to be successful, it must be
appropriate, as Helprin's is not. Instead of valorizing the
accomplishment of the heroic defenders of Calais, he has cheapened
it. Instead of honoring them, he has desecrated their memory. Now
they have suffered a second death, under the pen of a fatuous,
right-wing hack.

CUOMO'S CALL TO COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BY DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning high elective office is not the only way to influence
public policy. But there are only a handful of American
practitioners of the lofty political speech.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are so many ways to communicate now, communication
is cheaper, in more ways than one. For a generation that grew up on
Jerry Springer and Howard Stern, that thinks political oratory is
what dribbled over from the squalid impeachment imbroglio,
politician-speak means naught but spin, sophistry, and
cynicism-from-those-seeking-sinecures.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's Mario Cuomo. Thrice-elected and
once-defeated for governor of New York, the man who is probably the
nation's most gifted philosopher-politician delivered himself of
that most rare commodity Monday night at Harvard:
</P>
<P>
   A political oration rooted in Judeo-Christian theology, laced
with real-world examples and the hard lessons of 20th century
American history, and delivered with the pace and polish one
expects of a Grand Master. I've been in the room for a lot of Cuomo
masterpieces: his Notre Dame speech defending abortion in '84, his
Democratic convention declamations of '84 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   And now this one at the Kennedy School. It was a simple summons
to the gifted young to reach back to those in poverty. ``There is
still a Second City where the glitter doesn't show,'' he said,
where wages languish, health care is priced out of household
budgets, jobs and skills and basic education recede, and what is
left is a brooding, increasingly brutish underclass frozen out of
the brightly lit glassed-in towers of the wired, the connected, the
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   There is abroad in the land ``a lowering of aspiration . . . a
loss of confidence,'' that government can be organized to lift up
the downtrodden. The spirit that won wars, licked Jim Crow, raised
up women, and walked the moon has given way to artful appeals to
selfishness, couched in the language of tax cuts, suggesting
government can do nothing but take care of the rich, despite a
projected $4 trillion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans represent the upper half of the American
spectrum of wealth, argued the most eloquent Democrat. Their take
on the country's central ethic derives from the Founding Fathers'
emphasis on ``freedom, liberty, opportunity.'' But today's
Democrats add a fourth concept: Community. Interdependence. The
strong reaching down to lift the weak.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Community' was not written into the Constitution,''
acknowledged Cuomo. ``We didn't believe it for 150 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until the depth of the Depression in 1932 did Franklin
Roosevelt enunciate the principle of interdependence that became
Social Security. Workers got unemployment and workmen's comp. As
American society evolved, blacks and women got to vote, to get a
leg up on rights and prerogatives previously denied, and what came
to be derided as Big Government leveled the playing fields on which
all Americans disported.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan-inspired drumbeat against ``Big Government'' is a
hollow farce, he claimed. What do they mean, he demanded: Social
Security? No. Medicare? Medicaid? No and no. The defense budget?
Definitely no! So just what do Republicans mean when they attack
Big Government? ``Welfare _ one-and-a-half percent of the
government budget!'' That got a big laugh. Even former Republican
Senator Alan Simpson, the cowbody from Cody, Wyo., who brought his
barbed-wire wit to Harvard where he gets to introduce people like
Cuomo, was grinning from ear to ear.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo had put a lot into his Harvard speech. He cited Adam
Smith, Wall Street's ideological icon of choice, on the ultimate
value of funding public schools. He quoted Hebrew admonitions to
``repair the universe . . . make it better . . . sweeter, fairer,
surer.'' Cuomo's own Catholicism emerged in his peroration. ``The
truth is God made the world _ but didn't finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not sappy religiosity to urge humankind ``to love one
another,'' concluded Cuomo. ``Because that's the only way it can
work.'' Things go better when there is an active sense of
community, of mutual responsibility, of less tribalism and more
tropism for cooperation, he pleaded. ``There's 47 million kids in
poublic schools,'' he said, ``and 5 million in private schools.''
He harpooned the conservatives' favorite remedy for failing public
education. ``You think you can do it with vouchers?'' Summing up,
Cuomo hit the heights: ``We're all in this together, for better or
for worse. So let's make it for better.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't have time for high-sounding speeches like
his, he conceded; they're too busy putting bread on the table. As a
young lawyer with five kids (and now nine grandchildren, all of
them girls), he was the same way. But thanks to his public school
education, his hardworking immigrant parents, his native skills,
and his hard work, he made it.
</P>
<P>
   For the able and fortunate like him and for the Harvard kids who
clogged his standing-room-only Arco Forum audience, he said making
it may be necessary, but it is not sufficient:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to die now, and my old neighborhood is worse. And
I say, `I did great, I did OK.' '' In an era characterized by
public discourse on ``what the definition of `is' is,'' Cuomo aimed
far higher, at corralling the concept of ``I'' as opposed to
I-and-the-rest-of-humanity.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I' is not enough for me. If `I' am all I am of my life, it's
not enough,'' he reasoned. ``We're in this to make the whole place
better, after you take care of your own. That has meaning . . .
Make a contribution. Do everything you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, I think it safe to say, loved it.

A MAD HISTORY OF WOMEN AS TOLD BY TWIN BARBIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Working lightly, surely and always in sync, the playwright Paula
Vogel, the director Joe Mantello, the star Swoosie Kurtz and a
dream supporting cast are cheering up a mostly dreary season with
``The Mineola Twins,'' the exhilarating Roundabout Theater Company
entertainment now at the Laura Pels Theater.
</P>
<P>
   There is such an abundance of theatrical life on view in the
production that it comes as a shock when, at the curtain call, only
five people show up. Even though no attempt has been made to hide
the fact that each of the three women in the cast plays two roles
and their two male colleagues play many more, this post-performance
reminder is a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the role transformations take place onstage, front
and center, in sequences choreographed in syncopated dance
movements: the performer, attended by two genie-like dressers,
switches into a different costume, wig and sometimes sexual
identity, while never missing a step. The effect is to give ``The
Mineola Twins'' a festive air, celebrating the joys of theatrical
illusion even as they are cheerily unmasked.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the method of Ms. Vogel's play, which prompts the
audience to laugh, occasionally from its belly, at manners and
attitudes she doesn't find funny at all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret that the show isn't easily categorized. The
playwright, who received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for her elegiacal
``How I Learned to Drive,'' is here dealing in broad satire that is
often hilarious just because of the intense, go-for-broke way in
which it demolishes familiar targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mineola Twins,'' Ms. Vogel's overview of nearly 40 years
in the social history of American women, touches down to check the
temper of the times in the Eisenhower, Nixon and Bush
administrations. Everything is seen from the perspective of a pair
of furiously demented variations on that icon of a doll, Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna and Myra, conceived at the same moment of bliss, are
identical in every respect except for what Myrna, the ``good''
sister, refers to as the development in ``the chestal region.'' As
her first suitor notes, Myrna is ``stacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``bad'' sister, Myra, sometimes described as ``the whore of
Babylon'' (remember, this takes place on Long Island), is flat as a
pancake.
</P>
<P>
   When first met, the teen-age Myrna, her chestal region a sight
gag when the audience sees her in profile, works at a Mineola
luncheonette. Her only wish (other than winning the Homemakers of
America Senior Award) is to marry Mr. Right, move to Levittown and
raise a family. Mr. Right is Jim, a virginal ``older'' man (in his
early 20s) who is advising the Ford Motor Co. how to sell young
buyers on the company's still top-secret and unnamed revolutionary
new automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Myra has no single boyfriend. She prefers to take her boyfriends
in groups, like the first-string squad of the Mineola football
team. She spends her time getting suspended from Mineola High and,
when she isn't working as a cocktail waitress in what Myrna calls
``a roadside tavern of ill repute,'' she hangs out in Greenwich
Village, where women wear pants.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sisters are bound in a psychic union that allows each
to invade the other's mind, they profoundly loathe each other. No
matter that each eventually leaves Mineola on a different path,
their destinies remain locked as they deal with separate but
parallel tragedies. Apparently, not even unequal bra sizes can
break the bond of sisterhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel has been quoted as saying that ``The Mineola Twins''
is intended as a metaphor for the division between America's
political right and left. Yet the ferocity of the love-hate
relationship between Myra and Myrna seems far more complicated and
ambiguous than that. The politics of the play are fairly
rudimentary. The manner in which the show is performed is the
thing, and it's an upper.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kurtz seems never to stop working in television and movies,
but it's a long time since we have had the opportunity to see the
kind of bravura comic theatrical performance she gives here as the
Mineola twins. She is priceless, an early spring tonic, whether
playing Myrna as Sandra Dee, Myrna as the frosty, embittered Great
Neck homemaker, or the older Myrna, author of ``Profiles in
Chastity'' and a hugely popular, rabidly right-wing talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   It is this Myrna, outspoken foe of multiculturalism, birth
control and homosexuality, whose on-air voice sounds a little bit
like that of Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the hugely popular, real-life
radio talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ms. Kurtz is equally spectacular as Myra, who initially
suggests Linda Blair in combat with the exorcist. Poor Myra. During
the chaos of the Vietnam years, she serves time for bank robbery,
but later pulls herself together to settle down with Sarah, her
significant other, and to head the Long Island branch of Planned
Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be no accident that each sister is raising a
fatherless son who rebels against his mother and seeks guidance
from the aunt whose name his mother can scarcely bear to mention.
In the dual role of the sons is Mandy Siegfried, seen earlier this
season in ``Stupid Kids,'' an enchanting young actress who manages
to play two very different teen-age boys without for a minute
hiding her own identity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that she looks like a girl playing a boy (she
doesn't), but that she acts the characters. Had she simply
impersonated them, she would have called attention to herself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The show's third star performance is that of the comedienne Mo
Gaffney, a hearty woman who appears first as Myrna's boyfriend,
Jim, the fleshy, foolish man who hitches his wagon to the success
of the Edsel and allows himself to be deflowered by Myra.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a triumphant onstage transformation, she appears as
Myra's lover, Sarah. As much as anyone else in ``The Mineola
Twins,'' Ms. Gaffney exemplifies the playfulness of a production in
which cross-dressing, though a political statement, is also
legitimately funny.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Sherman, a big stalwart fellow, and Jimmy Holder, his
shorter, slighter sidekick, play their multiple nonspeaking roles
as if they were spaced out floorwalkers ever willing to give their
help, which is often expressed in dance. They play, among other
types, dressers, stagehands, FBI agents ``dressed like Mormon
missionaries,'' and the hospital orderlies who attend Myrna before
her shock treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight: the scene in which the temporarily mad Myrna
somehow loosens her restraints to dance an impromptu adagio, her
straitjacket flaps flying so gracefully that the orderlies seem
tempted to join in.
</P>
<P>
   It is often impossible to tell where the work of the playwright
leaves off and that of the director begins. Yet the vision
necessary to call forth and coordinate the many superb
contributions by those responsible for the sets, costumes,
lighting, musical staging and, especially, the amazing wigs, all
would seem to indicate that ``The Mineola Twins'' is the director's
show. That is, the work of Joe Mantello, who was also responsible
for the memorable stagings of Jon Robin Baitz's
``Mizlansky/Zilinsky or Schmucks'' and Terrence McNally's ``Love!
Valour! Compassion!''
</P>
<P>
   Like every director, Mantello needs a text that has a life and
mind to nurture. Forget his productions of McNally's ``Corpus
Christi'' and Neil Simon's ``Proposals.'' When he finds the right
material, he knows how to make it look effortless and inevitable,
something that had to happen in just the way we behold it. Which is
why ``The Mineola Twins'' is so satisfying and so theatrical. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have to look hard to find any reference to Rudyard Kipling
in the program for the Manhattan Theater Club's production of
``Captains Courageous, the Musical.'' It's there, but in very small
type on the page that lists the cast members, squeezed between the
information about the time in which the show takes place (1928) and
the advisory that there will be one 15-minute intermission: ``The
novel, `Captains Courageous,' was written by Rudyard Kipling in
1897.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention at all of M-G-M, which produced the film
that inspired the show, of the men who wrote that screenplay (John
Lee Mahin, Marc Connelly and Dale Van Every), or of Victor Fleming,
the film's director. The only credit: ``Based on `Captains
Courageous,' courtesy of Turner Entertainment Co.'' The artists are
dead, long live the holders of the copyright!
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, perhaps. What reputation the movie still has is
attached to the name of Spencer Tracy, who plays Manuel, the
philosophical Portuguese fisherman from New Bedford, who saves the
life of a rich boy who falls from an ocean liner and teaches him to
be a man. Tracy played the same sort of fisherman far better in
``The Old Man and the Sea,'' but with a Spanish accent.
</P>
<P>
   Why go into all this? I suppose I'm avoiding the question of why
the show, for which Frederick Freyer wrote the music and Patrick
Cook the book and lyrics, is so determinedly uninteresting and
spiritless.
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed by Lynne Meadow, the artistic director
of the Manhattan Theater Club, has an attractive, talented cast
headed by Treat Williams (Manuel) and Brandon Espinoza (the boy),
but nothing else is up to par.
</P>
<P>
   The score has the effect of one long, sleep-inducing lullaby.
The book might seem predictable even to someone who had never
touched Kipling or seen the once-popular Hollywood variation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the set, by the usually stylish Derek McLane, never evokes
the sailing vessel where the rotten kid lives and learns for
several months, before being returned to his father as a perfect
little he-man. The set looks like a large square wooden pier
floating off the Grand Banks, but at a permanent rake that
indicates it is in the process of sinking.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, we have a brief glimpse of a yardarm with some
cloth attached, cinched to look like a furled sail. Here is a
sailing vessel without masts, without any perpendiculars, with
nothing that reaches toward the sky, which is a constant in a life
at sea, unless you have lost your ship and are clinging to a raft.
</P>
<P>
   The set isn't that important, but it represents the failure of
the imagination behind the entire endeavor.

DARTMOUTH LEADER TAKES ON CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ President James Wright spent the evening two
Mondays ago the way he has several in his 30 years as professor and
provost at Dartmouth College, at a casual dinner in a fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Alpha Delta were so impressed that one e-mailed
the campus newspaper suggesting it do a story on what a great guy
the new president is. An improvement, he thought, on James
Freedman, the outsider president who spoke of cultivating a campus
for ``creative loners'' aspiring to write poetry or master the
cello. Here was a Dartmouth guy, who understood the keg-jumping
culture of this postcard-perfect campus, this ``fun Ivy'' for
students who play as hard as they work.
</P>
<P>
   But the paper had a bigger story to write. The next day, Wright
announced the new residential plan that will open fraternities to
women, ending, as the headline blared, ``the Greek system as we
know it.'' By Wednesday, students came not to praise the new
president, but to vilify him, in signs outside Greek houses, as
``Julius Brutus Arnold Wright.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the quintessential Dartmouth man had changed, he was only
reflecting how much Dartmouth, too, has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as a boys club, it now boasts the highest percentage
of tenured women professors in the Ivy League. It was the first of
the Ivies, four years ago, to have the same number of women
students as men. While its admissions office once had a virtual
pipeline from redoubts of prepdom like Deerfield Academy, it now
draws its highest number of freshmen from New York's scrappy
Stuyvesant High. And The Dartmouth Review, which once drove campus
debate weekly and put the school on the national news for
conservatism and bigotry, now publishes only sporadically. It's
hard to find a copy on campus.
</P>
<P>
   While the fraternities once defined Dartmouth, officials now say
they had come to defy everything that Dartmouth has worked the
better part of the last decade to become. To the outside world,
they serve as a reminder that a Dartmouth alumnus coauthored the
movie ``Animal House,'' and make it difficult to attract minority
students. Inside the school, they remind many that the school has
not yet changed its social structure to embrace its newer, more
intellectual students.
</P>
<P>
   Wright may be a villain to some, but he has also become a hero
to many students and to the faculty, who have waited for this as
the final step in shaping a new Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own deep conviction is that this is a place that is far
richer than the stereotypes,'' Wright said in a low rumbling
monotone that seemed to play down the protests outside his house
and the hate mail he has received in the two weeks since he
announced his plan. ``The image is of a school up in the woods
where a bunch of guys partied hard, and there may have been some
truth to that. But this has not been `Animal House' since I have
been here. That part of our history tends to get lost . . . and
that frustrates the historian in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright insists this is not a public relations strategy.
Admissions Dean Karl Furstenberg, though, is less shy about the
need for a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our image has deterred students from applying,'' he said. ``I
really want the college to have a balanced image, to have people
appreciate it for all its range, to know that we've got
conservatives, we've got liberals, we have radical feminists.
Somehow our image is stuck on one dimension of our personality.
Images persist longer than you think they would. They're also out
of date.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For several notable firsts, Dartmouth deserves a better
reputation than it's had. Founded to educate American Indians, it
was the first college to admit an African-American student, in
1824. As early as the 1950s, its fraternities fought their national
chapters against policies that excluded Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But even loyalists admit that the party school stereotype fit.
Critics snickered that the old school song about ``Men of Dartmouth
. . . with the granite of New Hampshire in their muscles and their
brains,'' was true in a way the authors did not intend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of kids who saw this as a finishing school (20
years ago). They came here, they learned a little Horace, they
joined a fraternity, they joined a team, they made contacts among
their fraternity brothers, then went home and joined dad's
business,'' said Ed Berger, dean of the faculty and a 20-year
professor. ``We didn't send a lot of kids on to PhD programs.''
</P>
<P>
   To alumni who cherish that past, it died in 1972, when Dartmouth
admitted women.
</P>
<P>
   But the real changes began with Freedman, who arrived from the
University of Iowa in 1987 and began an aggressive campaign to
downgrade the ``Animal House'' image and upgrade its intellectual
distinction. He restored Japanese and Hebrew to the curriculum, and
established a presidential scholarship program that enlisted
top-flight students in research projects. He shaped a cluster of
residences around faculty advisers, in an attempt to foster a
climate of intellectualism even outside the classroom. Dartmouth
has always been a school for top students, but he demanded even
higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Berger knew things were changing when a fraternity hosted a
lecture series. ``That was a major breakthrough,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty welcomed the changes. It had voted to do away with
fraternities in 1978, saying they were anti-intellectual, and was
rebuffed by the trustees.
</P>
<P>
   But Freedman's changes were largely overshadowed by other
crises. He became the epitome of the political correctness
ridiculed in the Dartmouth Review. In one widely publicized
incident, Review staff destroyed a shantytown on the Dartmouth
Green that had been set up by black students protesting the
school's investment in apartheid South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, applications dropped, especially among black
students, and black faculty left in large numbers, with fewer than
10 on campus in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni protested changes, too, in the school song (to ``Dear Old
Dartmouth'' from ``Men of Dartmouth'') and the mascot (from an
Indian head to a Big Green blob). In this atmosphere, most say,
Freedman never could have challenged the fraternities. Challenging
the party culture proved hard. The school banned keg deliveries in
1991, only to allow them in limited use a year later. Freedman
pushed fraternity rush from spring of freshman year to spring of
sophomore year, only to allow it again in fall of sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, though, the admissions office has worked
hard, and largely succeeded, over the past 10 years in what
Furstenberg calls ``a major recrafting of the message.'' Rather
than a nice small school in New Hampshire, it sold itself for its
research faculty. It sent recruiters to more schools, so that the
ratio of private school students has dropped by about 10 percent,
and got more students to visit the campus, where they might be
persuaded that it wasn't that movie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, change the Greek system? Wright, to most, seemed the last
person to do this, an unlikely intellectual, and an unlikely
liberal. A 58-year-old former football player and Marine, he worked
in the coal mines in his native Illinois after high school. Hearing
the tales of the mines, he fell in love with history, and entered
college at 21. He came to Dartmouth, and stayed. In manner and
visage, he is more the soothing country doctor than the college
president, more affable than inspiring in his speech, more
self-effacing than stuffy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was frustrated by letters he received after a
``ghetto party'' hosted by a fraternity and a sorority last year,
to which some students came dressed as welfare mothers. He had
heard the same complaint from other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was not an inclusive culture, that they wished
that they had more opportunity to meet students of different
backgrounds,' he said. ``When I put the question to them, what is
it that does not encourage that, the answer is always the
fraternities, the sororities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright says there is no social engineering in his plans, and no
magic in his timing. But a change of heart among alumni probably
influenced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear tumult, revolt, and revolution the way I did with
coeducation'' said David Cook, a 1957 grad, a member of Theta Delta
Chi, and head of the alumni council. ``What I've been amazed at is
the number of e-mails saying this is wrapping up something that
should've been wrapped up 27 years ago with coeducation.''
</P>
<P>
   What has also surprised many is the support among students, many
of whom have written opinion pieces or letters to the editor
supporting the new plan in The Dartmouth, the student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alcohol abuse is part of fraternity life, and the
fraternities are part of Dartmouth,'' said Leyla Kamalick, who
wrote one of the opinion pieces. Wright ``wants to eliminate
alcohol abuse entirely, and he's starting by eliminating it from
the school name, and I think that's a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   So it might just be possible that Jim Wright's fan club is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   As Wright stood before a faculty meeting called last week, Tom
Luxon, an English professor, rose and told him, ``Thank you for
your courage. Thank you for your bravery.'' As the applause
started, became louder and sustained, Luxon continued: ``Your
bravery led me to trust you. Your leadership is what's making this
possible. It makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright blushed, picked up his paper cup of water, and lifted it
to his mouth. Behind it, he smiled.

LIONS SLEEPING WITH THE LAMBS, BUT GRUDGINGLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. _ Edward Hicks, the early 19th century painter
and Quaker minister, is a commanding figure in American folk art.
His reputation rests largely on his ``Peaceable Kingdom''
paintings, more than 60 works that bring to life Isaiah's
optimistic prophecy for the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   In Hicks' depiction, fierce animals live side by side with tame
ones _ a wolf and a lamb, a leopard and a goat, a lion and a calf,
a bear and an ox _ all crowded together with small children on a
wooded knoll. A Hicks embellishment in the background enlarges the
biblical metaphor: William Penn is shown forging a peace treaty
with Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' works, especially his ``Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings,
continue to bring top prices in the market: last month a version
from 1837 was auctioned at Christie's in New York for $4.7 million,
a record for folk art. And people throughout this country recognize
the image as quickly as they do the nation's leading art icon,
James Abbott McNeil Whistler's ``Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, says Carolyn J. Weekley, an art historian who is the
director of museums at Colonial Williamsburg, most people do not
understand what Hicks' ``Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings are all
about. Though to some people they may be as endearing or as banal
as Hallmark greeting cards, she says they are actually neither.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that she began to wrestle with the meanings of
these paintings 20 years ago, when she had questions about the four
that are in Williamsburg's collection at the Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller Folk Art Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were not what they seemed to be,'' Ms. Weekley said.
``The `Peaceable Kingdom' paintings were all very different. And I
knew there had to be a reason for that. I wondered why Hicks had
painted so many in a series that spanned much of his life, from
1816 to 1847. And why were so few truly peaceful _ maybe only 20
percent. Indeed, these were not fuzzy, cuddly little animals.''
Five years ago, Ms. Weekley began her own in-depth study of the
paintings, a research project that resulted in ``The Kingdoms of
Edward Hicks,'' an exhibition now at the Folk Art Center that runs
through Sept. 6, and a scholarly book, published by Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   The show, the first museum retrospective devoted to Hicks',
presents 80 of his works, including half the ``Peaceable Kingdom''
paintings and other canvasses as well as signs, furniture and
memorabilia. It will travel to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the
Denver Art Museum and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing so many ``Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings together makes
it clear that at the outset Hicks may have wanted to paint images
of an ideal life but that he later seemingly abandoned that
ambition, 10 years after he started, as trouble began brewing in
the Society of Friends.
</P>
<P>
   The schism came when conservative Quakers like Hicks and a
cousin, Elias Hicks, who was also a minister, urged members to
return to the plain, simple life. But the more affluent Quakers who
sought a more worldly life refused. Neither Elias with his
preaching nor Edward with his paintings were able to repair the
rift, which was to divide Quakers for a century.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Weekley, Hicks' disenchantment is reflected in the
increasingly angry faces of the animals in the paintings completed
after 1825. ``Hicks continues to paint the theme in the 1840s,''
she said. ``But the urgency is gone, and these later works become
less energetic and more sorrowful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' life has been well documented, mostly in his memoirs,
which he wrote from 1843 until his death in 1849 at the age of 69,
but also in family letters and two books on the painter and his
work. Hicks was born in 1780 into an Anglican family in Bucks
County, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   After his mother died and his father, who held government
positions under the Tories and was later a surveyor, suffered
financial reversals, he was sent at age 3 to live with David
Twining, a Quaker farmer in Newtown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Hicks was apprenticed to a coach maker who taught him
ornamental and sign painting, crafts he used throughout his life.
At 35, however, he feared that his work was too decorative for a
Quaker, so he gave up painting entirely and took up farming, at
which he was a failure.
</P>
<P>
   To feed his family, he returned to his passion, painting, and
within a year had produced his first ``Peaceable Kingdom.'' He drew
on his skill at lettering, first in the borders and later the
banners in his paintings; both decorative techniques disappear in
the 1830s. He copied images of animals from lithographs and
engravings to compensate for his inadequacy as a draftsman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weekley said that her research might help disprove some
long-held assumptions about folk artists. ``We live with this
notion that they are simpletons who express no complex thoughts in
their paintings,'' she said. ``This idea was advanced by the people
who in the 1920s and 30s wrote about folk art as simplistic,
supposedly to add charm and mystique to folksy types of works.
While this attitude has been changing slowly over the last 20
years, the Hicks research may be the strongest proof of how complex
folk art can be.''

THEY'RE RECORDING, BUT ARE THEY ARTISTS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Andy Warhol began painting Campbell's Soup cans nearly four
decades ago, it wasn't long before Pop Art became accepted as the
Next Big Thing in the world of fine arts. The newest development in
a modernist tradition that had already absorbed the shocks of
Cubism, Dadaism and Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art was quickly
recognized as a movement ready made for museum catalogs, history
books and skyrocketing auction prices.
</P>
<P>
   But if you turn the words Pop Art around and apply them to
music, suddenly you have a debate about cultural values and
hierarchy, about entertainment and art, that has never been fully
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of that debate is a dialogue about the esthetic worth
of the primitive versus the refined, an oral tradition versus a
written one, spontaneity versus craft, populist versus highbrow and
European versus American. Or as the rock critic Robert Christgau, a
populist and leftist intellectual, declared in an essay on Chuck
Berry: ``Unless we can somehow recycle the concept of the great
artist so that it supports Chuck Berry as well as it does Marcel
Proust, we might as well trash it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   The music that is loosely defined as art-pop _ music as diverse
as that of Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel, Laurie Anderson, Beck,
Pavement and Duncan Sheik _ doesn't have much to do with Berry's
raw, euphoric synthesis of blues and country music. But Berry's
role as a founding father of rock-and-roll and a maker of hybrids
certainly paved the way for its development.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the term art-pop refers to any pop style
that consciously aspires to the formal values of classical music
and poetry. At the same time, most art-pop is underwritten and
marketed not by staid cultural institutions but by commercially
voracious record companies who tout even the silliest, most
juvenile acts as ``recording artists.''
</P>
<P>
   All but the most stubbornly highbrow critics would probably
agree that the mingling of pop and classical has had a genuinely
liberating influence on music. But at what point does the
convergence of so many musical streams muddy the water so
thoroughly that distinctions of quality begin to vanish in an
undifferentiated muck?
</P>
<P>
   Many people would date the birth of art-pop to the mid-1960s
when the Beatles first recorded with a string quartet and producers
like Phil Spector and the Beach Boys' leader, Brian Wilson, brought
a quasi-symphonic (or ``Wagnerian,'' as rock critics were fond of
calling Spector's Wall of Sound productions) textures to pop
recording.
</P>
<P>
   After the Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''
established the so-called concept album as pop music's dominant
format in 1967, rock bands of every stripe churned out albums (and
even ``operas'' like the Who's ``Tommy'') that linked songs into
suites and aspired to make grand artistic statements.
</P>
<P>
   A bombastic, classically inflected post-Beatles art-rock
flourished, especially in England, whence came the Moody Blues;
Pink Floyd; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Yes; Genesis; Electric Light
Orchestra; Procol Harum, and other bands.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the influence of Bob Dylan and the Beats, North
American art-pop took a more literary path through folk music in
the singer-songwriter movement that produced Joni Mitchell, Paul
Simon, Leonard Cohen and Laura Nyro. Fusing Beat and confessional
poetry with assorted musical hybrids, these artists chose the
long-playing record instead of print as the medium for evoking a
generation's collective experience.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan is today a certified cultural deity, while Ms. Mitchell
immodestly likes to compare her importance to that of Picasso and
Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   As the generational wars of the late 1960s and 70s cooled, older
pop styles were re-examined and canonized. Frank Sinatra, once
viewed as a kitsch pop crooner, is today exalted as a great
American artist who invented ``personal'' singing.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades before the Beatles recorded ``Yesterday,'' George
Gershwin aspired to write highbrow music with a populist pulse.
Even earlier, Scott Joplin's ragtime piano balanced a Mozartean
order against the raunch of a New Orleans brothel. Gershwin and
Duke Ellington, who emerged from the worlds of Broadway and jazz,
have eclipsed Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein as American
musical patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Broadway scores have been dusted off and ``elevated'' in
recordings featuring opera singers, and classically trained
vocalists from Dawn Upshaw to Bryn Terfel have applied their
talents to albums of popular standards. For her first solo album,
the gifted Broadway mezzo-soprano Audra McDonald chose to record
songs by young composers whose work thoroughly blurs the line
between Broadway pop and classical art song.
</P>
<P>
   To the diehard rock-and-rollers who championed punk rock's surge
as a purifying fire, the upward mobility of non-rock styles is no
cause for celebration, especially at a moment when rock has been
commercially eclipsed by hip-hop and country and eroded by a
tentative swing revival.
</P>
<P>
   The same advancing technology that played a crucial role in the
birth of rock with the near-simultaneous development of electric
instruments, high fidelity and the long-playing record has
contributed to the music's decline. By turning promotional
materials into product, the music video undermined rock's
integrity, subsuming the music to the values of television.
</P>
<P>
   In supplanting the LP, the compact disk, with its increased
length, hastened the demise of the concept album, which couldn't
comfortably support a song cycle longer than about 45 minutes. And
as the world became more of a global village, music with few ties
to Europe or the United States further called into question musical
hierarchies both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a younger generation, turning its back on its
parents, chose computers instead of music as its preferred mode of
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Where a generation ago, rock critics and record companies
announced the arrival of a new ``masterpiece'' every month or two,
mainstream pop has reverted to the detached consumerist ethic of
the pre-Beatles era. Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys rule,
and audience loyalty to a new act rarely extends beyond one or two
records.
</P>
<P>
   As for art-pop, the radio formats that sell records leave little
room for sounds that don't conform to strict niche-market formulas.
</P>
<P>
   But each year, great claims are still made for one or another
promising performer. This year's recipient of hype is the talented
pop-hip-hopper Lauryn Hill, who has been described as having
Roberta Flack's voice and Joni Mitchell's songwriting gift. As
enticing as that may sound, it's simply not true in either
department. Not yet, at least.
</P>
<P>
   As for the anti-establishment cultural war led by rock-and-roll,
it was won hands down by rock in the mid-1970s. Beethoven and
Proust have since rolled over in their graves many times and told
Tchaikovsky the news in several languages.
</P>
<P>
   But that victory is not without a certain irony. Yes, we now
have a Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and an entire cable television
channel (VH1) devoted to promoting the pantheon. But our musical
cultural values have become so relative that the Beatles, Dylan,
Gershwin, Ellington, and Sinatra now rank side by side in public
esteem with the likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Yanni, Celine Dion,
Neil Diamond and Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   For in today's musical climate, whatever you declare to be art
must be art, and forget persnickety snobs who think differently.
Come to think of it, maybe it (italics)is(end italics) time to
trash the concept of the great artist.

THE ODD MAN OUT AT NUMERIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all of the publicity he attracted for his mutual funds
over the years, John Bogle Jr.'s departure was announced in just
one terse paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle was out at Numeric Investors, the money management shop
known for its quantitative, or computer-driven, investment style.
Good work, thanks for the memories, a company statement said two
weeks ago. He was off to pursue other things. Then Numeric shut
down tighter than a drum, and Bogle was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has resurfaced. In an interview Tuesday, Bogle said he
became the odd man out at Numeric when founder and longtime
colleague Langdon Wheeler had a change of heart about plans to
retire within two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lang came to me with the suggestion that now was the time for
me to do something on my own,'' said Bogle, who was a managing
director at Numeric. ``I didn't disagree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Wheeler's decision made Numeric, a firm that invests
about $5 billion for institutional accounts and mutual fund
shareholders, too top heavy with managers. And Bogle wasn't going
to run it anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``His staying with the firm made my staying with management
somewhat superfluous,'' said Bogle, 39. ``It created a surplus of
management at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Wheeler and Bogle, Numeric also counted chief investment
officer Mark Engerman as part of its senior management. Engerman
wasn't going anywhere and his skills were needed at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   We asked Bogle whether another person might look at the same
events and say they were precipitated by a different change of
heart, a decision to jump Engerman ahead in the Numeric succession
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had never come up,'' Bogle answered. ``It may happen, but
it's never come up in conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, the son of John Bogle, founder of the Vanguard mutual
fund company, attracted a lot of publicity for Numeric's group of
funds, which manage a total of about $330 million. He was good copy
for slick investment magazines and newspaper columnists, including
us.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bogle and Numeric's n/i family of funds stressed
shareholder-friendly issues that would resonate at Vanguard: a cap
on fees and a preference to quickly close funds that could become
less effective if they became too large.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who will be 53 in May, was not available for comment
Tuesday. Bogle said Wheeler's original plan to leave the business
by age 55 started to change last summer, when they first started to
talk about ``management succession issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bogle still speaks well of Wheeler and said there were no
hard feelings between the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly value my friendship and working experience with
him,'' said Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   But Bogle and Wheeler are both known for strong egos, and even
Numeric officials acknowledged ``differences'' between them at the
time of the split.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler and Bogle first met at State Street Bank &AMP; Trust more
than a decade ago. Wheeler had been hired to develop a quantitative
model to replace one the company was buying from now-defunct Drexel
Burnham Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle walked in the door at State Street's asset management
department the day of the stock market crash in October 1987,
moving over from the corporate banking department.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler launched Numeric a few years later, with the help of
Hilda Ochoa, a silent partner and former chief investment officer
of the pension division of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Numeric built its own computer models that would select stocks
to buy and sell in investment portfolios. The models would jump in
and out of stock positions often, triggered by changes in analysts'
profit forecasts and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Numeric has a series of ``quants'' working its Cambridge,
Mass. offices. The typical background: heavy math and science
credentials mixed with a business degree.
</P>
<P>
   Numeric has its critics. Some people complain that the
portfolios move in and out of stocks too frequently, increasing
expenses. Others say Numeric closes its funds based on asset growth
too quickly, doing more harm than good. The company's original
institutional account was closed recently to work on problems after
a spate of weak performance.
</P>
<P>
   Numeric officials and Bogle insist none of those issues had
anything to do with this month's management change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophic approaches are not at odds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle said he was spending time with his family at the moment
and didn't know what he would do next. He said he preferred running
a smaller operation but did not rule out becoming involved in a
larger organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure you're going to be hearing from me soon,'' he
said.

WHERE ARE AMERICA'S YOUNG COMPOSERS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grandparents rule. There never was a time before when American
composers of classical music were so old: Elliott Carter, Henry
Brant, Milton Babbitt, George Perle, Lou Harrison, Leon Kirchner,
Ralph Shapey and Gunther Schuller count among the most venturesome
creative musicians of the present day, all of them going strong at
ages ranging down to 73.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of ``young composer'' in this context has to be
someone still under 50, and so far there are not too many high
achievers among them, as a listener was reminded at the recent
Focus festival of the Juilliard School, ``Toward the Millennium,
Part 1.''
</P>
<P>
   If we look back, say, 40 years, the contrast is alarming. Every
one of the composers mentioned above had already established a
reputation (though Carter, even then, was over the 50 limit), and
we could add to the list people who have since died but were, in
1959, under 50 and nationally, even internationally, prominent:
Cage, Bernstein, Barber, Morton Feldman, Irving Fine, Mel Powell,
Ben Weber, Hugo Weisgall.
</P>
<P>
   All these composers, those now elderly and those deceased, were
probably stimulated by growing up at a time when American music was
kicking itself into action: the period of the country's rise, more
generally, in international power and prestige. As far as music was
concerned, the center of gravity was shifting.
</P>
<P>
   American jazz and popular music were sweeping Europe, and some
of Europe's most important classical composers were coming here,
notably Schoenberg and Stravinsky. They had an influence, for sure,
but they were also changed by America, and after the war, American
composers went back to have a powerful effect on Europe: Cage and
Carter in the 50s, Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Now our young, under-50 composers are unplayed in Europe and
unregarded. This inattention must have something to do with the
decline in American cultural authority abroad since the end of the
Cold War, but it is also a response to a lack of interesting ideas
coming from this side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps those are linked phenomena, in that American artists
may have been unsettled by uncertainty as to the country's role in
the world, an uncertainty that may be much more confusing than the
downright opposition to the government that many adopted in the
Nixon and Johnson eras. American music was always most typically
outgoing, embracing. Now nobody in the world outside wants or needs
to be embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Another important difference for younger composers today is that
they have had to work in a world where the dominant musical style
is rock. The music Reich, Glass and others began to produce around
1970 is best seen not as a reaction against complexity within the
classical tradition, nor even as a response to Asian and African
music, but rather as a last attempt on behalf of classical music to
abstract elements of rock without stylistic compromise.
</P>
<P>
   For them, classical music was still at the center and could hope
to absorb rock, rather as, in previous ages, it had absorbed the
minuet and the waltz. Admittedly, the means were extreme. A lot of
classical music's intricacy had to be abandoned. But the
superiority of the high culture was never in question.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence has gone. Rock music does not need to be
assimilated and memorialized by classical composers; through
recordings, it has its own means of being remembered. And its
lesser status is not at all to be taken for granted. Since rock has
no use for would-be developers, classical music's powers of
assimilation have been stemmed, and with them, its opportunities
for growth.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a lot of classical composers have simply taken over
rock's basic elements of pulsation and symmetry, but so have a lot
of Broadway musicians, with results no more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor at work here, no doubt, is current suspicion with
regard to cultural hybridization. Valuing above all the authentic,
contemporary culture seeks to keep traditions separate for as long
as possible and thus makes it difficult for composers to learn from
elsewhere. Instead, they are asked to explore their own roots, and
a lot of time has been wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Artists cannot avoid their roots; anything they make will speak
of themselves and of their inheritance. The interesting things have
often happened when people have looked radically outside their own
backgrounds: LaMonte Young studying Indian singing, John Cage
reading Zen, Steve Reich playing African drums.
</P>
<P>
   Any such endeavors now have to confront intellectual barriers
founded on a false and unhelpful notion of ownership, and though,
happily, there are still wall-jumpers around, they generally have
to stay on the margins. Maybe it is there, on the fenced
borderlands between classical and other traditions (rock, klezmer,
gamelan), that the most valuable music of the next century will
start to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the energy has gone out of downtown
music, which was essentially an oppositional movement, and which
has nothing to oppose now that professional composers have given up
their claim to be authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those professional composers, well inside the
classical tradition, must work with what they find at home. Since
this does not now include the finger of history resolutely pointing
the way forward _ for the avantgarde movement began coming to a
halt as soon as Cage wrote his silent piece, in 1952 _ no one
should be surprised that the leading style of the last 20 years has
been pastiche.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is odd that nearly all younger composers should feel
compelled to recycle the masters of the mid-20th century rather
than those of any other epoch. Such recycling is sometimes
justified, or at least explained, as being audience-friendly,
though there is little evidence that the audience is feeling
particularly friendly in return.

CASH BALANCE IMBALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you're a Generation Xer, it could be a pretty good deal: A
``cash balance'' account or pension plan dressed up to look like a
401(k), though it rarely requires employee contributions and calls
for no investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a baby boomer or approaching retirement age, look out.
The cash balance account will do little to boost your pension, and
could slash its value by a whopping 20, 30, even 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, cash balance accounts have become one of the
hottest new benefits in the US workplace as more big companies,
eager to attract top young talent, have shifted traditional pension
plans to cash accounts that may be taken either as annuities or
lump sum payments when employees leave.
</P>
<P>
   Six percent of all US firms were using such accounts in 1994.
Today, more than 12 percent of the nation's top employers either
have switched to cash balance accounts from traditional retirement
plans, which delay payouts until 65, or are giving employees a
choice between the two, reports Hewitt Associates, a benefits
consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big employers are definitely shifting,'' said Hewitt actuary
Michael Johnston. ``It has been the very large companies, the
AT&AMP;Ts, that have gone in this direction first, but others are
starting to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the cash balance account allows companies to woo
highly mobile employees who are in demand by promising a cash
savings pension at the time of departure rather than regular
pension deductions employees can't take or touch until they are
ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional pension plan takes a lot of money and
basically gives most of it to the career employee who eventually
retires, but it gives little to those who come and go early in
their careers,'' said Johnston. ``Technically, it is backloaded. It
throws the money to those in the back end of their careers. Cash
balance is egalitarian. It says, `You're here for five years, when
you go we will still reward you. You'll get more than you would
have if you left right after vesting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said James Delaplane, vice president of retirement policy at the
Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans in Washington:
``The traditional pension has been the norm for many companies
primarily because they had large unionized work forces, but as
companies have evolved that's not necessarily the typical work
force anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Have workers really changed as much as this new trend suggests?
Delaplane couldn't say for sure, but the answer may be yes. After a
decade of layoffs and buyouts, a booming economy and low
unemployment are prompting US companies to hire again, and many are
not union.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the
proportion of union employees in the nation's work force dropped to
13.9 percent in 1998, from 14.1 percent. And while labor added some
new workers to its ranks, the increases in union membership failed
to keep pace with the extraordinary job growth the country enjoyed
in 1998, when 2.2 million new jobs were added to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say employers who make the shift from a traditional
pension plan to a cash balance account are looking to offer optimal
benefits to an increasingly mobile work force for whom longevity
with one company is no longer sought after or even desired.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a Catch 22: The cash balance account may be a boon
to the under-40 set, but it won't boost the retirement plans of
older employees in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Even among younger
workers, there may be conditions. Some companies, for example, will
permit an employee to take only a portion of his cash balance
retirement savings. Typically, that money is then rolled into an
IRA account when the worker leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash balance accounts are not our most desired alternatives to
traditional plans because they work to the disadvantage of older
workers,'' said Glenn Koocher, manager of programs and advocacy at
the American Association for Retired Persons' northeast regional
office in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Traditional pensions usually are based on a formula
similar to this _ number of years service times the highest average
salary in a worker's final years times a factor that may begin at
0.1 at age 40 and rise to, say, 2.5 or more by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   That means the longer you are with the company, the more you are
likely to accrue in pension benefits. In other words, the longer
you remain on the job, the higher the average salary upon which
your pension is calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At AARP,'' said Koocher, ``I get 1.6 percent of my high
average salary over five years times the number of years I've been
employed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a cash balance account, the company puts a fixed amount of
money into the account based on a percentage of annual salary, with
interest. If AARP switched from its traditional plan to a cash
balance retirement plan, Koocher's retirement annuity would be
based only on the money his employer has placed in the pot, rather
than other factors such as Koocher's age, 49, and his eight years
of service.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have provisions that take length of service into
account. They may improve the employer's match to workers' 401(k)
plans, for example, or give older workers points for service.
``There are also instances where companies have set a certain age
or tenure level and everyone older will stay in the old plan, and
people in a particular age group or at a certain tenure level are
converted to the new plan,'' said Delaplane.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Koocher wouldn't want to switch. ``The (cash balance)
account works to the advantage of the 25-to-30 year-old who is
looking to pick up the money and go,'' he said. ``I don't think
it's discriminatory toward older workers, but it is definitely less
advantageous.''

NEW TREASURER, OLD STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Missing millions at the Massachusetts treasurer's office? Lax
management controls? Questions at the state lottery?
</P>
<P>
   As the state's new treasurer, Shannon O'Brien, put it: ``The
bottom line is this: We've inherited a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm shocked! Shocked!
</P>
<P>
   This story had to happen. In fact, two weeks before this
``widening scandal'' broke, I went to see O'Brien and her first
deputy, Michael Travaglini. My pitch to them: You're going to be
digging through predecessor Joe Malone's dirty underwear, and sure
as night follows day you'll find something, this being the state
treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the calls went to the political reporters, whose
stories land on Page One, but those calls were going to come
eventually. It was an alert BankBoston teller who got the ball
rolling early.
</P>
<P>
   Already we have the requisite bad guys, but if it had not been
some middle-level treasury supervisor nicknamed Trixie, it would
have been someone else. Because more than anything we have a lot of
new fixers standing around in need of something to fix.
</P>
<P>
   There's O'Brien and there's the state's new attorney general,
Tom Reilly, and if there's nothing to fix why do we need them?
Auditor Joe DeNucci, whose job description is fixer, has piled on.
And all of these Democrats have found just the thing to fix: the
treasurer's office, previously run by Malone, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, of all people, should be able to appreciate what's
happening. A man of sharp elbows and a heaping helping of piety, he
spent eight years building a career on the backs of his Beacon Hill
enemies, and enjoyed every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   He spent virtually his entire tenure as treasurer running
against the man he replaced, Bob Crane, a Democrat. Even before he
took office in 1991, Malone was jawboning Crane to cancel a round
of last-minute raises to lottery employees. Malone rescinded
contracts to money managers Crane signed up for the pension fund in
his final days. And in the first year Malone wrote down $200
million in bad real estate investments that had been made for the
pension fund on Crane's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the current investigations is John Trischitta, a
treasury worker who is accused of helping a so-called
``heir-finder'' pocket $6.5 million in return for a $50,000
kickback and a share of the profits. Malone and his former aides
say there is no way to build a fail-safe system against a crooked
employee. Just look, they say, at the problems BankBoston had in
its private bank. The bank still hasn't found that guy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But lax controls in state government? What a novel
concept.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense, this is how the system should work. A place
like the treasurer's office is a backwater where big dollars are at
stake and influence can be exercised, but is rarely seen. It is a
place that should turn over often, not just from candidate to
candidate but from Democrat to Republican.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the future _ in four years or eight years _
Shannon O'Brien, a woman, like Malone, of sharp elbows and strong
ambition, will make a run for governor or the US Senate, based on
the work she did cleaning up the mess at the treasurer's office.
And if we're lucky, we'll get a Republican in Room 227 who will
start digging through her underwear.
</P>
<P>
   And we will again be shocked. Shocked!

</P>
<P>
   Robert Maloney, who ran the New England operations for Smith
Barney before he was convicted of illegally steering campaign
donations to his congressman-brother, is back in the brokerage
business.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney has taken a minority stake in Winslow, Evans &AMP; Crocker,
a tiny Boston retail brokerage house where he is a principal and
broker. The firm, whose majority owner is founder Peter Winslow,
has but 27 brokers; Maloney had 850 brokers working for him at
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998 Maloney was sentenced to 60 days of home
confinement and fined $256,000 for contributions he solicited from
Smith Barney employees for his brother, James H. Maloney, a
Connecticut Democrat. Maloney says the plans are to quietly grow
the business. ``After 25 years, I'm back at the beginning,'' he
says.

WITH RAZOR-SHARP DELIVERY, MARTINEZ GREETS HIS MATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ There was no mistaking the new arrival. And
it wasn't just the bright orange shirt Pedro Martinez was wearing,
as he worked the Red Sox clubhouse, shaking hands on both sides of
the aisle like a ward heeler at a pot-luck supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rheeeeallll,'' he said, greeting his former teammate from
Montreal, Rheal Cormier, and giving him a hug. ``Que pasa?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mi amigo, Jin Ho Cho,'' he said, grasping the hand of the
bemused Korean pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, lovely boy,'' he said to newcomer Kip Gross, a teammate
from Martinez's early Dodger days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, fat boy,'' he yelled upon spying Jim Corsi in the
trainer's room. ``Yoda.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's face darkened momentarily when Corsi came over and
made a crack about showing up late, but brightened again when Corsi
extracted the needle without drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, what's up with the funny hats?'' Martinez said, picking
up the new red mesh caps the Sox are wearing this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox clubhouse may be lacking the high drama of previous
springs, back in the days when Wade Boggs was falling out of his
pickup truck, Roger Clemens was jogging with his headphones, or Mo
Vaughn was turning up the heat on Dan Duquette and John Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Martinez is around, there will be no shortage of
high spirits, the kind that can make his tardy arrival appear a
mere trifle, which essentially it is. Surely, Martinez's delayed
touchdown here, two days after the first official workout, wasn't
because he dreaded coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was home spending some good time with my family,'' said
Martinez, who had been given clearance by Sox management to come in
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for permission to be home a few days later because it
was my dad's birthday,'' he said. ``We wanted to be there for his
birthday. We're never there. We always come over by the 15th or so,
so we took those two days to spend with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The only damage Martinez inflicted by showing up Tuesday, it
appeared, was to Joe Kerrigan's meticulous schedules, which chart
the daily activities of every pitcher in camp but will require some
alterations. Martinez underwent his physical, then did some running
and stretching with the other pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what do we have to do now?'' he said to Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably whatever you want to do,'' Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had been working out back home in the Dominican
Republic, said he is able to go on the mound now, and perhaps will
as soon as this morning.
</P>
<P>
   He waded through the obligatory gauntlet of questions about Mo
Vaughn (``We've got to look to the future. Forget about Mo. Mo's
gone. It's true. It's a fact, we have to forget about Mo and focus
on the work we have to do here and get our things done.'')
</P>
<P>
   He also parried several questions about Jose Offerman, a fellow
Dominican and friend with whom he played in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offerman adds speed, defense, and a great bat,'' he said.
``Offerman can hit for average and RBIs. He's good in the clutch, I
can guarantee you that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unfair, he said, to suggest that the Red Sox believe
Offerman can replace Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be any pressure for Offerman,'' he
said. ``He should just concentrate on his work. I don't think
anyone could have had more pressure than I did last year, and I
handled it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys should be professional. When he signed the contract,
Mo was still here. He didn't come to replace Mo, he came here to
play baseball for the Boston Red Sox. You guys have to understand
that and give him the respect he earned and treat him like a normal
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not Mo Vaughn. He can't replace Mo Vaughn, just like I
wasn't Roger when I came over.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez downplayed the impact of the Yankees' trade for
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams have improved this year,'' he said. ``Hopefully
we'll be one of the big surprises like last year. You never know.
You have to go to the field and find that on the field, not off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Roger's there doesn't mean anything. He's a great
pitcher, somebody very important to that team, but things can turn
around. You never know. We have to forget about other teams, and
focus on what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is in the house. Crank up the merengue, dust off
the Dominican flags, and smile until someone gives you a reason to
stop. Martinez hasn't found that reason yet.

 UNDATED: in return.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Also, pastiche is by nature ephemeral. Instead of constructing
in stone, many composers are happily building sand castles to be
washed away by the evening tide, and perhaps in doing so, they are
simply being realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite active commissioning of new work, and performance of it
by major orchestras and opera companies, the core repertory goes on
from decade to decade unchanged. Composers are now bound to face
the fact that their labors are unlikely to outlast a first
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that has changed since the 50s is that classical
music has lost its almost automatic eminence in the culture and its
place in the educational system. No longer does any college student
have at least a recording of Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The most regular contact people today have with a classical
orchestra _ probably even if they are symphony subscribers _ is
through the medium of the film score, where music rarely has a
chance to grow beyond the obligation to enhance emotional
atmosphere. There must be some link here with the debased
Romanticism so much in favor among younger composers.
</P>
<P>
   Only the old, who matured in more confident times, seem able to
create music of expression springing from structural energy, music
made to last _ even if the old, too, have been affected by
retrenchment _ and the American works of the last decade that look
to be most resilient are those of our most senior composers:
Elliott Carter's ``Symphonia,'' Milton Babbitt's many chamber-music
gems. Grandparents rule. But soon the grandparents will be gone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Young Lions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the brighter lights among the younger American
composers on the scene today.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID LANG The dominant creative talent in the Bang on a Can
group, he is capable of going way off beam (``Modern Masters,'' his
opera on John Ruskin) but also of hitting home. The sound may often
be aggressive, but the intensity is real, and the music has a mind
as well as a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   His music can be heard on various Bang on a Can anthologies from
Composers Recordings and Sony Classical, but important recordings _
notably, Steven Schick's of the percussion solo ``Anvil Chorus'' _
are no longer available. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN MACKEY A composer with a wild imagination and often a
keen sense of humor, he is perplexingly underrepresented on record.
His solo album, on Bridge, offers pieces for electric and acoustic
guitars, including ``Cairn,'' a memorial made of gentle appeals and
somber rippling sounds, and ``Lost and Found,'' a darting and
sonorous counterpointing of Renaissance music and rock. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUGUSTA READ THOMAS Big orchestral works show off her strengths:
boldness mixed with sophistication, energetic lyricism and a
somewhat Franco-American style of subtle and occasionally eerie
coloring. Titles are another strong suit. An album in the
Louisville Orchestra's First Edition series includes her Triple
Concerto, which has the subtitle ``Night's Midsummer Blaze'' and
confronts the trio of flute, viola and harp, for which she writes
exquisitely, with surprisingly vociferous music for symphony
orchestra. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ZORN He is so prolific and so various a musician that any
quick characterization will have to await the Zorn scholars of the
21st century. Styles _ rock and classical _ are often freely thrown
together, without intimidating expertise. Recordings of all kinds
are available on his own Tzadik label, one of whose recent releases
is his ``Aporias,'' a piano concerto whose multifarious strands
include Messiaen, Varese and boy choristers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEE HYLA His CD ``We Speak Etruscan,'' on New World, contains
music of compelling frustration, swerving between a mania of
reiterative patterns that fit intricately together and a wistful
meditative gloom. The works, all instrumental and neatly scored,
include two string quartets and a piano concerto, as well as the
title piece, rubbing together bass clarinet and baritone sax. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN HARTKE Beautiful craftsmanship is his hallmark but not
his limitation: the imaginative drive is fresh, partly in being so
playful, though he can also be solemn. A disk of his orchestral
music, on New World, includes his Violin Concerto, which starts
with New York liveliness and ends with a Shetland Islands lament,
and his Second Symphony, which again mixes moods but finishes
slow. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERALD LEVINSON A new CD, preferably including his Second
Symphony, is needed to supplement his first album, on Composers
Recordings. That disk includes one major work _ ``Dreamlight,'' for
cello, piano and percussion _ which demonstrates his ability to
create whole and convincing musical worlds between Western
soul-searching and Oriental (Balinese) joy. It also includes
``Black Magic/White Magic,'' which shows off his inventive
orchestral writing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AARON JAY KERNIS Manifestly skillful in everything he touches,
which is a great deal, he has moved in the 90s toward nightmare
scenarios, whose expression is vivid, even lurid. The saving grace
is his inability to be entirely comfortable with the grand gesture;
often the real music is in the cunning surroundings and
accompaniments, as in his English-horn concerto, ``Colored Field,''
coupled with his piano quartet, ``Still Movement With Hymn,'' on
Argo.

<P>
   If, as they say, religion is the opium of the masses, many
composers today are heavy users _ and pushers. Not a day goes by,
it begins to seem, not a blessed day, without a new recording of
new music steeped in devotion.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be Xanadu in this line was attempted in 1995: the
``Requiem of Reconciliation'' in memory of the victims of World War
II, commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart for
the Europaisches Musikfest Stuttgart, and introduced by the
conductor Helmuth Rilling. Fourteen composers chipped in a movement
each: among them, such strange bedfellows as Luciano Berio,
Friedrich Cerha (savior of the third act of Berg's ``Lulu''), John
Harbison, Bernard Rands, Judith Weir, Wolfgang Rihm, Alfred
Schnittke and Gyorgy Kurtag.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ill-fated Requiem for Rossini, which patched together
the work of a dozen composers now lost to history (plus Verdi, who
spirited his magnificent ``Libera me'' into his subsequent
masterpiece in honor of the poet and patriot Alessandro Manzoni),
Stuttgart's War Requiem failed to catch on. (Documentation survives
in a recording on Hanssler Classics.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems the quintessential construct for the waning
century. Four score and seven years ago (give or take), our modern
forefathers James Joyce and T.S. Eliot brought forth Babels of
jumbled styles and tongues that were accounted ``difficult.'' In
the fin de millenium global village, channel-surfing and cross talk
are the Human Condition.
</P>
<P>
   The eclecticism of a Gustav Mahler was once ``difficult,'' too.
Times have changed. Today his old heresy is glatt kosher. You are
what you quote, the more polyglot the better. Now, God knows,
anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   Ours has been called a godless age. Yet listeners flock to the
distant past, spinning disks of monastic chant and Renaissance
polyphony as purveyed by the Tallis Scholars, Lionheart, Anonymous
4 and their numerous ilk. The well of spirituality shows no signs
of running dry. Overtly or by implication, the continuing output of
such popular or esoteric composers as James MacMillan (``Seven Last
Words From the Cross,'' ``Visitatio Sepulchri''), Giya Kancheli
(``Abii de Viderem,'' ``Life Without Christmas''), Einojuhani
Rautavaara (``Angels and Visitations'') and Sofia Gubaidulina
(``Offertorium'') addresses the spirit as from one co-religionist
to another.
</P>
<P>
   From the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, Schoenberg's Moses was
lately proclaiming God ``unimaginable because invisible, not to be
surveyed, infinite, eternal, omnipresent, almighty.'' His
definition fits a principle for which I have no name. But ``God''
is the wrong word. Raised beyond the pale of organized religion, I
choke on doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the veil lifts in church, once a week. For me,
revelation arrives, on no fixed schedule, in nature, love and art.
Though I do not ``believe'' in him, God speaks to me in the images
of the old Flemish and Italian masters. Angels (for which I confess
a weakness) and hell (the literal ``mouth of the lion'' in the
lower right-hand corner of countless Last Judgments) are to my eyes
truth wrapped in metaphor: in other words, the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   As a general matter, though, art tinged with dogma seems to me
to start out at a disadvantage. Bach overcomes it effortlessly in
the ``St. Matthew Passion''; so do Haydn in ``The Seven Last
Words'' and ``The Creation,'' Beethoven in the ``Missa Solemnis''
and Mozart, Brahms, Berlioz, Verdi and perhaps Britten in their
settings of the Requiem.
</P>
<P>
   To this list I now add Arvo Part's miraculous ``Kanon
Pokajanen,'' as realized by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir
under Tonu Kaljuste on a Grammy-nominated recording (ECM 1654/5;
two CDs). Commissioned by Kolnmusik for the celebration of the
750th anniversary of the Cologne Cathedral last year, the piece
sets a cycle of ancient Church Slavonic prayers of repentance for
chorus a cappella.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, technically and spiritually, it is a tour de force,
though in effect it is austere in the extreme. Over a span of
80-plus minutes, at a pace as glacial as the march of the moon, we
travel from the midnight of contrition to a dawn of atonement. The
rise and fall of the phrases are governed by the speech patterns of
the words as the faithful would speak them in private devotion. The
musical grammar _ strict, transparent _ feels as old as time.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the full chorus bursts forth in solemn
radiance, the voices so present and absolute that they strike the
ear like the answer to some silent ``Let there be light.'' Later,
sections for the men's voices, forlorn and murmuring, alternate
with sections for the women's, floating and maternal. In one
passage, the sopranos glisten away into thin air, like beaten gold.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the basses and tenors sing in octaves, bending the
notes into strange Oriental dissonance. Here, a ray of sound
escapes the shadows, like candlelight glancing off the halo on an
icon. There, the voices spread from the rock-solid bass to a
soprano ether, as if to encompass the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Woven through the tapestry are three refrains. The first, a cry
for mercy, chimes and swings like bells. The two others, formulas
glorifying the Trinity and declaring acquiescence in the divine
will, churn broodily, stony and severe. Or so they do at first.
Toward daybreak, the women's voices cease to peal for mercy, at
last joining in the glorification and the Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Such astral transformations not only give the canon continuity;
they shape its meaning. The final prayer _ a coda that flows
seamlessly from the eight odes of the canon yet traces its own
independent arc _ achieves an earned serenity that may well be
called celestial.
</P>
<P>
   Another sacred commission introduced last year stands in the
sharpest conceivable contrast. For the Oregon Bach Festival,
Krzysztof Penderecki set out to write a setting of the Mass to
place beside Bach's. This stroke of hubris resulted in a 50-minute
setting of the Credo only, scored for orchestra, chorus and five
soloists.
</P>
<P>
   As the composer explained in a letter to Rilling (godfather of
this work as he was of the Requiem for Stuttgart), the Credo alone
absorbed all the musical ideas he had originally intended to spread
over the Mass. In his defense, Penderecki mentioned that he had
injected extra bits in Polish and German into the liturgical Latin
text. The piece as it stood said all he had to say, and besides:
``You will see that a Credo on a grand scale is much more original
than a Mass in traditional form.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording (Hanssler Classics 98311; CD), reveals drama on a
herculean scale, painted in every color in the composer's box. He
deploys a vast post-Romantic arsenal, beginning with a cappella
chorus in mighty assertion, next awakening the organ in an
earth-shattering pedal point, then unleashing the brasses like
giants from the Old Testament. There are stirring marches, spells
of heartsick gloom (``Crucifixus''), heart-on-sleeve episodes for
the soloists, exquisite instrumental interludes.
</P>
<P>
   Repetition, relentless accents, and melodic elaboration make the
text enact what it means. Faith, says the finale in a grand,
unambiguous climax followed by a confusion of anxiety-ridden
voices, harried by light, vicious percussion, is a victory hard
won, and hard to hang on to. A lonely, stratospheric ``Alleluia''
sounds stripped and spent. The concluding ``Amen'' thunders on a
minor chord, the organ lights the sky with a little puff of
high-pitched haze, and silence falls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That ``Kanon Pokajanen'' closes with a formally similar gesture,
for voices alone, implies no common ground. Part's elements, to
speak in metaphor, are light, rock and water. Penderecki's are
blood, sweat and tears. His Credo is a stunning performance, maybe
even, for co-believers, a convincing one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Age of Faith lies far behind us. Scientific method is
long entrenched. Inevitably, contemporary forays into realms of
rite and ritual strike an unbeliever as superstition or a higher
charade.
</P>
<P>
   Like most prejudices, this one merely serves to keep those who
hold it in the dark. What might they be missing? (What might
(italics)I(end italics) be missing?) Apart from figures like Part
and Penderecki, there is a whole international school of
disenchantment and alienation: composers who turn their backs on a
contemporary world run mad, in search of values that are
everlasting.
</P>
<P>
   New recordings from John Tavener, Gavin Bryars and Zbigniew
Preisner ring changes within a single esthetic. Faux-medieval is
not a bad description: the musician's Gothic revival.
</P>
<P>
   Is such music for real? Who is to say?
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell if an artist is sincere? It is hard to prove
the contrary. (There is such a thing as honest affectation.) On the
receiving end, the question ought to be what chords the music
strikes in us.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, we may make a strong presumption of sincerity in
these latest recordings. Each memorializes a loved one who is no
more. Tavener mourns his father; Bryars and Preisner each mourn a
friend. What funeral orator tells unvarnished truth? A universal
shyness forbids speaking ill of the dead. But the brush with
mortality makes us face all the truth we can bear.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eternity's Sunrise'' (Harmonia Mundi HMU 907231; CD),
assisted by the Academy of Ancient Music under the direction of
Paul Goodwin, Tavener addresses ``Death, Love and Eternity.'' Texts
of William Blake, Giorgios Seferis and Sappho of Lesbos share with
the liturgical passages of the concluding ``Funeral Canticle'' a
lapidary unadornment.
</P>
<P>
   Not that one hears much of them; for long stretches, the chorus
and even the soloists might as well be doing pure vocalise. Drones
from low instruments induce a sort of hypnosis; individual players
take occasional flight, as do individual singing voices in
long-drawn, cruelly exposed arabesques. Elsewhere, the plain
inspiration is chant. Between the depths and the heights, a vast
middle is often excluded, a space of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The general effect is of blocklike, simplistic structures
deliberately drained of drama but drenched in a contemplative mood
that varies little. (The paradox of new music for an
early-instrument ensemble should not go unremarked, but Tavener
minimizes any incongruity.)
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Sinking of the Titanic'' several years ago, predating
the musical and the movie, Bryars imagined an acoustic mirage: the
hymns of the band somehow continuing and dissolving into the black
and icy water. The effect was ingenious and deeply haunting. Now
the composer recalls the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
in which his friend and sound engineer Bill Cadman lost his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bryars' title ``Cadman Requiem'' (Point Music 462 511-2; CD)
puns on Britain's ancient religious bard Caedmon, whose verses
Bryars introduces between sections of the traditional Requiem.
</P>
<P>
   The crusty Old English within the Latin context works a contrast
not unlike serpentine interjections of Greek within Tavener's
English. In the spectrum of sounds Bryars draws from the celebrated
vocalists of the Hilliard Ensemble and from Fretwork, a six-person
consort of viols, he leaves Tavener far behind. The textures vary
from densely layered passages to strangely splintered ones, where
the principal musical line keeps switching from one voice to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The two Caedmon solos unfold in a less archaic, more melodic
idiom, and are delivered in individual fashion by the arresting
tenor John Potter and the robust but rough baritone Gordon Jones.
Still, the general impression is much the same. In our minds, we
are back in the Middle Ages, the heavy drone again doing its part.
</P>
<P>
   Without exploding the faux-medieval style, Preisner's ``Requiem
for My Friend'' (Erato 3984-24146-2; CD) goes a good deal farther.
Careful readers of film credits may recognize the composer's name
from Hector Babenco's ``At Play in the Fields of the Lord,''
Agnieska Holland's ``Secret Garden'' and Louis Malle's ``Damage,''
as well as numerous films by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the friend in
question (``Decalogue,'' ``The Double Life of Veronique'' and the
``Three Colors'' series, ``Blue,'' ``White'' and ``Red'').
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Requiem,'' the first section of Preisner's work, his
first independent large-scale composition, confirms his facility in
creating atmosphere. The church ambiance is overwhelming in long
echoes and the groans of the organ.
</P>
<P>
   Bells, cymbals, tangy chromaticism, a pastoral fiddle solo, the
impersonal declamation of the text, the babbling innocence of a
countertenor solo (not to mention the presence of a countertenor in
the first place) and the lovely lisping, shushing sonority of
passages in Polish: all these transport a listener deep into
imaginary mists of time. (Strange to say, a disembodied, pulsing
``Hosanna'' recalls a ``Kyrie'' in Maury Yeston's remarkable score
for the Broadway musical ``Nine.'')
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, which bears the title ``Life'' (uh-oh!), Preisner
pulls more motley material from his hat. A breathy chanteuse
noodles lazily. A flute planes and hovers like a condor on
``Nature.'' A long, aimless processional starts and goes nowhere as
a chorus sings in Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Pure movie music, alas. So much for the willing suspension of
disbelief.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The woman at the first preview was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' she told a friend. ``I thought I would hate it. I
had dinner with some people, and they said, `What are you seeing?'
I told them `Annie Oakley' and they said, (italics)`Why?'''(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question is Bernadette Peters, who stars in
the revival of Irving Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' opening on
Thursday at the Marquis Theater on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it should bother Barry and Fran Weissler, the show's
producers, that the woman called the show by the name of its lead
character; they are, after all, the team that took the best
choreography Tony nomination for their 1994 revival of ``Grease!''
and turned it into ``Best Dancing'' in the show's ads, figuring
that tourists wouldn't know what ``choreography'' meant.
</P>
<P>
   The preview-goer actually put her finger on the conundrum that
is the current production of ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' It is two
shows, really. The first is the Annie Oakley show, in which
Bernadette Peters gets to sing classic Irving Berlin while giving
the character an entirely new spin: shunning Ethel Merman's Mack
truck approach, she has reconceived the role in the vein of Eliza
Doolittle, a backwoods hick, who, with a great deal of sweetness
and spunk, slowly but surely learns everything she needs to know to
get her man, Frank Butler, played by Tom Wopat.
</P>
<P>
   When the show tried out in Washington in early January, the
critic Lloyd Rose wrote in The Washington Post, ``For anyone who
cares about the American musical theater, the chance to see Peters
in this role is reason enough to see the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The second show is the rest of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' directed
by Graciela Daniele and choreographed by her and Jeff Calhoun,
which Ms. Rose and Variety dismissed. The show's book, written
originally by Herbert and Dorothy Fields, with its plethora of
Indian jokes, is offensive by today's standards. So, the Weisslers
hired the writer Peter Stone to revise and update it, though he has
managed to leave such non-Indian gems intact as Annie shifting her
cleavage around and saying, ``I'll show him a thing or two.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of big-budget Broadway spectacles, which celebrate
scenery and animals, Ms. Peters is something of an anachronism. A
genuine musical-theater star, she can either sit around and wait
for a role in a new Stephen Sondheim musical (she is considered by
many to be the premier interpreter of his work) or else be the
diamond in a rough revival setting just for the chance to do the
job she was trained for.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, she has a built-in audience rooting for her. Working
since the age of 3{, she developed her quirky, personal style
during the 60s, when Broadway started its attenuated swan dive as
the world turned to rock-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed her course, winning a Theater World citation for her
performance in ``George M!,'' starring Joel Grey, and a Drama Desk
Award for ``Dames at Sea,'' Off Broadway. She was nominated for a
Tony Award for the 1971 revival of ``On the Town'' and for Jerry
Herman's ``Mack and Mabel.''
</P>
<P>
   She won a Tony as best actress in a musical for Andrew Lloyd
Webber's ``Song and Dance'' in 1986 and was also nominated for
Sondheim's ``Sunday in the Park With George.''
</P>
<P>
   When the theater has hit its fallow periods, she has never had a
problem keeping busy: besides countless television appearances,
everything from ``The Carol Burnett Show'' to ``Fall From Grace,''
in which she played Tammy Faye Bakker to Kevin Spacey's Jim Bakker,
she has appeared steadily in films, and won a Golden Globe Award
for her performance in ``Pennies From Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   After making her Carnegie Hall debut in 1996, she has traveled
internationally with her concert program, which will be broadcast
on PBS in August. But when the theater does come through, she comes
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how much the industry has changed,'' she says, drinking
tea one evening before ``Annie Get Your Gun'' previews are to
begin. She is at the Broadway Grill at the Holiday Inn Crowne
Plaza, where theater memorabilia is displayed in glass cases,
including a shirt she wore in the flop Neil Simon musical, ``The
Goodbye Girl.'' She peers at it. ``My biggest hit,'' she murmurs,
turning away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadway is changing and the roles aren't there because of
that,'' she goes on. ``The shows are different, grander, and with
an operatic sing-talking. Singing the script just isn't my
favorite. With `Annie,' I saw a wonderful character there. She says
what's on her mind and doesn't hold anything back, which is kind of
refreshing. I also thought, `Here comes a show in these strange
times we live in that are so negative that it might be nice to do
something looking up, positive. Maybe it's time to give people a
lift.' Revivals used to be a walk down memory lane instead of a new
show unfolding in front of you. But since revivals are approached
that way now, this one piqued my interest.''
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Ms. Peters is a remarkable-looking woman. Her trademark
pale skin is without lines, her waist is still tiny and this day,
at least, her wild hair is at peace. She seems to retain the
untouched quality of a child, a tranquillity, perhaps, left from
the days when her mother, Marguerite Lazzara, was in charge. A
would-be actress herself who used the name Marge Peters, she
succeeded in getting her 5-year-old daughter onto ``The Horn and
Hardart Children's Hour,'' where she imitated Sophie Tucker. Also
at 5, she won $800 on ``Name That Tune.'' The song she missed on?
``Pistol Packin' Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems somehow indelicate to bring that up now that she is
playing one. Though Ms. Peters is more than willing to chat about
certain things _ Michael Wittenberg, her husband of two and a half
years, who is an investment adviser; which spas give a great
massage; and what a fabulous job her friend Joel Grey has done
decorating her dressing room _ she is skittish about even the most
basic interview questions.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, ``How would you describe yourself?'' she answers:
``I can't describe myself. Do I have to?''
</P>
<P>
   It soon becomes clear why, as Richard Jay Alexander, the
director of her concerts, says, ``Everyone loves her but they don't
know her.'' Because in her own charming, disarming way, she sees to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous depth to Bernadette but it takes time,''
Alexander says. ``She started so young, and she had the same
manager for 27 years, which helped her through the treachery of
Hollywood and gave her a classy career, but she was taught to be
obedient. She doesn't challenge people until they have a certain
kind of relationship. She's enormously deep-feeling and emotional.
I've seen outbursts, not the kind you get from Al Pacino, but she
makes it clear if there's something she's unhappy with. Nothing is
an accident with Bernadette. It's all very deeply thought. I've
worked with a lot of people who show up and say, `I'm here.' She
studies hard. She's a director's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What she is concentrating on now is keeping well. While the flu
sweeps New York, she is gobbling Wellness Formula capsules, firm in
her intent to play all eight shows a week every week for the year's
duration of her contract. Except for matinee days, she takes a
voice lesson every day she performs.
</P>
<P>
   She is prepared for the hard work of carrying a Broadway show,
and says she welcomes it. That does mean, however, that she will
not be able to tour her concert, the second act of which is
entirely Sondheim. She smiles. ``I was telling Steve, `I'm really
going to miss hearing your lyrics, what you have to say.'''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to sing Irving Berlin is certainly a pleasure, but
the combination of Ms. Peters and Sondheim is guaranteed magic.
What makes their connection so powerful? She fidgets. ``I hate
talking about people,'' she says. ``I feel I'm invading their
privacy.'' But this is about the songs he writes, which she sings.
Everyone hears them. She sighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his soul, his songs have a lot to say about
somebody,'' she finally says. ``When he writes a song, he totally
takes on a topic and thoroughly gets into it and it just speaks to
me. I think Steve is a real softie, really. Plus intelligent,
smart, clever. He loves words and knows how to put them together.
But he has a lovely sensitive heart he's probably protecting.''
</P>
<P>
   As does she. Growing up in Ozone Park, Queens, with her eye on
Broadway, Ms. Peters found she could not even get into the chorus.
Standing all of 5 feet 2 with her mass of hair and distracting
bosom, she looked nothing like the tall, tensile dancers who form
the line. During her high school years at the Quintano School for
Young Professionals in Manhattan, where Gregory Hines was a year
ahead of her, she says she was in pain:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a teen-ager and are supposed to look like Twiggy
and you don't, you feel everything is wrong about you. When I was a
teen-ager, Twiggy was it _ straight hair, really skinny, no
breasts. I was trying desperately to blend in and be normal, but
that doesn't allow creativity to come out. Finally, one summer I
was fighting my hair going curly, I was hot, I thought, `The hell
with it.' And it was then I started working. Once I accepted that
about myself, it allowed me to come forward.'' She smiles, just a
touch ruefully. ``Even now, some directors say to me, `What can we
do with your hair?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two people who helped her most, she says, were David
LeGrant, her first acting teacher, and her vocal coach, Jim
Gregory. ``David said, `There is only one of you in the world, so
you must be the best (italics)you(end italics) you can be. And Jim
opened a whole creative world for me with singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her mother, who died in 1982, had always pushed her, Ms.
Peters insists she never felt the pressure was too much. ``We had a
deal that I could stop anytime I wanted,'' she says. ``I really
didn't work a lot as a kid. I would stand in a row for an orange
juice commercial and all the other kids were smiling for no reason,
so I didn't. I'm lucky I never became a success as a kid. I didn't
have to make a success twice. As a kid, it was more like a hobby,
getting my chops, learning the ropes, paying my dues at a young
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when she gathers with the cast at one of the final
``Annie Get Your Gun'' rehearsals before previews begin in New
York, Ms. Peters seems the calmest person in the room. She is
dressed in jeans, cowboy boots, a white camisole top and flannel
shirt. She re-applies her lipstick often and wears wire-rimmed
glasses to read. The task at hand is to polish the production
number ``I Got the Sun in the Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone walked into the room and didn't know who the star
was, the choice would be obvious: she is the smallest, the most
quiet and focused. While the dancers laugh and talk, she marshals
her energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need Bernadette and the four boys,'' Calhoun announces, and
they walk to the center of the room. They review some steps,
including the finale when two of the men lift her and set her on
their shoulders. After a run-through, one of them looks alarmed.
``Are you OK?'' he asks earnestly, touching her upper arm. ``I was
digging a little bit.'' She smiles and folds her hand around his
protectively, to reassure him.
</P>
<P>
   They do the number again. And again. Ms. Peters and the chorus
boys smile dazzlingly at one another, as if they've got a secret,
and maybe they do. As the star, she makes them look better; as her
frame, they keep her company. Their mutual delight in dancing can
convince anyone that every night is Saturday night and life is
nothing more than a jubilant variety show.
</P>
<P>
   As the song rises to its end, Ms. Peters is swept onto the men's
shoulders, skin radiant, eyes shining, her arms up and open in
musical-comedy triumph. There is absolutely no one else in the
world who can fit so comfortably in such a particular seat,
emitting such a particular joy.
</P>

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bobby Grier is considering doing something
that Dan Duquette does routinely _ make a trade.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the norm in the NFL, ever since the Herschel Walker
heist involving the Minnesota Vikings and Dallas Cowboys, but
Grier, the Patriots' vice president of player personnel, says teams
have approached him about deals for a running back knowing that
Robert Edwards may have suffered a career-ending injury. Edwards
was released from Massachusetts General Hospital Tuesday and headed
home to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are three ways we can address it,'' said Grier,
who had a lot of chatter with personnel men at the recent scouting
combine in Indianapolis. ``We could do it through the draft, or
look to free agency, or do something that seldom happens in this
league _ make a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some proposals and we're listening. Some of the
people bandied about are lead backs and some aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints reportedly offered Lamar Smith.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots decide to take the free agency route, they will
consider Darick Holmes, the former Bill and Packer who comes to
Foxborough for a visit Friday, and Travis Jervey, also a Packer,
who comes in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the draft, the Patriots aren't likely to package their
two first-rounders to get in position to take one of the top two or
three running backs coming out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't make a deal like San Diego did with Arizona last
year,'' said Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he's a big fan of Boston College All-American Mike
Cloud and acknowledged that Jerry Azumah of the University of New
Hampshire had an impressive combine. He thinks Cloud will go in the
middle of the draft and Azumah a little later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Azumah is very athletic and can catch the football,'' said
Grier. ``He has a chance of playing as a situational back, and he
returns (kicks). I've always liked Mike Cloud. I told him that he
had his break-out at the end of his junior year when he torched
West Virginia for about 200 yards. I've watched him about seven
games. He's quicker than fast. He has great vision and catches the
ball well out of the backfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier isn't ruling out a player he already has, Sedrick Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possibility,'' said Grier. ``Sedrick is a taleted
kid. He hasn't been able to take that talent from the practice
field to the playing field. This is going to be a very important
year for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said Shaw is immature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to grow up and accept the fact that everything is not a
bed of roses,'' said Grier. ``That some of the things that have
happened to him here are his fault. That he can't lay the blame
elsewhere all of the time. This is his third year. If he can't help
us win, then he won't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said the running back crop in the draft will be similar to
last year, when there were three top guys (Curtis Enis, Fred
Taylor, and Edwards) and then a falloff. The Patriots, who pick
21st and 28th in the first round, might benefit from the strong
quarterback crop this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might get a better player than we expected because some
teams will feel that this is the year to draft a quarterback if you
need one,'' said Grier.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may even dabble in the quarterback pool themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to draft a young quarterback and maybe sign a
veteran quarterback,'' said Grier, who didn't seem to be endorsing
a Scott Zolak return. ``I think if we did anything, we'd like to be
able to get a quarterback who can complement Drew (Bledsoe) and
throw on the run. We don't want to duplicate what we have. On draft
day a lot of weird things happen. We'll wait and see. There are
some quarterbacks we like, but there are other positions we like
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said the departed Tom Tupa was actually the team's No. 2
quarterback last year and would have played when Bledsoe was hurt
if back problems hadn't arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything would have happened during the year earlier, Tom
would have played,'' said Grier. ``As the year went on and reps
became more precious, that's where Zolak came into play. Tom was
punting and he did have some back injuries and there was a point
where we could't use him as a QB.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier all but anointed Heath Irwin the starting center,
replacing Dave Wohlabaugh, who signed a lucrative deal with the
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hate to lose a player of Dave's caliber,'' he said.
``I've always been very high on him. But I've also been high on
Heath as a football player and an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also like Jason Andersen. Heath wouldn't be one of the
bigger, stronger centers but I think he's more in the line of a
Dermontti Dawson, who is a smaller guy but very athletic and can do
a lot of things like get out on the backers, pull, etc. I'm not
saying he's Dermontti Dawson, but he has that kind of athletic
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier also seemed inclined to grab an offensive lineman in the
first round. He said they were the most impressive athletes at the
combine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are getting bigger and bigger and faster,'' he said.
``At one point, Aaron Gibson (of Wisconsin) got on the scale _ 6-6,
386. The kid (Derrick) Fletcher from Baylor got on and he was 6-6,
376. There was a kid who followed both of them who got on and
weighed 336 and he looked like a dwarf after following those two
kids. There are some huge offensive linemen who are good athletes
and are well-coached.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may be close to signing free agent defensive tackle
Bob Kuberski of the Packers, who at 6-4, 300 pounds could back up
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Grier also said the team is doing a detailed study of all the
injuries last season to see if there's an area they can pinpoint
for prevention. He doesn't blame the offseason conditioning
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use that as a primary factor in injuries we've had,''
said Grier. ``We've had guys who have been in this program from Day
1 who got hurt. Some of the hardest workers in the program got
hurt. Jacksonville had 16 guys on IR and they have a great
offseason program.''

DON'T CALL JAZZ AMERICA'S CLASSICAL MUSIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's one you may have heard before: Jazz is America's
classical music. It's a declaration that is always intoned with
great seriousness and a touch of argumentative pride; the intent is
to grant jazz the respect it undeniably deserves. But that
formulation has always left me skeptical, and I've come to think
that it does current jazz more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   In bygone decades, conflating jazz and classical music had some
remedial effect; it helped non-musicians understand that jazz is a
serious discipline, and helped jazz make headway in institutions,
with its media image and among arts donors. Now, the equation of
jazz and classical music only interferes with drawing new listeners
and helping them understand what they hear.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why people linked jazz and classical music.
Both are music for music's sake, in a separate commercial realm
from the windfalls of pop, rock and hip-hop. Both styles are
primarily instrumental and wordless, without the easy signposts of
pop verses and choruses.
</P>
<P>
   They both reward knowledgeable listeners, though they can easily
be enjoyed without a music degree. And both call for their
performers and listeners to be mature, emotionally if not
chronologically: to have long attention spans, to understand depth
and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Simply to enter either field as a performer is to make a huge
commitment, because only virtuosos need apply. Musicians must be
willing to practice until their hands ache, to absorb a long and
rigorous tradition, and only then, after years of work, to find out
whether they have the mysterious inspiration that will make them
worthy soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music and jazz also share a recording esthetic: both
are centered on real-time group performances, not recording-studio
assemblages (though editing and retakes are common). Compared to
pop albums, jazz and classical music are relatively inexpensive to
record: days of studio time compared to months or years. At
recording companies, classical music and jazz are often in the same
corporate division, as the two specialized styles that connote
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the similarities end when it comes to the music itself. In
almost every way except the high standards they impose on
musicians, jazz and classical music are diametrically opposed.
Every esthetic criterion is different: the smoothness of
instrumental and vocal delivery in most classical music versus the
smears and growls of jazz, well-tempered classical intonation
versus the blues inflections of jazz, the central role of rhythm in
jazz versus the peripheral one of rhythm in classical music, and,
most important, the fixed classical composition versus the
improvisatory disciplines of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Classical performances are almost entirely premeditated,
resuscitating scores from the distant or near past; jazz insists on
surprises and lives in an eternal present tense.
</P>
<P>
   In classical music since the Baroque era, the composer has been
exalted above all. Performers are expected to be distinctive, but
only because they have different ideas on how best to realize the
grand formal architecture and fine details of a composer's work.
</P>
<P>
   They are, with more or less humility, interpreters. And despite
the efforts of living composers, most of what classical musicians
interpret is from the repertory, not new work.
</P>
<P>
   In jazz, the performer trumps the composer. Jazz musicians do
treat some material with reverence, but they can also bring to it
irony, bemusement, savage wit, irreverence or elaborate
one-upmanship. Compositions are still important; whether it's
Ellington or Monk or Wayne Shorter or Tin Pan Alley standards, jazz
musicians prize the combination of musicianly intricacy and
indelible melody.
</P>
<P>
   But for jazz musicians, the underlying structure is less
important than what happens to it on the bandstand. To a
form-minded classical listener, the typical jazz structure of
theme-solos-theme may be banal. But just as Bach and Beethoven
built monumental sets of variations on modest material, a great
jazz improviser can turn a trivial pop ditty or a rudimentary blues
into an unforgettable performance.
</P>
<P>
   While classical music works toward a finished whole, jazz is
about process and interaction: about the thought and reflexes
involved when the saxophonist suddenly switches into double time
and the drummer answers with an approving flurry of cymbal taps.
Classical chamber groups, like jazz quintets, are cooperatives, but
they know what notes they'll play before they step on a stage. A
jazz group doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a significant exception in the jazz
tradition: big-band music, jazz's orchestral side. Section players,
like classical musicians, are expected to play the notes on the
page. Big-band composers and arrangers have nearly the same
unquestioned authority as classical composers, and they use big
bands to explore concepts involving precise orchestral sonorities
and large-scale forms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But jazz composers like Ellington always acknowledged that they
wrote for performers, not for posterity; they built their pieces
around the musicians who would bring them to life, hearing the
individual voices in the ensemble work. As they wrote, they kept
the music participatory rather than entirely autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``America's classical music'' line has settled in, jazz
repertory groups have established themselves at institutions like
Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. They treat important jazz
compositions with due admiration and work on some of the same
issues _ like historical authenticity versus present-day needs _
that have also engrossed the classical world.
</P>
<P>
   That's a worthwhile development; it keeps jazz in touch with its
history, gives musicians a stylistic education and makes sure that
important American music is heard not as an unyielding recording
but with live musicians taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   Major works like Wynton Marsalis' ``Blood on the Fields'' and
the reconstruction of Charles Mingus' ``Epitaph'' would not be
possible without jazz repertory groups. Yet no one pretends that
jazz repertory is all of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, classical music's fascination with form has also been
filtering through to young mainstream jazz musicians who are
exploring musical structure in small ensembles. Unlike classical
composers, they keep their forms volatile, improvising with the
shape of a piece as well as with the solos and interplay.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not trying to bring back ``third stream'' music, the
largely stillborn attempts to unite contemporary classical music
and jazz; they're just trying to spur some new improvisational
responses. And they don't aspire to the repeatability of classical
performances.
</P>
<P>
   As a marketing slogan, the jazz-equals-classical formula is like
handing an anchor to a drowning man. It's not as if jazz covets
classical music's popularity. Jazz and classical music each account
for less than three percent of sales of recorded music in any given
year (and less if Kenny G. and the ``Titanic'' soundtrack are
factored out). Luckily, both can count on dedicated audiences for
live performances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many potential listeners are put off by the solemnity of
classical music. The ritual of classical concert-going _ with a
silent audience contemplating a certified masterpiece by (usually)
a dead composer _ carries an aura of European elitism, which may
well be inseparable from music that long depended on the European
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who do give themselves over to silent absorption of
classical music find how gratifying it can be; the music thrives in
its formal setting.
</P>
<P>
   But jazz has always been a more informal, more participatory
medium, true to the call-and-response of its African ancestry and
its roots in parade music and dance tunes. Fans whoop or applaud
for a great solo, or laugh at a clever allusion; toes tap, heads
bob.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz musicians shouldn't have to perform amid conversation _ the
best jazz audiences are serious listeners _ but concert-hall
decorum can inhibit musicians as well as fans. Positioning jazz as
``America's classical music'' could keep people away from jazz's
earthiness and exaltation.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the ``classical'' stamp on jazz is a way of insisting on
the music's discipline and significance. Yet jazz is already
important without getting all high-toned. One of jazz's
all-American advantages is that, like important popular idioms
around the world, it rose up from under: out of bordellos and
speak-easies, dance halls and rent parties came genius after
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz legends weren't commissioned by churches or counts; they
had more colorful patrons. And in upstart America, an outlaw
heritage confers a touch of glamour that jazz should use. Jazz is
as complex, intelligent, passionate and profound as classical
music; we know that now.
</P>
<P>
   Far from having to borrow status from classical music, it should
get respect on its own very different terms.

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Blame it on Mo's momma.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know the real reason that Mo Vaughn is wearing an
Anaheim uniform these days, instead of Boston's, remember that
there is a reward in heaven for those who ignore their fathers and
do what their mothers insist is the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, making his official spring training debut with his new
teammates Tuesday, dropped this tidbit as he retraced the saga that
saw him end up with an $80 million contract that took him away from
Boston. When Vaughn became a free agent after the 1998 season, his
parents, Leroy and Shirley, disagreed on their son's choice of
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy wanted to see Mo retire in a Red Sox uniform. Shirley told
him not to be afraid to pursue his destiny, even if it meant
leaving the only ``home'' he'd ever known. Shirley won.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were with me on every decision I ever made,'' said
Vaughn. ``How I did was just as important for them as it was for
me. My dad wanted me to retire in a Red Sox uniform because that
had been so much a part of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom can handle the intensity of things and the
expectations. My father wanted her to bite her tongue. She
couldn't. As a mother to a son, she just said it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said signing with the Angels was a business decision, but
one influenced by the fact that they treated him with more respect
in one offer than the Red Sox had shown him in a year and a half of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn wanted to make a good impression on his first day as an
Angel, and most agreed that he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally got somebody who is not afraid to fail,'' said
pitcher Ken Hill, a Lynn, Mass., native. ``That's the bottom line.
In this game, you're going to be a hero or goat, but guys like him
want to take it on their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Massachusetts native, shortstop Gary DiSarcina
(Billerica), broke his left arm in a freak batting practice
accident Monday. His goal is get well by Opening Day so he can play
in the same lineup with Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Boston,'' said DiSarcina, ``and I have an
understanding of what he's all about and what he brings to the
table. It's not just performance sometimes. It's off the field, the
plane rides, dinner with the guys. The whole package. It's good to
have him on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know about his intensity,'' said Rod Carew, the Hall of
Famer who will be Vaughn's batting instructor. ``He's going to be a
leader and that is what we need. There is no looking back or
looking around and making excuses. They all know the challenge that
is ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined that Mo was the No. 1 free agent out there,''
said Angels general manager Bill Bavasi. ``You're not going to get
him cheap. First and foremost was his playing ability, his numbers.
But the makeup was a big issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped the Angels' cause that the Red Sox held off their best
offer until late in the negotiations. By then, Vaughn had made up
his mind that the Angels deserved first shot because they didn't
hesitate to roll the dice and put the dollars on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't want to give anybody else a chance to get
there,'' said Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn joins a potent lineup. The Angels outfield of Garret
Anderson, Tim Salmon, and Jim Edmonds, when healthy, is one of the
best in baseball. Darin Erstad, who played first base last year and
now will be the fourth outfielder, hit .296 in 133 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to bring in a guy who can hit 40 home runs,'' said
Salmon. ``It just makes our lineup that much stronger. You've got
to be excited with him hitting in front of or behind you. It will
make some things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for a savior. We've shown that in most
situations we have enough to win. He brings credibility to our
lineup. We match up better.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is no stranger to several Angels. One of the candidates
for the shortstop job is Luis Rivera, a former teammate in Boston.
Coaches Rick Wise, Dick Pole, Carney Lansford, and John McNamara
all have Red Sox ties and are aware of Vaughn's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will make a difference with this club,'' said
Rivera. ``I'm still surprised he got out of there. Especially with
the community ties he made.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, incidentally, says he will maintain those ties and
continue to support the foundation he set up in Boston. There are
no plans to open a California branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to make this club,'' he said. ``I'm here to help
this club. They already got talent and leaders. I've got to come
here and do my job _ to help this club to be as good as it can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows he also is here to offer advice and provide
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 31,'' he said. ``That's old, isn't it? I just recall when
I was a kid and I wished I had some guys who would come up to me.
It's all a mental game, anyway. You're already talented enough. You
have to get yourself ready mentally so that you can be consistent
every turn at bat.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things happened in Boston the last couple of years that
contributed to Vaughn's departure. And he knows not everybody will
remember him kindly. Hopefully, it won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put me on the map to have played there,'' said Vaughn. ``I
don't look at the situation in a negative light at all. It gave me
an opportunity to be here and do what I'm doing. No matter what you
say about me, when it came down to playing the game, I played the
way it was supposed to be played. I have no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, his tune changed a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened fell on the shoulders of two guys,''
said Vaughn. ``The general manager and the owner. In life, you all
know that if you want something, you go get it, even if the money
isn't there. You take care of it. The Angels came with respect and
showed that they wanted me over here. I wasn't going to go on a
barnstorming campaign and see who made the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk out both sides of their mouth, it is really
hard. I look at the situation now and I wish them all good luck. I
just want to go out there and do what I'm capable of. It's not a
grudge. I'm a happy person. I just want to go out and do the things
I'm capable of doing.''

 (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The composer Jack Beeson concedes that in the context of
American contemporary music, his opera ``Lizzie Borden,'' which had
its premiere at the New York City Opera in 1965, is probably
considered musically conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Based on accounts of a horrific ax murder that took place in
Fall River, Mass., in 1892 and was soon steeped in legend (``Lizzie
Borden took an ax, and gave her father 40 whacks,'' goes the
familiar children's chant), the opera has generally been praised as
gripping theater. But despite its angst and dissonance, the score
is tonally grounded, often hews to recognizable keys, has stretches
of sweet lyricism and set-piece arias, and even incorporates a
likeness of a Protestant hymn tune and a pastiche of a Victorian
parlor song.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the standards of what was mostly around in those days and
what was mostly being written about,'' Beeson said recently in his
Upper West Side apartment, `` `Lizzie Borden' was, like all my
operas, I suppose, conservative, whatever that term means.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is surprising to find that in the mid-1960s, when a schism
was widening between the self-described modernists, who mostly
championed Serialism, and the so-called traditionalists, who
retained links with tonality, a striking number of knowledgeable
critics considered ``Lizzie Borden'' to be on the musical cutting
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Commanday, in The San Francisco Chronicle, referred to
the complex score's ``apparent 12-tone procedure.'' And Leighton
Kerner, then a young freelancer, wrote in Women's Wear Daily that
the score ``stands on its own as contemporary music'' and is ``not
in the least bashful about jumping into atonality or Serialism.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is not a trace of Serialism in the music. How to
explain the confusion? ``Back then, if it was dissonant, it was
thought to be 12-tone,'' suggested Beeson, who, at 78, is affable,
dapper and has recently completed his 10th operatic work. ``I don't
think `Lizzie' will strike many people today as being all that
dissonant.''
</P>
<P>
   Operagoers can judge for themselves on Saturday evening, when
``Lizzie Borden'' returns to the repertory of the company that
presented its premiere but in a new production directed by Rhoda
Levine and conducted by George Manahan.
</P>
<P>
   Produced with the Glimmerglass Opera, it was introduced there,
to considerable acclaim, in the summer of 1997. The mezzo-soprano
Phyllis Pancella will sing the title role; the baritone Stephen
West is Lizzie's miserly father Andrew Borden; and the soprano
Lauren Flanigan will portray his manipulative young second wife.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the story of the confused critical
reception ``Lizzie Borden'' received in 1965, and the continuing,
and pointless, attempts to pigeonhole it stylistically. The decades
of the 1960s and 70s were a fractious time in every aspect of
American life, and music was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   After the Second World War, composers increasingly took refuge
in university music departments, a development both good and bad.
That composers were shielded from the necessity of earning a living
through their music was obviously beneficial. But many composers
claimed the intellectual high ground at the expense of mainstream
audiences, writing works of daunting complexity according to
rigorous procedures to engage and challenge one another.
</P>
<P>
   Those who still cared about reaching the outside public, which
included virtually every composer of opera, were considered
panderers by many of their atonalist colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The split was evident in Columbia University's music department,
where Beeson had been teaching since 1945. Beeson was fascinated
and somewhat amused by conflicting accounts of the schism depicted
by two American composers, who were born in the same year, 1938,
and who attended the college at the same time. As reported by K.
Robert Schwarz in a 1997 article in these pages, Charles Wuorinen
ridiculed the idea that composers at Columbia during that period
were under the stranglehold of Serialist bullies on the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reigning orthodoxy was on one hand, a kind of Coplandesque
Americana and, on the other hand, the symphonism of Howard Hanson
and Roy Harris,'' Wuorinen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But the other composer, John Corigliano, who now writes
luxuriously tonal works, insisted that Serialism was the ``official
academic manner'' at the time. Beeson, who knew them both as
students and respects them as composers, said he did not recognize
the Columbia that either described. But he was not entirely
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``An undergraduate is young, excited, combative, and thinks that
everyone who isn't with him is against him,'' he said. ``Written
all over Charlie's and John's reactions were their own rather
strong personalities between the ages of 18 and 22.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeson's perspective on the schism is refreshingly undogmatic.
Moreover, to him, the central issue is not where his operas fit in
the spectrum of 20th-century compositional styles. Opera is a world
unto itself, with its own byways and practices, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who write more than a few operas get to be known as
opera composers,'' he said. ``I think they are set aside somewhat
by the regular composers of so-called serious music, who don't
necessarily look down on the opera composers, but look sideways at
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The sideways glance Beeson refers to is not free of a certain
prejudice, he believes: ``An opera composer is often thought of by
the serious composer of chamber and orchestra works as someone who
is diluting the purity of music with words, lights, costumes and
the rest of it, writing musical dramas for the great unwashed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Beeson believes that the pragmatic skills required to compose a
successful opera can come only from experience in the theater. On
this subject he agrees entirely with Aaron Copland, who divided
composers like himself who ``play at writing operas'' from those
``hopelessly attracted to this `form fatale.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though Beeson has composed more than 110 nonoperatic works, he
clearly considers himself among the hopelessly attracted few. And
it took hold early in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Muncie, Ind., he grew up listening to the radio
broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera in the early 1930s and started
writing librettos as an adolescent, including an adaptation of
Byron's ``Manfred'' and, closer to home, ``Red Wing,'' a tale of
``an Indian princess who was supposed to be buried under our boy
scout camp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the musical skill to set his own librettos, he attended
the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, then took private lessons
with Bartok in New York. In 1945, he began his association with
Columbia, first working as a rehearsal pianist, coach and assistant
conductor in the Opera Workshop, which for nearly two decades
produced innovative operatic productions, including significant
premieres of American operas.
</P>
<P>
   He learned first-hand that the best opera composers were those
with a wide palette of styles. The music he wrote, in 1957, for
``The Sweet Bye and Bye,'' a story of Christian evangelists
confronting revelers in Atlantic City in the 1920s, evokes
evangelical hymns and flapper dances.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lizzie Borden,'' which Beeson called ``a highly wrought-up
and agonized affair,'' is expressionistic and harmonically pungent,
though here, too, the music abounds with period touches. When the
music historian Nicolas Slonimsky described Beeson's style as
``marked by enlightened utilitarianism,'' the composer could not
have been more pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Opera has selected ``Lizzie Borden'' to be
telecast nationwide on March 24 as part of the ``Live From Lincoln
Center'' series. Kenward Elmslie, the librettist, and Richard
Plant, who prepared the scenario, based the work on the historical
Lizzie Borden, who was accused of hacking not only her father but
also her young stepmother to death.
</P>
<P>
   Though charged and tried, she was acquitted for lack of
evidence. But the operatic Lizzie is clearly the murderer, and the
act is depicted in music of slashing, visceral intensity.
</P>
<P>
   There are listeners for whom operas like ``Lizzie Borden'' are
hopelessly melodramatic, virtually a mid-century American
continuation of Italian Verismo. But it is hard to deny the
subtlety and power of the characterizations. Lizzie is sullen and
full of repressed anger, but also terribly lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger, more vulnerable sister, Margaret, is a role for
lyric soprano, but her high-flying lyrical lines and coloratura
twitterings suggest that Margaret, also a virtual prisoner in her
father's home, is unstable and in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Borden's grim bluster is conveyed though pouting,
sputtering vocal lines. But he is also powerfully attracted to his
young wife, the scheming Abigail. Yet when Abigail sings of living
in a house heavy with the presence of her husband's first wife, the
unnerving music makes you feel she has a legitimate complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1965 New York City Opera performance is now
available on a two-disk CRI recording, an important contribution to
the discography of American opera. A 1974 recording of ``The Sweet
Bye and Bye,'' by the Kansas City Lyric Theater, has also been
reissued on CD by the Citadel company. These releases, plus others
to come, should help Beeson's operas secure more productions,
especially now that the climate for contemporary music is more
tolerant of stylistic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still composing them. His ninth, a one-act work called
``Sorry, Wrong Number,'' based on the 1944 radio play, will be
given its premiere at the Kaye Playhouse in New York in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Beeson turned to a frequent collaborator, Sheldon Harnick, for a
libretto, but Harnick wasn't interested: ``Sheldon said the story
was too `Grand Guignol' for him, and he didn't approve of the
murder at the end. He told me to do it myself. So I did. Turned out
just fine.''

LABELS PROFIT AND PAY A PRICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news from most of the world's major classical-music
labels is that the gloom of recent years has largely been
dispelled. Granted, classics account for only 2.3 percent of the
American record market, just less than jazz (2.5 percent),
according to Soundscan, a company that tracks sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives who run most of the major labels say their
divisions are profitable and the future is secure.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that this profitability has been attained
through a series of bloodlettings in recent years. Staffs have been
cut, artists have been jettisoned and project lists have been
pared. All these things have happened before, of course: the
marketplace has long dictated expansions and contractions that
occur with almost tidal regularity.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, the rules of engagement have taken a
radical turn. Now, the standard repertory _ the Romantic
symphonies, chamber works and operas that were formerly a safe
haven _ has become a target.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest development in a corporatization of artist
and repertory decisions that began in the late 1970s, when
pop-dominated labels rebelled against the expectation that their
profits would subsidize the classics. A series of takeovers in the
1980s and 1990s looked promising: when Bertelsmann took over RCA
and Sony acquired CBS, their recording programs increased
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Warner joined the fray, buying Erato, Teldec and Finnadar. And
Seagram's, having just bought Polygram, has assured Deutsche
Grammophon, Philips and Decca/London that they will be unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   But the multinationals have shown a tendency to micromanage, and
companies that were profitable and healthy quickly stopped taking a
benign view of divisions that produced less startling yields. Even
freak hits like the Three Tenors disks, which helped subsidize more
serious, slower-selling recordings, became mixed blessings: they
persuaded corporate number-crunchers that classics
(italics)could(end italics) sell in the millions if only artists
and label executives would choose the right projects.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, definitions and expectations are shifting wildly in
the classics world, and as executives try to determine their
companies' missions _ and as performers juggle conscience, artistry
and ambition in a struggle to find their places _ the business has
become peculiarly amorphous.
</P>
<P>
   Conductors in particular are waking up to a hostile new world,
as several whose recording careers seemed solid have been cut
adrift. Charles Dutoit and Christoph von Dohnanyi, who recorded
plentifully for Decca/London, have lost their exclusive contracts,
and now work project by project.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Slatkin, long RCA's great American hope, was dropped at
the end of last year, when the company decided to throw its full
weight behind the more recently signed Michael Tilson Thomas on the
ground that Thomas' dynamic personality and his unusual repertory
ideas were more easily marketed.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin brought the company his share of novelties, from Leroy
Anderson vignettes to works by Ginastera and John Corigliano. But
he also recorded the Tchaikovsky symphonies, and had hopes of
making his way through the rest of the standard canon; that, in
today's climate, is an unhealthy desire.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that a conductor will get the go-ahead to record,
say, a Beethoven cycle for a major label in 1999 is virtually nil.
Label heads are unanimous on this point. And it seems not to bother
consumers much, either.
</P>
<P>
   The principal reason record companies are reluctant to keep
recording the warhorses, after all, is that people are not willing
to buy the newest interpretations _ certainly not enough to justify
the enormous recording costs, which are around $200,000 for an
American orchestra (without soloists or chorus) and roughly a third
as much in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Why have these recordings lost their appeal? An undiplomatic
answer is that in the core repertory, few of today's conductors are
able to create the kind of excitement that made their predecessors'
recordings hot commodities.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact is, times have changed. In the 1950s, when LPs were
new and the business was coming of age, Beethoven and Brahms
cycles, let alone Mahler and Bruckner recordings, were sparse
enough that each new release was an event. People bought those
disks, memorized their interpretive quirks, engaged in impassioned
debates and waited for other performers to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   But after 50 years _ more if you factor in reissues from the
78-rpm era _ the catalogs are awash in recordings of the standard
works.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to determine who might buy a new Beethoven cycle, the
record industry looks at a model of the market divided into three
segments. ``Core collectors,'' who have traditionally sustained the
business, can be expected to buy at least 40 new disks a year.
</P>
<P>
   Recordings that appeal to them generally sell fewer than 10,000
copies. ``New listeners,'' who have come to classics recently,
might buy six or seven, but are more strongly drawn to new works _
say, Kronos Quartet recordings _ than to the standard repertory.
Still, they can push sales toward 70,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond them lies the Promised Land, or more prosaically, the
mass market: buyers uncommitted to classical music but who, with
the right media push (a PBS special or a film connection) can be
induced to snap up recordings by the millions. The champion here is
James Horner's ``Titanic'' film score, on Sony Classical, which has
reportedly sold 9.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for a label with a new Beethoven cycle is that none
of these groups have much use for it. Core collectors own cycles on
CD by Toscanini, Walter, Bernstein, Szell, Karajan, Furtwangler and
Mengelberg, and perhaps period-instrument traversals by Frans
Bruggen and Roger Norrington, along with individual symphony
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   New collectors gravitate toward classic accounts as well, partly
because of the aura of reverence that surrounds them and partly
because, as reissues, they are comparatively inexpensive. Forget
the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   The preference for reissued older recordings serves labels'
interests, too. These sets were recorded when costs and royalty
rates were low, and have long since been amortized. And with
classic status translating to steady demand, they require only the
slightest promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Reissues, in fact, are now mentioned in the same breath as
crossovers when executives speak of the lifeblood of the business.
At RCA, which now releases only 30 new recordings a year (down from
120 three years ago), reissues make up 75 percent of the annual
release schedule.

DUQUETTE TAKES POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Dan Duquette, still fighting off the remnants
of a weeklong bout with the flu but sounding as relaxed as the
black suit-and-sneakers ensemble he wore to the Red Sox training
complex Tuesday, gave a vigorous defense of the Jose Offerman
signing while making it clear that the club is prepared to deal for
more offensive punch this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox general manager, making his first appearance in camp
after delaying his flight from Boston on doctor's orders,
acknowledged the strength of the Yankees while questioning
Toronto's willingness to put Roger Clemens in pinstripes. But he
also stressed that he expects a Red Sox team that won a wild-card
spot last season to be a contender again this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a stable pitching staff and good defense, that's the
foundation of our team,'' Duquette said. ``If it's artfully managed
like we know Jimy Williams and (pitching coach) Joe Kerrigan can
effectively do, that should be enough to put us in the pennant
race. Beyond that, if we need some more hitting, we'll get some
more hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Clemens trade to the Yankees and its impact on
the pennant race, Duquette said:
</P>
<P>
   ``See, what's been lost in this equation so far is that David
Wells was 18-4 last season, so whoever replaces Wells in the Yankee
rotation has to pitch at a high level, obviously, for them to
maintain the status quo. Obviously, the Yankees have a good team,
they had a great record last year, and they're returning with their
basic team intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge hasn't really changed. The Yankees were strong
before the trade, and they're strong after the trade. That hasn't
changed our challenge. We've got to put together a team that can
get into a position to beat the Yankees in a short series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I thought we matched up with the Yankees pretty
effectively. Unfortunately, we didn't get to that short series to
play them. The pennant is still up for grabs, playoff spots are
still up for grabs, and we aim to do everything we can to challenge
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won five of 12 meetings against the Yankees last
season, with all three of the top Sox starters _ Pedro Martinez,
Bret Saberhagen, and Tim Wakefield _ beating New York at least
once.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said, ``It doesn't bother me,'' when asked about the
broad criticism he has received for giving a four-year, $26 million
contract to Offerman, expected Wednesday for the team's first
full-squad workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about Offerman is our fans are going to
like watching him play,'' Duquette said. ``There are not too many
players who can do what he can do in the American League, and excel
in as many categories as he excelled.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette noted that Offerman's deal is about the same as the
four-year, $25 million deal the Sox gave third baseman John
Valentin last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's like the going rate for qualified established
major league infielders,'' Duquette said. ``Offerman is not only a
qualified established major league infielder, he's one of the best
producing players in the American League last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk all you want about what the Red Sox paid Jose
Offerman. There was interest in him from the Orioles. There was
interest in him from the Indians. What was the extent of the
interest from those clubs? I don't know exactly. I know Cleveland
paid significantly more for their second baseman than what we paid
for Offerman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians signed free agent Robbie Alomar, a nine-time
All-Star celebrated as much for his fielding skills as his offense,
if not more. Offerman, whose defense has been a liability, has been
an All-Star once in his career, as a shortstop for the Dodgers in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a good sign for the Red Sox,'' Duquette
said. ``This kid is just coming into his own. He can hit when it
counts, he's a switch hitter, he's a premier on-base man and he's a
premier base-stealer. Over time, it will be a good and valuable
contract for the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he expects the Sox to compensate in part for the
power they lost when Mo Vaughn left by increased power in right
field, from rookie Trot Nixon, and a full season out of Mike
Stanley, who didn't join the club last season till the end of July.
He also pointed to a healthy Reggie Jefferson, who played just 62
games last season because of a stress fracture in his back, as a
key component.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wild card is what kind of offensive production are we
going to get from our DH,'' he said. ``It's well known that to win
in the American League, you need production from your DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see how those questions are answered, in the event we
need more power for our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he hasn't had any discussions ``recently'' with
the White Sox about Frank Thomas, whose name has come up repeatedly
this winter in trade speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep reading that Frank Thomas is available in a trade, but
that hasn't really been confirmed to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette seemed unconcerned about the abundance of second
basemen/DH types. First, he said, Jefferson and Jeff Frye, both of
whom finished last season on the disabled list, must show they're
healthy and capable of playing at optimum levels. Williams, he
said, has a knack for using his players, which could mean that
Offerman plays second at times, shares first base with Stanley on
other occasions, and platoons with Jefferson at DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some depth at second base that may create some
opportunities for us, if everyone is healthy, for a trade,''
Duquette said, ``where we can trade some of our depth at second to
address other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will take care of itself as the season progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette has said the Red Sox were interested in dealing for
Clemens. Without naming him, he took a swipe at Blue Jays GM Gord
Ash for his willingness to deal Clemens to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a curious position Toronto established,'' he said.
``They established that early on in their trade discussions with
other ball clubs. Their position was they would trade him to the
Yankees because the Yankees were world champions and not really one
of their direct competitors, but they wouldn't engage their direct
competitors, us being one of them, in substantive trade
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's a curious position, because if you're going to
accomplish your ultimate goals you need to do it in your division
first. But that was their position all along. Very rarely do you
see the Red Sox make a trade with the Yankees, for obvious reasons.
They're our direct competitors. Very rarely do we make a trade with
the Orioles and Blue Jays.''

 UNDATED: release schedule.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having enjoyed recent successes with boxed sets devoted to
Sviatoslav Richter and William Kapell, the label is planning a
99-CD Rubinstein box (to be priced at about $1,500) for September,
and a big Heifetz box and a more expansive Richter set for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of new releases to reissues is less extreme elsewhere.
Still, most labels know the value of their archives: Sony
Classical's beautifully packaged Masterworks Heritage series has
set a high standard for the presentation of historical recordings;
EMI has sold Maria Callas every which way and is reviving its Great
Recordings of the Century line; Deutsche Grammophon's Originals
series was a nostalgic hit as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the masters of ``secondary exploitation,'' as it is called
in the business, are on staff at Philips. Having cobbled together a
complete Mozart edition in 1991, using recordings from all the
Polygram labels, Philips is now issuing a 200-disk series, Great
Pianists of the 20th Century, which surveys the work of 73
pianists, with recordings licensed from all the major labels and
plenty of material not previously available on CD.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger for old recordings is so pronounced that orchestras
have started mining their radio archives to produce and market sets
of their own, with impressive results. On the heels of a pair of
high-profile mail-order sets from the Cleveland Orchestra, the New
York Philharmonic issued its ``Historic Broadcasts,'' a 10-disk
survey of varied repertory, in 1997, and a 12-CD Mahler cycle this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, ``Historic Broadcasts,'' priced at $185, sold 5,000
copies in its first year; at $225, the Mahler box sold 2,500 copies
in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all of this leave living, developing artists?
Instrumentalists seem to be finding support, and period-instrument
bands are flourishing. As for conductors, the ones willing to
shelve their Beethovenian dreams in favor of unusual projects are
having an easier time.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought, a decade ago, that EMI executives would
speak with unbridled enthusiasm about a young English composer who
writes in an alternately accessible and thorny style? Yet the
company lists Thomas Ades' opera, ``Powder Her Face,'' among its
best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Grammophon, which had an enviable new-music series in
the early 1970s but has since maintained a fairly staid image, has
just introduced 20/21, a series named for the changing century,
with disks devoted to Pierre Boulez, Toru Takemitsu, Mauricio
Kagel, Elliott Carter and Arvo Part.
</P>
<P>
   Singers have it made, sort of. The Alagnas, Matthias Goerne, Ian
Bostridge, Cecilia Bartoli, Jennifer Larmore, Ben Heppner, Thomas
Quasthoff, Renee Fleming, Bryn Terfel and Anne Sofie von Otter, new
to the record bins in the last decade, are now bankable stars,
churning out recital disks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet operas, like symphonies, are expensive and therefore less
plentiful. There, too, unusual works _ and works with links to
other media _ have an edge: Deutsche Grammophon released Andre
Previn's ``Streetcar Named Desire'' within months of its premiere,
thanks to the PBS broadcast, which yielded the live recording.
</P>
<P>
   The major labels have long been overdue to explore new
repertory, and if they lag behind independents in that regard,
their marketing and distribution power will help them take over the
areas the independents have pioneered. But the independents are
unequivocally devoted to classical music, something that cannot be
said of most multinational majors now.
</P>
<P>
   Conductors and soloists know they can get a green light for
projects involving popular young composers like Ades, Aaron Jay
Kernis, Richard Danielpour, Tan Dun or John Tavener. But they also
see a contrary trend, which is that if they really want to see
executives' eyes light up, they should propose recordings built
around film scores, nonfilm works by film composers, or hybrids
that draw on folk, pop, tango and world music, perhaps bringing
together stars from each world.
</P>
<P>
   Such projects ``treat the recording as an art form rather than
just a preservation medium,'' in record company parlance. Fair
enough: Glenn Gould approached his recordings that way, as does the
Kronos Quartet. ``We're extending the definition of classical
music'' is another commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Who, at this late date, is against that? Yet the projects
themselves often have the aura of something dreamed up in a
boardroom, with sales projections discussed intently, and questions
of their appropriateness for a classical music label not at all.
</P>
<P>
   It may be unfashionable to say so, but definitions and
boundaries are useful in music. To argue that distinct styles
should inhabit their own realms is not to imply the superiority of
one over another, to preclude honest cross-fertilization or to
suggest that listeners should not experiment. But record labels
have implied charters, and if they regularly abrogate them, neither
the music nor its listeners are well served.
</P>
<P>
   Crossovers, like them or not, have become part of the charter.
But Sony Classical has started down a path that goes well beyond
crossover, and if other labels follow suit, classical labels as we
know them will be fundamentally altered.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bolton giving bad performances of opera arias is
crossover; but Marcus Roberts playing Joplin rags with wide-ranging
improvisatory freedom is jazz. Offering it on a classical label
misleads listeners who don't know Joplin and bypasses jazz fans who
would appreciate its subtleties.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Appalachia Waltz'' is a folk music album, Yo-Yo
Ma's presence notwithstanding, just as Joe Jackson's ``Heaven and
Hell'' is progressive rock, and Eileen Ivers' ``Crossing the
Bridge'' is Celtic folk-rock. Nothing about these disks strikes the
ear as classical, yet because they are on a classical label, that
is how Soundscan registers their sales. The 2.3 percent of the
market accorded to classics, then, may be inflated by ringers.
</P>
<P>
   Sony may be responding to corporate pressure to make every
project profitable, pressures that executives at other labels say
they feel as well. If they all respond as Sony has, the effect may
be devastating in years to come. Classical labels, after all, have
always depended on the depth of their catalogs, and the current
passion for reissues suggests that they always will.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to insure the strength of the back catalog is to
approach new projects not just with a sense of their immediate
sales potential but also with an eye to their future usefulness,
either as perennials or as material that can be recompiled to suit
different needs.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that collectors a few decades from now
will hanker after ``Appalachia Waltz'' the way buyers today seek
out, say, Rubinstein's Chopin. The question is: will future
collectors look back at the turn of the 21st century as a time of
adventurous repertory expansion or a time when record labels
abandoned art music to chase the quick buck?

 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Edgerly's e-mail was hastily composed in Bangkok and
zinged to Boston. But his business partner in the home office had
no trouble interpreting its message: Asia was teeming with
potential clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following two large, important projects in South Korea. Great
opportunities in Thailand. Talk to you when I get back,'' wrote
Edgerly, head of international operations for The Recovery Group,
during a recent two-week trip to Asia to explore opportunities for
consulting to troubled enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Asia would seem to be the last place on earth to scout for new
business. Economies across the region have cratered, and companies
are failing. Commerce in many places is barely moving.
</P>
<P>
   So why would American companies, including many in
Massachusetts, flock to the troubled region? Economic forces
ravaging Asia have created a vast land of business opportunity.
Although there is no stampede, some enterprising companies are
waking up to the unique opportunities for bargain-hunting in Asia's
worst economic slump since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work is in helping Asian companies work out of
financial trouble by reducing debt or restructuring operations. But
companies of all stripes _ financial firms, computer companies,
athletic shoe makers, importers _ are seeking new business or
beefing up operations all over the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   A plunge in the value of most Asian currencies against the
steely US dollar means that office space, top-notch employees, even
entire companies can picked up at depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the contrarian perspective . . . this is the
perfect time to go'' into Asia, said Anne Bailey Berman, president
of Chadwick Martin Bailey, a Boston market research firm with
international clients. Asia's slump offers a chance to ``buy low,
sell high,'' she noted. ``These are big markets. They're having
their financial woes, but it's not as if these markets are going
to'' disappear, she added.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising to find Recovery Group courting potential
clients in Asia _ its specialty is reorganizing companies and banks
in distress. ``Asia is where it's at right now,'' said Stephen
Gray, the managing director and recipient of Edgerly's e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses, acting now, also hope to get in early on a
recovery in some of the world's biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   Most economies in the region slowed dramatically or contracted
in 1998, and many financial systems, including Japan's, are still
crumbling. Experts say full recovery could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``everybody who talks about Asia knows it's going to come
back,'' said Charles McChesney, executive director of The Alliance
for the Commonwealth, which tracks export trends for New England.
``Asians have shown they can grow their economies consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   First to rush in were Wall Street's financial giants beefing up
their presence in preparation for an eventual recovery. Auto makers
followed, including Ford Motor Co., which boosted its stake last
year in Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. With New Balance Athletic Shoes
Inc.'s shoes surging in popularity, the company is increasing
production in China.
</P>
<P>
   With Asia ``at its low ebb, this is the perfect time'' to build
Cambridge Technology Partners' business there, said James Sims,
chief executive of the computer consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, his company had virtually no overseas
operations. It opened a Tokyo office 1 1/2 years ago, just as a
currency crises cascaded through Asia. Cambridge Technology's
services _ sorting out computer hardware systems or designing
Internet systems for corporations _ are most critical for
struggling companies seeking to become more efficient or
competitive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian companies ``are spending huge amounts of money'' on
information technology, Sims said. ``When people go through tough
times they don't randomly cut everything. They say, `Where should I
be investing?' . . . If you're a global company you better make
those investments because you know your competitors in the US and
in Europe are making those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   New York financial companies are snapping up Asian businesses, a
trend that is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial houses are doing business, because they're
involved in doing deals or they're buying up other financial firms
at a good price,'' said Lawrence Horwitz, managing director for
Boston-based Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm that
opened an office in Tokyo this year.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital Corp.'s agreement last month to acquire Japan Leasing
Corp. from the country's most troubled bank, Long Term Credit Bank,
is the latest in an Asian shopping spree by the Connecticut
company. Travelers Group, after announcing a merger with Citibank
to form Citigroup, acquired a stake last June in Nikko Securities
Co., one of Japan's biggest brokerage houses. Baltimore-based T.
Rowe Price Associates Inc. in January established a beachhead in
Japan to sell mutual funds there.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity appears to exist for investment banks and workout
specialists who can help companies get back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   At New York-based Salomon Smith Barney, Robert Morse, chief
executive of Asia-Pacific operations, said its Asia commitment was
increased at a time troubled companies there need his company's
services to sell unprofitable operations, raise cash, or reduce
debt through the sales of securities.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon, a unit of Citigroup, has bulked up by adding 400
employees to its Asia-Pacific operations through its acquisition of
CountyNatwest, Australia's biggest brokerage firm, and by hiring
another 100 employees in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and
elsewhere. Salomon's total Asia-Pacific work force is now 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian markets still are small relative to European and US
markets. There's a lot of opportunity,'' Morse said.
</P>
<P>
   The US accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a
high-profile piece of business, is presiding over liquidation of
the once high-flying Hong Kong investment bank, Peregrine
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Marti Kopacz, a partner and head of the firm's workout practice
in New England, said some 20 partners are doing recovery work in
Asia _ up from seven in 1997. And there's need for a dozen more,
she said. ``The work is so voluminous you can't cover it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia may be a mother lode for workout firms _ but the business
is not easily won. Cultural issues present barriers to doing
business.
</P>
<P>
   Economic crises pose issues that are similar to those faced by
US savings and loans in the 1980s. But many Asian cultures are wary
of US-style restructurings in a part of the world where liquidation
is the traditional remedy for failure. South Korea, Thailand and
Malaysia seem to be the first to embrace Western expertise,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Recovery Group entered Asia gingerly, first dipping
its toe into Thailand while participating in a World Bank-sponsored
program to educate business people there about methods of
restructuring. Recovery Group hopes to win contracts with Thai
banks or companies needing help to work out nonperforming loans,
which could total nearly half of the country's total outstanding
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery Group's Gray believes that Asia's potential may be
greater than that of Eastern Europe, where his firm helped
state-owned operations convert to private concerns. But, partner
Edgerly said, ``You can't march a bunch of foreigners in who don't
know anything about the country and expect everyone to sign up. It
doesn't work like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston bankruptcy attorney George Kelakos hopes family ties will
help if his Boston law firm sets up shop in Bangkok. His
Thai-American wife, Anchalee Kelakos, was born in Bangkok and knows
the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'll be able to overcome those trust issues,'' he said.
When talking to Thai officials, he is careful to make clear he
would ``assist them as team players.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelakos is among a group of bankruptcy judges and attorneys who
have traveled to Bangkok to help the Thai government set up a
US-style bankruptcy system, which was created by legislation last
year. He and his wife escorted Thai officials who met World Bank
and US government officials in Washington. As a result of these
contacts, Kelakos is consulting to Thai law firms. .
</P>
<P>
   Plunging Asian currencies and stock markets have hammered US
investors. Nearly two years after the financial disaster began,
savvy Wall Street investors now view Asia as a rare opportunity to
bargain hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Acadian Asset Management, an affiliate of Boston-based United
Asset Management, recently teamed with a Singapore merchant bank,
Pegasus Capital Ltd. The goal: to invest equity ``in good companies
in Southeast Asia that have bad balance sheets,'' said Churchill G.
Franklin, Acadian's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Bozaan, president of Waterford Partners, which invests in
stock markets in emerging countries after they have declined,
raised $12 million from clients over the past year. He was able
hire an analyst in Singapore, who had worked at Jardine Fleming
Securities, to help manage the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are so many bargains in Asia, Bozaan said _ his
New York firm could easily invest $100 million there _ investors
are hard-won. ``So many people lost so much money,'' investors are
``very, very cautious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia bargain-hunting effect works in novel ways, too,
spawning Paul Counihan Jr.'s import-export business.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Concord, Counihan has spent a decade moving from Guam
to Thailand to Indonesia as a manager of nightclubs and
restaurants. When riots broke out in the streets of Jakarta last
year, he moved from the Indonesian city to the island of Bali to
open a restaurant. That's where he spotted Balinese hand-crafted
teak furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Because Indonesia's rupiah had plunged against the dollar, the
furniture could be exported cheaply to the United States. Counihan
figured it would be ideal for outdoor use in New England, because
``it weathers into a beautiful silvery gray.''
</P>
<P>
   His siblings and parents are partners in his venture. The family
now waits for a ship carrying two 40-foot containers of furniture,
which they plan to sell at a store they are opening in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a strong dollar, Counihan said he thinks he can
``really undercut the market here.''

ROOTING FOR SALSIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You're a sophisticated diner. You negotiate French or
Italian menus with aplomb. Well-versed in hens-of-the-woods,
pomegranate molasses, and star anise, you're confident you can
shine before your dinner companions, instructing them in the
exotica of today's restaurant pantries. There's nothing you can't
expound on, you think, as you flip open the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Except, you realize in a moment of sheer panic, salsify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petite lion's head bowl of steaming salsify soup served with
crisped oysters, hot horseradish, and osetra caviar,'' reads Biba's
menu.
</P>
<P>
   The first question comes quickly. ``This looks interesting.
What's salsify, dear? You know so much about gourmet cuisine,'' the
spouse says, smiling fondly.
</P>
<P>
   You blush and turn helplessly to the server for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Menus at Boston's high-flying restaurants can do that to you
these days. Some ingredients are so unusual the diner needs a
dictionary. Salsify, cavolo nero, crone de Japonaise, patofa,
sunchokes, wild dried mulberries, parsley root _ what will they
think of next?
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, there's really nothing new under the sun.
Salsify, or the black-skinned scorzonera, which is more widely used
in restaurants than the white salsify, or oyster plant, is a root
vegetable hailing from 16th-century kitchen gardens in Europe.
Colonial America was wild about salsify, and Thomas Jefferson was
known to grow several varieties of it. As Elizabeth Schneider,
whose ``Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables'' (William Morrow) is the
bible in such matters, says, such vegetables ``grow out of fashion
rather than into it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice, dowdy root vegetable,'' Schneider adds, voicing
regret that an ingredient long-used by European cooks should be so
little known here.
</P>
<P>
   But chefs are always looking for something new, something
different to capture the short attention spans of the dining
public. Jim Wilker of Specialty Foods Boston, which supplies 75
restaurants with unusual products, says he often gets calls from
chefs searching for out-of-the-ordinary ingredients. In his
warehouse, he shows off big, meaty king oyster mushrooms from the
West Coast; bleeding heart radishes that look a little like turnips
until he cuts one open to reveal a ravishing crimson and white
interior; bumpy sunchokes or Jerusalem artichokes; and inky-green
wrinkled leaves of the cabbage cavolo nero. The black salsify,
grown in Belgium, looks like a slender black carrot with a whiskery
top. Because it's uniform in size and thickness, it's preferred
over the unruly-looking white salsify, which was probably more
commonly grown in earlier America.
</P>
<P>
   Although some people think it tastes of oyster, to me it has an
artichoke-like flavor with a hint of something stronger, such as
turnip. Schneider also likens it to a soft-cooked artichoke heart
with a hint of coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Felino Samson, chef de cuisine at Galleria Italiana, grills
salsify and serves it with a frittata crespelle, a sort of crepe
made with eggs and radicchio, topped with shaved black winter
truffles. ``Salsify is a great vegetable,'' Samson says. ``I like
it because of its sweetness and earthiness, and it works well with
truffles.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson adds he likes to give unusual vegetables a star turn in
antipasti. ``A lot of foodies are really intrigued.''
</P>
<P>
   At L'Espalier, chef-owner Frank McClelland offers roasted wild
striped bass with a red rice crust accompanied by a salsify,
fingerling potato, and leek salad. The dish is accented with sea
urchin roe. McClelland believes the neutral flavor of salsify takes
on characteristics of strong elements in the dish, moving ``one
flavor into another gracefully.'' So the salsify enhances the sea
urchin roe and leek qualities while adding its soft texture to the
mix. The fish, topped with tiny greens and haricots verts, rests in
a lobster and truffle broth.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual ingredients ``spark interest,'' McClelland says. ``Let's
face it, the public is eager to learn and to try new things. It's
not the foundation of my cuisine,'' he says, but he admits that he
likes to offer diners tastes and textures they haven't often
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Other unusual items get supporting roles on the plate. Jim
Becker of Rauxa in Somerville uses patofa, or taro root, in a puree
with his grilled pork chop with pomegranate sauce. McClelland uses
cavolo nero with a beet risotto. The Blue Room in Cambridge serves
it sauteed with cipollina onions, garlic, and olive oil alongside a
grilled skirt steak, polenta, and gorgonzola cheese. George Lopes,
sous-chef, says the ``big, meaty leaves like to be paired up with
meat.'' At Casablanca in Harvard Square, chef Ana Sortun treats
cavolo nero as a main ingredient along with semolina berries and
porcini mushrooms in ribollita, the thick vegetable soup that's
reboiled.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how unfamiliar restaurant ingredients seem to the
general public, it's amazing how quickly chefs' whims can make
their way into the eating vernacular. How many of us knew about
mesclun 10 or even five years ago? So, as author Schneider laments
our ignorance about a common European vegetable, Rene Shepard of
Rene's Garden Seeds of California sees a ``real connection''
between what diners eat in restaurants and then ask for in grocery
stores and, if they're gardeners, eventually want to grow for
themselves. ``If chefs are cooking with it, people eat it and then
want to know more.'' Eventually that spark may reach our kitchen
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   And we may be planting salsify again, just like Thomas
Jefferson.

PUSHING THE ENVELOPE TO THE BRINK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUGLAS MACKINNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans, Democrats, the news media, and most
Americans can only sit back and scratch their heads in wonder. Bill
Clinton becomes only the second president in U.S. history to be
impeached by the House and tried in the Senate, and his poll
numbers go higher.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, pundits and politicians have labored to
explain the discrepancy between President Clinton's high approval
ratings and what House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has
called his ``reprehensible'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   My answer as to why the American people keep giving the
president a much higher grade than he deserves is this: They have
been systematically and successfully conditioned by many in
Hollywood and the entertainment community to lower their moral
standards and reevaluate what is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If we were to take an honest look at television and movies over
the past two decades, we could clearly see that they have pushed
the ``what is acceptable'' envelope farther and farther each year.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, 90 percent of the American people may have
found a particular show or scene offensive, but five years later,
after seeing the same behavior _ violence, sex, nudity or lack of
respect for authority _ thousands of times, maybe only half that
number would find it offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the same envelope of ``what is
acceptable'' was pushed even farther and even more Americans
started to question their judgment and values. People may say to
themselves, ``Gee, that show really seems out of bounds to me, but
I guess I must be becoming a prude or something. Everybody seems to
be showing that stuff now.''
</P>
<P>
   Has this been a deliberate attempt by Hollywood and the
entertainment community to subvert morality and decency? Of course
not. But it should be noted that the majority of those in control
of the creative process in Hollywood would describe themselves as
very liberal, both in their politics and in their behavior. It's
natural that their personal beliefs and biases would infiltrate the
programs they write and produce.
</P>
<P>
   While one would hope that those in the entertainment community
would recognize the tremendous responsibility they have to the
nation, I'm afraid that is not going to happen anytime soon. Many
of the Hollywood power-brokers who donated the maximum $10,000 to
Clinton's legal defense fund have gone on record as saying that
even with (or because of) the impeachment, they support him and
think the Monica Lewinsky episode is just a plot created by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to derail their ideological
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope has now burst.

   ARSON _ INDIANAPOLIS _ The curiosity of a campus police officer
has led to the arrest of a man authorities say has confessed to
burning as many as 50 churches in 11 states. The Justice Department
announced that Jay Ballinger, 36, has been arrested and charged
with setting fire to seven churches in Indiana dating to 1994. He
was arrested earlier this month after being questioned at a
hospital where he was being treated for burns. Federal authorities
also said they were looking into whether Ballinger and two
co-defendants have any connection with the burnings of
predominantly black churches in the South. Officials said Ballinger
confessed to setting up to 50 church fires between 1994 and 1998 in
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio and
Alabama. Authorities refused to identify the four other states.
Also charged are Angela Wood, 24, of Athens, Ga., identified in
court documents as Ballinger's girlfriend, and Donald Puckett, 37,
of Lebanon, Ind. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TYPHOID-OUTBREAK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Frozen mamey products
from countries such as Guatemala have been pulled from the

mamey from these nations was never allowed in the United States
because of sanitary conditions in the countries of origin, and with
health officials conceding salmonella typhi can survive prolonged
periods of freezing, one wonders why frozen mamey was ever allowed
into the country. The FDA is putting thought into the question now.
Investigators are focusing on processing points in Guatemala, the
source of more than one frozen brand name. Meanwhile, tests on
confiscated samples conducted by Department of Agriculture have
been inconclusive, failing to isolate any `salmonella typhi.

   AIRFORCE-CUTS _ The Air Force's effort to squeeze more space

congressional sources say. The Air Force Research Laboratory is
preparing to announce job cuts nationwide, possibly by the end of
the month, as it struggles to downsize to a smaller budget by Oct.
1. Lawmakers are irate because the cuts reflect abrupt changes as
the Air Force has killed or severely cut back some programs to
funnel an extra $100 million into space-based radar and laser
programs. ``The abruptness of it all will result in an enormous
waste of science and human capital,'' said Michael Gessel, an aide
to U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News).

   RACE _ LONDON _ The 600-page report on the 1993 murder of a
17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the
spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of
Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution
in race relations. The report makes damning criticisms of the
metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first
time in Britain, institutional racism. It calls for widespread
reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed
problem in modern British society. The investigation was so marred
from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably
never be punished. (Roughton 600).

   CRAFT-DESIGN (Undated) _ There are 13 million people in the
United States making crafts to sell, and over a billion dollars
being spent in the process. This could be construed as very bad
news. But it's not. Much of the most recent craft production is
more beautiful and more technically sophisticated than it has been
for 30 years _ since the heyday of American craft artists like
George Nakashima and Gertrude and Otto Natzler, the glittering era
of modern Italian art glass or the British studio pottery tradition
of and Lucie Rie. By William L. Hamilton.

   NY-HAMPTONS-BARGAINS (New York) _ No one brags about them.
They're not featured in the color brochures. Queries are met with
an all-too-obvious effort to change the subject. ``They're really
not our niche,'' said Frank Newbold, the manager of the East
Hampton, N.Y., office of Sotheby's International Realty. ``I'd like
to help you, but it's not our thing.'' But bargain houses, it turns
out, form the backbone of much of the real estate business in the
Hamptons, even in these days of mega-houses and
multi-million-dollar sales. By Tracie Rozhon.

   MAILBOX (Ridgefield, Conn.) _ Monica Brunen, and her husband,
Cal, live in a giant, federal-style house they built themselves
after months spent photograping and measuring the period details in
Connecticut's finest 18th-century mansions. Their house could grace
the pages of Traditional Home magazine. But what's that green,
bulbous thing sprouting like a mushroom at the end of the driveway?

   NC-DAY-MUSEUM (Milton, N.C.) _ Nearly 10 years after a brush
fire reduced the historic Union Tavern to a roofless shell, a
determined committee is slowly raising money to repair it and
convert it into a museum devoted to Thomas Day, a black
cabinetmaker who worked here before the Civil War. Born free in
Virginia in 1801, Day walked a precarious line all his life.
Despite laws limiting the rights of free blacks, he established a
successful business in North Carolina, owned stock in a local bank,
trained white apprentices (and owned black slaves, himself), and
numbered among his customers North Carolina's most prominent
citizens, including the Governor, David S. Reid. By Liz Seymour.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    __ Free to anyone on the Internet, the Linus operating system,
created by a journalist's son, has mutated in recent months from a
geek fetish to a challenger to Microsoft Windows. ___
 &HT;    ...........................
 &HT;    One recent rainy afternoon at the home of Marcus Meissner in
Erlangen, Germany, Meissner's computer froze. It was the sort of
routine headache that most of us who rely on the alien machines
endure on an almost daily basis.
 &HT;    But Meissner, 25, didn't simply reboot. Although by day a
caretaker of elderly patients at a state-run nursing home, by night
he is a foot soldier in the liberation army of Linux, an
increasingly popular operating system that is available free on the
Internet.
 &HT;    Meissner is part of a global confederation of volunteers who are
intent on ushering in a kind of parallel silicon universe in which
computers don't crash, programmers readily share intellectual
property and, incidentally, the Microsoft Corporation has no reason
to exist, because Linux already belongs to everyone.
 &HT;    Meissner sent out an E-mail. Moments later in Budapest, a
26-year-old called Mingo - it is the habit of the wizards who tend
to Linux to refer to one another by only their E-mail avatars -
posted a fix. Gabriel, a radio astronomer in southern Spain,
countered the next day with a different version.
 &HT;    Then Petkan, a system administrator at a Bulgarian newspaper,
weighed in with a new approach. The point was not simply to mend
the program, but also to find the most elegant way of doing so. Of
course everyone knew that Torvalds, the California-based spider at
the center of this self-spinning web, would have the final say.
 &HT;    Torvalds is Linus Torvalds, the Finnish programmer who eight
years ago, as a 21-year-old student at the University of Helsinki,
created Linux's skeletal code and released it free on the Internet.
 &HT;    Since then, he has become something of a cult figure, regularly
outranking celebrity executives such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
in Internet personality polls. Troll the Web and you can catch an
audio clip of his uttering the correct pronunciation of Linux
(LINN-ucks) and see what he wore to last year's Finnish president's
Independence Day ball.
 &HT;    Named for both the physicist Linus Pauling and the Peanuts
character, Torvalds grew up in Helsinki in a family of journalists.
His motivation for starting Linux had as much to do with pragmatism
as with intellectual exploration. As an undergraduate, he couldn't
afford the several thousand dollars it would have cost to buy a
commercial version of Unix _ the operating system popular in the
academic and corporate worlds _ so he decided to write his own.
 &HT;    Now, when programmers, hobbyists and other Linux devotees ask
him, as they do several dozen times a week, what part of the
program they should work on, he tells them to come back when they
know.
 &HT;    Torvalds' moral and technical authority over Linux's evolution
derives from the countless hours he has spent juggling ideas and
requests submitted by the program's ever-growing network of
acolytes. But it is part of the power of Linux that when its prime
mover opted for a clumsy solution to Meissner's problem _ as even a
cult hero occasionally does _ his lieutenants did not shrink from
correcting him. To liberate the world from bad bugs, crashes and
bloated software, the rebel programmers of Linux strictly adhere to
a meritocratic mantra: ``The best code always wins.''
 &HT;    It is hard to believe that the future of software lies in a
haphazard process of far-flung programmers E-mailing each other in
the middle of the night, but it just might. Beloved by techies for
its remarkable ability to run for months without crashing and for
its compatibility with other programs, Linux has mutated in recent
months from geek fetish to a dark-horse challenger to Microsoft
Windows, the ubiquitous operating system that has defined computing
for a decade.
 &HT;    A formidable array of Microsoft's competitors, including IBM,
Intel and Oracle are lining up to back the orphan program. New
companies such as Red Hat Software in Durham, N.C., are aiming to
make money by providing technical support for the software they can
never own. In a bow to Linux's growing stature, Netscape and Intel
invested last fall in Red Hat. Even Microsoft has made a show of
trembling before Linux's rebel forces.
 &HT;    In an internal memo that somehow found its way onto the
Internet, a Microsoft engineer outlined the circumstances in which
``Linux can win'' and proposed strategies for defeating the
advantages of its new competitor. Microsoft has also cited its fear
of Linux in its antitrust battle with the Justice Department.
 &HT;    Still, some perspective is in order. Linux, which runs on only
about 7 million computers worldwide, has a long, long way to go
before it makes a dent in Microsoft's 250-million-plus empire. And
despite its growing popularity, Linux is still too complicated for
the average nonideologically motivated computer user.
 &HT;    But its significance is not solely as a product, but also as an
idea _ the embodiment of what amounts to a widely held political
belief among notoriously apolitical programmers that software
should be better.
 &HT;    ``People have grown used to thinking of computers as unreliable,
and it doesn't have to be that way,'' Torvalds told me one night as
we sat in his office at his Santa Clara, Calif., home. ``I don't
mind Microsoft making money. I mind them having a bad operating
system.''
 &HT;    Torvalds lives in a modest tract house, where he moved with his
wife, Tove, the six-time karate champion of Finland, two years ago
to take a job at a secretive start-up partly owned by Paul Allen,
one of the founders of Microsoft. The house is filled with stuffed
penguins, his favorite animal _ and not incidentally, the Linux
mascot _ for reasons he can't quite explain, except that they seem
``friendly.'' When he travels he makes every effort to visit the
local zoo. His favorite is in Singapore, because it has the most
exotic animals and the fewest cages per capita.
 &HT;    Each night, after tucking in his fair-haired daughters,
Patricia, 2, and Daniela, 10 months, Torvalds retreats to the
orange light of his computer to log several hours working on Linux.
 &HT;    Linux's most lasting legacy may be its role in legitimizing a
radical model of software development that has come to be known as
``open source,'' in which the ``source code'' _ the usually
secreted DNA of a computer program _ is freely released on the
Internet for anyone to see, modify or redistribute. The idea is
akin to the notion of Coca-Cola publishing its formula for Coke.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it doesn't sit well with corporate executives,
who often spend tens of millions of dollars on programmers'
salaries alone. ``Why should software be free?'' asks Edward J.
Zander, chief operating officer of Sun Microsystems. ``Why should I
give away what I pay millions of dollars to develop? Why doesn't
General Motors give its cars away for free? Why don't you give me
your newspaper for free?''
 &HT;    But by harnessing the collective wisdom of developers worldwide,
Linux partisans argue, a rigorous, informal peer review naturally
emerges in which the best innovations are ratified and adopted,
resulting in a better product.
 &HT;    ``I can't imagine having a problem and having to spend four
hours figuring it out instead of turning to the most knowledgeable
person on the Net who would know instantly how to solve it,'' says
Marc Ewing, 29, who started Red Hat in 1993. ``It would be a
terrible waste of time.''
 &HT;    And the rapid growth of the Internet, which after all was
created through the open-source process, has made the approach ever
more feasible by broadening the universe of potential contributors
and allowing for nearly instant distribution of fine-tuned fixes.
 &HT;    ``When I released Linux,'' Torvalds told me as we sat scanning
hundreds of E-mail messages he received that day, ``I thought maybe
one other person would be interested in it.'' Among the faithful,
the story of Torvalds conjuring an operating system out of a blank
screen has already taken on the ring of legend.
 &HT;    But the legend wants to correct the notion that he solely wrote
the software.
 &HT;    ``The kernel'' _ Linux's most vital code _ ``is 1 percent of the
entire program,'' he says. ``Of that 1 percent, I've written
between 5 and 10 percent. I think the most important part is that I
got it started. Then people had something to concentrate on.''
Indeed, Torvalds places the number of volunteers who regularly
contribute to the ``kernel'' at about 1,000, and thousands more
have sent in pieces of code over the years.
 &HT;    ``I didn't ask for this army of people to come to me,'' he says.
``They come because this is what they want to do.'' Of the six
young men in four countries who played in the E-mail round robin of
fix-the-bug, for instance, only Mingo is paid to work on Linux, and
even his contribution was not directly a part of his job.
 &HT;    Torvalds readily concedes that Linux also owes much to the
groundbreaking work of Richard Stallman, a legendary hacker at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who in 1984 founded the Free
Software Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes the use
of free software. Living out of his office at MIT, Stallman devoted
himself to developing a free operating system. His thousands of
lines of code make up many of the software tools and utilities that
are a part of Linux.
 &HT;    Still, there's no denying Torvalds' centrality to the Linux
revolution. According to Eric Raymond, an evangelist of the
open-source movement, programs such as Linux are usually organized
around one central wizard to whom the others pay fealty. The
perverse cross between anarchy and a cult of personality, Raymond
explains, comes from a natural tendency toward efficiency. The
leader maintains his place only with the consent of his peers.
 &HT;    In a self-published essay, ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar,''
which has become a manifesto for Linux devotees, Raymond sees the
cathedral as the traditional mode of software development, and the
bazaar as the preferable, open mode. Elite programmers prefer the
bazaar, he says, because it allows them to operate in a ``gift
culture'' in which prestige is the currency and the rich developer
is the one with the best reputation.
 &HT;    ``Open-source software,'' or OSS, is really just a moniker
invented by a few marketing-savvy programmers, who decided last
year that they needed a term with public relations gloss for their
preferred mode of developing software. But the concept dates back
to the days before the rise of the personal computer, when hackers
and hobbyists pushed the technology envelope; at the time, they
were more engaged in the pursuit of knowledge than in corporate
profits.
 &HT;    Predictably, computer-industry lore credits Microsoft's
chairman, Bill Gates, with heralding the end of that era with his
``Open Letter to Hobbyists,'' first published in 1976. ``Most of
you steal your software,'' Gates wrote, piqued at how the early
computer tinkerers passed around copies of any software they came
across, including Microsoft's first program, the Basic computer
language for the Altair 8800. ``One thing you do ... is prevent
good software from being written. Who can afford to do professional
work for nothing?''
 &HT;    With the advent of the personal computer, a new mass market for
software arose, and with it, an industry renowned for its
entrepreneurs and their ability to create wealth. Previously,
computer innovations had largely arisen on university campuses,
where the free exchange of ideas often reigned.
 &HT;    But big business, dependent on innovations for its profits,
began closely guarding its intellectual property, as software
companies began making money by selling upgrades to programs that
consumers had already purchased. There was nothing in it for a
company offering fixes for free.
 &HT;    With the Free Software Foundation, Stallman tried to recapture
an earlier atmosphere by developing a free operating system he
called GNU. He released it under a new software license known as
``copyleft,'' which allowed it to be endlessly copied or modified.
One of Torvalds' first decisions working on Linux was to release
the source code under Stallman's general public license. ``I wanted
people to be able to trust me without trusting me personally,''
Torvalds says. ''So even if I turn to the dark side, nobody can
take it over.''
 &HT;    Stallman thinks that some of Linux's proponents have already
sold out and insists that the system's proper name is GNU-Linux. To
him, the point of free software isn't that it fosters superior
technology, but that it's free and urges the use of inferior free
software over anything proprietary.
 &HT;    ``The free-software movement is concerned primarily with
strengthening civil society,'' he says. ``Think free as in free
speech, not free beer.'' It seems that many have. It is hard to
discount Linux contributors' claims that they do what they do for
the love of it, given how much free time they devote to perfecting
the program.
 &HT;    Theodore Y. Ts'o, a researcher at MIT, speaks of Linux in
spiritual terms. ``There's a quote from the New Testament,'' he
says. ```By your works you will know them.' That's what it's like.
You take care of your code, and when people report bugs you fix it.
You are thereby known as a provider of good software.'' Donald
Becker, who builds Linux machines for NASA, says, ``We think we're
changing the world.''
 &HT;    Other, more traditional software companies are jumping on the
bandwagon. In December, Sun agreed to make its popular Java source
code available to developers who pay a license fee. The company is
retaining PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit, as Torvalds has for
Linux, the process of determining which new functions can be added
to the language.
 &HT;    Last winter, in a move much celebrated by open-source
proponents, Netscape released the source code to its Navigator Web
browser. Although the software was already free to customers, the
company is gambling that opening its code to developers will give
it an edge over Microsoft's competing browser, Explorer, which
comes free with Windows. And America Online, which plans to acquire
Netscape, has pledged to support its open-source initiatives.
 &HT;    Even Microsoft, in its memo assessing open-source software,
concedes that ``Linux and other O.S.S. advocates are making a
progressively more credible argument that O.S.S. software is at
least as robust _ if not more _ than commercial alternatives ...
The ability of the O.S.S. process to collect and harness the
collective I.Q. of thousands of individuals across the Internet is
simply amazing.''
 &HT;    In November, Microsoft was holding a party to celebrate the
opening of its new software-development center in Palo Alto, Calif.
 &HT;    In a true geek protest, about 50 Linux stalwarts gathered to
hand out Linux CD's to Microsoft's guests as they entered. Wearing
penguin T-shirts bearing the slogan ``Where Do You Want to Go
Tomorrow?'' and carrying ``Star Wars''-inspired signs that read,
``Use the Source, Luke,'' the group gathered at a coffee shop and
was about to head over to the party when two guys arrived from
Microsoft.
 &HT;    Apparently they had been monitoring the group's Web site. ``What
you guys are doing is touching a lot of people's hearts,'' one of
them told the group. ``We'd love to sit down and talk.'' The offers
of pizza and beer were politely declined, at least until after the
event. But it was something of a crowning moment.
 &HT;    ``Did you get that down?'' one of the protesters wanted to know.
``Microsoft wants to buy us a beer.''

NEW TAX CREDITS AND MORE COMPLEXITY AWAIT TAX PROCRASTINATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many Americans, those dreaded tax forms are
probably still sitting around waiting to be tackled. But thanks to
several tax changes that took effect in the 1998 tax year, you may
want to file sooner than April 15 because you might get a refund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, refunds through Feb.
19 were averaging $1,784, or 15 percent above last year's levels.
The jump is mostly because of new child and education tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Tax preparers say the new credits are making tax returns of low-
and moderate-income taxpayers more complicated. Each credit has
different qualifying incomes. Determining what the IRS calls
modified adjusted gross income for each credit requires different
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really where a lot of this complexity comes into
place,'' said Martin Nissenbaum, director of personal income tax
planning at the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young. He said the
income tax forms of low- and moderate-income people are becoming as
complicated as those of high-income taxpayers who typically itemize
more deductions.
</P>
<P>
   He and other tax preparers recommend starting your taxes earlier
than usual and they recommend using a computer software package
like TurboTax or getting help from a professional preparer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't realize you need (help) until you start filling out
your forms,'' Nissenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Yeager, manager of tax research at H &AMP; R Block, a
nationwide tax preparation firm, said clients are often confused
about many of the education tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The new child and education tax credits can be taken whether or
not you itemize your deductions. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _Children: a $400 per child tax credit. The credit is reduced
for single people with incomes above $75,000 and married people
filing jointly with incomes above $110,000. The credit rises to
$500 per child beginning in the 1999 tax year.
</P>
<P>
   _HOPE Credit: allows students or parents of students to deduct
up to $1,500 per student for tuition and fees incurred in a
post-secondary or vocational education program. This tax credit
applies only for the first two years of post-secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   _Lifetime Learning Credit: provides a credit for students or
parents of students of up to $1,000 per year for undergraduate,
graduate and professional courses. The credit equals 20 percent of
tuition or fees with a cap of $1,000 per year per family. (To
receive the full credit, tuition and fees would have to total at
least $5,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The credit applies to tuition and fees incurred after June 30,
1998. The HOPE and the Lifetime Learning Credit cannot be used in
the same year for the same student. Both credits are phased out for
single people with incomes between $40,000-$50,000 and married
people filing jointly between $80,000-$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Interest on student loans: up to $1,000 of interest on some
student loans can be deducted. Loans have to be within the first
five years of repayment to qualify. For example, a person who began
repaying a student loan in 1992 or before would be ineligible for
the deduction. President Clinton has proposed eliminating the
five-year limit. The amount of interest that can be deducted will
rise to $2,500 in 2001. The deduction is phased out for single
taxpayers with incomes between $40,000-$55,000 and married people
filing jointly with incomes of $60,000-$75,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Individual Retirement Arrangements: More people may qualify to
take an IRA deduction this year up to a $2,000. A person's IRA
deduction is no longer limited by whether his or her spouse is
covered by an employer's retirement plan such as a 401(k). This
will allow a non-working spouse or a spouse who works part time to
place as much as $2,000 a year in an IRA and deduct it.
</P>
<P>
   _Roth IRAs: People can put aside up to $2,000 a year in
after-tax money for such an account. The money is not taxed upon
withdrawal in most circumstances. Individuals with incomes more
than $110,000 and married people filing jointly with incomes
greater than $160,000 are barred from opening Roth IRAs. Both types
of IRAs can be opened up until April 15 and qualify as being opened
in the 1998 tax year.
</P>
<P>
   Money can be withdrawn from both the traditional IRA and the
Roth IRA to pay for higher education and first-time homebuyers can
withdraw up to $10,000 to put toward a home purchase without being
subjected to the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. The amount of
the withdrawal from the traditional IRA, however, is added to your
income in the year it's withdrawn and taxed accordingly. Roth
withdrawals are not taxed because such accounts are such up with
after-tax money, unlike a traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If you owe money to the IRS, you can charge it on Mastercard,
Discover or American Express _ for a fee totaling between 1.5 and
2.5 percent of the amount owed. The IRS is prohibited from
absorbing that fee which is typically charged to merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Visa isn't participating because of a policy that prohibits
surcharging consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't pay your tax bill, Nissenbaum recommends filing for
an extension with the IRS rather than charging it. The IRS charges
about 7 percent in interest for filing past April 15 while many
credit cards charge as much as 19 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   If you write a check, make it out to the United States Treasury
rather than the IRS. The change was mandated as part of 1998
legislation aimed at overhauling the IRS. But if you happen to
write ``IRS or Internal Revenue Service'' on your check, it won't
be sent back to you. The IRS, which is a unit of the Treasury
Department, will still cash it almost immediately.

NEW TAX CREDITS AND MORE COMPLEXITY AWAIT TAX PROCRASTINATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many Americans, those dreaded tax forms are
probably still sitting around waiting to be tackled. But thanks to
several tax changes that took effect in the 1998 tax year, you may
want to file sooner than April 15 because you might get a refund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, refunds through Feb.
19 were averaging $1,784, or 15 percent above last year's levels.
The jump is mostly because of new child and education tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Tax preparers say the new credits are making tax returns of low-
and moderate-income taxpayers more complicated. Each credit has
different qualifying incomes. Determining what the IRS calls
modified adjusted gross income for each credit requires different
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really where a lot of this complexity comes into
place,'' said Martin Nissenbaum, director of personal income tax
planning at the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young. He said the
income tax forms of low- and moderate-income people are becoming as
complicated as those of high-income taxpayers who typically itemize
more deductions.
</P>
<P>
   He and other tax preparers recommend starting your taxes earlier
than usual and they recommend using a computer software package
like TurboTax or getting help from a professional preparer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't realize you need (help) until you start filling out
your forms,'' Nissenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Yeager, manager of tax research at H &AMP; R Block, a
nationwide tax preparation firm, said clients are often confused
about many of the education tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The new child and education tax credits can be taken whether or
not you itemize your deductions. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _Children: a $400 per child tax credit. The credit is reduced
for single people with incomes above $75,000 and married people
filing jointly with incomes above $110,000. The credit rises to
$500 per child beginning in the 1999 tax year.
</P>
<P>
   _HOPE Credit: allows students or parents of students to deduct
up to $1,500 per student for tuition and fees incurred in a
post-secondary or vocational education program. This tax credit
applies only for the first two years of post-secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   _Lifetime Learning Credit: provides a credit for students or
parents of students of up to $1,000 per year for undergraduate,
graduate and professional courses. The credit equals 20 percent of
tuition or fees with a cap of $1,000 per year per family. (To
receive the full credit, tuition and fees would have to total at
least $5,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The credit applies to tuition and fees incurred after June 30,
1998. The HOPE and the Lifetime Learning Credit cannot be used in
the same year for the same student. Both credits are phased out for
single people with incomes between $40,000-$50,000 and married
people filing jointly between $80,000-$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Interest on student loans: up to $1,000 of interest on some
student loans can be deducted. Loans have to be within the first
five years of repayment to qualify. For example, a person who began
repaying a student loan in 1992 or before would be ineligible for
the deduction. President Clinton has proposed eliminating the
five-year limit. The amount of interest that can be deducted will
rise to $2,500 in 2001. The deduction is phased out for single
taxpayers with incomes between $40,000-$55,000 and married people
filing jointly with incomes of $60,000-$75,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Individual Retirement Arrangements: More people may qualify to
take an IRA deduction this year up to a $2,000. A person's IRA
deduction is no longer limited by whether his or her spouse is
covered by an employer's retirement plan such as a 401(k). This
will allow a non-working spouse or a spouse who works part time to
place as much as $2,000 a year in an IRA and deduct it.
</P>
<P>
   _Roth IRAs: People can put aside up to $2,000 a year in
after-tax money for such an account. The money is not taxed upon
withdrawal in most circumstances. Individuals with incomes more
than $110,000 and married people filing jointly with incomes
greater than $160,000 are barred from opening Roth IRAs. Both types
of IRAs can be opened up until April 15 and qualify as being opened
in the 1998 tax year.
</P>
<P>
   Money can be withdrawn from both the traditional IRA and the
Roth IRA to pay for higher education and first-time homebuyers can
withdraw up to $10,000 to put toward a home purchase without being
subjected to the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. The amount of
the withdrawal from the traditional IRA, however, is added to your
income in the year it's withdrawn and taxed accordingly. Roth
withdrawals are not taxed because such accounts are such up with
after-tax money, unlike a traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If you owe money to the IRS, you can charge it on Mastercard,
Discover or American Express _ for a fee totaling between 1.5 and
2.5 percent of the amount owed. The IRS is prohibited from
absorbing that fee which is typically charged to merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Visa isn't participating because of a policy that prohibits
surcharging consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't pay your tax bill, Nissenbaum recommends filing for
an extension with the IRS rather than charging it. The IRS charges
about 7 percent in interest for filing past April 15 while many
credit cards charge as much as 19 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   If you write a check, make it out to the United States Treasury
rather than the IRS. The change was mandated as part of 1998
legislation aimed at overhauling the IRS. But if you happen to
write ``IRS or Internal Revenue Service'' on your check, it won't
be sent back to you. The IRS, which is a unit of the Treasury
Department, will still cash it almost immediately.

COBURN `FEELS GOOD' ABOUT WORK ON `AFFLICTION' AND `PAYBACK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody in the movies grins bigger than James Coburn, and this
month those wall-to-wall teeth have reason to shine.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn is enjoying his best movie month in years.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Payback,'' the Mel Gibson shoot 'em down, Coburn plays the
kind of charming, lovable rascal that made him a big star in the
1960s. Only this time, he's doing it as a gangster.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Affliction,'' Paul Schrader's hard-hitting film version of
the novel by Russell Banks, Coburn gives an absolutely frightening
performance as an abusive, vile father to Nick Nolte's character.
</P>
<P>
   It would be enough just to have those two hugely different
characters on screen at the same time. The icing on the cake was
getting his first Academy Award nomination, as best supporting
actor in ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, fresh out of the shower after a workout in his Beverly
Hills home, admitted it was a surprise _ after more than 40 years
of film acting and dozens of films _ to finally get Academy
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good,'' Coburn said. ``It's an honor and
everything, but it's definitely a surprise. When we started, it was
just, let's do a film and hope it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying all along, well, this is worthy of an Oscar
nomination. I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, that and a dollar and half
will get you a cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen Coburn's starring films _ ``Our Man Flint,''
``Waterhole No. 3,'' ``The President's Analyst,'' ``Duffy,'' ``Duck
You Sucker'' _ remembers the big, booming personality, the wide
grin and the infectious laugh that defined many of his roles.
Coburn kept his lean, tall body in tight control, so when the grin
came, smart and joyously wicked, it was startling.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn is 70 now. He's bulkier, and one hand is twisted a bit
from the rheumatoid arthritis that severely restricted his career
for many years. But he's healthy and active _ the arthritis no
longer a problem _ and the booming signature laugh is still very
much evident. Coburn laughs a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Told that he was very scary to watch in ``Affliction,'' he gave
one of those laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' he said. ``That was my job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' is about a small-town underachiever, Wade
Whitehouse (Nolte), who slowly loses the nominal control he has
over his better nature. He becomes more and more like his aging
father, who was a tyrant in his own home when his children were
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the father) is the full-blown affliction,'' Coburn said,
now much more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte is a big man and a strong presence on screen. Director
Schrader needed an actor who could be believably intimidating to
Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted somebody of another generation of actors who was
powerful enough to play with Nick,'' Coburn said. But Coburn said
Schrader (director of ``American Gigolo'' and ``Touch,'' but
better-known for writing such screenplays as ``Taxi Driver'' and
``Raging Bull'') gave him little instruction, beyond not being his
usual likable screen personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Well, you know, Jim, this guy is not a charming
man.''' Coburn laughs. ``I said yeah, I understand. He said, `Well,
you know, I'm just going to let you two guys go at each other.' And
(Nick and I) just looked at each other and said, `Ooookay.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's role as Pop Whitehouse was only a few minutes here and
there in the movie, yet the character's presence dominates the
film's dark corners.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn got to get back to the charm in ``Payback.'' He has even
less screen time in that film, although his role ended up being
longer than originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (movie) was really a lark,'' said Coburn, who has been
friends with Gibson since ``Maverick.'' ``Mel called me up and
said, `How would you like to do a little thing in `Payback?'''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn shot a few days and was done. But the movie was plagued
with troubles between Gibson and rookie director Brian Helgeland
(scripter of ``L.A. Confidential'' and ``Conspiracy Theory'').
Helgeland was fired, and much of the movie was reshot so Gibson's
bad guy seemed, well, not so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``About five months passed, and I got another call. `Listen, we
took some stuff out, and so we need to put something in to make it
work.'''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Payback,'' a remake of the Lee Marvin classic ``Point
Blank,'' Gibson is a crook trying to regain stolen money that was
taken from him by a member of the crime syndicate of which Coburn
is an officer. In one comic scene, when he's under Gibson's gun,
Coburn's character seems concerned only that the bad man will shoot
his expensive luggage. It's the movie's most entertaining moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coburn enjoyed doing ``Payback,'' it was ``Affliction''
that was the real treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent films are the ones that are worthwhile
doing,'' Coburn said. ``Others are, like, build a set and blow it
up. Who cares? It gives you a little titillation for about 20
minutes, and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have good literature that comes from a book, like
Russell Banks', you've got something to work with. You can say
something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his long career, Coburn has come full circle to character
acting. He started out in small roles, often in westerns. The roles
slowly but steadily got larger. He had one of his first stand-out
bits as the knife-throwing member of ``The Magnificent Seven,'' and
another as the Manufacturer in ``The Great Escape.'' He's one of
the lead baddies menacing Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in
``Charade,'' and has a key role in ``The Americanization of
Emily,'' with Julie Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in 1965 that Coburn broke into stardom playing one of
the best early satires of the James Bond phenomenon in ``Our Man
Flint,'' a low-budget spoof that became a big hit _ mainly due to
Coburn's infectious vitality. The movie is terribly dated now _
although ``Austin Powers'' fans should really dig it, baby _ but
Coburn is still fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But then the arthritis struck _ hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do anything. I couldn't move,'' Coburn said. But he
continued to work, sometimes only doing narration or commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He had little luck with conventional doctors, of whom he has
little good to say. But everything changed for him when tried
homeopathic remedies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finished with the arthritis,'' he said. ``I cured that. I
mean, with a little help from my friends. It seems to be mainly on
its wane. I don't have any more pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He also does a regular work-out that includes some Asian
movements, hiking and stretching. He started it because of the
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become habitual,'' he said. ``It makes me feel good. The
activity is certainly good.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Oscar nomination brings him a lot more scripts, he'll
welcome them with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to work; that's my reality,'' Coburn said. ``The rest
of it's all jive. The reality is the work, because that's the thing
that lives forever. That's being recorded, and it will live as long
as there is somebody to look at it. The rest of it is just a
passing through, waiting for the in-between.''

FEARFUL WORKERS HIDE HIV INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ David had been working too many hours. His weight
was down and his T-cell count was low.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he didn't want anyone to know he has the virus that causes
AIDS. To justify his sick time, he told his supervisors he had a
chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I just told them I was HIV positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, David (not his real name) took a risk. Despite
the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last June to include HIV under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the law that prohibits
discrimination against people with disabilities, many workplaces
still are hostile to people with HIV, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet statistics show that HIV is becoming more common in the
workplace as people live longer and healthier on new drug
combinations. According to recent estimates by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, an estimated 650,000 to
900,000 people in the United States are infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, and some continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite legal protection against discrimination, many workers
continue to go to great lengths to hide their illness from their
employers, including not turning in health claims for fear of
people finding out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had cancer, they'd tell their employers. If they have
HIV, they're terrified,'' said Robert Bank, director of legal
services and the advocacy department at Gay Men's Health Crisis in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing that in 1999, most people are still
fearful to tell their employer their HIV status for fear of
retaliation,'' Bank said.
</P>
<P>
   A year-old campaign by the AIDS Council of Northeastern New York
in Albany is hoping to make employers more sensitive to the needs
of HIV infected workers, and increase their awareness about their
legal obligations to workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are afraid to tackle the issue of AIDS in
the workplace,'' said Dana Moss, a human resources partner at Fleet
Bank Corp. in Albany. Last October, he had his managers attend the
AIDS Council's day-long class as a pro-active step against any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   By law, companies must provide ``reasonable accommodations'' to
infected workers. That might include allowing a worker with HIV
enough time off at lunch to take medication, often a complicated
regimen that must be strictly followed, or eliminating forced
overtime that can cause undue exhaustion in someone with a chronic
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Doing otherwise, as the AIDS Council points out, could be the
grounds for an expensive lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that employers need to know about,'' said Nancy
Fisher, director of education for the AIDS Council. ``Disclosure is
a huge issue for people with HIV and for good reason. There's still
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   David, who works in a food manufacturing plant, had to assure
his supervisors, with the help of a physician, that HIV cannot be
spread through food. He also was asked to remain under the care of
a physician and to stop working when he became too sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was fair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, David asked that his workday be no longer than 10
hours and that his confidentiality be protected. Living in a small
community, he is worried about how his co-workers would react.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under suspicion and it's not the management of the plant
that I'm worried about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Petesch, a Washington, D.C., attorney specializing in
employment law, recommends anti-harassment training for both
company managers and their staff.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a nationwide poll that showed a majority of employees
thought their co-workers would feel uncomfortable working near an
HIV-infected colleague. Some 24 percent believed their HIV-infected
colleague should be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``That right there is a recipe for disaster,'' said Petesch, who
serves on the board for the CDC's Business Responds to AIDS
program, a national effort to raise awareness about the disease in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Council has visited a half-dozen workplaces in the
Albany area. The council's program covers different ways to protect
confidentiality and dispel myths about how the disease is spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to be getting the point out that you're not
doing stuff at work that puts you at risk,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   David believes that's an important message since many people
with HIV and AIDS want to work and can work, despite their illness.
``I plan on staying working for as long as I can,'' he said. ``I've
worked since I was 14. I'm not used to handouts.''

   Leon Reed hopes to hold political office one day. On this night,
the 30-year-old Texas Christian University senior is looking the
part, dressed in a coat and tie with a closely cropped haircut
framing his narrow, dark-brown face. When he takes his place behind
the lectern to introduce Don Jackson, chairman of TCU's political
science department, he sounds the part as well. But this is not a
political rally. It is a meeting Reed has organized to inform his
fellow students, whose skin color has put them at the center of an
intensive manhunt by Fort Worth and campus police, of their rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is easy to admire the two new Palm Computing hand-held
personal organizers introduced this week, the Palm IIIx and the
Palm V, but it is also easy to be envious of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Pilot and its successors are the most popular hand-held
computers ever, with more than 2.5 million sold in the past few
years. They are small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, cheap enough
to buy without having to hide the receipt from one's spouse, easy
enough to use without memorizing the instruction manual, and just
techy enough to be the only fashion accessory worn proudly by
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Like their predecessors, both the Palm IIIx and the sleeker Palm
V include a date book that can store five or more years' worth of
appointments, an address book that can hold thousands of names,
phone numbers and addresses, a to-do list that can occupy all of
your free time for months to come, a memo pad that would satisfy
the most entrenched bureaucrat, an expense account tracker and a
calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Information, including text, is entered easily by writing on the
screen with a pen-like stylus.
</P>
<P>
   It can also hold scores of electronic mail messages transferred
from a desktop computer. The built-in Hotsync software synchronizes
files between the Palm and its desktop or laptop computer at the
touch of a button, to keep contact and calendar information up to
date.
</P>
<P>
   The new models work seamlessly with Microsoft Outlook as well as
several other programs, both Windows and Macintosh. With an
optional modem, the Palms can send and receive data including
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the start. More than 2,000 other application
programs, most of them available free or at low cost from the
Internet, have been written for the Palm operating system by people
who love the little pen-based device that was first introduced in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new Palms are to be admired for improving with age, and that
is where my envy comes in. For example, while my eyesight is
beginning to dim, making it hard to read in low-light situations,
the new Palms have an improved screen that is much brighter and
easier to read indoors and out.
</P>
<P>
   While I get thicker around the middle, the Palm V is getting
thinner _ in fact only half the thickness of the original Palm
Pilot. My batteries tend to run down more quickly these days, but
the new Palms can go for days, or weeks. The Palm V has a
rechargeable lithium-ion battery instead of the twin AAAs used in
the Palm IIIx.
</P>
<P>
   There was something else, but I cannot remember what it was.
Perhaps I should have written it down. Oh yes, the Palm IIIx has
twice the memory of the Palm III that it supersedes, 4 megabytes as
against 2MB. Palm Computing has also repositioned the memory chips
to make the newest Palms more rugged, which is important on a
device that some people carry everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the 3Com Corp.'s Palm Computing division has
revitalized its lineup, just in time, perhaps, to stave off a
flurry of copycat devices based on the rival Windows CE operating
system. More on those in a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm IIIx, which has a list price of $369, is pretty easy to
sum up: It has a better screen, a faster operating system (Palm OS
3.1) and more memory than the year-old Palm III, at the same price.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 3Com has cut the price of the Palm III to $299,
making it more attractive to PC owners on tighter budgets. The
price of the Palm Pilot Professional organizer has been cut to $199
from $249.
</P>
<P>
   The fancier and more expensive new model is the long-awaited
Palm V. While it is less than half an inch thick, the Palm V
carries a fat $449 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the Palm V roughly $448 more expensive than the
simple paper notebook and pencil I have been using in a futile
attempt to keep my life organized. Is being organized digitally
worth the extra $448? After several days of testing the Palm V, I'm
not sure I can justify it logically.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when I pulled out the Palm V during a meeting this week with
some Silicon Valley hot shots and flashed its new brushed metal
case, the ooohs and aaahs were certainly worth a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   With just 2MB of memory and a shorter battery life, the Palm V
offers no performance advantages over the less-expensive Palm IIIx,
which, by the way, will also fit in a shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few minutes in its desktop cradle each morning will
keep the Palm V charged for even the longest workday, it was no
problem to pop a couple of fresh AAA batteries into the older
versions every few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 price difference between the two new models buys style.
The 3Com folks refer to the Palm V as the ``executive'' model, the
kind of functional status symbol that will appeal to people who
must have the tiniest cell phones at the conference table.
</P>
<P>
   Current Palm owners will be envious of the Palm V's sleek
design, but their enthusiasm may fade when they discover that none
of their Palm Pilot III accessories, including the stylus, modems,
cases and so on, fit the skinnier device.
</P>
<P>
   A new 33.6 kilobit-per-second modem for the Palm V is $169. A
Palm V travel kit, including a power adapter for foreign countries,
is $50 extra. Elegant leather holsters for the Palm V are available
from Coach and Dooney &AMP; Bourke.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers and engineers may also object to the Palm V because,
unlike the Palm IIIx, the case cannot be cracked open easily to
facilitate clever technical hacks, like transforming the Palm into
a television remote control, a global positioning system device or
an electronic book.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to reprogram and tinker with the original Palm Pilot
was a major factor in its popularity among the technical elite.
</P>
<P>
   As always, style is not always compatible with functionality.
The leather cover flap that comes with the Palm V presses down on
the device's new, raised scroll button. Even the lightest pressure,
like laying it face down on a desk or putting it in a shirt pocket
while its power is on, causes the Palm V to chatter like a tiny,
rabid chipmunk.
</P>
<P>
   Such gripes aside, a lot of people will probably be cashing in a
share or two of their favorite Internet stock to get the Palm V,
just because it is cool as well as genuinely useful.
</P>
<P>
   And I will attempt to justify buying one, too, because I've just
discovered a $20 program called GlucoPilot, which enables me and
other Type I diabetics to use a Palm computer as a way to track and
chart my daily blood glucose, insulin and carbohydrate information
much more efficiently than with a paper notebook.
</P>
<P>
   GlucoPilot and more than 2,000 other Palm OS programs are
available at www.pilotgear.com, one of the best of many Internet
sites that have sprung up to support Palm users.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Palm organizers have not had much serious
competition. That is about to change. Compaq next week is going to
unveil its Aero hand-held computer, which will join
Hewlett-Packard's Jornada 420 as rivals to the Palm organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Compaq and the H-P hand-helds have color screens, one
of their main advantages over the Palms. Color-screen rivals will
also be coming from Casio, Everex, Philips and others.
</P>
<P>
   Some other features planned for these new challengers sound
impressive, like microphones and speakers for voice annotation,
vibrating alarms, and so on. The question is whether they will be
able to match the Palm's ease of use, battery life, size and
weight, cheap and plentiful software supply, and price.

HOW A CHIP MAKES A GREETING CARD BURST INTO (FUZZY) SONG

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the outside, it looks like a regular greeting card. A little
bulky, perhaps, and a little heavier than you'd expect, but
otherwise, nothing out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   But when you open it, a tune begins and a movie-preview voice
booms out a message. Yes, this is a singing, talking greeting card.
Although cards like these have been around for decades, they are
still enough of a novelty to take you by surprise. And some of them
even let senders record their own songs or messages.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that underlies such cards is a mixture of
different sciences: microelectronics, old-fashioned mechanics and
economics. On a novelty item like this, price is of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   While people will spring for $3 for an ordinary card, they won't
go much above that for one that sings. Fortunately, an inexpensive
sound chip does most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   A leading chip, the tiny Chipcorder (from Information Storage
Devices), not only provides enough room to record a short message
or jingle, but also integrates sound filters and amplifiers _ all
on a silicon chip so small that six of them could fit comfortably
on a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Chipcorders record analog sound, not the digital sound usually
associated with microelectronics, and for good reasons. For one, it
cuts out the expense of the two converters needed by computer sound
cards and modems to convert analog signals into digital signals,
then reverse the process.
</P>
<P>
   Since analog sound does not need to be encoded and compressed
like digital sound, it takes up much less storage space, which also
keeps costs down.
</P>
<P>
   These sound-recording chips were first marketed in the early
1990s for use in telephone answering machines, portable dictation
devices and interactive books. But since chips with relatively
short recording times of 10 or 20 seconds can be manufactured quite
cheaply, they migrated naturally to novelty items like greeting
cards.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of 1998, they also found their way into more
than 12,000 New York City taxicabs: They are the technology behind
the celebrity voices that remind you to buckle up, pick up a
receipt and take all your belongings when you leave.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what they are used for, Chipcorders need a signal
to tell them to start playing. That is the only mechanical part of
the whole operation, and it is very low tech. In greeting cards,
the circuit board containing the Chipcorder is glued to a paper
mounting. A plastic tab keeps two electrical contacts from touching
each other and closing a circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The paper mounting attached to the end of the plastic tab is
then glued over the fold in the greeting card. Opening the card
draws the tab back; it slips out from between the two contacts,
allowing the circuit to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting electrical signal tells the Chipcorder to play.
(In taxicabs, the Chipcorders' play signal comes from turning the
meter on or off.)
</P>
<P>
   The chips can easily be recorded over, for at least tens of
thousands of repeat recordings. But not all singing greeting cards
allow you to record your own messages, because it costs more to
include that capability.
</P>
<P>
   All Chipcorders have the capacity for re-recording, but for
customers to record their own sounds requires that each card have
an additional switch and a microphone, and those cost money to buy
and install. Even though they are relatively small items, they push
up the selling price of a card to around $10, which is steep even
for the high-margin greeting cards market.
</P>
<P>
   It's economics that has prevented audio greeting cards from
becoming widespread. The typical outlets for greeting cards _
bookstores, drugstores, card shops and, increasingly, supermarkets
_ are high-overhead enterprises that pay close attention to profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the outlet, regular cards retail for $1 to $4, with
about half of that being profit. The Chipcorder, batteries and
speaker can cost what a retail outlet is prepared to pay for a
card, pricing singing cards out of the retail channel.
</P>
<P>
   So some big card companies that have experimented with singing
cards, like Gibson Greetings, no longer manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   Direct sales over the Internet may, however, keep the cards
singing. Sea Joi, listed at iMall (www.imall.com), has, like all
Internet merchants, low overhead, and sells a line with prerecorded
tunes or spoken messages for around the retail price of a regular
card.
</P>
<P>
   For about three times as much, it also sells cards with tiny
built-in microphones for recording your own 10-second messages. But
there's a problem with these record-your-own-message cards: If you
think it's hard to record an answering-machine greeting, think of
the pressure you're under when your lips are close to a card and
you have a 10-second time limit.

MURDER OVER THE HIGH SEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, they
paid with their own.
</P>
<P>
   When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and
Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little
blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the Florida
Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing Cuba in
makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was little enough the
fliers could do for any rafters they came upon _ toss down food and
bottled water, radio their location to the Coast Guard _ but that
little could make the difference between life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown more
than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and had saved
scores of boat people from drowning or dying of thirst. Armando, by
contrast, was going up for only the second time. What all four had
in common was a love of American liberty _ and a profound concern
for any Cubans so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean
hellspot that they would risk their lives to get away.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took off
from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly to just
below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's territorial waters.
Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic controllers as they
approached the 24th parallel, identifying themselves and giving
their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air Force, without warning and
without reason, scrambled two MiG fighters and blew the rescue
planes out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The planes and their passengers were disintegrated by the Cuban
MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they went down.
No bodies were ever recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men _ Carlos, Mario, and Armando _ were US
citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved by
Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US resident. What
happens when four American civilians are butchered in cold blood,
over international waters, by the air force of a Third World
dictatorship? What terrible retribution does the United States
exact for a quadruple murder so barbaric and unprovoked?
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing is: Nothing happens. There is no retribution.
Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the position not only that
Castro must not be punished for the four lives he destroyed, but
that the victims' families must not be permitted to recover
anything for their loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shoot-down, under intense political pressure,
President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton Act. Title III of
the statute allows American citizens whose property was confiscated
by the Cuban government _ Castro nationalized billions of dollars'
worth of American assets in the 1960s _ to file suit against any
foreign company using that property. Title IV bars any officer of a
foreign company trafficking in stolen American property from
receiving a visa to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip on
power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his treasury.
But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title III has never
taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending it (as the law
permits him to do if he finds that a suspension ``will expedite a
transition to democracy in Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect
because the State Department refuses to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the memory
of the four murdered men. But the Clinton administration has
delivered a cut unkinder still.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued the
Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful deaths of their
loved ones, a legal remedy specifically authorized by the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James Lawrence King
awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in damages. ``Cuba's
extrajudicial killings . . . were inhumane acts against innocent
civilians,'' he wrote in his final judgment. ``The fact that the
killings were premeditated and intentional, outside Cuban
territory, wholly disproportionate, and executed without warning .
. . makes this act unique in its brazen flouting of international
norms.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the families attempted to collect their judgment out of
frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration blocked them. The
president famous for feeling people's pain is less concerned with
the pain of grief-stricken Americans, it would appear, than with
the pain Castro might feel if the judgment were paid.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an open
and declared enemy of the United States and has been for 40 years.
In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four unarmed Americans
engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he committed an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   The response of the United States should have been to remove
Castro from power and put him in the dock for crimes against
humanity. (For the murder of just one American in 1989, the United
States invaded Panama and seized Manuel Noriega.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The
families of the dead Brothers to the Rescue deserve better from
their government. And the unhappy people of Cuba, bleeding under
Castro's whip, deserve better from their free and powerful neighbor
to the north.

PEACE ACTIVITS DECRY MARINE EXERCISE IN OAKLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Peace activists criticized Oakland Mayor Jerry
Brown for his support of a mock military invasion that the Marine
Corps plans next month to test its urban warfare preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Coalition Against Urban Warfare, a group of more
than 15 anti-war organizations, said they were shocked that Brown,
who in recent years has disparaged U.S. military spending and the
``weaponry of death,'' would endorse a practice landing by the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised that Brown supported this; I used to
listen to his radio show, and he regularly spoke out against the
military,'' said Sherry Larsen-Belville, of the Livermore
Conversion Project, a peace group. ``This is sending the wrong
message to our community. It is promoting violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen-Belville marched with about 70 protesters Tuesday night
near the Oakland City Hall. Many carried anti-war picket signs and
chanted, ``Urban poverty they don't care, they give us urban
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine operation, called ``urban warrior,'' is scheduled to
take place March 15-18 and will put 700 Marines in the Oakland area
at any given time. Military officials said the exercises would test
the Marines' ability to handle a 21st-century coastal urban
conflict, natural disaster or large-scale humanitarian effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland has a long history with the military, and we wanted to
maintain good relations with them,'' the mayor's spokeswoman,
Stacey Wells, said of the operation. ``Oakland will also get some
training and help with disaster relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said that Brown saw no conflict between his past anti-war
sentiments and his current support for the military exercises. Nor
does the mayor's endorsement erode his stance on violence, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exercise on a base,'' Wells said. ``It has to do
with training and readiness, not the military industrial complex.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, Brown hosted a radio show called ``We The
People.'' Brown's guests included a number of progressive thinkers
and peace activists, and he would often chime in against increases
in military spending and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine exercise was originally slated to take place at the
Presidio, the former military base in San Francisco, but in
December Presidio caretakers decided not to authorize the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy will participate in the exercises, which will allow
troops to practice a ``three-block war,'' including an armed
conflict, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2025, 70 percent of the world's population will
live in coastal urban environments, and 70 percent of the nation's
capitals and 70 percent of nuclear reactors are also located in
those kinds of areas,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Schenkel, the leader of
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The main ``invasion'' will begin on March 15, when some 400
Marines will launch in amphibious landing craft and helicopters
from two carriers and other ships anchored near Angel Island in the
San Francisco Bay. The troops will perform a landing in Alameda and
then be escorted by the Oakland police to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-acre Naval facility, in the residential East Oakland
hills, was shut down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schenkel, most of the combat exercises will take
place in and around the hospital, and will include Marines firing
blanks from M-16 rifles. Peacekeeping and disaster relief
operations will ensue at base housing, and will involve about 200
actors playing war-weary civilians. The troops will sleep in
existing base barracks.

<P>
   Col. Qaddafi's emissary, Youssef Debri, met me in Cairo. He was
in Egypt exploring the ramifications of Libya's surrendering two of
its citizens to stand trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In formal talks in New York, a U.N. official had already managed
to narrow the gap between Libya's concerns and the British-American
proposal for a trial in the Netherlands, but important differences
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now Debri was in Cairo informally, to clarify Washington's terms
with a well-connected, retired American diplomat, in the hope of
ending Qaddafi's equivocation.
</P>
<P>
   An intimate of Qaddafi since their student days at military
college, Debri had contacted me some weeks before to propose that I
visit Libya. Cut off from the world by the U.N. embargo over
Lockerbie, Libya, he said, had grown weary of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the embargo's terms, it could sell oil _ its only export _
to European customers, so it had money for food and medicines. But
the other barriers to trade and transportation were wearing it
down. Few businessmen and almost no journalists came to call.
</P>
<P>
   Debri's message was that Libya, anxious for a new start, wanted
to put Lockerbie behind it. In Libya, he assured me, I would be
free to go where I liked and to see whomever I wanted, including
Qaddafi himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided on the journey, I went to the State Department
for a briefing. Officials there acknowledged that they knew little
about what was going on in Libya. In 1986, two years before
Lockerbie, President Reagan broke off relations with Libya and
imposed economic sanctions in response to a series of terrorist
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the officials said, Libya had committed
no terrorist acts. Unlike Iraq, it posed no strategic threat. But
because of Lockerbie, the United States still shunned Qaddafi and
kept Libya on its list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a U.S. grand jury indicted two Libyans _ Lamin Khalifa
Fhimah, ex-manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines office in Malta, and
Abdel Basset Ali al- Megrahi, a high-level intelligence official _
for the Lockerbie bombing. A British court did the same. In 1992,
the U.N. Security Council imposed its own sanctions, including a
flight ban that effectively closed Libya's airports. Tripoli, in
response, proposed trying the two suspects in a neutral country,
but Washington and London would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last August, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
announced that she would ``call the Libyan government's bluff'' and
offered a trial by a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands.
Libya agreed in principle, but Qaddafi demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   The American embargo did not bar my visit (since it makes an
exception for journalists). I flew to Cairo; then, with Youssef
Debri, set off for Tripoli by car.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Benghazi, then Sirte, chosen by Qaddafi as Libya's
new capital. Around 11 o'clock on the morning after our arrival,
Youssef and I set out, heading south, to see Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour ride across the desert, we were met by a
police escort, which led us to an almost indiscernible dirt track
that ran off the paved road. A bumpy mile or so later, we reached
the gate of a chainlink fence, where three or four limousines sat.
</P>
<P>
   Parking our car among them, we piled into a Land Rover, which
bucked us over rock and sand a half-hour deeper into the desert.
Finally, we reached an encampment of large tents and modern
trailers near which grazed a herd of some 200 camels. No armed
guards seemed to be anywhere in view.
</P>
<P>
   The tent to which I was first directed was ballroom-size, its
sides open to admit the breeze. Seated next to three Africans in
native robes, I was offered tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans made a brief call on Qaddafi, after which Youssef
escorted me to Qaddafi's tent, pitched nearby, and left me there.
Save for a few simple chairs and a table, the tent was bare. Its
camel-skin roof and sides were weathered; the rugs covering the
sand floor were ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi sat alone, except for an interpreter. He wore a thin,
tattered Bedouin robe, embroidered at the edges, over a
much-laundered print sport shirt and khaki pants. His furrowed face
was clean-shaven, his eyes covered by dark glasses. A beige turban
half-concealed his bushy hair.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I began the interview by asking whether the view that Libya had
embarked on a new course was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi did not turn to me to answer. Through the open flaps of
the tent, he fixed his eyes on the horizon. His lips seemed barely
to move. He spoke in a controlled monotone, though from time to
time emotion quickened its pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he said, ``unfortunately treats us as if the world
was the way it used to be. Americans accept that changes have taken
place since the end of communism, but not in their treatment of
Libya. So in the end, they take a racist and fanatical position,
similar to the way Hitler treated the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that America is much like Hitler. We have no
explanation for this, except that it is a religious, fanatical,
racist position. Some analysts call this a new colonialism. But
colonialism is colonialism, and it is always unjust. It is how we
were treated by the Italians, Algeria by the French, India by the
British. This is imperialism, and we seem to be entering a new
imperialist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of our conflict with America is not that we attacked
them. We have never attacked an American target. America started
the aggression against us right here in the Gulf of Sirte. When we
defended ourselves, they attacked us in these very tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombed by missiles in our own territorial waters. In
1986 our own children were killed. No one can bring my daughter
back to me. Then Lockerbie came along. Now we'd like this chain of
events to be over. But America doesn't want to turn the page. We
shall, however, show courage and be patient, and America will be
the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The events about which Qaddafi rambled date back to 1981, when
American jets shot down two Libyan planes in a dispute over the
extent of Libya's territorial waters. In January 1986, President
Reagan, responding to terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, blocked
commerce with Libya and froze its American assets. A few weeks
later, U.S. Navy planes bombed Sirte and destroyed four patrol
boats in another dispute over territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reagan, blaming Libya for a bomb that killed two
American soldiers in a Berlin nightclub, attacked Tripoli and
Benghazi, along with suspected terrorist camps in the desert. Among
the 37 civilians reported killed was Qaddafi's adopted infant
daughter, Hana'a. Libyans say the child's death haunts him still.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Qaddafi if Libya was responsible for the many
terrorist incidents of which it was accused in the 1980s, he issued
no denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents that you mention belong to the past,'' he
said. ``Once Abu Amar (Yasir Arafat) was wanted. Now he enters the
White House with all the trappings, the music, the red carpet
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I detected a note of envy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Libya is a terrorist country. But now that is
illogical, not reasonable. All these things are of the past, an era
that is over. The bombing of the French plane (a French UTA
airliner bombed over Niger in 1989, at a cost of 171 lives) took
place during a time of war in the region _ Libya, Chad, France. It
was similar to America's downing of the Iranian plane in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis shot down a Libyan aircraft over the Sinai. The
Soviet Union shot down a Korean airplane. It was a time of war. So
how come you forgot all about that and you just mention the charges
against Libya? There is no explanation for that. We go back to the
racist, fanatical complexes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Qaddafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Libya, I asked, ready to turn over the two Lockerbie suspects
for trial? His answer, I thought, contained a clue to his
procrastination in resolving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed that a trial should take place. Now let us sit
down and decide how it can be put into practice. I want to find out
the truth about Lockerbie myself. After that, the story will be
finished. I am not so concerned about whether the two Libyans are
convicted or not. What is important is that the problem come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice the number of Libyans have died from the embargo than
were killed at Lockerbie. Whether this one or that is guilty or not
is the business of the lawyers and the courts. What matters is that
once the trial starts, sanctions will be over against Libya. The
embargo will be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good
relations with Europe. We have European embassies and companies
here. But America is different. We are not enemies of the American
people. Millions of Arabs, millions of Muslims, millions of
Africans are Americans these days. How could we be their enemy?
Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later I was cautiously sipping camel milk in the
waiting-tent when Youssef returned. In an urgent tone he reported,
``The Leader wants me to remind you that he was not talking
officially and that he was not stating policy. He asks you to
remember that he is a private person and was speaking from his
heart on what he feels.''

   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.

   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good

Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''

PEACE ACTIVITS DECRY MARINE EXERCISE IN OAKLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Peace activists criticized Oakland Mayor Jerry
Brown for his support of a mock military invasion that the Marine
Corps plans next month to test its urban warfare preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Coalition Against Urban Warfare, a group of more
than 15 anti-war organizations, said they were shocked that Brown,
who in recent years has disparaged U.S. military spending and the
``weaponry of death,'' would endorse a practice landing by the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised that Brown supported this; I used to
listen to his radio show, and he regularly spoke out against the
military,'' said Sherry Larsen-Belville, of the Livermore
Conversion Project, a peace group. ``This is sending the wrong
message to our community. It is promoting violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen-Belville marched with about 70 protesters Tuesday night
near the Oakland City Hall. Many carried anti-war picket signs and
chanted, ``Urban poverty they don't care, they give us urban
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine operation, called ``urban warrior,'' is scheduled to
take place March 15-18 and will put 700 Marines in the Oakland area
at any given time. Military officials said the exercises would test
the Marines' ability to handle a 21st-century coastal urban
conflict, natural disaster or large-scale humanitarian effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland has a long history with the military, and we wanted to
maintain good relations with them,'' the mayor's spokeswoman,
Stacey Wells, said of the operation. ``Oakland will also get some
training and help with disaster relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said that Brown saw no conflict between his past anti-war
sentiments and his current support for the military exercises. Nor
does the mayor's endorsement erode his stance on violence, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exercise on a base,'' Wells said. ``It has to do
with training and readiness, not the military industrial complex.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, Brown hosted a radio show called ``We The
People.'' Brown's guests included a number of progressive thinkers
and peace activists, and he would often chime in against increases
in military spending and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine exercise was originally slated to take place at the
Presidio, the former military base in San Francisco, but in
December Presidio caretakers decided not to authorize the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy will participate in the exercises, which will allow
troops to practice a ``three-block war,'' including an armed
conflict, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2025, 70 percent of the world's population will
live in coastal urban environments, and 70 percent of the nation's
capitals and 70 percent of nuclear reactors are also located in
those kinds of areas,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Schenkel, the leader of
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The main ``invasion'' will begin on March 15, when some 400
Marines will launch in amphibious landing craft and helicopters
from two carriers and other ships anchored near Angel Island in the
San Francisco Bay. The troops will perform a landing in Alameda and
then be escorted by the Oakland police to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-acre Naval facility, in the residential East Oakland
hills, was shut down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schenkel, most of the combat exercises will take
place in and around the hospital, and will include Marines firing
blanks from M-16 rifles. Peacekeeping and disaster relief
operations will ensue at base housing, and will involve about 200
actors playing war-weary civilians. The troops will sleep in
existing base barracks.

SPOON UP SOME FOOD FOR THE SOUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you find a dish that prompts a thousand recipes, it's clear
that the dish has been around awhile and that people enjoy it. It
wouldn't have lasted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess that it's not too expensive to make, that it
probably doesn't take much time and that the cooks like to tweak
it. They like to put their personal stamp on it, put in a secret
ingredient, pay particular attention to it and make sure the family
enjoys it.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably soul food of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the final days of Black History Month, it is
appropriate to look at soul food. To pick out something that fits
in that category; something rich, custardy, comfortable; something
that's a soulful regional staple.
</P>
<P>
   Soul food is a designation for an African-American style of home
cooking. Jonell Nash writes in her cookbook ``Low-Fat Soul''
(Ballantine, $14), ``Soul food was then born in the slave quarters
of Southern plantations as our ancestors pieced together amazing
meals mainly from scraps and leftovers. After choice portions were
selected for the `master's' table, the remaining neck bones, hock,
tails and tough cuts, along with cornmeal, molasses, lard and other
staples, were then rationed to the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished meals were put together with produce from the
slaves' gardens and fish and game from the nearby lakes and woods.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way for a lot of people. Poverty knew no color, and
those who didn't have much made do with what they could find. They
grew it, caught it, spiced it up and cooked it with loving,
practical care.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Nash includes Southern, creole, Cajun and island
cooking as soul food. There is even a little Mexican thrown. The
differences in these styles are often indiscernible.
</P>
<P>
   Even when things became prosperous, when grocery stores appeared
on every corner and there was money to buy food off of shelves,
soulful cooking still demanded some of the old ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing about Southern cooking was that the food was
home-grown, fresh and not hybridized,'' Edna Lewis, an undisputed
pioneer in Southern cuisine, said in an interview for an online
newsletter. ``You picked the food from the garden each day, and
nothing was store-bought. You had your own meat, or you bought it
from a neighbor. We made our own butter and didn't give our cows
pills to make them give more milk. The food had a better taste when
it wasn't injected with something, like everything is today.''
</P>
<P>
   The days of growing vegetables and milking cows are gone for
most of us. We couldn't do it if we wanted to, and most of us don't
want to. But we can still use local ingredients. We can amend our
recipes to fit our surroundings, and we can make them with the kind
of care that brings more than just physical nourishment to our
family tables.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon bread is a good place to start. It is easy and adaptable.
It is a staple in many households, in many cultures. You can put
your own personality in it.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican spoon bread has Cheddar cheese and chopped green chiles;
the creamy mixture of Tennessee spoon bread is punctuated
throughout with country sausage.
</P>
<P>
   You can use ham or bacon; whole corn or cream corn or a mixture
of both; milk, sweet cream or sour, half-and-half. Make it as
sugary as you want. Just make it hot and steaming and inviting.
Make it soul food.
</P>
<P>
   As Nash says: ``Even more than specific dishes or ingredients,
soul food represents a certain spirit, an attitude, a flamboyance,
a kind of loving that one brings to the kitchen and stirs into the
pots.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is her basic recipe:
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN SPOON BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion or scallions
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white or yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups 1-percent-fat milk
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat 1 1/2-quart baking dish or
souffle dish with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. Heat butter in
nonstick skillet; saute onion until tender, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In small bowl, combine cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt (if
desired) and 1 cup milk; stir until blended. In a 3-quart saucepan
over medium heat, scald remaining 2 cups milk (heat just until tiny
bubbles form around edges of pan). Stir in cornmeal mixture; cook,
stirring occasionally, until mixture resembles thick mush, 4 to 5
minutes. Remove from heat; let cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In medium-size bowl, beat egg yolk slightly; stir in a little of
cornmeal mixture. Stir yolk into warm cornmeal; mix well. Using
rubber spatula to scrape skillet, stir in onion mixture.
</P>
<P>
   In small, clean, deep bowl, beat egg whites until stiff. Fold
1/3 of whites into cornmeal mixture to lighten; fold in remaining
egg whites until evenly blended. Spoon batter into prepared dish.
Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 30 to 40 minutes. Spoon
onto plates to serve.

than a million dollars. He has invested in a marina in London and a
rental property in Rhode Island. He has a stock portfolio. He pays
a driver $850 weekly to ferry him around New York in his 1998
Infiniti Q45.
</P>
<P>
   But Leifer has something most moguls do not have: a mother who
frequently checks his e-mail for pornography. Aron Leifer is 18.
</P>
<P>
   Leifer, of Borough Park, Brooklyn, is about four years ahead of
Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who became a multimillionaire in
his early 20s. Bill Gates had to wait until he was 30 to join the
millionaires' club.
</P>
<P>
   Leifer said he hoped to take his computer software company,
Multi Media Audiotext, public within six months and join the rank
of the multimillionaires. He quit school, a yeshiva, at the age of
16 and now works 14-hour days serving clients around the globe,
including Bell Atlantic, Hewlett Packard, Fleet Bank and many
telecommunications and Internet marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Leifer is the latest in a quickly growing group of young people,
most of them young men, getting rich from their computer
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Before he started his company, Leifer hadn't earned a dime in
his life. ``I have never, ever done anything, not even
baby-sitting, that people do when they are my age, that generated
money,'' he said. ``Almost all my family are people that work for
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Leifer studies the Talmud two hours a day with a rabbi he hired
to tutor him privately, and both his father and grandfather are
Hasidic rabbis. But at 18, Leifer is, as his Web site denotes, a
technology master (www.technologymaster.com) who writes software
for things like database management and computer phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Leifer is exceptional, even compared with other get-rich-quick
kids. But the Internet has spawned a group of teen-agers who think
nothing of setting up online versions of yesteryear's lemonade
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these entrepreneurs have followed a similar path. Their
first computers were purchased for the usual reasons: the parents
or child wanted one. What happened next is also consistent from
child to child.
</P>
<P>
   Once their fingertips touched down on those keyboards, they
started to build better mousetraps almost immediately, either by
writing programs or designing their own Web sites for fun. Finally,
someone, usually an adult, told them that they could make some
money selling what they knew.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Jay Leibowitz of Northridge, Calif., who turned 17
earlier this month, said he had done to make his first $30,000 or
$40,000. At the time of that first big success, Leibowitz was 14.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12, he taught himself a programming language, Visual
Basic, and used it to write two software programs, one for running
DOS commands in Windows and another that allowed the user to edit
batch files, which contain series of instructions for a computer to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz put the software he designed onto Compuserve in its
shareware area. Users who downloaded the program and liked it sent
Leibowitz checks. The big money came when he sold the rights to the
shareware to ``some guy whose name I forget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the profits to buy a new snowboard, a set of
golf clubs or any other toy a 14-year-old boy might crave,
Leibowitz plunged his earnings directly into the stock market. In
two and a half years, he said, he has quadrupled his money and now
estimates his net worth at $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for fun and a little profit (about $1,200 a month), he runs
an advertiser-supported site called Streetwhiz
(www.streetwhiz.com), which teaches investing basics and is aimed
at young people.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz's mother, Carolyn, who is a nurse, recently asked him
about the viability of investing in municipal bonds. Leibowitz is
looking into his mother's query. He heard in December that he had
not been admitted to Harvard under its early admission program but
was being considered in its pool of regular-admission applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason so many kids are in computer-generated businesses
is because they have the edge over the adult population,'' said
Marilyn Kourilsky, vice president of the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership in St. Louis and a former
economics professor at the University of California at Los Angeles
who has done extensive research on entrepreneurship and youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were brought up on computers. The smart kid in
school you wouldn't buy Girl Scout cookies from can now sell you a
lot while wearing his pajamas, not having brushed his teeth and
surrounded by 25 bags of potato chips.'' These youngsters do not
need to have the social graces of skilled business people, she
added; they are anonymous entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the archetypal computer nerd,'' said Dan Finley, a
college freshman from Federal Way, Wash., who started a Web site to
review computer hardware, called The View (www.the-view.com), when
he was 16. ( Finley turned 18 on Jan. 23, he said proudly.)
</P>
<P>
   He has encountered some bumps along the way. A company once sent
Finley a $6,000 printer to review, but his computer was too puny to
make the printer work properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable _ at one point our living room was a vast
storage area'' for computer equipment, said Hal Finley, Dan's
father. The elder Finley said he had not minded circling around the
room to get to the sofa because his son's business endeavors were a
``cost-effective usage of his education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd discourage lawn mowing or anything less than what he's
capable of doing,'' the father said. ``He's an A student.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Dan Finley works on The View five hours a week and has 20
writers working for him. After paying his writers, he clears about
$500 monthly from advertising income. In the works is a new Web
site, Pre Amp, to review music.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has already been in touch with record companies for
review copies of new work, now that he has a track record on the
Web. He is also looking for writers. Finley, an economics major at
Claremont McKenna College in Los Angeles, just bought his own car,
computer, couch and school books with his earnings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as a ``saver'' and said he managed to save
``25 to 26 percent'' of what he earned. His next step is to invest
in mutual funds, now that he is legally an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being under 18 is a pain,'' Dan Finley said. ``You can't sign
contracts, can't get a credit card; every bank account you have has
to have a parent's name on it. It's always been frustrating to
me.'' He admitted that he was anxious to break away from his
parents financially and assume more risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Finley yearns for the freedom granted any adult
entrepreneur, being underage has given him an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now people think it's cute because they're young,''
Kourilsky said. ``I'm sure they thought Bill Gates was adorable.
It's very hard to say no to a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Young entrepreneurs also have other advantages over their
competition: without mortgages to pay, mouths to feed and car
insurance bills, these kids are willing to undercut the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   They are even willing to trade goods for services to get their
foot in the door. Sam Roberts, 12, offered that deal to his first
client, Todd Strasser, who writes popular novels for preteen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Strasser's most popular book is ``How I Created My Perfect Prom
Date.'' He wanted a teen-ager-friendly Web site to communicate with
his fans, so he called on Roberts, then 11 and a neighbor in
Westchester County, to help him design it (www.toddstrasser.com).
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was already a proven commodity in computers when he
hooked up with Strasser. In the third grade, at age 8, he came in
first in a design contest sponsored by a software company and won a
20-inch television with a VCR attached and $1,500 worth of movie
tickets. He agreed to design a Web site for Strasser in exchange
for a computer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam understands what needs to be done so clearly,'' Strasser
said. ``He even came up with some great lines to describe the
books.'' Strasser has since paid Roberts with sneakers and software
to update the site and has recommended Roberts' services to other
friends who are writers.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, flush with success after that first job, decided to
start his own Web page design company, Webman, with a partner,
Michael Greenberg, another seventh grader in his school. They
determined their price and got to work. But trouble was afoot when
Greenberg set up his own company to design Web sites and business
cards, calling himself Web Man Productions. The partnership
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends as long as we don't talk about our Web site
companies,'' said Roberts, who can be found at www.webman.tsx.org.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers like Roberts are proving the title of a popular
self-help book: ``Do What You Love, the Money Will Follow,'' by
Marsha Sinetar (Paulist Press, 1986). Young entrepreneurs excel by
starting businesses they are ``keenly and personally interested
in,'' said James B. Hayes, president of Junior Achievement, a
79-year-old organization set up to help children learn about the
free enterprise system. These days, the computer is an easy
starting point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young entrepreneurs who make it, though, seem to approach
the machine in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is the only 12-year-old I know who erases his pornographic
messages because he hates wasting the time and thinks it is
inappropriate,'' said Steven Roberts, Sam Roberts' father, by
e-mail. ``The computer opened up his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they make money and run businesses, most of these
young business people are well rounded.
</P>
<P>
   Leifer, with his circumscribed life of Torah study three times a
day and round-the-clock business dealings, is the exception. Still,
he admitted that he would like to get his driver's license (he said
he could not find the two hours needed to take the test), and,
eventually, to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz is captain of his high school golf team and has a 6
handicap. He also runs the investors' club at his school.
</P>
<P>
   Finley shares the job of music director at his college radio
station, works at the student union restaurant and can be found at
midnight every Thursday playing Ultimate Frisbee with his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts plays soccer, basketball and baseball and is studying
for his bar mitzvah in March.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them have plans to stop producing their computer
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself to be relatively ambitious,'' Leibowitz
said. ``I like to learn about things, and I don't see what prevents
me from learning stuff. I know it may sound precocious. Some people
know how to surf. I know how to be an entrepreneur.''

TIPS FROM TEEN-AGE MILLIONAIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no simple recipe for becoming a teen-age millionaire,
but people who have been there have a few suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't make earning money the goal. None of these kids even
thought about making money until they started earning some from
doing what they loved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work for no pay. For a little while, at least. Then start
charging. Aron Leifer of Brooklyn, a millionaire at 18, built his
client base by answering programming questions at no charge. Later,
clients felt comfortable giving him their business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay focused. These young people finish what they start.
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-promote. When Dan Finley, a college freshman and Web site
entrepreneur, was in high school, he spoke regularly to groups
about his business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enter contests. Winning helps jump-start careers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid television. Oh, except for ``Dawson's Creek'', ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'' and ``The X-Files.'' (These are kids, after
all).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rich and Ellen Levin and their preschool-age children, Nate and
Steffi, have a problem unique to the digital age: they have too
many computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Levins, who live near San Francisco, have three personal
computers at home _ two desktops and a laptop that Levin, who is a
technology information manager for a Bay-area company, lugs between
his home and his office.
</P>
<P>
   Friction started when more than one of the Levins wanted to use
the household's single Internet connection. There were also times
when the family came to loggerheads over the color printer: Mom and
Dad wanted to print out letters and reports at the same time the
children wanted to churn out puzzles and games.
</P>
<P>
   Levin thought he had a solution: setting up his own local area
network, or LAN. ``I suggested to my wife that I put in a network,
a real wired one,'' he recalled, explaining that he had wanted to
link all the household's computers with conventional network cards
and wire, the way millions of computers are commonly laced together
in offices and schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Levin vetoed that notion, insisting that her husband
not drill holes in the walls of their home. Then Levin heard about
a wireless way to connect the family's computers by way of an
old-fashioned technology: radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   A wireless home network allows computers to act in concert,
swapping files through a single, Windows-like interface, using the
same Internet connection simultaneously and sharing popular
peripherals, like printers, Zip and tape drives, and scanners.
Multiplayer computer games like Quake II can also be blasted across
home networks.
</P>
<P>
   Levin chose a system called Homefree from Diamond Multimedia
Systems, a major maker of modems, graphics cards and the Rio player
for MP3 music. Diamond introduced Homefree Wireless late last year.
The idea, the company said, is that computer networking should no
longer be prohibitively complicated, or limited mostly to
universities and corporations, which can hire professionals to
manage the systems.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond is not the only company to recognize the growing
interest in home networking. Apple has long shipped its computers
with networking cards inside that make wire-based networks possible
in homes.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Compaq and Dell have followed Apple's lead while
broadening the PC networking options by adding adapters that link
computers through home telephone wiring.
</P>
<P>
   For years, giants like IBM have been making networking systems
for computers in homes and small offices. But these systems have
been mostly conventional, using wires and networking cards. Intel
is preparing to release in the spring its own home-network system,
which will use phone lines, and systems that run along existing
electrical wiring are being sold and designed.
</P>
<P>
   Each approach offers a range of advantages and disadvantages.
The chief advantage of wireless networks is that users are not
tethered by cables to places near phone jacks, electrical outlets
or the other computers on their network.
</P>
<P>
   A wireless connection permits a user to, say, sit outdoors on a
terrace with a laptop and browse the Internet, yards away from the
computer in the house that is physically linked to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is easy installation. ``Part of the problem in
the past had been that setting up a network was not easy,'' said
Rocky Scales, director of product marketing for the communications
division of Diamond Multimedia, which licensed Homefree's
technology from another California company, Alation. ``They were
difficult to set up. They required drilling holes in the walls.
They required running wires underneath the carpet and throughout
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Levin household, the wireless revolution has spelled an
end to hauling the laptop to the single color printer in the
upstairs office, and also having to transfer files from the
downstairs computer to diskettes to the upstairs computer for
printing. Everyone prints what they want when they want over the
network, Levin reported happily last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we don't have to worry about who is on the Net,'' he said.
Before the network, only one person at a time could go on line,
using the home's single phone line. Now all three computers can be
on line at once. ``I'm very happy with it,'' Levin added. ``It is
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Affordable wireless networking for homes is relatively new.
Webgear, a technology company based in San Jose, Calif., introduced
one of the first systems, Aviator, a year ago. With Aviator,
pager-size modules are connected to the printer ports of the
computers' printer ports.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, Proxim, a wireless communications company in
Mountain View, Calif., released Symphony Suite, which uses its own
wireless modem for Internet connections. Last month, Innomedia,
which is based in San Jose, announced that its home networking
product, Infoaccess, would be on retail shelves by late March.
</P>
<P>
   Each Infoaccess unit looks much like an external modem with a
small antenna protruding from its side; it plugs into any of a
computer's COM ports and promises a range of 300 feet, twice the
indoor range of Homefree's system.
</P>
<P>
   So if networks are so useful, why did they take so long to come
into homes?
</P>
<P>
   Experts examining home computer trends point to an increase in
the number of multicomputer homes. Of the 47 million households
with computers in the United States, 12.4 million have more than
one, said Karuna Uppal, a home-networking analyst for the Yankee
Group, a technology research company in Boston. That number is
expected to jump to 17 million by the end of this year, and half of
all homes with computers are likely to have more than one by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many factors are driving the increase in homes with multiple
PCs, including the growing availability of powerful computers that
are more affordable. In addition, more parents are giving their
children computers for educational purposes. Studies show that
parents seldom discard their older computers when they buy newer,
more advanced ones. As the Levins did, they usually give the older
one to the children.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Appleman, vice president of sales and marketing for
Webgear, said technological improvements in wireless communications
and consumers' comfort with cordless telephones had contributed to
the climate for radio-wave, also called radio-frequency, networks.
Another factor is that consumers want systems that are easy to
install and operate, even if they have to give up some features of
sophisticated office systems that are wired.
</P>
<P>
   The Homefree wireless system requires the use of cards
(available to fit either ISA slots or the newer PCI slots) that
must be inserted inside desktop computers _ an intimidating
prospect for some users. (Laptops require the simple insertion of a
special adapter card into the laptop's PCMCIA slot.)
</P>
<P>
   While the hardware installation was simple with a recent review
copy of Homefree, software glitches prevented it from working _
specifically, it could not locate the other computer on the system.
Diamond's toll-free help line was overloaded, resulting in
20-minute-plus waits for assistance. Once contact was made with
Diamond, the problem was quickly fixed with a downloaded driver
patch.
</P>
<P>
   Speed is another consideration for home networkers, and wireless
systems are slowpokes compared with wired ones. The Homefree and
the Aviator systems promise to move data to and from computers as
quickly as one megabit per second (a new version of the Aviator
that is expected to be shipped late next month is designed to
perform at more than twice its current speed).
</P>
<P>
   A common hard-wired network, using a 10/100 Ethernet card, can
push data along at 100 megabits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zai, product manager for the Infoaccess system,
acknowledged that while data on his system crept along at only 85
kilobits per second, much slower than the Homefree's megabite per
second, it was still almost twice as fast as today's commonplace
56-kilobit-per-second modems.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the radio-frequency systems require users to designate
one computer, usually the one with the fastest connection to the
Internet, to act as the network's hub. The hub computer must be on
for the others to share resources.
</P>
<P>
   With each new user sharing an Internet connection, the speed of
the connection drops. That drop can be slight or significant,
depending on the number of people sharing the line and the kind of
network being used.
</P>
<P>
   And using a home network to view movies from a computer-based
DVD would be troublesome because the transmission rates are not
fast enough yet to move such large video and sound files seamlessly
in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue often raised by consumers interested in wireless
home networks is security. Can your neighbor use a wireless system
to tap into your network? Zai, the Infoaccess product manager, said
that would be practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the Joneses cannot peek into the Johnsons'
computers is that radio-wave networks like Homefree use
spread-spectrum frequency-hopping technology, which means that the
information is transmitted on various frequencies _ the
transmission jumps from frequency to frequency in a pattern that
only its dedicated receiver knows. (Homefree's hops over 80
channels up to a million times a second.)
</P>
<P>
   Other receivers, even those only a few yards away, cannot
recognize the pattern and capture the information, designers said.
</P>
<P>
   For Zai, home computer networks, while sophisticated in design,
must remain simple to set up and operate if they are going to be
the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use it,'' he said, ``you don't have to be a PC networking
wizard.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one brags about them. They're not featured in the color
brochures. Queries are met with an all-too-obvious effort to change
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really not our niche,'' said Frank Newbold, the
manager of the East Hampton, N.Y., office of Sotheby's
International Realty. ``I'd like to help you, but it's not our
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But bargain houses, it turns out, make up the backbone of much
of the real- estate business in the Hamptons, even in these days of
mega-houses and multi-million-dollar sales. One agent, Jerry
Preiser, of Prudential Long Island Realty, estimates that houses
under $200,000 make up 55 percent of his company's business. A
well-known local company, Cook Pony Farm Real Estate, currently has
318 houses under $250,000 listed on its computer.
</P>
<P>
   Even Newbold of Sotheby's was surprised when he checked his own
exclusive listings. ``Well, I'm amazed,'' he said. ``We have 23!''
</P>
<P>
   The unmentionables are scattered throughout the East End of Long
Island: in Bridgehampton, in Amagansett, on Shelter Island, in Sag
Harbor and Southampton and East Hampton and in the section of East
Hampton known as Northwest _ the ``hot new area,'' one agent said,
``because there's nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But what does a buyer really get for $150,000? Or $200,000? Are
there better bargains in one town than in another?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, this reporter visited two dozen properties under
$250,000 _ and reviewed dozens more listings _ that were either for
sale or had just sold or gone into contract in that spit of land
known as the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and a word of warning: Don't expect brokers to fall all over
themselves to show you these properties. As Diane Saatchi of
Dayton-Halstead Real Estate said: ``Around here, everybody's such a
snob. Agents would rather go to cocktail parties and say they just
sold a $2 million house than 10 $200,000 houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the East End locales, Bridgehampton is the toughest in
which to find a bargain: most of the smaller houses were built for
the potato workers decades ago and have long since been torn down.
But a couple of listings sound promising. One, at 97 Maple Lane, is
offering a three-bedroom house, plus what the listing describes as
a ``legal cottage with one bedroom'' for $250,000. The 1987 house
is said to be adjacent to land owned by a church. What could
possibly be wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   It soon becomes excruciatingly clear: the house is actually in
the middle of an industrial park, hidden behind a long metal
warehouse building, right across the street from the Bridgehampton
railroad station. (``Close to transportation,'' Ms. Saatchi pointed
out.)
</P>
<P>
   The next house, at 41 Snake Hollow Road, the winding road to the
Hamptons Classic horse show, sounds irresistible: a 1910 cedar
cottage with two bedrooms and _ the magic words _ ``room for
pool.'' But that property, too, is a little, er, commercial. Not
only does it appear to be in a state of advanced deterioration _
its backyard shed is rusting corrugated tin _ but it overlooks the
back of a huge shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when depression is setting in _ pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   On the road between Bridgehampton and Sag Harbor, there's a
nondescript ranch house listed at $199,000. But here's the secret:
the back of the house slopes down to its own piece of Lily Pond. A
four-bedroom waterfront house for $199,000!
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the house is on a main road, but it's in a
residential neighborhood and far enough from the street that much
of the view of the road _ if not the sound _ could be blocked out
by rhododendrons or boxwood or a tall fence. And, anyway, you would
probably spend most of your time in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The house still has the fir floors, wide porcelain kitchen sink
and knotty-pine kitchen cabinets it was built with in 1954, said
Gioia diPaolo of Cook Pony Farm. On half an acre, there is room for
a pool, and there is 75 feet of pond frontage. ``It's just not the
second-home-buyer's dream; to be on a busy road,'' Ms. diPaolo
said.
</P>
<P>
   But things are looking up.
</P>
<P>
   In Sag Harbor, while there are nowhere near as many bargain
houses as there were a couple of years ago, there are still plenty.
Sag Harbor, always known for its mid-19th-century homes and its
Nantucket-like feel, has seen a real-estate boom in the last few
years, especially in the old ``fixer-uppers'' that might once have
fallen into the under-$200,000 class. Those fixer-uppers have now
been fixed up and are going for close to half a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But a two-story Victorian town house with a terrific location is
still on the market; right in town, at 13 Elizabeth St., and the
price is right: $189,000. But the street isn't as pretty as others
nearby, and a number of houses on the street need the same kind of
complete renovation this one does. Yet there is that front porch
and the rear deck, and the flower garden. And if Sag Harbor is
really booming, how long will it be before the other houses on the
street are restored?
</P>
<P>
   (If you're looking at wrecks, experts say to buy them in
neighborhoods with at least a smattering of more expensive houses _
that way, you'll get your renovation money back if you sell.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond a Getty station, across from a town park, there is a
Victorian cottage that had once been adorable: the Wreck of the
Day. The house, set back from the road, cries out for everything;
even the floors look as if they need propping up. Still, the deep
backyard, with its pergola, has potential. But $225,000? On the
main road?
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the Hamptons houses under $250,000 are in East
Hampton, and a large percentage of those are in what is called the
Springs, the neighborhood north of the village and east of Three
Mile Harbor. ``There's a prejudice against the Springs,'' Elisabeth
Mills of Dayton-Halstead said, referring to the raffishness of the
area _ the sense that this is where the locals live year-round.
``But this is where you can get the most house for your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by what is for sale this week, she is right. There is a
white postmodern house with an in-ground vinyl pool (``You're not
going to get Gunite for less than $350,000,'' Ms. Mills said) on a
side street; the price has just been reduced to $235,000. Because
of its pool, the agent estimated that the house would rent for at
least $18,000 for the season, which means that the rental income
might carry the mortgage, the goal for many Hamptons second-home
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest section of East Hampton (between Three Mile
Harbor and Northwest Harbor), two out of the dozens of listings
bear mentioning. One, a barnlike, little L-shaped two-bedroom, is
on a half-acre parcel of rolling woods, a short drive from its
neighborhood association's beach. Despite its $167,500 asking
price, the house has been on the market for years, local brokers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? The kitchen is downstairs and _ worse _ it's
connected to the living room by a metal spiral staircase (spiral
staircases, whether in a Manhattan duplex or a Hamptons barn, are a
no-no). But it appears that the staircase might be replaced by a
regular wooden one by knocking through to the storage space beyond.
(Please, check with a structural engineer.)
</P>
<P>
   In general, experts caution would-be buyers to investigate the
town ordinances before they count on making changes. ``Maybe you
can put on another story and see the water,'' said Frank Newbold of
Sotheby's, ``but make sure you're not too close to the property
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, just a bike ride from Three Mile Harbor, is the only one
of the 23 listings the Sotheby's office would part with for this
article: a spick-and-span, $235,000, three-bedroom gray cottage
with a fireplace on a one-acre parcel of land (which, for this part
of the Hamptons, means there is an extra building lot that can be
split off or retained for privacy).
</P>
<P>
   In Amagansett, in Barnes Landing, not far from the water, an
architect-designed, one-bedroom saltbox on a quarter-acre just went
into contract for close to its $189,000 asking price. The
description doesn't do the house justice: the living room has beams
and stone floors, and even though the site is small, agents said
that town ordinances would allow the new buyers to enlarge the
house, within certain limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this house is gone, another one down the street is
still for sale, but it doesn't have the charm of the littler one.
For one thing, it needs a good paint job _ the lines of the
joint-compound tape can be seen through the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Southampton, several houses under $250,000 are for sale
north of the Montauk Highway, a location considered less valuable
than the south-of-the-highway ``Gold Coast.'' An immaculate,
gray-shingle bungalow ($215,000) sits in a subdivision with the
aura of 1950s suburbia; the lack of trees is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a tiny, newly shingled bungalow on a perfect piece
of land on a quiet street ($185,000) and, finally, what seems like
the buy of the century: a ranch house on the top of a ridge, on a
full three-quarters of an acre _ a house that sold Tuesday for
$132,500.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there's a bit of a problem: in the distance, wrecked cars
are piled on top of one another. Through the tree trunks, you can
see a junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Orton, of Cook Pony Farm, didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, with care, ``but when the leaves are out in
the summer, you can't see it at all.''

CYBERNAVIGATION: JOYSTICK, MOUSE AND KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Long ago, in a magical land called the Crystal Kingdom,
lived a good wizard. Behind the walls of his Crystal Castle, the
wizard used magic gloves to produce strange potions and magical
spells. One day the wizard accidentally mixed the wrong potions and
__ KA-BOOM! A huge explosion sent the magic gloves flying, and
turned the wizard to stone! One of the magic gloves flew out a
turret window and landed safely on the ground. The other glove
wasn't so lucky. It landed in a cauldron of pure evil!''
</P>
<P>
   _ From the Glover Manual(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about interface design. It's a story about game
consoles and personal computers, and how the innovations of the
former highlight shortcomings of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Glover is a Nintendo cartridge. It is also published as a
CD-ROM. Both contain the same cinematic introduction. The good
glove flies out the window, lands on the ground and looks up in
horror as the castle's seven crystals (the life force of the
kingdom) pop off their turrets and begin to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they're about to shatter, the glove casts a spell,
turning them into something tougher: rubber beach balls. Thus
transformed, the crystals hit the ground and bounce rather than
break. Unfortunately, six of them bounce into different parts of
the kingdom and must be retrieved to restore the castle and bring
the wizard back to life.
</P>
<P>
   So the story is an archetypal quest _ a scavenger hunt about
redemption. The hero is a magic glove that looks like the Hamburger
Helper mascot. Sometimes he runs, walks or tiptoes, and his two
middle fingers become legs.
</P>
<P>
   And he sometimes turns into a hand that can roll, lob or dribble
a beach ball, and his arms and legs become fingers. (In either
case, his eyes blink at you expectantly from the back of the
glove.)
</P>
<P>
   Alone, Glover can jump, turn cartwheels and crawl on his belly
(palm?). But once he finds the beach ball hidden in every level, he
has an all-purpose object to manipulate (throw at a target, bounce
up stairs, use as a flotation device _ it slices, it dices).
</P>
<P>
   He can also transform the rubber beach ball into a bowling ball,
a magnetic ball bearing or its original crystal form, each of which
comes in handy, depending on the situation. Run into a glass window
and the beach ball does nothing. Heave a bowling ball toward it
(smash!), and it does nicely.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ingenious control system, particularly on the Nintendo
console, with its analog joystick that reads angle and direction,
allowing more subtle control. The joystick lets you fine-tune your
position, but it also lends degrees and gradations to your
movement. If you tilt the stick slightly forward, you're walking.
Tilt it all the way forward, and you're running.
</P>
<P>
   For subtlety, nothing beats an analog controller, be it a
joystick, steering wheel, tuning knob or volume dial. Shifting your
hands a millimeter to the left or the right, and you can squeeze a
two-ton hunk of glass and steel into a tight parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Nudging a dial imperceptibly in either direction, you can find
the perfect sound level. In digital space, analog control makes you
nimble and flexible and comfortable in your virtual skin.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with a keyboard, which is entirely digital. You
can move with arrow keys, but only at a uniform speed. You can
perform the same maneuvers with Alt and Shift as you can with
Nintendo control buttons, but the left middle and ring fingers on a
keyboard just don't respond like index fingers and thumbs wrapped
around a console controller. If Glover truly reflected the PC game
experience, he would be a mitten.
</P>
<P>
   But this frustration is typical of computer software, as opposed
to the software that runs on game consoles or in wired-to-the-gills
home theaters. The standard hardware interface for a home computer
is a 19th-century technology designed for alphanumeric data entry,
not for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of a mouse only half-solves the problem because all
you can really do with a mouse is draw on a flat surface and
shuffle paper in fancy ways, which starts to seem inadequate as our
information becomes less and less flat.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of digital media, cutting-edge designers don't talk
about pages. They're not interested in flat, static surfaces. They
talk about landscapes. They talk about information the way joystick
jockeys talk about a video game, in terms of volume and movement.
And that's great.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only great if you have an input device that lets you
fly, and the keyboard remains firmly grounded. There are 107 keys
on a standard computer keyboard. That makes it the centipede of
hardware interfaces. By the same token, a computer mouse, with its
two-dimensional flexibility, would be something like a snake.
</P>
<P>
   If digital media is a landscape, then computer input devices
allow people to crawl, slither and walk across it. They are
flatland devices for covering a vast ground. Remote controls allow
people to swim in it _ in a puddle of information on one audio CD
or the tidal pool of network television or the inland sea of 500
cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   And game devices are what allow people to fly, swooping down to
nab a quick tidbit of information or lingering in upward spirals
for hours over a thermal updraft of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   When the fabled convergence comes about _ when televisions and
PCs and consoles all melt together and their contents blur at the
edges _ our choices about how to experience media may boil down to
our preferred means of locomotion: the keyboard, the remote control
or the joystick.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will walk. Some will prefer to swim. And the ones
who have been playing video games all their lives? They'll probably
plug joysticks into their information appliances in 2006 and fly
right off the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the video game, Glover returns to the castle, puts
the last crystal in place, brings the wizard back to life and hops
onto the magician's right hand. Summoning the evil glove, who
glowers and resists, Glover restores his demonic counterpart to
goodness and health. And they all live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Until the wizard makes his next explosive mistake.

 &HT;    AARP OPENS DRIVE AGAINST MEDICARE FRAUD
 &HT;    With MEDICARE-FRAUD-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AARP and the federal government Wednesday launched
a drive to recruit and train thousands of retired volunteers to
help detect Medicare overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although reducing fraud, waste and abuse will not cure all
Medicare's financial problems, it is an essential first step in
keeping the system solvent in the long term,'' said Joe Perkins,
president of the AARP, formerly known as the American Association
of Retired Persons. About half of its 33 million members are 65 or
older, which qualifies them for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care cheats should be on notice that we should use
every appropriate tool to combat Medicare fraud and abuse,'' said
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In a new national poll of 2,000 adults released by the AARP, 83
percent said health care fraud is widespread, and 86 percent said
that if they knew more about health care fraud, they would be more
inclined to report it.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians' organizations objected that encouraging
patients to look for mistakes or fraud in their medical bills could
damage the bond between doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Hospital Association and the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association endorsed the AARP's $500,000 initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's initial sessions in 31 cities started with a
satellite-linked briefing by Reno and officials of the AARP, the
FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually asking you to be the eyes and ears of the
Medicare program,'' HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Using methods developed by U.S. Administration on Aging as it
trained 10,000 volunteers in pilot programs, the retirees were
taught how to double-check their Medicare bills and how to identify
common Medicare scams.
</P>
<P>
   They were told to ask their doctor, hospital, nursing home or
other provider about any item they don't understand. If still
unsatisfied, they were asked to report questionable items to the
Medicare contractor whose phone number is on the Medicare statement
and to report likely fraud on the the toll-free Medicare Fraud
Hotline at 1-800-HHS-TIPS (1-800-447-8477).
</P>
<P>
   Participants received baseball caps and magnifying glasses as
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending out patients to fight Medicare fraud with little more
than a baseball cap, magnifying glass and an 800 number trivializes
real fraud and creates an adversarial tone in every
physician-patient encounter,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a Texas
physician who is president of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the magnifying glasses and caps ``obviously bring
visibility to the program, but it's what's in people's heads, and
knowing how to read the bill, that would be very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (Dickey) yesterday and reassured her that we want
Medicare recipients to have enough training to review their bills,
but we also want those bills to be straightforward enough,''
Shalala said. ``Part of the campaign over the next couple of years
is going to be to simplify the billing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her department's efforts to simplify the more than 100,000 pages
of Medicare billing rules have been bogged down by the need to
divert money and manpower to solving Medicare's problems with the
Y2K bug. Otherwise, next year that programming glitch could plague
the network of computers used by the government and contractors to
handle nearly 1 billion Medicare bills annually.
</P>
<P>
   But some progress from changes encouraged and funded by Congress
and President Clinton are already apparent, according to June Gibbs
Brown, the inspector general who discovered that in 1996, 14
percent of the payments in the ``fee for service'' portion of
Medicare were unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, there has been a dramatic drop in these payments
which should not have been made,'' she said at the Miami session.
``That is down to 7.1 percent, but it also means we're still
misspending about $12.6 billion in that part of the program
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   She was unable to separate the portion due to waste or mistakes
from the part due to fraud or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons, said the AARP program would make
it harder for a doctor to trust his patient ``instead of worrying
that he's a government-anointed deputy, a paid informant, driven by
a profit motive to entrap him and looking to collect a bounty on
the back of a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Reno said rewards to informants ``are a different
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said, ``Health care professionals themselves check their
bills and make sure they aren't paying for something they shouldn't
be paying for.''

WILL THE 2000 BUG GOBBLE THE VEGGIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Johns, the president of the Territorial Seed Co., has no
idea whether the millennium bug, a k a Y2K, is ``overblown fiction
or a real problem.'' But that did not stop him from warning about
possible Y2K disruptions in the catalog that Territorial recently
mailed to 650,000 gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog, Johns reminded his customers of the alarm that
some gardeners felt last year after the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine announced that broccoli sprouts contain high levels of
sulforaphane, a cancer-fighting compound. He said the announcement
set off such a frenzy that worldwide supplies of open-pollinated
varieties of broccoli seed that reproduce similar plants generation
after generation were wiped out in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all learn from that experience,'' Johns concluded.
``If in fact the millennium computer bug turns out to be real, I
truly believe the world's seed supply available to home gardeners
will be gone just as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors say Johns is sowing Y2K hype, but there is no
denying that he is harvesting a once-in-a-lifetime marketing
opportunity. Polls reveal that tens of millions of Y2K-leery
Americans fear that computers could break down frequently enough
during the transition to the year 2000 to cause big disruptions in
the global economy. Hard-core alarmists fear there will be limited
supplies of seed for next year's crops. But the ranks of the
worried also include a larger group of gardeners who plan to grow
vegetables this year as a hedge against breakdowns in deliveries of
food to stores.
</P>
<P>
   Territorial's response is the $99.50 Millennium Victory Garden,
a mix of 47 vegetable seeds. It is the most popular item in the new
catalog, Johns said, and on a pace to become the most popular
offering in the company's 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
   To some seed dealers, Territorial's assertions are farfetched at
best. Lana Baker, the vegetable seed specialist at Molbak's Seattle
Garden Center in Washington, which claims to stock the largest
variety of vegetable seeds of any retailer in the world, said
Molbak's never had a problem getting the type of broccoli seed that
Johns contends was wiped out. Besides, she said, ``it's extreme to
suggest that people will run out of seed because of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Molbak's sales are up, too, as are those of
industry giants like W. Atlee Burpee in Warminster, Pa. Some
vendors, like Ferry-Morse Seed Co. in Fulton, Ky., say that sales
have not yet jumped significantly but that salespeople in the field
are reporting requests from retailers to be ready to ship extra
seed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought people would plant more vegetables as a hedge
against the year 2000, but we are definitely seeing a millennium
effect,'' said Donald Zeidler, direct marketing manager at Burpee.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the home-grown food chain are also feeling the
effects. The Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc, Wis., a maker
of pressurized home-canning equipment, has seen its sales double in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the demand lasts, vegetable gardening may reverse a long-term
decline. Just over 20 percent of American households grew
vegetables in 1997, according to the National Gardening Association
in Burlington, Vt. That's down from 49 percent in 1975, the
post-World War II peak, when many Americans were growing food in
response to inflation in food prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although flower gardening remains popular, more and more growers
of edible gardens have thrown in their trowels. As more homemakers
moved into the job market and wide varieties of relatively
inexpensive vegetables became available year round, vegetable
gardeners found it hard to justify the investment _ until the year
2000 threat arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had become spoiled shopping at the local supermarket,''
said Don Landis, 50, an airline cargo handler who lives in suburban
Seattle. But concerns over the year 2000 bug convinced him and his
wife to return to backyard vegetable gardening for the first time
in 10 years. ``If this turns out to be a non-event,'' he said,
``the food banks will all be overflowing and we'll have a good
story to tell our grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   In Escondido, Calif., Patrick D'Acre, 43, a technology
consultant, plans to turn a steep hillside behind his home into a
terraced fruit-tree orchard and vegetable garden and to chronicle
its development on his Web site, www.y2kupdatereport.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be therapeutic, practical and timely,'' said D'Acre,
who describes himself as an on-again, off-again gardener.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also newcomers. ``We get people every day who've
never gardened before,'' said Johns, who included enough seed in
the Victory Garden packages to build in some redundancy for
beginners' inevitable failures. ``We're trying to reach people who
may not normally be gardeners.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds that are most in demand are open-pollinated varieties,
as opposed to commercial hybrids, and especially the ``heirloom''
plants that have been passed over the garden fence for generations.
Open-pollinated plants _ those pollinated by natural means, like
visits by insects _ have been ignored by most commercial growers
and many gardeners because they are often more susceptible to
insects or disease than commercial hybrids and, unless conditions
are perfect, may not produce as much food. In some crops, like
tomatoes, the fruits of the open-pollinated plants are tastier than
the hybrids but not firm enough to be shipped long distances and
handled in stores.
</P>
<P>
   What appeals to millennium bug alarmists, though, is that seed
saved from one year's crop of open-pollinated plants will produce
very similar plants in future generations. Seeds saved from
commercial hybrids rarely produce plants as productive or vigorous
as the parent, so gardeners must buy new hybrid seed each year.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to heirloom seed sales than Y2K. They have long
been favored by gardeners for their taste and for the stories
linked with their history. Now, they are also attracting those who
are concerned about the spread of genetic engineering into the food
chain and the concentration of control over hybrid seeds in fewer
and fewer corporations. The heirloom movement is so strong that
1,900 of the 7,313 varieties available were added in just the last
four years, according to the Seed Savers Exchange, a nonprofit
group in Decorah, Iowa, dedicated to preserving seed diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, seed marketers say there is no doubt that the possibility
of computer disruptions next year is increasing interest in such
seeds and food gardening in general. As Ms. Baker explained,
``Everybody's trying to be a little more prepared without looking
like the crazies running into the woods with guns.''

VIRTUAL STOCKS LURE REAL MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Hollywood and the Internet to produce a virtual
stock market of fake stocks and fake money with such a fanatic
following that players are offering hundreds of real dollars to buy
a make-believe portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   First, the game. Hollywood Stock Exchange (www.hsx.com) was
founded in 1996 by two Wall Street veterans and movie buffs, Max
Keiser and Michael Burns. Today, nearly 200,000 HSX traders
speculate on box-office returns for current and forthcoming films
by trading Movie Stocks on the site.
</P>
<P>
   HSX keeps a real-time ticker of Movie Stock prices, which are
determined by the gross box-office revenue a film earns in its
first four weeks in United States theaters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one HSX share of the forthcoming ``Star Wars''
prequel from George Lucas currently trades for roughly H$315,
meaning that players expect the film to gross $315 million in its
first month. ``Shakespeare in Love'' earned a little more than $46
million in its first four weeks, paying Movie Stock holders H$46.66
per share. A star player, Curtis Edmonds, got in when the film was
valued at only H$1.
</P>
<P>
   It was Edmonds who auctioned off his portfolio on Ebay
(www.ebay.com), the Internet auction site. The high bid for his
imaginary portfolio, worth $136 million in HSX dollars, was $1,050
in real dollars after a seven-day auction last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of an experiment to see if there was a real market
out there for Hollywood Dollars,'' said Edmonds, a lawyer for the
State of Texas and an amateur film reviewer. He said that after a
year of HSX trading, he was retiring from it because it had become
too easy.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio was one of the largest in HSX history when it was
put up for sale, and it has earned a certain measure of fame for
Edmonds, known as Blueduck on the HSX site and also on a related
site, the Hollywood Stock Brokerage and Resource site
(www.hsbr.org), a fan site for HSX players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy when it was going for $100,'' Edmonds said. ``I
wouldn't have imagined anyone would want to pay over a thousand.''
Although Edmonds has yet to collect from the high bidder, he is
confident that his HSX habit will turn into real money because two
other E-bay bidders also eclipsed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the bids on the portfolio skyrocketed last week, at least
nine other HSX high rollers put their portfolios on the Ebay
auction block. But even though some of those portfolios eclipse
Blueduck's in HSX value, none have garnered anywhere near $1,050,
which only adds to the absurdity of it all.
</P>
<P>
   A senior analyst for Jupiter Communications, Adam Schoenfeld,
links the portfolio's auction price to the inflated valuation of
Internet stocks: ``This is a pretend market mimicking the mania of
real markets. Caveat emptor.''
</P>
<P>
   John Riffe, a librarian in Billings, Mont., who is an HSX
trader, was an early bidder on the Blueduck portfolio. He said:
``It's for the prestige. It's like a Cadillac versus a Chevrolet _
they'll both get you to the same place, but the Blueduck just gets
you there in nicer style.''
</P>
<P>
   Riffe said he would have paid up to $200 for Edmonds' account
but that he had no interest in the other HSX portfolios on Ebay.

   Rick Morrison arrived at his interview at Carnegie Mellon
University armed with more than just his charm and a rehearsed
spiel for admissions officers. A high school senior from central
New Jersey, he also took an interactive, graphics-laden multimedia
portfolio that highlights his academic record, activities and
creative writing and is saved on a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more exciting and expressive than a few lines on a
traditional college application,'' said Morrison, 17, a student at
Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   His portfolio opens with a mini-submarine passing through a sea
of blue-green colored words and ending at a treasure chest which
contains the word ``dream.'' Clip-art graphics and new age
instrumental music follow as a backdrop to the portfolio's main
menu. Move the cursor to one of the subjects, click, and steel
doors open to the next level, with more detail and carefully
wrought graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Yourst, a senior at Vestal High School in upstate New York,
didn't send a CD with his applications to MIT, Princeton, Cornell
and Carnegie Mellon. Instead, he sent the Internet directions
(called a uniform resource locator, or URL) to a website for a
software company, Laserstars Technology (www.laserstars.com) that
he started when he was 15. While he considered creating a link to a
personal site, Yourst, now 18, also sent details about other
projects, including his high school's website
(www.vestal.stier.org/vhs), which he helped to design, and a
software program he created that helps scientists at Cornell
University analyze molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think including information about my site will certainly
differentiate me from other high school students, especially
because it shows the level of science and technology experience I
have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paper applications are still the main tool admissions officers
use to decide whether or not to accept a student. But additions
like these are part of the growing technological supplements that
frantic teenagers are either sending along with their college
applications, referring to in their essays or shipping out
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on for students to distinguish themselves from
the zillions of other kids who have glowing SAT scores and great
marks,'' said Peter Kovaric, a professor at UCLA who specializes in
educational technology.
</P>
<P>
   For years, applicants to theater, film and music programs
regularly shipped off tapes of their performances. And applicants
seeking spots at universities like MIT or Caltech have regularly
sent disks with their originally written computer programs. Now,
such electronic supplements are moving beyond the realm of
specialized programs to the general college applicant pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've just tipped the iceberg in terms of what's
possible and what students can do with this technology,'' said
Michael Steidel, director of admissions at Carnegie Mellon.
``Students are just learning how to exploit it to their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13,000 applications Carnegie Mellon has received this
year, about 100 have referred to websites and about a dozen
applicants have sent CDs with multimedia portfolios. Steidel said
the number of CDs and floppy computer disks arriving with
applications has decreased slightly over the last two years as web
site citations on applications have increased.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether this extra effort to grab an
admissions officer's attention pays off. ``The supplemental
materials can help distinguish one student from another, but in 99
percent of the applications they don't particularly help the
applicant,'' said Bette Johnson, associate director of admissions
at MIT, in a comment typical of the admissions officers' attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Added Kovaric: ``If they can't do library research or write a
clear paper, then all the animated gimmicks in the world aren't
going to change anything. But if they can write a compelling
personal statement and put together an interesting website, they
can set themselves apart from other students.''
</P>
<P>
   With official acceptance notices due out in April, it's too soon
to tell if Morrison's CD was a hit at Carnegie Mellon. ``I think
their reactions were very positive, even though they only saw a
small piece of it,'' Morrison said of admissions officers'
reactions to his disc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the CDs and websites are viewed only if
admissions workers have time. Normally they don't. Carnegie Mellon
skims most of the website referrals and CDs, Steidel said. Harvard
occasionally reviews the supplemental work, but normally does so
only once the students have passed the high academic hurdles, said
Marlyne McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard and
Radcliffe colleges. MIT's admissions officers sometimes look at the
website referrals they receive, Ms. Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do care what students are doing,'' said Erika Jonieta, an
MIT admissions officer who reviews most of the website referrals.
``But I see one in five that really make a difference in a
student's application.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what the admissions officers say, students believe
their electronic portfolios will pay off. Hunterdon Central High
School students point to four previous classmates who used CD
multimedia portfolios with their applications last year, which are
archived at the school's website (www.hcrhs.hunterdon.k12.nj.us).
One received a full scholarship to Rider University and a job
working with technology, in part because of his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   While Carl Storrs, 18, a senior at Walnut Hills High School in
Cincinnati, can't cite previous classmates with websites, he thinks
admissions officers will be impressed with his website
(http://meowing.ccm.uc.edu/carl), which explains his after-school
work in electronic computer music at a program at the Cincinnati
College's Conservatory of Music and an internship researching
pupillary dilation.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Cortina of Hunterdon Central High seized Harvard's
invitation to submit additional material for her application. She
applied for early admission and was deferred to the general
applicant pool. She finished her interactive multimedia portfolio
earlier this month and mailed copies to Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Georgetown and Boston University with a letter from her teacher
explaining the portfolio and the CD portfolio project at Hunterdon
Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just saying I can sing, I can write,'' said Ms.
Cortina, 17. ``It's saying `Look at the opportunities I've had with
technology. Look at the breadth of knowledge and capabilities. And
look, I can also sing and dance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio opens with a quick animation of shapes and colors
gliding across the screen, followed by a short video of Ms. Cortina
introducing her portfolio. On the next page, mauve and blue hues
accent the main menu of choices: Academics; Activities; Writing, a
description of her high school. The academics section includes her
transcript, including awards and standardized test scores. The
writing page highlights three poems she wrote and interpreted
through multimedia presentations set to music and graphics. She is
proudest of the 30-second digitized video clip of her three theater
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all say that if it's not something that catches their
eye, don't bother, `` she said of admissions counselors. ``But I
think this is eye-catching with some substance to who I am and what
I've done.''

SUPPLE CURVES FROM A MASTER OF MOHAGANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Va., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By LIZ SEYMOUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILTON, N.C. _ Nearly 10 years after a brush fire reduced the
historic Union Tavern to a roofless shell, a determined committee
is slowly raising money to repair it and convert it into a museum
devoted to Thomas Day, a black cabinetmaker who worked here before
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Born free in Virginia in 1801, Day walked a precarious line all
his life. Despite laws limiting the rights of free blacks, he
established a successful business in North Carolina, owned stock in
a local bank, trained white apprentices (and owned black slaves,
himself), and numbered among his customers North Carolina's most
prominent citizens, including the governor, David S. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Today, worshipers at the Milton Presbyterian Church, a snug
brick building that dates to 1837, still sit in pews designed and
constructed by Day, who according to local legend donated them on
the condition that he and his family be allowed to sit downstairs
with the white parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1830, when he married a free black woman from Virginia, the
North Carolina General Assembly voted to make an exception to its
law that no free blacks be allowed to take up residence in the
state. She joined Day here in Milton, a small town on the Virginia
line, and they had three children, whom they sent to school in
Wilbraham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1848, Day purchased the Union Tavern, a Federal-style
building erected in 1815, and converted the upstairs into a living
space and the downstairs into a showroom, with a workshop out back.
Though Day drew inspiration in his cabinetry from contemporary
pattern books, his work has a distinct personality that scholars
have learned to recognize, even in unsigned pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Often massive in scale and decorated with exaggerated ``S''
curves, bulbous turnings and exuberant cutouts, Day's wardrobes,
sideboards, beds, chairs and secretaries have a forthright dignity
that is hard to ignore. Day's architectural carvings, especially
his sinuous newel posts and ornamental mantels, border on folk
sculpture. The most famous mantel, in a home near here, is
decorated with two frowning mahogany faces.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1850s, however, increasingly restrictive legislation
on the activities of blacks in the state, combined with a national
financial panic, undermined Day's business. He died bankrupt in
1860 or 1861, though a son of his followed him into the cabinetry
business.
</P>
<P>
   There are collectors, particularly local figures, who have
always prized Day's work. But it was a 1994 children's book,
``Master of Mahogany: Tom Day, Free Black Cabinetmaker'' (Scribner,
$15.95), by Mary E. Lyons, that drew larger attention to the man. A
furniture company, Craftique, learned about Day's work through the
book, and in 1996 it licensed reproductions of some of the 30 Day
pieces owned by the North Carolina Museum of History, in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Craftique owns the copyright to the Thomas Day name (and pays a
small royalty to the tavern in Milton, to support the renovation);
subsequent reproductions, like the ones that Derrick Joshua Beard
is making, are sold under another name, in this case, the Sankofa
North Carolina Heritage Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Milton, a tiny town of 200, believe that the
restoration of Day's old showroom and workshop in the Union Tavern
will complete the renewal of interest in his life. Through eggnog
socials, bingo parties and pancake breakfasts _ and state and
private grants _ the town has raised $500,000 to stabilize the
tavern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much more it's going to take'' to finish the
restoration, said Marian Thomas, the president of the Thomas Day
House/Union Tavern Restoration group, which is overseeing the
project. The committee's hope is that a national celebrity may
become involved in the project. Those interested in joining the
group, for a $10 annual fee, can reach her at Box 1996, Milton,
N.C. 27305-1996; telephone (336) 234-7215.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year that you wait everything gets more expensive,'' Mrs.
Thomas said, sitting in a wing chair in the living room of her
209-year-old house, near a secretary that she believes is by Thomas
Day. ``But we just keep moving forward.''

CAMPAIGN SPENDING ROBS VOTERS OF INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Money. Money. Money. That is the name of the game
in American politics, where almost any campaign for public office
is likely to cost candidates and their parties more than a million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If the prize is the Democratic or Republican presidential
nomination, a White House hopeful must be ready to solicit and then
spend at least $20 million before he or she ever has the
opportunity to square off against the nominee of the opposing
party.
</P>
<P>
   The love of money may be the root of all evil, as the Bible
teaches us, but the use of money, as a powerful California state
treasurer named Jesse Unruh once said, is the mother's milk of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Long before anyone ever heard of Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton
was the target of investigators who believe he either broke or
badly bent the congressionally decreed rules that govern the ways
in which politicians can garner and spend campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of converting the Lincoln bedroom into a
celebrated sleep-over salon for individuals who filled Democratic
coffers. He was charged, as was his 1996 GOP opponent, Bob Dole,
with turning so-called soft money into hard money by fielding
television commercials that argued strongly for the election of a
candidate. Soft money was supposed to fund only institutional ads
that supported an issue or a party and not an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's running mate, Al Gore, was charged by his opponents
with making fund-raising telephone calls from his White House
office in violation of a law passed in 1883 when Chester A. Arthur
was president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also stirred up controversy when he denied being aware that
his appearance at a Buddhist temple in California was actually a
fund-raising excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno declined to name an independent
counsel to probe the accusations against Clinton and Gore.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr looked into some of them but so
far has not formally accused the president or vice president of
wrongdoing. Three committees of Congress have launched
well-publicized inquiries into their activities, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the use of money in political campaigns remains an
explosive and often nasty issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Congressional leaders had an opportunity last year to
bring some fairness and decency to the matter by passing a
bipartisan reform bill, but they refused to do so because the
legislation's strictures would cost the GOP money.
</P>
<P>
   So what has been the upshot? The barons of the AFL-CIO announced
two weeks ago that they will spend $46 million to help elect a
Democratic Congress in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., withdrew his
bid for election to a fourth term because he does not want to spend
the next two years raising campaign funds. Although Lautenberg, 75,
is independently wealthy, he figured he would have to collect at
least $12 million to run a successful campaign for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad that Lautenberg's career is ending because he no longer
wants to be involved in the tawdry exercise of seeking funds from
people who have a greedy vested interest in parceling out dollars
to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the gun lobby, the tobacco companies, the
petroleum industry or the labor unions, contributors give money in
exchange for favors. That fact of political life was demonstrated
last year when legislation to levy a tax on tobacco as a means of
curtailing teenage smoking was defeated by GOP leaders on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Money does not, of course, guarantee candidates' victory at the
polls. But lack of money can guarantee their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, we have seen such presidential hopefuls as
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, publisher Steve Forbes and former Delaware
Gov. Pete duPont, all of whom were armed with millions of dollars,
go down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But the men who defeated them in the Republican primaries, Dole
and George Bush, also entered the battle laden with money.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, campaigns have become more expensive
and candidates more beholden to special interests, whose objectives
often run counter to initiatives that benefit the people.
</P>
<P>
   Television has made it possible for voters to see the candidates
in informal settings dealing with major issues. But television also
has made it imperative that candidates raise and spend millions
more than they once did.
</P>
<P>
   American voters may not be upset by the manner in which big
bucks decide elections and policies, but they should be.
</P>
<P>
   As our system stands now, it simply encourages the irresponsible
use of money to influence the people's business.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill once said: ``Politics are almost as exciting
as war, and quite as dangerous. In war you can only be killed once,
but in politics many times.'' Had he lived in America in the 1990s,
he might also have noted that politics is almost as expensive as
war.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is not just in dollars; it also is in an erosion of the
people's influence and authority.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Noel C. Culberson has long since acceded to
a Faustian bargain offered by marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers subsidize his television shows, newspaper
subscription and favorite sports teams, and in exchange, Culberson
concedes them a bit of his subconscious to soak up the commercial
messages directed at him.
</P>
<P>
   So when a company recently announced that it would offer free
personal computers to people willing to accept a constant display
of advertising in the right margin of the computer screen,
Culberson, 31, a financial analyst, jumped in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can zone out ads from years of practice from watching
television and ignoring e-mails,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That seems of little comfort to privacy advocates and consumer
groups who are concerned about what they see as an intrusive level
of consumer monitoring required to sell the advertising needed to
cover operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Culberson's main concern is that there are not
enough free computers to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Since Free-PC, the aptly named company behind the concept,
announced on Feb. 8 that it would give away 10,000 computers, more
than one million people have signed up for the offer. To qualify,
potential recipients have to answer several dozen questions that
will determine how desirable they are to potential advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The questions ask for a telephone number, street address, e-mail
address, birth date, marital status, sex and household income.
There are also questions about hobbies and the magazines and
consumer electronics in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., will choose the
10,000 winners of low-end Compaq computers, based on who best fits
the demographic profiles that advertisers are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6,000 schools have signed up for a similar program
offered by Zap Me, of San Ramon, Calif. Last October, the company
announced that it would give schools 15 computers with
satellite-based Internet connections. The catch: the computers
display advertising in the left-hand corner of the monitor. So far,
Zap Me has given computers to 55 schools in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of free computers represents an evolution from older
offerings of free, advertising-subsidized e-mail and Internet
access. The companies offering such services have generally
struggled, spending millions to build a subscriber base large
enough to attract enough advertisers to offset their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those offering free computers say the enthusiastic response
proves that this business model's time has come and can be
profitable _ particularly with the rapid price drops of computer
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the companies promoting free PCs say they will give
advertisers an unprecedented ability to target ads toward likely
customers, based on their demographics and Web-surfing patterns. In
fact, that is pretty much Free-PCs only reason for existing.
</P>
<P>
   When students log onto one of the free Zap Me computers, the
system will know each one's grade level, sex and Zip code. The
computer will then dish out age and sex-appropriate advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far, neither Free-PC nor Zap Me has announced any deals
with advertisers. While waiting for sponsors to sign on, Zap Mes
computers have been displaying advertisements from some of its
partners, including Microsoft and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether advertisers will sign on is just one of
the lingering questions about a concept that could forever change
the relationship between PC users and their computers.
</P>
<P>
   The main worry of privacy advocates is the monitoring of
information that will allow the advertising to be targeted. They
warn that recipients of free PCs must be aware that commercial
dossiers could track their buying and surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   While both Zap Me and Free-PC promise not to disclose personal
information about any specific user, such information can still
become public through a lawsuit or if the company is ever sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you go to auction sites? What kind of research do you do?
Do you like sex? Do you explore prescription drugs?'' asked Evan
Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a newsletter based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible profile of you in the hands of strangers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters, an organization that
opposes intrusive marketing, put it more bluntly: ``You're letting
a surveillance device into your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns that personal data could be subpoenaed,
Steve Chadima, a spokesman for Free-PC, said that seemed unlikely
and that the company would fight any such attempt. He stopped
short, though, of giving an ironclad assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to go to jail for it,'' he said. ``But we
certainly would do everything in our power not to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadima said privacy concerns had not stopped people from
signing up. ``It doesn't seem to be an issue, given how many people
have responded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some consumers are wavering. Even Culberson said that
before he would actually accept a free computer _ if offered one _
he would have to know that it would not monitor his every mouse
click.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ted Maddock, technology coordinator for Mount Diablo
High School in Concord, Calif., said he did not object to the Zap
Me advertisements, targeted or otherwise. Mount Diablo was among
the first to get the Zap Me computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts have balked at the Zap Me offering,
arguing that their mission is to educate, not act as an advertising
conduit. Their objections recall similar ones over advertising on
Channel One, which has given free televisions to more than 12,000
schools nationwide in return for broadcasting programs and
commercials to students.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddock said Zap Me's advertising was no worse than banner
advertisements that students would have to see anyway when they
surfed the Net. Besides, he added, his school could not otherwise
afford the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone offered us $70,000 worth of computers,'' Maddock said.
``It's been working well.''

<P>
   The United States, as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, will be the
first, last and only global superpower.
</P>
<P>
   American officials quite naturally tend to act as if the world
were unipolar. They boast of American power and American virtue,
hailing the United States as a benevolent hegemon. They lecture
other countries on the universal validity of American principles,
practices and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 G-7 summit in Denver, President Clinton boasted
about the success of the American economy as a model for others.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has called the United
States ``the indispensable nation'' and said that ``we stand tall
and hence see further than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement is true in the narrow sense that the United
States is an indispensable participant in any effort to tackle
major global problems. It is false in also implying that other
nations are dispensable _ the United States needs the cooperation
of some major countries in handling any issue _ and that American
indispensability is the source of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States was often able to impose its will on other
countries. That unipolar moment has passed. The two principal tools
of coercion that the United States now attempts to use are economic
sanctions and military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions work, however, only when other countries also support
them, and that is decreasingly the case. Hence, the United States
either applies them unilaterally to the detriment of its economic
interests and its relations with its allies, or it does not enforce
them, in which case they become symbols of American weakness.
</P>
<P>
   At relatively low cost, the United States can launch bombing or
cruise missile attacks against its enemies. By themselves, however,
such actions achieve little.
</P>
<P>
   More serious military interventions have to meet three
conditions: They have to be legitimated through some international
organization, such as the United Nations where they are subject to
Russian, Chinese or French veto; they also require the
participation of allied forces, which may or may not be
forthcoming; and they have to involve no American casualties and
virtually no ``collateral'' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States meets all three conditions, it risks
stirring up not only criticism at home but widespread political and
popular backlash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem peculiarly blind to the fact that often
the more the United States attacks a foreign leader, the more his
popularity soars among his countrymen who applaud him for standing
tall against the greatest power on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their
tenure in power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the
best way for a dictator of a small country to prolong his tenure in
power may be to provoke the United States into denouncing him as
the leader of a ``rogue regime'' and a threat to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress nor the public
is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of unilateral
global leadership. Some advocates of American leadership argue for
increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that is a
nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend
effort and resources to achieve American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   However much foreign policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the
United States lacks the domestic political base to create a
unipolar world. American leaders repeatedly make threats, promise
action and fail to deliver. The result is a foreign policy of
``rhetoric and retreat'' and a growing reputation as a ``hollow
hegemon.''
</P>
<P>
   In acting as if this were a unipolar world, the United States is
also becoming increasingly alone in the world. American leaders
constantly claim to be speaking on behalf of ``the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But whom do they have in mind? China? Russia? India? Pakistan?
Iran? The Arab world? The Association of Southeast Asian Nations?
Africa? Latin America? France? Do any of these countries or regions
see the United States as the spokesman for a community of which
they are a part?
</P>
<P>
   The community for which the United States speaks includes, at
best, its Anglo-Saxon cousins (Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand) on most issues, Germany and some smaller European
democracies on many issues, Israel on some Middle Eastern questions
and Japan on the implementation of U.N. resolutions. These are
important states, but they fall far short of being the global
international community.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, the United States has found itself
increasingly alone, with one or a few partners, opposing most of
the rest of the world's states and peoples. These issues include
U.N. dues; the land mines treaty; global warming; an international
war crimes tribunal; the Middle East; the use of force against Iraq
and Yugoslavia; and sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   On these and other issues, much of the international community
is on one side and the United States is on the other. The circle of
governments who see their interests coinciding with American
interests is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States regularly denounces various countries as
``rogue states,'' in the eyes of many countries it is becoming the
rogue superpower.
</P>
<P>
   If a unipolar world were unavoidable, many countries might
prefer the United States as the hegemon. But this is mostly because
it is distant from them and hence unlikely to attempt to acquire
any of their territory.
</P>
<P>
   American power is also valued by the secondary regional states
as a constraint on the dominance of other major regional states.
Benign hegemony, however, is in the eye of the hegemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reads about the world's desire for American leadership
only in the United States,'' one British diplomat observed.
``Everywhere else one reads about American arrogance and
unilateralism.''
</P>
<P>
   Political and intellectual leaders in most countries strongly
resist the prospect of a unipolar world and favor the emergence of
true multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Harvard conference, scholars reported that the elites
of countries comprising at least two-thirds of the world's people _
Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims and Africans _ see the
United States as the single greatest external threat to their
societies.
</P>
<P>
   They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace
to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.
They view the United States as intrusive, interventionist,
exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical and applying
double standards, engaging in what they label ``financial
imperialism'' and ``intellectual colonialism,'' with a foreign
policy driven overwhelmingly by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are to be expected. American leaders believe that
the world's business is their business. Other countries believe
that what happens in their part of the world is their business, not
America's, and quite explicitly respond.
</P>
<P>
   As Nelson Mandela said, his country rejects another state's
having ``the arrogance to tell us where we should go or which
countries should be our friends. ... We cannot accept that a state
assumes the role of the world's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bipolar world, many countries welcomed the United States as
their protector against the other superpower. In today's world, in
contrast, the world's only superpower is automatically a threat to
other major powers.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove Americans to stop acting and talking as if this
were a unipolar world. It is not. To deal with any major global
issue, the United States needs the cooperation of at least some
major powers. Unilateral sanctions and interventions are recipes
for foreign policy disasters.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders also should abandon the benign-hegemon illusion
that a natural congruity exists between their interests and values
and those of the rest of the world. It does not. At times, American
actions may promote public goods and serve more widely accepted
ends. But often they will not, in part because of the unique
moralistic component in American policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also simply because America is the only superpower,
and hence its interests necessarily differ from those of other
countries. This makes America unique _ but certainly not benign in
the eyes of those countries.

WHERE ALL THE LOST BAGS GO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (mk) 
 By TERRY McMANUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next time an airline tells you your bags have been hopelessly
lost, you may want to head for Scottsboro, Ala. That city is home
to the Unclaimed Baggage Center, a halfway house for AWOL
possessions. Or, if you want to save time, you can just get on the
center's Web site (www.unclaimedbaggage.com) and sample some of the
goods for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our customers and employees, it's a little like Christmas
every day,'' said Bryan Owens, 40, owner of the Unclaimed Baggage
Center. The company's Web site says it deals in ``lost treasures
from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the stock is clothing, but you can also find
sporting goods, computers, camera equipment, jewelry and
miscellaneous trinkets. Some of the more unusual items that have
turned up in Scottsboro include a six-carat diamond ring, a case of
ancient Egyptian artifacts and a set of signed Salvador Dali
prints, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines, Owens explained, sell bags and cargo by the pound
to Unclaimed Baggage with no knowledge of their contents; carry-on
effects are sold as is. (The airlines queried confirmed that their
companies sold lost baggage and cargo but would not identify the
buyers. For his part, Owens would not reveal his suppliers.)
</P>
<P>
   Brock Warner, a spokesman for Unclaimed Baggage, said the
company had no competitors because it had exclusive long-term
contracts with the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Owens said, only a tiny number of lost items ever
make their way to his block-long store in Alabama, which his father
founded in 1970. About 0.5 percent of bags are misrouted by the
airlines _ the problem worsens during the holidays _ but 98 percent
of the bags are claimed by customers within 48 hours, Owens said.
When you consider that 1 billion passengers check 2 billion bags
every year, Owens said, you begin to understand how stuff gets
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines search for the owners for up to 90 days but do not
open the luggage. After that, they take legal possession of the
articles, including that laptop you brought on board or that novel
you left at the gate, and quickly sell them to Owens. He, in turn,
ships them to Scottsboro or donates them to charity. Since last
October, Owens has also been moving this merchandise on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Unclaimed Baggage Center also occasionally auctions
exceptionally rare and expensive items, like the Egyptian
artifacts, through Christie's, Warner said. UBC has some of the
jewelry appraised before it is priced for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stocking about 2 million unique, never-seen-before items
in our store each year,'' Owens said. About 50 to 75 products are
sold online each week. Owens said in-store and Web buyers could
expect to pay 50 percent to 80 percent below retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a car CD player (new and still in its box) was
available at Unclaimed Baggage for $150 while a Chicago audio
dealer was asking $279 for the same unit. But a pair of Adidas
Universal running shoes recently offered on line for $51 was just
$9 less than what a Chicago Foot Locker store was charging.
</P>
<P>
   So would a purchaser feel a little creepy about buying unclaimed
baggage? Who was the shoes' previous owner, anyway? Don't all
people who lose baggage wish they could have it back? And for that
matter, who owned the grass skirt and coconut top that sold for $5
under the ``unique clothing'' category not long ago? And who bought
the Polish military helmet for $125? Couldn't the airlines just
give these items to charity and take a tax write-off rather than
selling them?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize that after 90 days, we've settled the
claim with the customer,'' said David Castelveter, a spokesman for
US Airways in Arlington, Va. He said he assumed that selling the
items ``is an attempt to recoup some of the costs of doing that,
though we're probably still losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airlines are liable for up to $1,250 per passenger for
luggage mishandled during domestic flights, but they are not liable
for lost carry-on possessions, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, business is brisk on the Unclaimed Baggage site,
which averages about 2,000 visits a day, Owens said. The traffic is
almost certainly encouraged by such helpful observations on the
Unclaimed Baggage site as the one about a someone buying a
``perfectly ordinary soap-on-a-rope'' only to find that it was
hollowed out and full of cash.
</P>
<P>
   And a woman recently found $2,000 in the lining of a suitcase
she bought, Warner said, adding, ``We can't check everything.'' Any
drugs found by Unclaimed Baggage are turned over to the Drug
Enforcement Agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's neat that they're selling these things and
they're not going to waste,'' said Leah Cruz of Tampa, Fla., who
has purchased several items from the site. ``It's still good
stuff.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are interested in unusual plants _ and helping out the
gene pool at the same time _ the following plant societies offer a
wide variety of seeds:
</P>
<P>
   THE AMERICAN HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY, based at River Farm in
Alexandria, Va., offers members a free seed-exchange program, which
draws from hundreds of annuals, perennials, woody plants,
vegetables and herbs. The $25 annual membership includes the
American Gardener magazine. Call (800) 777-7931; on the web:
www.ahs.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN STATE HEIRLOOM SEED SOCIETY, a nonprofit organization of
farmers and gardeners in Delaware, N.J., offers 1,000 varieties of
edible heirlooms in its 1999 catalog, like the genus Yellow, a
2-pound sweet, yellow tomato with red streaks. A $10 membership
includes reprints of old seed catalogs and the summer tomato
tasting. Member farmers receive seed free. For a catalog, write the
Society at P.O. Box 15, Valley Road, Delaware, NJ 07833.
</P>
<P>
   HEIRLOOM SEED PROJECT grows 90 varieties of vegetables, herbs,
flowers, fruits and field crops at its 100-acre farm at the Landis
Valley Museum in Lancaster, Pa., including Amish gnuttle bean,
black salsify, Hoffer lazy wife bean, Wren's egg pole bean,
birdhouse gourd, dipper gourd and Jenny Lind melon. Also available
are field crops like flax seed, red mangelwurtzel (it's a very
large beet), buckwheat and spelt. Apple varieties include Black
Gilliflower Sheepnose, Cox's Orange Pippin and Baldwin Woodpecker.
For information, write Heirloom Seed Project, Landis Valley Museum,
2451 Kissel Hill Rd., Lancaster, PA 17601; or call (717) 569-0401,
ext. 204.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW ENGLAND WILDFLOWER SOCIETY lists more than 200
wildflower varieties in its 1999 Seed and Book Catalog. The
selection includes wild flowers that thrive in moist, shady
locations or in sunny and dry spots. There are easy-to-grow
varieties, like purple coneflower, cardinal flower and
Jack-in-the-pulpit, and those that require more patience, like
trillium and pitcher plant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Requests for the catalog must be received by March 1; seed sales
end on March 15. Some seeds are in limited supply, and orders are
filled as they are received, so if you want seeds, don't delay. To
obtain a catalog, send $2.50 to Seeds, New England Wild Flower
Society, Garden in the Woods, 180 Hemenway Rd., Framingham, MA
01701.
</P>

VEGGIE OUT WITH CURTIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With unrestrained enthusiasm and a smile wider than the
Chattahoochee River, Curtis Aikens makes his success look like
child's play.
</P>
<P>
   The burly, vegetarian star of the cable TV Food Network's ``Pick
of the Day'' has an irresistible sweetness that could make even the
most dedicated meat-and-potatoes eater want to gobble a plate of
grilled tofu.
</P>
<P>
   All that positive energy is exactly what Aikens used to mask a
dark secret for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first African-American to have a cooking show on TV,
yet I didn't learn to read until I was 26,'' Aikens, 40, said
during a brief break in a whirlwind Fort Worth weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing with kids is what's so important that you achieve
things by reaching for them,'' Aikens said. ``I tell the kids to
set goals, to strive to be better and to give back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes to do personal appearances, either cooking for
a charity event or publicizing his latest cookbook, Aikens finds an
outlet for spreading his literacy gospel and talking to children
about overcoming odds.
</P>
<P>
   Aikens was born in Conyers, Ga., just east of Atlanta. He said
he didn't suffer from dyslexia but just wasn't taught properly. He
repeated the third grade and just ``schmoozed'' his way through the
rest of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exhausting,'' he said. ``I wish someone had been as
open to me about asking for help as I try to be when I'm talking to
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He practices what he preaches about giving back: All royalties
from his cookbooks _ the latest of three is 1995's ``Curtis Cooks
With Heart and Soul'' (William Morris, $23) _ go to reading and
literacy programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aikens was 26 and running his own produce business in the San
Francisco area when he saw a TV commercial for a literacy program.
It promised confidentiality, and Aikens got the tutoring he
desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on the passion that his mother, Laura, has for cooking,
Aikens turned his love of vegetables and food preparation into a
high-profile career. He made his mother's pumpkin pie first when he
launched his TV cooking show in Atlanta in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama taught me to cook; she's my big inspiration. There's
nothing like her collard greens and corn bread,'' he said. ``She's
proud of me, and I'm proud of her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was the produce man on ABC-TV's ``Home Show,'' and his
first cookbook was published in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   His vegetarian theme has had staying power. Originally, he
sought a meat-free diet to lose weight but wound up sticking with
it because ``vegetables eat and taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anti-meat. I just grew up loving and eating
vegetables,'' he said. ``Our family always believed that vegetables
are as big a part of the meal as meat.''
</P>
<P>
   What's his favorite vegetable? Whatever's fresh. Aikens enjoys
sauteing veggies in a tiny bit of olive oil and adding a bit of a
favorite salad dressing or some marinara for serving. Or he'll
grill asparagus, potatoes and any other vegetables that are handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have no idea how easy this is,'' he said. ``You
saute the vegetables a few minutes, cook some pasta and in 10
minutes, it's on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's feeling nostalgic, his favorite dish to make is
collard greens, cooked with an onion, sliced bell pepper, garlic, a
bit of olive oil and salt. He's happy to report, too, that he can
now find decent collard greens in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okra is one of my real favorites, but the Southern kind is
hard to get in California. The okra we get there from Chile just
isn't the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's important because Aikens splits his time _ when he's not
taping the TV show in New York _ between homes in Georgia and in
Marin County, where his two young sons live, north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Travels will soon take Aikens on his first trip to Great
Britain. That's where he'll be working on a new international
literacy program with suspense novelist Ken Follett, whom he met
recently through mutual friend Robin Leach while vacationing in
Antigua. MORE:

LIKE IT OR NOT, AMERICANS WANT TO KEEP CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, people are still talking about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Thompson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Sunday column contained a major misrepresentation of
fact: `Most Americans didn't want Clinton removed from office. ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong!
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, you too have been falsely persuaded by national
poll results and/or you insulated yourself from what most Americans
really wanted from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every one friend, relative and business associate of mine
who wanted Clinton to stay, ten others have expressed to me the
opposite desire. I am among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 60 years as a citizen, I have not once been polled by
someone representing himself as national media. I do not know a
single individual in all my experience who has been contacted by
such organizations. Who are the people polled? Where are the people
polled? How are these people selected?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton did was despicable. He defiled our highest public
office. He should have been ousted and disbarred. However, because
of a group of spineless Senators, scared for their own political
future, we are left to try explaining another failure of the system
to our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a pathetic charade our elected officeholders perpetrated.
Now we have a President whom most of my friends, relatives and
business associates want no part of. They do not want to see him,
hear him or read about him, period!
</P>
<P>
   ``Our President now is without credentials. He is viewed as a
joke. And, we have this White House jester for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington reader who wrote this letter signed off with
``Sincerely,'' and it was heartening to learn that he was sincere
in his viewpoint. If there is one thing I can't stand, it's a
reader who rips me to shreds and isn't sincere about it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most people who despise Bill Clinton are as sincere
as sincere can be. Clinton-haters loathe Slick Willie with an
intensity that defies description.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I have no use for Clinton. I enthusiastically
supported Bob Dole last time around _ and I figured out long before
Clinton ran for re-election that he was a lying, double-dealing
worm.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody needs to tell me that what Clinton did in the
sex-and-lies scandal was despicable. For Clinton, despicableness is
an art form.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment that the scandal exploded into the headlines
right up until the Senate voted him not guilty of perjury and
obstruction of justice, I never believed that Clinton should be
removed from office against the wishes of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Most Americans
did not want Clinton removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   That is a fact _ a fact supported by poll after scientific poll.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the president's detractors would like to believe
that the polls are wrong or maybe even rigged. If you are
absolutely, positively certain that the president should be booted
out of the White House, it's plenty disconcerting to think that 60
to 70 percent of your countrymen disagree.
</P>
<P>
   It also stands to reason that a person with strong opinions on a
controversial topic will communicate those opinions most often to
people who are likely to agree. Most of us gravitate toward folks
who think as we do.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Polling your family, pals and co-workers is no
way to gauge the attitudes of the public at large. Past performance
has shown that scientific, nationwide polls such as those
commissioned by major newspapers and TV news organizations are
extremely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   There might be an argument here if the impeachment polls had
been all over the map _ if one said that 70 percent of Americans
wanted Clinton removed and the next said that 70 percent wanted him
to stay. But virtually every poll turned up the same result:
Somewhere between 60 and 70 percent wanted Clinton to finish his
term.
</P>
<P>
   You can disagree with the majority opinion that the polls
reflect. But you're deluding yourself if you insist that the polls
are wrong just because you don't like the results.

CLEARING THE NAME OF A WEST POINT GRAD
</HEADLINE>
 (for use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good timing.
</P>
<P>
   In pardoning Henry O. Flipper during the last Black History
Month observance of the 20th century, President Clinton picked an
appropriate moment to undo one of the more glaring racial
injustices of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper, the first African-American to graduate from West Point,
was dishonorably discharged from the United States Cavalry in 1892
under circumstances that emitted a pronounced smell of racist
taint.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper went on to a distinguished civilian career as a civil
and mining engineer in Mexico and the American Southwest. He also
became an outstanding linguist, a specialist in translating complex
Spanish land grant documents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those accomplishments, Flipper tried for decades to
erase the stain from his military career. He had really wanted to
be a soldier more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Considering what he had to endure to gain his commission, his
soldierly ambition was understandable. In his book ``Colored Cadet
at West Point'' (published in 1878, a year after his graduation),
Flipper wrote of being subjected to continuous ostracism and
harassment. That he kept his silence and endured the ordeal
testified to his strength of character.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper was brought up on charges at Fort Davis, Texas, amid
accusations of embezzlement of commissary funds and conduct
unbecoming an officer. The court-martial found him not guilty of
embezzlement, for lack of motive, but guilty on several counts of
the latter charge.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the court-martial said he didn't steal the money but
did try to cover up the fact that it was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Flipper did try various means to hide the fact that the
money was gone until money owed by some officers came in to cover
the shortfall. He even covered part of it with a personal check,
for which he lacked sufficient funds. He was expecting a royalty
check from his book to arrive in time to offset that.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, however, did steal part of the money. Suspicion fell
for a while on a laundress with whom Flipper was friendly, who had
access to Flipper's quarters. He kept the commissary funds in a
trunk there.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Flipper would maintain that his commanding
officer at Fort Davis, Col. William R. Shafter, set him up in
collusion with another officer who bore a long-standing grudge
against Flipper. The black lieutenant frequently went riding at
Fort Comanche with the woman that officer later married, and there
was bad feeling between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   It was the dishonorable discharge that gave off the strong smell
of racism. White officers convicted of much more serious offenses
were routinely given lesser sentences _ suspensions or setbacks on
the promotion list.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars have speculated that the harsh sentence was
imposed in the expectation that it would be overturned higher up in
the chain of command. The judge advocate general of the Army, Gen.
David G. Swain, recommended as much to President Chester A. Arthur
and Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the late
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is believed that there is no case on record in which an
officer was treated with such personal harshness ... I would
recommend the sentence be continued but mitigated to a lesser
degree of punishment,'' Swaim wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln and Arthur ignored Swaim's recommendation and confirmed
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper continued his efforts to get a law passed reinstating
his commission until 1924. He died in 1940. Descendants of his
brother, African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Josephus Flipper, and
other interested parties took up the cause again during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Army changed the discharge to honorable. A statue
was unveiled in his honor at West Point in 1977, the centennial
year of his graduation. In 1978, his body was reinterred with full
military honors by a burial detail from Fort Benning, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pardon this month completed the process of removing
the asterisk from Flipper's niche in black history.

IF I'M PATIENT, GOD WILL WASH MY CAR CARES AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I saw it as I came across the front of my car, a
streak of glistening silver, long, stretched and shiny across the
hood.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I thought someone had hocked a huge one onto the car,
but the stain was far too large for that. I came around to the
driver's side and saw that the side mirror, door and trunk had also
been savaged, and as I stepped in closer to get a better look at
the shiny mess, I heard it distinctly.
</P>
<P>
   CRUNCH.
</P>
<P>
   An eggshell.
</P>
<P>
   I had been egged. An entire generation of unborn chicks had been
lobbed through the air to strike and splatter all over my innocent
Honda. As I scratched away hardened egg whites with my fingernail
below the window, I moaned.
</P>
<P>
   Now I was gonna have to wash it, something I haven't done since
I bought the car two years ago, and with good reason. What kind of
idiot criminal would steal a filthy car when there's plenty of
clean ones to be had?
</P>
<P>
   I figure no one's going to steal a car with so much nicotine on
the windows that you couldn't see out in spots. No one's going to
steal a car that you have to move heavy objects, like large panes
of glass, my great-grandfather's meat grinder and an old computer,
in order to sit down. No one's going to steal a car that will make
them dirty just by riding in it. Besides, I know that if you wait
long enough, God always washes it for you.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my car, dipped in so much egg that it was ready to
be breaded like a cutlet. What did this mean? Obviously, I thought,
someone hates me. Eggs? What is that supposed to say?: ``Sadly, I
am unable to appropriately express my anger, so I have no other
alternative than to throw an animal product at your mode of
transportation''?
</P>
<P>
   But pelting a breakfast food at my car? Why couldn't they just
Corn Pop or grit me?
</P>
<P>
   And what's next? If eggs are the first level of vengeance, then
what? If I make the vandals even angrier _ maybe by pointing to an
obvious though kindly overlooked physical flaw _ do I get a rasher
of bacon? If I start dating their ex-spouse, what fate lies for me
then? Will I come out of my house one day and find, to my horror,
that the Honda has been Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruitied, with the
tires slashed and filled with whipped cream?
</P>
<P>
   And who are these vandals? Who could hate me enough to throw a
delicate ovum onto the hood of my car and watch it rupture?
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, I assembled a list of possible and cowardly suspects.
</P>
<P>
   SUSPECT No. 1: The President of My Neighborhood Association.
Motive: The fact that I tried to egg his house for reporting me to
the city of Phoenix for having a messy yard, but realized it was
both immature and wrong when I arrived and he was standing outside
with a video camera in his hand. Ulterior motive: He had a sudden
epiphany that when he drove by on Saturday and I extended a cordial
greeting to which he smiled at and waved, I was really saying, ``I
hate you, stupid tattletale! Don't you wave at me, Stupid
Tattletale Man!! I'm going to tattle on YOU! For being DUMB, you
dummy!! ''(I'm not very good at on-the-spot insults.)
</P>
<P>
   SUSPECT No. 2: Jerry, the Homeless Tree Trimmer. Motive: The
complete and utter rejection he experienced on the porch of my
house at 11 p.m. on a Sunday night while demanding that I give him
money. The main reason I don't think it's him is because my
neighbor Robyn finally called the cops on him that same Sunday
night, after he stood on her porch and repeatedly said to her, ``Do
you recognize me? I got my hair cut. But it's me, it's really me,''
and we're pretty sure he now lives in a tent.
</P>
<P>
   SUSPECT No. 3: The Lady at the Movies Who Cut in Front of Me in
the Popcorn Line. Motive: When the Popcorn Guy said, ``I can help
the next person,'' and it was really (begin ital) my (end ital)
turn but Suspect No. 3 stepped up to the counter, I walked up next
to her and said loudly, ``Cheater, Cheater, Panty-Eater!'' She then
gave me a dirty look and said, ``Humph!'' To which I put my hands
on my hips and said ``Humph!'' much louder.
</P>
<P>
   SUSPECT No. 4: An Irate Reader. Motive: Any number of reasons,
including, but not limited to: My using the word ``thing'' instead
of ``think''; the mention of a simple joke that a reader takes out
of context and redirects it as a personal insult to themselves or a
deceased family member; or a clown that is very, very angry behind
those painted-on tears and cannot suppress their fiery love for
weather guy Sean McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   When my husband came home that night, I showed him the list and
told him about my car getting egged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?'' he replied. ``Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
You've got the equivalent of all of Mount St. Helens' ash on the
hood alone, that should protect it. Your little dirt cocoon should
be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you,'' I replied. ``God washes my car when he thinks
it's time!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurie,'' my husband said, ``your car is so messy, people have
asked me if you're breeding chickens in the back seat and are then
making sausage with that grinder. Maybe someone just felt sorry for
your car and they're forcing you to wash it, like an
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine!'' I said, stomping around the house, collecting a
bucket, sponge and dog shampoo, since we were out of soap. ``God
knows better, but fine!''

   With a spoon and a paper towel, I scraped the egg, which had now
hardened to the consistency of polyurethane, off the afflicted
areas. Then I squirted the dog shampoo on the car, worked it up
into a lather and, as I took the hose to it, most of my neighbors
came out to watch.
</P>
<P>
   I was drying off the last part of the bumper when I heard
something hit the hood. I heard another thud, and another one. I
ran to the front of the car, and that's when I saw them. Three big,
wet streaks across the section I had just scraped.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up, held out my hand and barely got to the front porch
before God's Carwash opened for business.  &QL;

A BASEMENT OF HIS OWN

Works,'' to be published in May by Villard.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ambiance might charitably be described as early
20th-century American dungeon: The cobwebbed walls are made of
slabs of Manhattan schist set in brown mortar, which over the last
century has shed enough sand and lime to form an inch-high berm at
their base. A network of rusty pipes _ steam, gas, drain, sprinkler
and water _ crisscrosses the floor and ceiling. The air is moist
and pungent, redolent of No. 2 heating oil and steam-boiler exhaust
and shimmers in rude blue fluorescent light. This is a basement, my
basement, and I love it.
</P>
<P>
   In our five-story, five-bedroom house, this is the one place I
can truly call my own. Each of my children has his or her own
bedroom. My wife, who works at home, has her own study. Even the
washer and dryer get their own four walls with a door that closes.
By default, I get everything beneath the house's habitable spaces.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about a rec room with a wet bar and a 60-inch
television. I'm not even talking about the kind of slightly
mildewed chamber that is hospitable enough to house a laundry or a
sewing nook. I'm referring to a nether world of sewer drains, leaky
pipes, tool-strewn work benches and smoky power plant that only a
man could covet. I'm talking about the kind of creepy, irredeemable
vault that, much as I may wish for it, could not even be converted
into a teen-ager's bedroom. Banished to this subterranean briar
patch by the local matriarchy, I secretly howl with joy.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that has been working overtime to break down gender
barriers and eliminate old-boy clubs, the basement continues to
resist integration. That's not likely to change anytime soon, says
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the author of ``Finding Flow: The
Psychology of Engagement With Everyday Life'' (Basic Books, 1998),
the best-selling analysis of peak experience.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his research into flow, that absorbing psychological
state that athletes, musicians and surgeons refer to as ``the
zone,'' the University of Chicago psychologist outfitted 200
working men and women with electronic pagers, beeped them randomly
during the day and asked them to write down where they were and how
happy and creative they felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the basement is the part of the home in which
men have the greatest number of positive moods, and the environment
in which women have the fewest,'' Csikszentmihalyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Where are women happiest?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bathroom,'' he said. ``It's one of the few places they
don't feel hassled by children or husbands _ a place where they
don't feel obligated to do anything but focus on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The affinity for what Csikszentmihalyi calls the micro-ecology
of the basement almost certainly originates in the Y chromosome. My
16-year-old daughter was surprised recently to learn we had one.
Her younger sister has explored the region a couple of times with
her twin brother but now refuses to venture beyond the top of the
stairs, from which outpost she often rouses me from a
board-drilling fugue to request dinner or announce a telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   Social constructionists would undoubtedly argue that my girls
are simply taking their cues from their mom, who refuses to honor
this sanctuary, the very foundation of our cozy Upper West Side
familial corporation, with even an occasional visit. They would
also have a generous explanation for her apparent snub: she's
cutting me some slack, honoring my space.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But she also shudders just thinking about the moist
ecology of our basement and shakes her head, mystified, when I
eagerly head off down below. I don't expect her to understand my
urge to drain the boiler, arrange my drill bits, practice my slap
shot and disassemble things that work just fine any more than I can
figure out why, when the world is too much with her, she finds
peace in an hour or so of furtive folding and sorting.
</P>
<P>
   My 9-year-old son, by contrast, follows me into the sanctum
sanctorum every chance he can get, to learn, among other things,
the fabulously destructive potential of the Sawzall. He and his
pals can often be found there after school, furiously flailing away
with hammers and saws, industriously building nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Are we just an old-fashioned family, immune to the new gender
politics that has done away with His and Hers?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, our corporation requires two very modern
paychecks to stay afloat. I submit, however, that my basement
puttering satisfies a vital, even if seemingly outdated
psychological need, long important to the male ego. With my
protective hands on the pulse of the domestic compound, I can
literally take and adjust its temperature, insure its proper
hydration and hygiene and feel as if I have guaranteed the good
health of the family gene pool for another day.
</P>
<P>
   For years, researchers have churned out studies showing that,
while working dads are performing more household chores than their
fathers did, women still do the maid's share of them _ and often
after racing home from the office themselves. The latest figures
from the Families and Work Institute, a Manhattan research group,
show that men now put in 75 percent as much time as women taking
care of grunt work in the parlor, kitchen and nursery _ up from 30
percent in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But what would happen to that ratio if the obligations of the
basement were added to the usual cleaning, shopping and diapering?
I would trade having to plunge my arm shoulder-deep into a
backed-up sewer drain in search of a Furby someone has flushed down
a toilet for a hundred diaper changes any day.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe I would not. The basement is my world, and I'm
not ready to give it up.

CLASSIC CAR BUFF LORIN TRYON DIES AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MALCOLM GLOVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lorin H. Tryon Jr., one of the world's most
respected classic car aficionados and president of the renowned
Blackhawk Automotive Museum, died Feb. 12 of a heart attack at the
San Ramon Valley Medical Center. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his association with the museum, which he was
credited with bringing into national prominence among classic car
enthusiasts, Mr. Tryon was best known worldwide for his leadership
of the prestigious Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.
</P>
<P>
   His fascination with automobiles began at an early age and was
fostered by his grandfather, who was one of California's first auto
dealers. At the age of seven, when he was barely big enough to see
over the hood and operate the clutch and brake, he operated his own
car wash at his family's home and drove the cars back and forth to
his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tryon, who was born in San Francisco in 1927, pioneered many
shows and judged others, both nationally and internationally. For
27 years, he had been the driving force in the revitalization and
popularity of the renowned Pebble Beach display of classic cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of Lorin Tryon, my friend for 40 years and my partner
at Pebble Beach for 27 years, cannot be filled,'' said J. Heumann,
his co-chairman at Pebble Beach. ``I will miss not only his
friendship and his humor, but above all, his incredible knowledge
of the collector car movement, resulting from an entire life
devoted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lorin has been the guiding light for the Concours,'' said
executive director Sandra Kasky. ``He was more than just a leader,
he was a mentor and a friend who set exacting standards that we
eagerly tried to meet and will continue to strive toward in his
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was involved in organizing the
inaugural international Automotive Design Forum at Blackhawk
scheduled to be held Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tryon is survived by his wife, Dolores, a son, Bill, and a
daughter, Catherine.
</P>
<P>

the Blackhawk Automotive Museum or to the American Heart
Association, 11200 Golf Links Road, Oakland, Calif. 94605.)

SNUGGLING UP TO TOUCHY-FEELY MICE

<P>
   How big are the files on your C drive? Soon you will be able to
give them a push with your mouse to find out. The bigger they are,
the more they will push back.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of peering at the menu bar, you will be able to move
your mouse across the mouse pad until you bump into the image you
want _ you will be able to locate icons by touch as easily as your
fingers find a light switch.
</P>
<P>
   The standard, sometimes maddening system that people use to
interact with their computers _ the graphical user interface, or
GUI _ is about to be broadened. In the jargon of researchers, the
new ``modality'' is called haptics, and it will let users reach out
to move, stroke and push virtual objects on their screens and
``feel'' those objects under their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The word haptics comes from the Greek word ``haptein,'' for ``to
fasten.'' Some video games let players experience simple examples
of haptics; through force feedback, players can feel shudders and
jolts through joysticks and steering wheels that are linked to
virtual activities like driving vehicles with high-torque motors.
</P>
<P>
   Now haptics technology is poised to move from the joys of the
game arcade to the sober tasks of the desktop. Manufacturers hope
that the new devices will satisfy the need for the tactile in a
variety of ways, from the mouse that lets users ``finger'' the
fabric of a T-shirt advertised on the Web to handheld, pen-size
instruments that will let artists mold virtual clay or let
apprentice doctors practice palpating their virtual patients.
</P>
<P>
   At the Immersion Corp. in San Jose, Calif., which licenses
force-feedback technology, the company's president, Dr. Louis B.
Rosenberg, is applying Immersion's patented haptic technology to
trackballs, mice and other cursor-control devices. ``Our mission as
a company is to add feel to every desktop on the planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immersion has licensed its ``feelit'' technology to Logitech, a
manufacturer of computer pointing devices, which plans to introduce
a haptic device by late summer, Rosenberg said. It will cost about
$125.
</P>
<P>
   Will users be able to feel a texture as subtle as corduroy using
haptic devices? Margaret Minsky, a haptics consultant in Brookline,
Mass., who did her PhD dissertation on the simulation of textured
surfaces, said force-feedback devices could be surprisingly
effective. ``For corduroy, the devices modulate resistance at such
a fine scale that you are able to perceive tiny variations in the
surface,'' she said. ``But they aren't up to velvet yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mice work in the two-dimensional world of flat surfaces, moving
left and right, and forward and back. Some high-end commercial
applications of haptics mimic three dimensions, allowing users to
hold slender rods in the air and move them to and fro to create
virtual paintings, music or surgical stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Playter, vice president for engineering at Boston
Dynamics in Cambridge, Mass., has worked on a number of haptic
simulators that he hopes will soon be on apprentice surgeon's
desks, permitting them to reach into virtual patients to practice
grasping and cutting spongy, slippery virtual organs before they
move on to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor holds an actual forceps in one hand and a needle
holder in the other,'' Playter said, describing one of the
company's simulation systems. Looking at the computer monitor while
moving the instruments in thin air, the doctor punctures the
virtual vessel, pulls the thread through, grabs the other vessel
and sews the two vessels together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the haptic feedback, you can feel the needle pop
through as you sew, and how tightly you are pulling on the
thread,'' Playter said.
</P>
<P>
   The forceps and needle holder of the Boston Dynamics system are
attached to a machine called the Phantom. Sold by Sensable
Technologies, based in Cambridge, the Phantom can measure not only
the location of the actual thread holder but also its angle _ handy
when it comes to sewing imaginary sutures.
</P>
<P>
   The desktop version of the Phantom, released in late 1998 and
priced at about $10,000, looks like a desk lamp on the outside. On
the inside, it is mechanically similar to a small, friendly robot:
optical devices mounted on three motors determine the position of
the tip of each instrument.
</P>
<P>
   For force feedback, torque from the motors is transmitted
through a cable to the tip of the device, changing the amount of
resistance the user feels while moving the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The Phantom underlies some haptics applications that are
gradually emerging from research laboratories, many for
rehabilitative medicine or computer-assisted design for
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boeing Co. in Bellevue, Wash., for instance, Bill McNeely
hopes to use the Phantom to help improve airplane designs. Boeing,
like many manufacturers, does digital rather than actual full-size
mock-ups of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to figure out maintenance for a virtual airplane,''
McNeely said. ``Without the sense of touch, you don't know when
your elbow is crashing into a virtual bulkhead.'' Force feedback
lets McNeely know if machinery will be accessible once it is
installed. ``Anyone who's twisted and turned to get an oil filter
out of the engine block knows the problems of removing objects from
a narrow, confined space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The underpinnings of haptics technology are not new. Dr. Kenneth
Salisbury, a principal research scientist at the Artificial
Intelligence Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
co-inventor of the Phantom, said the decades-old technology had
arisen partly as an offshoot of robotics interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, one of the key problems was manipulating
hazardous materials at a distance,'' he said. In response,
researchers developed robot arms controlled by joysticks. ``They
developed force feedback so the operators could feel when they hit
an object,'' Salisbury said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, research in haptics has accelerated,
moving closer to commercial applications, Dr. Minsky said.
``Graphics can tell us something is made of cloth, leather or wood,
but reaching out and touching is believing,'' she said. ``Haptics
satisfies one of our most basic human needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaron Lanier, the computer scientist who coined the term virtual
reality, agreed that haptics interfaces with virtual reality would
one day become common but said that would take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Force feedback isn't just a way of organizing graphical
information, but a whole new modality, so it won't happen
tomorrow,'' he said. ``But inevitably we will make use of touch
because humans have haptic capability, and the best tools for us
are based on how our bodies work. Haptics is going to happen to us
all.''

 IN INDIA, CHILDHOOD is FOR SALE  
 &HT;     (To publish this ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased
_ the rate is not prohibitive _ from one of these New York Times
Syndicate sales representatives:

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-798-0970;
fax, 310-798-7338.)  By SOMA WADHWA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the
skill we prepare the child for. Along with education, of course.''
 Escape Through Education
 &HT;    At Mukti Ashram, the children get basic training in literacy,
health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in
such trades as carpentry, tailoring and making cane and bamboo
products. There are group discussions on the legal system and
children's rights, as well as current political issues. The
youngsters also help manage the ashram, thus acquiring leadership
skills.
 &HT;    Once the children return to their villages, the ashram keeps
track of how they fare. Many become economically independent,
setting up small enterprises. Most importantly, these rehabilitated
youngsters are helping to teach their communities to fight for
their rights in order to prevent further bondage.
 &HT;    Some of the youngsters return to help Kailash in the
raid-and-rescue operations. Thirteen-year-old Mohan, from Bihar
state, was rescued from a carpet factory in Uttar Pradesh, where he
had worked from age seven to 10. After a year in the Mukti Ashram
in New Delhi, it became clear that he was a bright youngster, and
Kailash enrolled him in one of the marches against child labor.
After this Mohan returned to his village and gave talks in local
schools about the cruel realities of child labor.
 &HT;    Fourteen-year-old Govind is doing the same. An underpaid
telephone booth attendant during the day and a cook at night for a
shopkeeper in the Nepal-Sikkim border town Jhaba, the boy was
rescued by Kailash's activists about three years ago. Once at the
shelter, Govind impressed everyone by his quick mind and grasp of
academic subjects, so he was encouraged to be part of all the
coalition's rallies and marches.
 &HT;    He returned from a three-week visit to his village near Jhaba
and informed Kailash about the local networks that he has set up
there. He went to each family in his village and informed them of
the poor conditions their children work in once they are sent away
to the bigger cities.
 &HT;    ``He is so fired up by what he has learnt here,'' Kailash said,
``that he now plans to go to different villages in India and talk
of his experiences as a child who had to work 16 hours a day. My
children are all so bright. They are going to change society.'' He
calls them ``young multipliers of the message.''
 &HT;    Through the Coalition, which was founded in 1989, Kailash has
supplemented these individual rescue operations with a vigorous
campaign to garner public opinion against child labor. Today The
South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude comprises 400 partner
organizations, including human rights groups and trade unions in
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
 &HT;    ``The need for comrades in the combat was obvious,'' he said.
``I realized that children in the region were all facing the same
pernicious fate, and that the fight had to be for all of them.
Banning child labor in India would only shift businesses that
thrive on such inexpensive labor to the neighboring countries.
These children are ours, you cannot shun their problems because
they don't share your nationality.''
 &HT;    Every wall in Kailash's small, functional office in South Delhi
seems to reflect this belief. Huge black and white photographs of
children from South Asian countries who are working away their
childhood crowd the office, reminders that millions will have to
join hands to save the millions suffering.
 &HT;    He points at them and says, ``Children are world citizens and
the world must come together to save them.''
 &HT;    It was this global outlook that brought Kailash to push through
a carpet-consumers' awareness campaign that culminated in the
creation of Rugmark, a label that certifies carpets made without
child labor. To be Rugmark-certified, carpet manufacturers agree to
independent monitoring and inspections. A presentation by Kailash
in 1991 before a U.N. human rights subcommission in Geneva resulted
in U.N. endorsement of the label.
 The Power of a Positive Label 
 &HT;    He is unwilling to hazard a guess on the percentage of carpet
manufacturers who comply with the Rugmark requirements, but he
points out that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain and the
United States import only Rugmark carpets from the Subcontinent.
The certification is not foolproof, of course.
 &HT;    James Tufenkian, an American who is on the board of Rugmark and
whose company employs about 6,000 weavers in Nepal, was quoted in
The New York Times last October as saying, ``While Rugmark's heart
is 100 percent in the right place, how can we know what's really
going on in the weavers' homes?''
 &HT;    Added to these advocacy efforts, Kailash has organized many
marches in India and Nepal as part of an ongoing protest against
child labor. His latest effort saw him co-ordinating a Global March
Against Child labor this year. Commencing in January 1998, the
march saw activists, supporters and many a child laborer march in
Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Europe and many of them
traveled to Geneva in June for the drafting of a new convention on
child labor by the International labor Organization.
 &HT;    ``Marches have been so much a part of the Indian tradition of
protest,'' Kailash says. ``Mahatma Gandhi used marches effectively
to protest British laws.'' Kailash also wrote 800 letters to
organize different groups for the March to Geneva.
 &HT;    Gauri Pradhan, of NGO Child Workers in Nepal, credits Kailash
with having made the cause a regional rather than a
country-specific issue; Ishtiaque Ahmed, who works against child
labor in Dhaka, Bangladesh, credits Kailash with perseverance and
vision.
 &HT;    Not that Kailash is hungering for appreciation; he is quite
prepared to meet any criticism that might come his way and advances
some himself: ``People might say we have no business touring the
world when the problem of child labor is nowhere near eradication
back home. But that's a very narrow approach. In today's globalized
world you can't sort out anything by remaining home.''
 An Early Start  
 &HT;    Kailash's first brush with child labor was close to home in a
small town in Madhya Pradesh. Perplexed to see the cobbler's son
not attending school like him, 7-year-old Kailash innocently asked
why, only to be told that children born to the ``untouchable''
castes in India have no option but to work.
 &HT;    The sentence stuck with him. So did the desire to change the
terrible truth of the statement.
 &HT;    Years later, while studying electrical engineering at the
Regional Engineering School in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh state, where
he was born, he organized a book bank to help those students who
could not afford new textbooks.
 &HT;    After teaching engineering for a few years Kailash decided to
work more directly for social change. ``The world had to know the
shocking truth. And I chose not to remain with a mainstream
profession but to change things. I walked out of home.'' Now,
others walk with him, in his marches against the sale of childhood.

 IN INDIA, CHILDHOOD is FOR SALE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the
skill we prepare the child for. Along with education, of course.''
 Escape Through Education
 &HT;    At Mukti Ashram, the children get basic training in literacy,
health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in
such trades as carpentry, tailoring and making cane and bamboo
products. There are group discussions on the legal system and
children's rights, as well as current political issues. The
youngsters also help manage the ashram, thus acquiring leadership
skills.
 &HT;    Once the children return to their villages, the ashram keeps
track of how they fare. Many become economically independent,
setting up small enterprises. Most importantly, these rehabilitated
youngsters are helping to teach their communities to fight for
their rights in order to prevent further bondage.
 &HT;    Some of the youngsters return to help Kailash in the
raid-and-rescue operations. Thirteen-year-old Mohan, from Bihar
state, was rescued from a carpet factory in Uttar Pradesh, where he
had worked from age seven to 10. After a year in the Mukti Ashram
in New Delhi, it became clear that he was a bright youngster, and
Kailash enrolled him in one of the marches against child labor.
After this Mohan returned to his village and gave talks in local
schools about the cruel realities of child labor.
 &HT;    Fourteen-year-old Govind is doing the same. An underpaid
telephone booth attendant during the day and a cook at night for a
shopkeeper in the Nepal-Sikkim border town Jhaba, the boy was
rescued by Kailash's activists about three years ago. Once at the
shelter, Govind impressed everyone by his quick mind and grasp of
academic subjects, so he was encouraged to be part of all the
coalition's rallies and marches.
 &HT;    He returned from a three-week visit to his village near Jhaba
and informed Kailash about the local networks that he has set up
there. He went to each family in his village and informed them of
the poor conditions their children work in once they are sent away
to the bigger cities.
 &HT;    ``He is so fired up by what he has learnt here,'' Kailash said,
``that he now plans to go to different villages in India and talk
of his experiences as a child who had to work 16 hours a day. My
children are all so bright. They are going to change society.'' He
calls them ``young multipliers of the message.''
 &HT;    Through the Coalition, which was founded in 1989, Kailash has
supplemented these individual rescue operations with a vigorous
campaign to garner public opinion against child labor. Today The
South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude comprises 400 partner
organizations, including human rights groups and trade unions in
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
 &HT;    ``The need for comrades in the combat was obvious,'' he said.
``I realized that children in the region were all facing the same
pernicious fate, and that the fight had to be for all of them.
Banning child labor in India would only shift businesses that
thrive on such inexpensive labor to the neighboring countries.
These children are ours, you cannot shun their problems because
they don't share your nationality.''
 &HT;    Every wall in Kailash's small, functional office in South Delhi
seems to reflect this belief. Huge black and white photographs of
children from South Asian countries who are working away their
childhood crowd the office, reminders that millions will have to
join hands to save the millions suffering.
 &HT;    He points at them and says, ``Children are world citizens and
the world must come together to save them.''
 &HT;    It was this global outlook that brought Kailash to push through
a carpet-consumers' awareness campaign that culminated in the
creation of Rugmark, a label that certifies carpets made without
child labor. To be Rugmark-certified, carpet manufacturers agree to
independent monitoring and inspections. A presentation by Kailash
in 1991 before a U.N. human rights subcommission in Geneva resulted
in U.N. endorsement of the label.
 The Power of a Positive Label 
 &HT;    He is unwilling to hazard a guess on the percentage of carpet
manufacturers who comply with the Rugmark requirements, but he
points out that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain and the
United States import only Rugmark carpets from the Subcontinent.
The certification is not foolproof, of course.
 &HT;    James Tufenkian, an American who is on the board of Rugmark and
whose company employs about 6,000 weavers in Nepal, was quoted in
The New York Times last October as saying, ``While Rugmark's heart
is 100 percent in the right place, how can we know what's really
going on in the weavers' homes?''
 &HT;    Added to these advocacy efforts, Kailash has organized many
marches in India and Nepal as part of an ongoing protest against
child labor. His latest effort saw him co-ordinating a Global March
Against Child labor this year. Commencing in January 1998, the
march saw activists, supporters and many a child laborer march in
Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Europe and many of them
traveled to Geneva in June for the drafting of a new convention on
child labor by the International labor Organization.
 &HT;    ``Marches have been so much a part of the Indian tradition of
protest,'' Kailash says. ``Mahatma Gandhi used marches effectively
to protest British laws.'' Kailash also wrote 800 letters to
organize different groups for the March to Geneva.
 &HT;    Gauri Pradhan, of NGO Child Workers in Nepal, credits Kailash

country-specific issue; Ishtiaque Ahmed, who works against child
labor in Dhaka, Bangladesh, credits Kailash with perseverance and

CEMETERY TO REMOVE FENCE THAT OFFENDED HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Members of a cemetery association in a rural South
Texas town voted to remove a recently-installed fence that divided
the white and Hispanic sections of the burial ground and threatened
to sour ethnic harmony.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the vote, the association's president, E.A.
Murff, who is credited with erecting the fence, resigned. His wife,
the group's secretary-treasurer, also quit.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Salge of the Waldheim Cemetery Association, which
maintains the white portion of the burial ground, said the vote to
remove the fence was 22-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community wants this settled peacefully and for everyone
to go back to their normal routine and peaceful obscurity. We want
to put this thing to bed,'' said Salge, a Bee County farmer whose
grandparents and parents are buried in the Waldheim Cemetery 3
miles outside of Tynan, which has a population of 175 and one
blinking yellow traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot chain-link fence was erected three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed about it. I stood there and shook my head and said,
`Why do that?' It's ridiculous, and it looks exclusionary,'' said
Carol Polasek, 62, a resident of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw it, I said, `This is trouble. We don't need
this,' ... There are local farmers who are willing to donate their
tractors to tear this fence down,'' she said by telephone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And trouble quickly arrived in this farming community where
white and Hispanic residents live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   But the tranquility was disturbed recently because of news media
attention and when a Hispanic group threatened to file a civil
rights complaint with the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few people did this, and it just put a bad reflection on
everybody, the whole town,'' said Margie Jostes, whose family
members are buried in the 4-acre Waldheim Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a community that gets along real good,'' Jostes said.
``This is modern times, and you just don't do a thing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, whites were buried in one section of
the Waldheim Cemetery and Hispanics in another, and until last
month when the fence was erected, no one thought anything of it.
</P>
<P>
   For Hispanics, who are accustomed to using a road through the
white section during wet weather for burial ceremonies, the fence
represented both a real inconvenience and a symbolic slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fighting to be buried on their side. That isn't the
issue. The issue was dividing the cemetery,'' said Diane Cavazos
Taylor, whose father maintained the Hispanic section for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be able to use that road for funerals, and in my
opinion, the main reason that fence was put up was to keep us from
using that road,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   She said if there must be a fence, it should enclose the entire
cemetery. And, she said, Hispanic residents are willing to do their
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to put up the money to fence in the rest of it.
Our main goal is to tear down that middle fence, not to divide the
cemetery,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Murff declined to comment on the issue before the Tuesday night
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier statements, Murff said the fence was erected to keep
out vandals and cattle, but since the fence gate is not locked, it
would pose little barrier to intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The American G.I. Forum, a Hispanic veterans' organization, was
quick to respond to the barrier. At a memorial service Sunday,
wreathes for Hispanic veterans were placed on their graves, but
those for white veterans were laid against the fence.

</P>
<P>
   Seasoned bargain hunters know that spring is the most affordable
time of the year to ski. When the daffodils are pushing through the
lawn and dedicated skiers are turning to boating and baseball, ski
areas find themselves with a surplus of snow and vacant condos.
Consequently, the discount ski season begins _ around the third
week of March _ in a last ditch attempt to garner maximum revenue
from empty hotel and condo rooms before the season's unofficial
last hurrah at Easter.
</P>
<P>
   But this ski season has been a particularly slow one, with good
snow arriving later than usual in much of the Rockies and the
Northeast. Smart skiers should be on the lookout for even deeper
discounts than normal. Prices will dip around the end of March and
then fall off after Easter, which is April 4 this year. That's when
reductions of 20 to 40 percent occur, with 50 percent off sales.
But remember _ prices fall at different times at different resorts.
Even within a resort, the discounting isn't always uniform.
</P>
<P>
   To take optimum advangtage of this year's spring skiing bonanza,
it pays to be flexible. Shop around, go where the empty rooms are
and keep an eye out for inexpensive airline tickets. To find the
cheapest seats, look to hub cities like Denver, which has a surfeit
of United flights, or Salt Lake City, which is well served by
Delta. Smaller ski town airports may pose problems _ there are
often fewer flights. And the smaller planes having access to these
mountain resorts may not reduce their prices substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Budget-minded skiers should consider a condo or hotel that isn't
``ski-in/ski-out.'' Accomdations located a short walk or a shuttle
bus ride away from the slopes may offer lower lodging costs. So can
staying outside the resort. Skiers heading to Purgatory can
economize by staying down the road in Durango. In Vail and Beaver
Creek, West Vail and Avon offer cheaper choices. Some skiers opt to
stay in discounted lodging in Salt Lake City and take the bus up to
Snowbird or Alta. Thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, Canada also
looms large as ski heaven for those on a budget. Whether its Lake
Louise, Whistler or Tremblant, rates drop precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, spring skiing is perfect for impulsive skiers. Call up
a ski tour operator, a central reservations office or check out a
Website to compare snow conditions and check out any condos
available for the upcoming weekend. The East has plenty of good
deals to be grabbed at the last-minute. So is the West, although
flying makes it a bit more complicated. When there's air involved,
the ideal minimum amount of time for last-minute Western ski trips,
from either the East or West Coast, is three days.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some deals for Spring 1999. Prices are per
person, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   At Vermont's Stratton Mountain (RR1 Box 145, Stratton Mountain,
Vt. 05155; 800-STRATTON; www.stratton.com), a two-night package
with slope side lodging that includes two days of lift tickets
ranges from $98 to $198 per person. This deal begins March 26 and
is available any day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   At Maine's Sugarloaf/USA (RR 1, Box 5000, Carrabassett Valley,
ME 04947 800-THE LOAF; www.sugarloaf.com ), the week-day price is
$59.95 per person per night and includes accommodation in an
on-mountain condo, lift ticket and a 90-minute ``Perfect Turn
Clinic.'' Guests can also use the Sugarloaf/
</P>
<P>
   USA Sports and Fitness Center.
</P>
<P>
   At Colorado's Steamboat Springs, spring skiers can get mid-week
round-trip airfare to Hayden, transfers, five nights lodging at the
Harbor Hotel and Condominiums, a four-day lift ticket and taxes for
$789 from New York, $699 from Chicago, $819 from Miami and $729
(midweek only) from Los Angeles. Contact Moguls (Moguls Ski and
Snowboard Tours, Inc., 4876 Sterling Dr. Boulder, CO 80301;
800-666-4857; www.skimoguls.com).
</P>
<P>
   At Vail, the Lodge at Vail (174 East Gore Creek Dr., Vail, CO
81657, 800-830-SNOW) is one of the most luxurious ski properties in
the West. Look for a mid-week deal for $219 per room, per night _
good until April 1. The price is based on a Sunday or Monday
arrival and a three-night minimum stay is required.
</P>
<P>
   In Breckenridge, a spring skiing package beginning April 6,
includes round-trip airfare based on mid-week flights, an

 &HT;    
 By JEFF GREENWALD  
 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    What a trick of fate: The way to get ahead in the age of the
knowledge worker is not through raw brainpower, but by harnessing
your emotions.
 &HT;    Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist and former New
York Times science writer, turned this idea into a household phrase
with his 1995 blockbuster ``Emotional Intelligence.'' A primer on
the art _ and science _ of self-mastery and social persuasion, the
book remains an international best-seller, now translated into 30
or so languages. At the time of this interview it was topping the
charts in Turkey.
 &HT;    Goleman's follow-up volume _ ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence'' (Bantam, 1998) _ goes even further, providing a kind
of moral philosophy for corporate America. His thesis: In today's
technical fields, you need a highly developed set of soft
(emotional) skills to leverage your hard (knowledge-based)
expertise.
 &HT;    Now CEO of the consulting firm Emotional Intelligence Services
(www.eisglobal.com/), Goleman seems to be walking the talk; let him
know what you think at goleman javanet.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JEFF GREENWALD: The mythical hero of Silicon Valley is the nerd
_ a brain trapped inside a geeky-looking body. Your research
suggests otherwise.
 &HT;    DANIEL GOLEMAN: The stereotype of the tech expert with no social
skills may be accurate. And I used to think these two factors were
independent. But friends at places like MIT argue that people drawn
into the technical fields spend many hours _ particularly in
adolescence _ alone, absorbed at the computer, or in a lab.
 &HT;    As they're increasing their technical understanding in math and
science, they're missing out on a parallel track of social
learning. They become emotionally de-skilled, and that pulls them
back later in their careers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The person who seems to belie this point of view is Bill
Gates, who by external appearances is almost autistic. He's hardly
what anyone would call a failure.
 &HT;    A: Gates is a fascinating case. He has a fabulous drive to
achieve, and that reverberates throughout his company. On the other
hand, he's notorious for the worst of emotional intelligence. He
yells, he's abrasive, and he doesn't seem to care how he's coming
off. If he were starting at the bottom _ if the playing field were
level for Gates _ he's not the guy you would pick to lead a team.
He'd work for you, not run you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So what's the role of technical skill?
 &HT;    A: It's an entry-level requirement. You have to have enough to
do the job _ but it's not what sets star performers apart. A
University of California/Berkeley study, started in the 1950s,
followed a group of Ph.D. students in science and the technical
fields for 40 years. It turned out emotional-intelligence abilities
were four times more important than IQ in determining professional
success and prestige by the end of their careers.
 &HT;    And in a study of managers who failed, it was always because of
a deficiency of emotional intelligence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Does our penchant for smartcards, smart homes, and PDAs
encourage emotional intelligence in society, or impede it?
 &HT;    A: The early returns show a negative impact, particularly as it
affects kids _ the average level of emotional intelligence has been
declining among young people for the last 20 years. This generation
spends more time than any generation in history staring at video
monitors. It doesn't matter if they're doing educational CD-ROMs;
they're not out playing with other kids.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What about the workplace?
 &HT;    A: The increasing reliance on communication via the Web and
e-mail _ if it replaces human touchpoints _ weakens the fabric of
connectedness that makes a company or organization work. That's why
emotional intelligence is so important in the high tech universe.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How does emotional intelligence apply to people like Oracle's
Larry Ellison who are more inspired by the Japanese ``warrior
mentality''?
 &HT;    A: Samurai were Zen students _ they engaged more skillfully
because they cultivated inner peace. Emotional intelligence is
about being skillful, not squishy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What's today's most emotionally intelligent technology?
 &HT;    A: The MIT Media Lab's Roz Picard, who wrote a book about 2001's
HAL 9000, is investigating computers that can read emotions in the
user and adjust themselves accordingly. If you're frantic and
uptight, they can make things easier. If you're enthusiastic and
zeroed in, they'll up the level of challenge. They're user-friendly
in the real sense of the word _ which means they're emotionally
intelligent, for machines.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: It's one thing to program a computer; how about humans?
 &HT;    A: Competency in emotional intelligence is learnable. In
``Working with Emotional Intelligence,'' I set out guidelines for
training programs designed to make people better on the job, where
the payoff is. A lot of programs out there _ such as these one-day
motivational seminars, or doing ropes courses in the countryside _
have little, no, or even a negative effect. Companies are wasting a
lot of time and money on inappropriate solutions.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Could good training rescue a troubled company _ say, Apple?
 &HT;    A: Emotional intelligence is not the answer to every problem
faced by an organization. There are market realities. But how well
you face a market reality is determined by emotional intelligence.
Andy Grove, writing about Intel, makes a good point: The critical
thing is how managers respond emotionally to a crisis. So often
people panic, deny the crisis _ or kill the messenger. A company
has to be open to bad news, take it in fully, and respond quickly.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What about other traditions that have a different way of
dealing with emotions?
 &HT;    A: In many Asian cultures you squelch expressions of emotion,
particularly of negative emotion _ which means that people are
getting eaten up inside without showing it. But I was amazed at
Asia's interest in emotional intelligence. In Taiwan, ``Emotional
Intelligence'' is the best-selling book of all time. In Korea,
they're starting to put emotional intelligence curricula in the
schools. ``We're very taken by the West,'' they told me, ``and very
influenced by your ideas and technologies. And here is Western
science affirming our most deeply held values.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is emotional intelligence sort of bottom-line Buddhism?
 &HT;    A: It's very interesting. Buddhists read ``Emotional
Intelligence'' that way. Christians tell me it's about
Christianity. And Jews tell me it's a great book about Judaism. It
may in that way reflect what Huxley called ``the perennial
philosophy,'' which itself reflects the basic neurological
structures that govern human existence.
 &HT;    My work is grounded in science, particularly neurological
science. Apparently the eternal questions all the great religions
are grappling with are the legacy of evolution: What do you do with
destructive emotions? How can you live a good life, and have
healthy connections to other people? How can you help future
generations?

 By JEFF GREENWALD  
 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    What a trick of fate: The way to get ahead in the age of the
knowledge worker is not through raw brainpower, but by harnessing
your emotions.
 &HT;    Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist and former New
York Times science writer, turned this idea into a household phrase
with his 1995 blockbuster ``Emotional Intelligence.'' A primer on
the art _ and science _ of self-mastery and social persuasion, the
book remains an international best-seller, now translated into 30
or so languages. At the time of this interview it was topping the
charts in Turkey.
 &HT;    Goleman's follow-up volume _ ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence'' (Bantam, 1998) _ goes even further, providing a kind
of moral philosophy for corporate America. His thesis: In today's
technical fields, you need a highly developed set of soft
(emotional) skills to leverage your hard (knowledge-based)
expertise.
 &HT;    Now CEO of the consulting firm Emotional Intelligence Services
(www.eisglobal.com/), Goleman seems to be walking the talk; let him
know what you think at goleman javanet.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JEFF GREENWALD: The mythical hero of Silicon Valley is the nerd
_ a brain trapped inside a geeky-looking body. Your research
suggests otherwise.
 &HT;    DANIEL GOLEMAN: The stereotype of the tech expert with no social
skills may be accurate. And I used to think these two factors were
independent. But friends at places like MIT argue that people drawn
into the technical fields spend many hours _ particularly in
adolescence _ alone, absorbed at the computer, or in a lab.
 &HT;    As they're increasing their technical understanding in math and
science, they're missing out on a parallel track of social
learning. They become emotionally de-skilled, and that pulls them
back later in their careers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The person who seems to belie this point of view is Bill
Gates, who by external appearances is almost autistic. He's hardly
what anyone would call a failure.
 &HT;    A: Gates is a fascinating case. He has a fabulous drive to
achieve, and that reverberates throughout his company. On the other
hand, he's notorious for the worst of emotional intelligence. He
yells, he's abrasive, and he doesn't seem to care how he's coming
off. If he were starting at the bottom _ if the playing field were
level for Gates _ he's not the guy you would pick to lead a team.
He'd work for you, not run you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So what's the role of technical skill?
 &HT;    A: It's an entry-level requirement. You have to have enough to
do the job _ but it's not what sets star performers apart. A
University of California/Berkeley study, started in the 1950s,
followed a group of Ph.D. students in science and the technical
fields for 40 years. It turned out emotional-intelligence abilities
were four times more important than IQ in determining professional
success and prestige by the end of their careers.
 &HT;    And in a study of managers who failed, it was always because of
a deficiency of emotional intelligence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Does our penchant for smartcards, smart homes, and PDAs
encourage emotional intelligence in society, or impede it?
 &HT;    A: The early returns show a negative impact, particularly as it
affects kids _ the average level of emotional intelligence has been
declining among young people for the last 20 years. This generation
spends more time than any generation in history staring at video
monitors. It doesn't matter if they're doing educational CD-ROMs;
they're not out playing with other kids.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What about the workplace?
 &HT;    A: The increasing reliance on communication via the Web and
e-mail _ if it replaces human touchpoints _ weakens the fabric of
connectedness that makes a company or organization work. That's why
emotional intelligence is so important in the high tech universe.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How does emotional intelligence apply to people like Oracle's
Larry Ellison who are more inspired by the Japanese ``warrior
mentality''?
 &HT;    A: Samurai were Zen students _ they engaged more skillfully
because they cultivated inner peace. Emotional intelligence is
about being skillful, not squishy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What's today's most emotionally intelligent technology?
 &HT;    A: The MIT Media Lab's Roz Picard, who wrote a book about 2001's
HAL 9000, is investigating computers that can read emotions in the
user and adjust themselves accordingly. If you're frantic and
uptight, they can make things easier. If you're enthusiastic and
zeroed in, they'll up the level of challenge. They're user-friendly
in the real sense of the word _ which means they're emotionally
intelligent, for machines.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: It's one thing to program a computer; how about humans?
 &HT;    A: Competency in emotional intelligence is learnable. In
``Working with Emotional Intelligence,'' I set out guidelines for
training programs designed to make people better on the job, where
the payoff is. A lot of programs out there _ such as these one-day
motivational seminars, or doing ropes courses in the countryside _
have little, no, or even a negative effect. Companies are wasting a
lot of time and money on inappropriate solutions.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Could good training rescue a troubled company _ say, Apple?
 &HT;    A: Emotional intelligence is not the answer to every problem
faced by an organization. There are market realities. But how well
you face a market reality is determined by emotional intelligence.
Andy Grove, writing about Intel, makes a good point: The critical
thing is how managers respond emotionally to a crisis. So often
people panic, deny the crisis _ or kill the messenger. A company
has to be open to bad news, take it in fully, and respond quickly.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What about other traditions that have a different way of
dealing with emotions?
 &HT;    A: In many Asian cultures you squelch expressions of emotion,
particularly of negative emotion _ which means that people are
getting eaten up inside without showing it. But I was amazed at
Asia's interest in emotional intelligence. In Taiwan, ``Emotional
Intelligence'' is the best-selling book of all time. In Korea,
they're starting to put emotional intelligence curricula in the

influenced by your ideas and technologies. And here is Western
science affirming our most deeply held values.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is emotional intelligence sort of bottom-line Buddhism?
 &HT;    A: It's very interesting. Buddhists read ``Emotional
Intelligence'' that way. Christians tell me it's about
Christianity. And Jews tell me it's a great book about Judaism. It

   Q. I want to put a picture of my band's Web page in our flier.
How can I take a picture of the screen so I can use it with
Microsoft Word?
</P>
<P>
   A. What you want is often called a screen grab or screen shot.
True to its name, it is a picture of exactly what was on your
screen at the time. There are slightly different ways to get a
screen grab, depending on which platform you are using, but here
are the basic steps:
</P>
<P>
   If you are using Windows 95 or 98 and have the image you want to
capture on the screen, press the Alt key along with the Print
Screen key (found in the top row of the keyboard). Pressing
Alt-Print Screen will capture the active window, and pressing just
Print Screen takes a picture of the entire desktop. Go to, in
order, your Start menu, Programs and Accessories, then to the Paint
program that comes with Windows. Open a new Paint window and press
Control-V to paste the picture into the window. You can crop it if
you want to and save it as a bitmap picture file, which can be
pasted into Microsoft Word or any word processor that allows you to
embed graphics in a document. These files can also be attached to
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using a Macintosh, press Shift-Command-3 when you see
the screen image you want to capture. You will hear a click, and a
file in PICT format called Picture 1 will appear on the top level
of your hard drive. You can open the file and drag the mouse over
the area you want; press Command-C and then Command-V to paste the
selected portion into the Word document.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are 13 million people in the United States
making crafts to sell, and over a billion dollars being spent in
the process. This could be construed as very bad news.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most recent craft production is more beautiful and
more technically sophisticated than it has been for 30 years _
since the heyday of American craft artists like George Nakashima
and Gertrude and Otto Natzler, the glittering era of modern Italian
art glass or the British studio pottery tradition of Lucie Rie.
</P>
<P>
   You can skip the hippies. Contemporary crafts _ that wide, vague
world of handmade ceramic, glass, wood, metal and fiber work _ are
no longer exclusively the countercultural mud cakes or the
whirly-twirly, funkadelic, post-modern confetti of the 1960s
through the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Crafts have become design conscious _ and the design market has
taken notice. From Barry Friedman Ltd., the East Side Manhattan art
and design gallery, to small downtown shops, crafts are being
included in a stylish vocabulary of modern furniture and
contemporary decorative objects. They enjoy a new peaceful
coexistence with home design. Think of them as ``contemporary
decorative arts.'' Or studio art, functional sculpture, painterly
vessels _ any of the phrases galleries and museums use to elude the
term ``crafts,'' which has an earthy, lingering stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been almost a taboo about objects made by
craftspeople,'' said William Georgis, an architect in New York
City. Georgis and his partner, Richard Marshall, a curator, collect
crafts, contemporary art and mid-century modern furniture. ``But
it's breaking down,'' he said. ``For me they're very appealing.
There's not the snobbery of an art object. They're functional
objects artfully made.''
</P>
<P>
   At Shi, a shop in the Noho section of Manhattan, handmade
ceramics like tea bowls and plates in a range between $12 to $60
are selling more strongly than production wares, to people who are
not collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting a crafts look,'' said Laurie McLendon,
Shi's owner. ``But the more educated people become now about design
and style, the more confident they become. You were going to do
Russel Wright dinnerware, now you do something less recognizable,
with a handmade piece. There aren't thousands of them out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Olnick, who with her husband, Giorgio Spanu, collects
paintings, Art Deco furniture by Jean-Michel Frank and others, and
Italian glass by Carlo Scarpa, has also begun to buy contemporary
craft pieces, including glass by Yoichi Ohira, whose work ranges in
the thousands of dollars, and basketwork by Masako Maki, whose work
stays largely in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something attracts you, you should let yourself love it and
learn about it,'' she said. ``There's a workmanship that's
incredible, but a simplicity that makes you feel the designer
hasn't overworked it. That's what appeals to me about the Maki
basket, the Ohira glass and the Art Deco furniture _ they're basic,
uncomplicated, but you also see the hand of the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanu explained that ``we never buy a piece without bringing it
into the house and living with it, to see the connections.'' He
added that collecting contemporary crafts could still be expensive,
frustrating pearl-diving. ``What keeps people out of the field is
the prices,'' he said. ``The bad work costs as much as the good.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Lipton, a New York Chinese antiques dealer who has
exhibited Ms. Maki's work, was optimistic about the expanding
choice among less expensive, more handsome objects. ``You have to
edit,'' he said. ``But $18,000 objects aside, these contemporary
forms can be quite reasonable, and are now easier to take a chance
with.'' Lipton said that he thought understatement, not notably
present in the contemporary crafts movement, had quietly entered
the field and was attracting new admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the thaw is the interest in mid-century modern design,
first fashionable, now popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen-fifties environments were very rich with craft,''
said Paola Antonelli, an associate curator in the Museum of Modern
Art's department of architecture and design. ``The quintessential
1950s environment, the Ray and Charles Eames house, is a
celebration of craft intermingled with design.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz O'Brien, the owner of 41, a New York modern design gallery,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craft was the detail of modernism that gave it depth _ the
textiles, the ceramics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Lui, a mid-century modern collector in Tarzana, Calif.,
said he began typically, with 1950s Italian and Scandinavian glass.

 &HT;    WB syndrome: Teens rule TV _ and how
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been said to the point of hoarseness that Hollywood is just
like high school, only with more money. But this is getting
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Television's infatuation with adolescents is spreading like a
nasty rumor about the prom queen. The WB, which does the best job
of any network of getting teen buzz, is also the only network
growing in audience rather than shrinking, and don't think that
hasn't gone unnoticed. Then add to the mix the escalating emphasis
on feature films aimed at teens, such as the upcoming ``Cruel
Intentions'' (March 5), a movie that hasn't even opened yet and is
already being touted as a possible TV series.
</P>
<P>
   It's pilot season, when the prototypes for new series are shot,
and there are so many new youth-must-be-served shows in the works
for fall that Fox has taken the unusual step of holding open-call
auditions for anyone ages 15-21 in New York and Los Angeles _ no
experience necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It's still too early to tell what the fall schedule will look
like _ a network typically commissions two or three times as many
pilots as it takes to series _ but here's just a partial sampling
of what's in the works.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cruel Intentions.'' Fox. The black comedy (see above) hasn't
even opened yet. The sex would have to be toned down considerably,
and the stars (Sarah Michelle Gellar, etc.) would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Brookfield.'' ABC. Drama set in a boarding school; one of
the producers is a 22-year-old college student. Not to be confused
with the WB's ``Young Americans,'' about an all-boys prep school
battling a blue-collar school in the same town.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Opposite Sex.'' Fox. Three guys enroll in an all-girls
school. A sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Wasteland.'' ABC. Another drama by Kevin Williamson, creator
of ``Dawson's Creek'' and orignator of the new onslaught of teen
horror movies. This one would track six friends just out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Roswell High.'' Fox. A drama that ties together high school
life and the Roswell UFO crash, of course.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Freaks and Geeks.'' NBC. High school drama set in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Brutally Normal.'' The WB. Another high school drama.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Carson's Vertical Suburbia.'' ABC (tentative title). Comedy
about a teen and his family in a Manhattan high-rise.

 UNDATED: Scandinavian glass.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I kind of poo-pooed the idea of contemporary glass,'' he
explained. ``Then I started to see classic, simple designs
appearing, and I went into it. My interest is design, not rarity.''
Lui added, though, that much contemporary glass, which he has
purchased within the last 10 years, including pieces by Richard
Posner and William Morris, was now getting expensive quickly in the
auction market. Lui has found newer names, like Toshio Iezumi, in
the Corning Museum's annual publication New Glass Review.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Friedman, who began showing crafts two years ago with an
exhibition of glass by Michael Glancy, is considered an important
pivot in the strategy to interest noncraft collectors in the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea if the market would accept this idea,'' he said.
``My clients came in to see 1950s glass or furniture, but they
bought Glancy's work, too.'' Friedman now represents work by
Bennett Bean, a potter; Mike Shuler, a woodworker; Toots Zynsky, a
glass maker, and 17 other contemporary ``decorative artists,'' as
he calls them.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the thaw is the quality of the new craft work,
at both ends, in galleries and in shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical element has been missing, and the contemporary
craft world traditionally has not been too rigorous,'' said Susan
Cummins, who owns a craft gallery in Mill Valley, Calif. ``But
expertise has grown. The level of skill now is quite phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to galleries that specialize in craft media, like
Elliot Brown in Seattle or Charles Cowles, Garth Clark and Nancy
Margolies in New York, galleries like Max Protetch now also exhibit
ceramics or glass next to painting and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Craft establishments like the American Craft Museum in New York,
the Smithsonian Institution's Renwick Gallery in Washington and the
new Mint Museum of Craft and Design, which opened last month in
Charlotte, N.C., must now compete with the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York for audiences. The Met currently has on view a
selection of contemporary ceramics, ``Clay into Art,'' through May
30th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums that heretofore have turned their noses up at things
made by hand _ L.A. County, Boston Fine Arts _ are including them
now,'' said Mark Leach, director of the Mint Museum of Craft and
Design. ``It's a way to bolster attendance and income. The public
has an enduring relationship with this area, the tactile world.
There's no intellectual substitution for wrapping your finger
around the handle of a coffee mug that's been exquisitely
designed.''
</P>
<P>
   But is craft art?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of tired of that battle,'' said Jane Adlin, the
curator of the ceramics show at the New York Metropolitan Museum of
Art. ``The idea is to get people in to see art. The process is less
important. It's like saying, `Did the artist use brush or a palette
knife?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adlin made a salient point about the effect of the
definition to a prospective buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about collecting crafts is that they're
generally affordable when they're called crafts,'' she said. ``The
minute you call it art, the price goes way beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Craftspeople themselves can be the most reasonable about the
issue of what they produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make decorative, functional work,'' said Peter Lane, a New
York ceramicist. ``It's not sculpture. When contemporary
craftspeople move away from design into art _ and higher prices _
it creates a new category that I don't find appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bonner, a metalworker in Providence, R.I., said, ``I
know craftspeople who want to be recognized in the fine art world,
but for me it's not a criterion I worry about. I enjoy them both.
I'm not frustrated about how I'm being perceived.'' Bonner added,
``A craftsman has a better crack at making a living if he doesn't
have the best crack at the high end of fine art market.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fought the battle about whether they were art for the
last 25 years, contemporary craft now stands poised to fight the
battle of whether they're stylish design, in some ways a harder
fight to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crafts?'' asked Brian Murphy, the vice president of
Parish-Hadley Associates, incredulously. ``You mean, those things
you see at crafts fairs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Murphy, an interior designer, answered with a nervous
laugh. ``I never use it in my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton said that his customers for craft objects were largely
adventurous collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers have been reluctant to use them,'' he said. ``The
word `craft' doesn't sound chic enough yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Calvin Tsao, a New York architect, finds handmade objects an
indispensable part of the language of interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design is not just an intellectual exercise,'' he said. ``I
love crafts as daily objects. Good crafts deal with details of
humanity.'' Tsao's own collection at home includes pieces he has
found traveling; he will stop the car to visit a potter's studio by
the side of a highway, and buy an inexpensive bowl from an unknown
artist.
</P>
<P>
   For more serious modern design collectors, the big question will
be whether contemporary crafts can hold their value as the market
tries to develop in their direction. Auction houses have entered
the fray, including crafts in their decorative arts category.
Sotheby's sale on March 12 in New York will include 50 lots by
craft artists like Albert Paley, a contemporary metalworker.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the real safety _ whether investment or esthetics
_ has been in vintage pieces. Kim Hostler of Antik, a modern design
gallery in TriBeCa, made a decision not to show contemporary work.
``The attraction of vintage pieces is that you know you might be
paying a high, but fair, price,'' she said. ``There's value
established in the piece, and you can resell it. If you buy new
work, you're buying on a purely emotional level.''
</P>
<P>
   For collectors like Ms. Olnick and Spanu, though, that is the
essence of the enthusiasm of living with what they collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play it safe,'' said Spanu. ``I must be driven by
the beauty of the piece. Whatever mistakes I've made, I've never
felt I've made a mistake in terms of the art of it.''

IT'S TIME TO ABANDON RACIAL BIASES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Reed is a political science major who hopes to hold
political office.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the 30-year-old Texas Christian University senior
is looking the part, dressed in a coat and tie with a closely
cropped haircut framing his narrow, dark-brown face.
</P>
<P>
   When he introduces Don Jackson, chairman of the TCU political
science department, he sounds the part as well. But this is not a
political rally. It is a meeting Reed has organized to inform some
fellow students, whose skin color has put them at the center of an
intensive manhunt by Fort Worth and campus police, of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to understand if Reed were indignant about the
way African-American males are being treated in the wake of a rash
of rapes around the college campus. Not only are police stopping
them, but officers are asking them for DNA samples, their shoe size
and their feelings about white people. Of the dozen or so black
students attending the meeting this night, half said they had been
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   What Reed finds most distressing is the enduring image of
African-American males as criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those aspects of America you learn to deal
with,'' he said. ``But it gets to you after a while. You don't feel
like fighting it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that he and the other African-American males at TCU
are victims of a society that clings to this image, and of law
enforcement officials operating under the presumption of guilt. Not
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rape is a heinous crime,'' he said recently. ``We kind of joke
among ourselves that whoever is doing this better hope the police
catch him before we do, because we're the ones suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Jim Lankford, supervisor of the Fort Worth Police
Department's sex crimes unit, said that police are gathering more
evidence with each offense, but that no arrest is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Four young women, mostly students living around TCU, were raped
between January and April last year, and one attempted sexual
assault was reported last year. Another young woman was raped last
month, two days before the spring semester began.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the attacker usually entered the young
women's homes through open windows, concealed his face and
features, and covered the victims' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that sketchy physical description, Lankford said, ``The
victims are telling us he's a black male.''
</P>
<P>
   And that alone, Reed said, has made him and other black students
targets in the investigation. Police, he said, have been stopping
them on traffic violations, and in some instances, have been
waiting outside their classrooms and making unexpected visits to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford said investigators are simply following leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, we're not unfairly targeting anyone,'' he
said. ``We're just following up on tips and leads that we receive
and trying to either confirm or negate them as suspects. It's
usually because we have more information than `a black male in the
TCU area.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know whether police have been operating within the
law without more information about each stop, said Jackson, who is
also an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. But this
much is certain: Police cannot legally stop a person simply because
his race matches that of a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stop every black man in the neighborhood that fits the
description,'' said Jackson, ``is not sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Fort Worth police have run their
investigations this way, targeting African-American men based on
such broad descriptions of suspects. But it ought to be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, police were accused of singling out black men
during a two-day sweep for suspects in a rash of attacks on people
in their driveways.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are given a gun, a badge and the authority to
stop and arrest people. That is tremendous power. The public,
however, has a right to expect them to use it wisely. Or at the
very least, lawfully.
</P>
<P>
   Despite prevailing attitudes, not every black male is Willie
Horton, the Massachusetts convict who was the subject of a
political ad campaign by former President Bush. Nothing, though,
seems to soften this image. Not time. Not the fact that most
African-Americans are law-abiding citizens sickened by crime as
much as whites are.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this image has become a filter through which many
whites and some blacks perceive black men. That is why it was so
easy for us to believe people such as Charles Stuart and Susan
Smith, who blamed black men for murders they themselves committed.
</P>
<P>
   What disturbs me most about this attitude is how it has been
internalized by some law enforcement officers, the people we count
on for protection.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that police might look at any person and
suspect the worst. They deal with crime and violence every day. But
far too often with blacks, especially black men, the presumption is
``criminal'' until proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, most African-American men reject the life of crime,
have never committed an offense. And they deserve more than to be
eyed with suspicion just because of their skin color.

GARDEN Q&AMP;A: CLIVIA CARE, APPLES FROM SEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DORA GALITZKI   
 c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clivia Care
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a potted clivia at home that looks very healthy. I
have had it for two years, and it has grown sizably in that time. I
am waiting for it to bloom, but it seems that I will not be favored
with a single flower this year. Can you tell me how I can help it
to flower?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have grown Clivia miniata for many years. Recently the
flower appeared, as always, but it never grew up and out of the
plant base. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a healthy clivia that produces many flowers and
seedpods. How should I treat the seeds in order to grow new
clivias?
</P>
<P>
   A. With strappy, glossy, dark evergreen leaves and an impressive
stalk topped by a cluster of red-orange, sometimes yellow,
trumpetlike flowers, Clivia miniata is an old favorite with
houseplant lovers. But we sometimes forget that nature didn't
design it to live in a heated house and that it thrives best when
conditions are reasonably close to those in its native South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   To bloom, a clivia needs to be on an annual cycle of warm and
cool temperatures. Starting in late October or November, the
temperature of the room should be kept at about 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, day and night, for eight to 10 weeks. During this time,
growth slows down, so reduce watering, although it is best not to
let the soil become completely dry. Flower stalks that never fully
elongate are a sign that the cooling period was not long enough or
cool enough. After the cooling period, keep clivias at 65 degrees
or warmer. They should bloom in March or April.
</P>
<P>
   Once the berries, or seedpods, have turned shiny red, remove
their seeds. Just barely cover the seeds with a well-draining
potting medium, kept moist but not wet. Then, grab a thick book and
wait. The seeds can take months to germinate. When they do, place
the seedlings in bright light (but out of direct sun), and go back
to the book. If you're careful and do a good job, it shouldn't take
more than three or four years before your new clivia is ready to
bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Apples From Seed
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wish to grow trees from the seeds of the apples I buy. I
have tried several times, with different varieties, but none have
germinated. Please tell me how to germinate and grow them. And at
what size and age can the young trees be planted outdoors?
</P>
<P>
   A. The seeds in an apple are part of life's lottery: a genetic
mix that is half the tree they grew on and half whatever apple tree
the bee happened to visit last. As in any lottery, there are more
losers than winners, and your future apples are not likely to meet
your expectations, but hey, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Fair warning given, there are two steps before planting your
seeds. First, apple seeds, like many others, need a cold period,
called stratification, before they will germinate: 60 days in a
damp paper towel or sphagnum peat moss in the refrigerator (not
freezer) should do it. Second, apple seeds are coated with a
chemical that inhibits germination. Normally this would come off
when the seeds spend a little time in a digestive tract. So after
the cold period, wrap the seeds in cheesecloth, soak them for an
hour, and rinse, using hot water 100 to 110 degrees. Repeat the
soak-and-rinse several times.
</P>
<P>
   Place the prepared seeds in a damp paper towel in a plastic bag
in light, but not in direct sun. They should germinate in about a
week. Plant three or four of the germinated seeds a half-inch deep
in a 6-inch pot, and keep the seedlings in full sun indoors until
after all danger of frost is past. At the latest, plan your timing
so that the seedlings will be outside by midsummer and have time to
harden off before winter.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the pot in the ground until next spring, when the
seedlings can be transplanted to your future orchard site (better
mark them so that no one steps on them). Assuming you have a
compatible tree for cross-pollination, you'll have apples four to
10 years later _ and finally see if you've won the lottery.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Orrin G. Hatch on
Wednesday introduced legislation to limit lawsuits stemming from
the Y2K computer problem, mainly by giving companies 90 days to fix
any glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have warned of serious economic problems starting
Jan. 1, 2000, if computers crash or malfunction because they were
not programmed to recognize dates beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of litigation stemming from those potential glitches
could take the form of customers suing vendors for failing to
deliver a product or service.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, a potential defendant with a Y2K
problems would have 90 days to get it fixed. During that 90-day
``cooling off'' period, anyone intending to file a Y2K-related
lawsuit must first give the defendant written notice of the
problem. The defendant would then have 30 days to respond in
writing and an additional 60 days to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said the bill is intended
to prevent ``frivolous and baseless litigation, but would not
restrict an individual's right to sue to mitigate real damages.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the legislation is ``especially important to
California, where over 20 percent of the nation's hi-tech jobs are
located.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to protect people's employment in this industry, it
is necessary to have some rules,'' Feinstein said, adding that she
became involved in crafting the legislation because she was
approached by representatives of California's hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said the bill is intended to encourage ``Y2K problem-solving rather
than a mad rush to the court house'' by imposing ``a brief
time-out,'' that would avoid litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said some experts have predicted that the world-wide cost
of Y2K-related litigation could amount to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the legislation is not intended to discourage
companies form solving Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any business that delays solving Y2K problems is putting its
entire company at risk,'' Hatch said. He said despite precautions
taken to solve Y2K glitches, ``there's still going to be myriad
problems that will arise and we want to make sure there is a legal
situation here that won't bankrupt the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act would
require a 90-day ``cooling off period'' during which no Y2K lawsuit
could be filed. That is intended to give a company time to resolve
Y2K problems and avoid court battles.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would limit punitive damages to $250,000 or
three times the economic damages, whichever is greater.

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLL0WS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require anyone filing a Y2K lawsuit to specify
the damages sought and exactly how they were calculated.
</P>
<P>
   It would also limit a company's liability to the proportion of
the company's fault in causing the harm, to prevent plaintiffs from
going after the wealthiest defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation was introduced Tuesday in the House by Reps.
Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., David Dreier, R-Calif., James P. Moran,
D-Va., Christopher Cox, R-Calif., Calvin Dooley, D-Calif., and
Robert ``Bud'' E. Cramer Jr., D-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The American Electronics Association, the nation's largest
hi-tech trade group representing more than 3,000 U.S.-based
technology companies, praised the legislation as ``a necessary
legal framework that employs balance and reason with a shared
responsibility to remedy any problems that may occur.''

 &HT;    Group draws strength from overcoming obstacles
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ TLC fell from a pinnacle no other female group had
even reached.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the group produced the biggest-selling album ever by
women, selling 10 million copies of ``CrazySexyCool.'' Radio play
of the hit ``Waterfalls,'' a sophisticated plea for safe sex, was
huge. And the video, in which the three Grammy winners turned into
mercury water goddesses, earned four MTV Music Video Awards.
</P>
<P>
   They were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   They filed for bankruptcy. One battled serious complications
from a lifelong illness. One went through a difficult pregnancy.
And one is still fighting a bad reputation earned after burning
down a $1.3 million Alpharetta manse.
</P>
<P>
   Now that TLC has finally released its third album, ``Fan Mail,''
the group faces yet another obstacle. In the tenuous world of pop
music, five years out of the spotlight can be murder on a career.
</P>
<P>
   But how Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins, Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes and
Rozonda ``Chilli'' Thomas, who transformed themselves from 1992's
condom-wearing caricatures to 1995's biggest crossover success, got
through their personal struggles has a lot to do with who they are
right now.
</P>
<P>
   And why, professionally, they'll probably survive.
</P>
<P>
   Trial by fire
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Watkins, 28, would come home after
battling her incurable sickle cell anemia in the hospital, only to
find the lights had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, that's what declaring bankruptcy means: You
can't pay your bills. Your power gets cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're sick.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes spent the past half decade throwing water on her
fire-starter reputation.
</P>
<P>
   What was lost in the headlines, says Lopes, 27, was that
then-boyfriend Andre Rison knocked her around so many times that
she blacked out on the June 1994 evening she burned down their
house.
</P>
<P>
   But she was the only one called crazy.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only one who went to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, also 27, was the last of the three to hit the gossip
columns, when she got pregnant in 1997 with her producer Dallas
Austin's baby. Never mind that she'd professed celibacy in Vibe
magazine. ``But that wasn't a big deal; that didn't even register
in comparison to all the other TLC talk,'' she says. ``That was a
living hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins makes it sound like boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me stronger, it made me rely on myself more, and it
prepared me and my group to do battle with the evils in this
world,'' the compact, fiery redhead says in a way that is,
surprisingly, not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is gravelly, but she doesn't growl.
</P>
<P>
   Rough though her words may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not going to sit on `Oprah' and start crying and say,
`Oh my God, they took my. . . . Naw. I don't want any sympathy. All
that's part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And living is much easier these days for the Dunwoody resident.
</P>
<P>
   Only once last year was she felled by sickle cell anemia, the
hereditary disease in which red blood cells periodically change
shape, causing excruciating pain and soreness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone stabbing you with a knife, over and over
again, like Freddy Krueger,'' explains Watkins, now a national
spokeswoman for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' bouts with sickle cell, made worse by the stress of
performing, cut short what could have been a profitable 1995
``CrazySexyCool'' tour. Soon after, the insurers of Rison's home
filed a $1.3 million lawsuit against Lopes. All that, plus having
to pay the group's operating and promotional expenses, forced TLC
to seek bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Then everything stopped. Except the talk. The jokes. And the
rumors about the group.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins got sicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stress can break a normal person down, so you
know what it did to me,'' says Watkins, whose swollen eyes this
recent evening at a rehearsal reveal she's suffering from allergies
only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wake up in the hospital, all those times I could
have died, and I would always see my mother's face,'' Watkins
recalls, her eyes narrowing with anger. ``That's when I finally
realized who really gave a damn about me. That's who had my back.
That's the person that loves me. That's the person I worry about if
she has something bad to say about me. No one else in the world can
say anything about me _ besides my mother _ and it'll mean anything
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Powerful role model
</P>
<P>
   Watkins credits her strength to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother finds that funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Tionne says that, I have to laugh to myself,'' says
Gayle Watkins, smiling as she puts up groceries in her Jonesboro
home. ``She's been strong-willed since the day she came into this
world. I don't know where she gets that `It's my mama' stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was watching the elder Watkins, now retired from UPS,
work three jobs simultaneously to care for Tionne and her younger
brother, Carnoy. Sometimes dinner in their Des Moines, Iowa, home
consisted of Kool-Aid and popcorn. But that was the way things were
from the time Tionne was about 6, when her mother and father split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tionne's been through so, so much, but honestly, never more
than I thought she could deal with,'' says Marie Davis, who
introduced Watkins and Lopes to recording star friend Perri
``Pebbles'' Reid, TLC's first manager. ``She's just always had this
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis could even see it when Watkins, then 17, was bent over the
shampoo bowl, assisting a stylist at Escape Salon off Stewart
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say `TT' _ that's one of her ghetto-fabulous names _
I'd say, `TT, you're a star!' '' Davis says. `` `You need to be
onstage.' `You're going to be famous.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No one had to tell ``Chilli'' Thomas that. When the Atlanta
native heard there was a female group looking for a third member,
``I was like, `I'm here! Oooh, I can sing! I'm ready to be the next
Janet Jackson!' ''
</P>
<P>
   What Thomas wasn't ready for was the verbal abuse she says she
endured from Reid when the R&AMP;B singer started developing TLC in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm, like, 95 percent almost me again,'' Thomas says as she
finishes off some fish from Piccadilly's, frequently splashed with
hot sauce from an industrial-size bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously. Pebbles gave me a complex. I'm not trying to dog
people, but you know, I'm just being very honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Being specific about the alleged abuse seems a bit harder. But
Thomas tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, I'm serious,'' she begins.
</P>
<P>
   Then stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't understand. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``That woman. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Finally she gets a complete sentence out: ``I don't know if she
had a problem with me or not. The other two she didn't do like
that. I don't know if she felt like I was a threat or what. But she
always made me feel like I wasn't up to par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long, long struggle back to confidence,''
continues Thomas, who like Watkins is clearly athletic, even in
baggy warm-up Nike gear. ``But I simply had to do it to raise my
son (Tron, who's named after the 1982 Disney movie, one of his
father's favorites). It's not about me now. I've had to get over it
and be strong for him. And I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's noticeable. TLC's 3 million-selling 1992 debut,
``Oooohhh . . . On the TLC Tip,'' featured rapper Lopes
prominently. ``CrazySexyCool'' was meant to ``grow the group up,''
Austin says, so it was centered on Watkins' throaty, more sensual
vocals. Now, on ``Fan Mail,'' Thomas' lighter, more pliant singing
takes the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may think I'm biased when it comes to rating Rozonda's
voice,'' begins Austin, 28, Thomas' on-and-off boyfriend of eight
years. ``But I'm being honest. I mean, I get in trouble all the
time for saying this: She's no Whitney Houston. And so what? You
can go into any black church and find those kinds of singers all
day long. But a special singer, like Rozonda, has a familiar tone.
A tone that makes people want to sing along with her, like Brandy
and Monica and Janet Jackson. With a Whitney or Celine Dion record,
you watch it from a distance and observe the vocal performance.
With Rozonda or Janet, you're right there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear `No Scrubs,' it doesn't even sound like a TLC
record, because we're not used to Chilli's vocals up front,'' adds
Kandi Burruss, who along with fellow Xscape member Tameka ``Tiny''
Cottle wrote the first single from ``Fan Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She delivers it well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I'm almost back to being that super-hyped girl
that came into this business ready to be a star,'' says Thomas, who
like Lopes has a home in Stone Mountain. ``I'm working toward 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology from TLC's first manager would help, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen,'' Reid insists. ``You know, we're all grown
now. It's time we assume responsibility for our own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid does concede, however, that they were once a major part of
each other's lives. In fact, all parties say the four were
inseparable at the start of this decade, planning what TLC would
look like and sing like in the basement of Reid's Country Club of
the South home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a slumber party every night,'' Reid says.
</P>
<P>
   Then it became business.
</P>
<P>
   TLC eventually signed with Reid's Pebbitone production company,
which then negotiated the deal with LaFace Records _ which is
co-owned by Reid's former husband, Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intermingling makes LaFace like Motown for more reasons
than the impact their music has,'' noted Nelson George, author of
``The Death of Rhythm &AMP; Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   When TLC filed for Chapter 11 creditor protection in July 1995,
claiming the group was $3.5 million in debt with less than $1
million in assets, many industry observers said aloud that part of
the blame was their deal with Pebbles Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who's going to apologize to me for diminishing my name?''
an exasperated Reid asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to apologize for people lying on me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to say `Sorry' for having to deal with the rumors
that she slept with my husband?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saved and filled with the Holy Ghost now, but we all have
to make our individual peace,'' adds Reid. After selling millions
of records (``Mercedes Boy'') in the late '80s, she gave up her
singing career and her Atlanta-based Savvy Records label in
November to lead a ministry called Women of God Changing Lives
Through Christ. ``I can't get into child's play.''
</P>
<P>
   Three lives get busier
</P>
<P>
   The serious business of rehearsing for TLC's ``No Scrubs'' video
was supposed to start at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is in the lounge of this mazelike North Atlanta rehearsal
facility opening up another pack of peanut M&AMP;Ms. Watkins is
starting to stretch with two of their dancers. And Lopes, well, she
isn't around.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she would be talking anyway: The official line from
LaFace is that the firebrand isn't doing print interviews right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, because in TLC's absence, Lopes was the most visible.
She hosted MTV's talent show, ``The Cut.'' She told Sister 2 Sister
magazine what led to her accidentally, she maintains, burning down
the Country Club of the South mansion she shared with Rison. And
now you can turn on urban radio and hear the first act from her
Left Eye Productions company, another female trio named Blaque
(``808'').
</P>
<P>
   The other two TLC members may not have been in the spotlight,
but they were busy.
</P>
<P>
   Though Watkins made her motion picture debut in the 1998 film
``Belly,'' she isn't thinking about acting anymore. Like pop singer
Jewel, she's written a book of poetry, as yet unpublished, called
``Thoughts, Vol. 1,'' which includes ``Move Out of the Way,'' a
poem about people who won't move out of the way for an ambulance.
She's also working on a Saturday morning cartoon and a clothing
line with Austin called ``Grungy Glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, meanwhile, is pursuing an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That we could round up these three very different
personalities with all these things going on and get them back in
the studio was a feat, to say the least,'' LaFace co-president L.A.
Reid says. ``Things, I promise you, are finally fine.'' Looks that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's after 9 p.m. and rehearsal still hasn't started.
TLC's members have pulled up in $50,000-plus Lincoln Navigators and
Land Rovers, not the sign of a group scraping for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fan Mail'' is out on Atlanta's LaFace Records, not the sign of
a group unhappy with its record deal.
</P>
<P>
   And Tower Records manager Keith Medlin says, ``Their absence
hasn't diminished this group's popularity one bit. I don't know how
this record is going to debut (on the music charts Thursday). But
with all the time away, with all they've been through, there's
still no one like TLC. All they've got to do, really, is top
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's nearing 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Left Eye has arrived. TLC is finally all together now.
</P>
<P>
   Step one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every housekeeper fights a never-ending battle
against dust. At times it seems that the dust begins to collect on
surfaces immediately after they are wiped clean. Actually this is
not an exaggeration, because the dust is circulating in the air
around us and it starts to settle when the air currents subside.
</P>
<P>
   What is dust and where does it come from?
</P>
<P>
   Dust is fine bits of matter that are capable of floating in the
air. It can range in size from invisible microscopic particles to
grains of sand.
</P>
<P>
   Dust particles are formed when a substance is broken down either
physically, through abrasion, or chemically, through combustion.
Every time someone enters your home they bring a little dust with
them from the outside. The best way to minimize this incoming dust
is by installing area rugs at all entrances. Encourage people to
wipe their feet before treading inside. Vacuum and shake out these
rugs weekly.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is only a small part of the dust battle, because
most dust in a home is created inside. It comes from two major
sources: the fabrics around the house and our own bodies. Clothes,
drapes, carpets, upholstery, towels and other fabrics are
constantly being worn away every time we move or brush against
them. Eventually the fabric erodes into tiny lint and filament
particles that eventually settle as dust.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the human body continually produces considerable
quantities of dust as it sheds dried out layers of skin. As new
layers are created, old ones dry and disintegrate into dust
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither of these dust sources can be eliminated, the best
the housekeeper can do is to pick up the dust as soon as it
settles. In spite of all the advances in technology, the best
dust-collecting tools are ones that have been around for decades:
the dust cloth, the dust mop and the vacuum. The techniques for
using these tools are basic and obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The only trick to using the dust cloth is in selecting one made
of natural cotton fibers. Cloths with synthetic fibers are less
absorbent and can produce a static charge that repels dust away
from the cloth. Dusting sprays are also useful because they give
the dust cloth or mop an electrostatic charge that attracts dust
particles. Sprays are effective, but can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to pull dust from fabrics is by washing, shaking or
vacuuming them. Carpets should be vacuumed every week because they
are major dust collectors. Every time someone walks across a
carpet, the fibers throw some dust into the air. In addition, the
dirt and dust particles embedded in the carpet abrade the
surrounding fibers to produce even more dust.
</P>
<P>
   Upholstered chairs and sofas readily collect dust, and they spew
it into the air whenever someone sits down. You can vacuum more
dust from a chair cushion if you place it in a large plastic bag.
Close the mouth of the bag around the vacuum nozzle and allow the
machine to suck the air and dust out of the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Most housekeepers ignore clothes closets during the weekly
cleanup, yet the closets are significant dust producers. Garments
shed fibers whenever they are removed or replaced from the rack.
This abrasion can be reduced considerably by keeping clothes in
individual plastic bags. Remember to vacuum the closet floor
periodically or the dust that settles there will be thrown into air
each time someone opens the closet door.
</P>
<P>
   With a vacuum cleaner, the amount of dust collected depends on
the suction power of the machine and the filter inside. In most
vacuum cleaners the collecting bag acts as a dirt filter. Paper
bags have a better filtration action than cloth bags; some can
capture particles as small as 10 microns. Special vacuum bags that
can capture particles as small as one micron are also available at
a higher cost, but they cannot be used in all vacuums because
require extra suction. They must be used in vacuums with powerful
motors.
</P>
<P>
   Dust is a byproduct of combustion. Whenever fossil fuels,
heating oil, natural gas or wood are burned, they are converted
into heat energy and combustion gases (wood also has an ash residue
that disintegrates into dust). The combustion gases carry minute
particles that settle as dust. Well-tuned burners consume more fuel
with less waste.
</P>
<P>
   Have the burner in your heating system tuned annually by a
heating specialist and make sure the venting system is well
maintained. In a forced-air system the filter traps airborne dust.
It should be replaced whenever it gets dirty.

A MAN WHO LOVED THE MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take much to draw Gene Siskel into heated debate on
some film-related matter. All you had to do was get him started.
Then his enthusiasm took over, whether on the page, on television
or after hours. I remember him gleefully backing Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, into a
corner one night at the Cannes International Film Festival about
eight years ago, arguing tenaciously that a new NC-17 ratings
category would be more useful than the old, onerous X. The only way
Valenti could finally escape was by promising to continue the
conversation at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that Siskel, whose death on Saturday at 53
came as a shock despite his very public illness, handled that
encounter with courtesy as unwavering as his doggedness. In a
profession not known for affability, he seemed the most gracious
film critic around. Even when engaging in critical fisticuffs with
Roger Ebert, his friend and foil in a partnership that turned
televised film criticism into such lively spectator sport, he
showed a convivial ease.
</P>
<P>
   In the more than two decades since the Siskel and Ebert critical
juggernaut began, film reviewing changed as dramatically as
filmmaking did. These two public personalities became such
celebrities in their own right that film studios placed full-page
commemorative ads in Variety after Siskel's death.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ebert led the way toward a more democratic critical
universe. Their prominence came at a time when films were newly
available on videotape and a new breed of film awareness, not to
say movie-mania, swept into popular culture. With concise,
thumb-pointing assessments and sharp disputes, they vastly
outshined their imitators and set the tone for armchair film talk
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They made the most of this film fever while also recognizing its
perils. As Siskel wrote memorably of one of his favorite films last
year:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad News: Jonathan Demme's deeply moving `Beloved,' a tribute
to generations of African-American women who survived slavery, fell
victim to the pointless hoopla surrounding weekend box office
statistics that compared a three-hour slavery drama with a
97-minute horror picture (``Bride of Chucky''). A journalist should
not argue for the withholding of information, but I'm against the
release of box-office statistics. Oh, how I long for the good ol'
days when cab drivers didn't ask me if I thought `Waterworld' would
ever break even.''
</P>
<P>
   As of 1985, Siskel counted ``Singin' in the Rain'' and
``Pinocchio'' among his favorite films, alongside ``Citizen Kane''
and ``City Lights.'' He was both serious critic and true fan, and
he found one highly visible way of showing it. His admirers were
bound to like him even better for having dared to buy John
Travolta's white ``Saturday Night Fever'' suit (a hugely profitable
investment, as it turned out). And for recognizing it as the only
disco cinema souvenir worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel, critic for The Chicago Tribune since 1969, will be
remembered for his warm, disarming persona and for thumb-raising
that could be eclectic despite the television show's mainstream
popularity. (His top five films of 1994: ``Hoop Dreams,'' ``Pulp
Fiction,'' ``Ed Wood,'' ``32 Short Films about Glenn Gould,''
``Quiz Show.'') And he, along with Ebert, must be admired for
displaying courage and dignity throughout the nine months since
Siskel underwent brain surgery yet did his best to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   He was in top form only months ago when he said of Jerry
Springer's lurid ``Ringmaster,'' ``In 30 years of reviewing movies
I haven't used the word `mendacious,' but that streak is now
over.'' Much too soon.

A PAINTER'S JOURNAL IN 3 DIMENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes at end)  
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What I am trying to do in this book is to write about the man
who lives, who suffers, who chooses to paint, who wants to have
vision, who suspects more and more that whatever happens, it
happens because of forces beyond him as long as he works. He must
provide that one force: He must be a man working.''
</P>
<P>
   So wrote the American painter Jon Schueler (1916-1992) in a
journal entry on April 14, 1978. As ``The Sound of Sleat'' reveals,
he had been ``a man working'' ever since he had taken up painting
in 1945, after earning a bachelor's degree in economics (1938) and
a master's in English literature (1940) at the University of
Wisconsin and after serving in the Army Air Corps in Europe in
World War II. The work of painting had carried him into the ranks
of New York Abstract Expressionists, which made him a contemporary
of artists like Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   But this apparently was not enough for Schueler. He needed
something more to allay the loneliness of his work, especially as
he was about to fulfill his longtime dream of moving to the Western
Highlands of Scotland. ``If I am going to be alone,'' he wrote, ``I
shall need the word _ if only my own on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   So in January 1957 he began the present book. Work on it went on
for some 22 years, until August 1979, 13 years before his death in
1992. In it he put journal entries and personal letters sent and
received, anything to create a narrative of his life and an account
of his search for artistic freedom. At his death the manuscript
added up to more than 2,700 pages, too many for a single volume.
</P>
<P>
   Friends had read it, including the novelist Russell Banks, who
has written an introduction, and felt strongly that it was worth
publishing. So Magda Salvesen, author's widow, and Diane Cousineau,
who had been a friend, cut it, shaped it, wrote a running
commentary on its contents and titled it ``The Sound of Sleat,''
which is both the body of water next to where Schueler settled in
the Highlands and a pun on the sensation that many of his brooding,
Turneresque landscapes evoke.
</P>
<P>
   To read the resulting book is far less confusing than any
description of its structure may convey. True, its time sequence is
sometimes hard to follow: framed by the editors' commentary,
Schueler's dated journal entries often cover earlier periods of his
life, not necessarily in order, so that one chronology nests within
another within another. But a benefit is that events viewed from
several vantage points spring into three dimensions. Besides, if
you get lost, you can always turn back to the straightforward
three-page chronology at the start of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest benefit of all is that with cumulative power the
entries explain the remarkable experience Schueler underwent upon
his arrival at the Sound of Sleat, an experience that allowed him
to record on canvas his simultaneous sense of rapture in response
to the landscape and his apprehension of death.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the pages, Schueler describes the daily tensions of
trying to make it as a painter, occasionally pausing to remark on
how little these details have to do with the true vocation of the
artist and how much of what he complains about is ``counterbalanced
with great ecstasies, happiness, laughter, humor, love, tenderness,
friendship, affection, parties, travel, rare good times, deep and
powerful friendships, loyalties, intellectual and creative
stimulation and challenges in the art worlds of San Francisco and
New York as well as in nature and in the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   What many of these pages add up to is an absorbingly gossipy
portrait of the New York art scene in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly the author goes back in time to deal with events
in his life that are mentioned without comment in the book's
introductory chronology but that strike you as potential time bombs
ticking away. Among these are his mother's death when he was 6
months old and the fact that he didn't learn of this until he was
12; his hospitalization during the war and ``medical retirement''
in February 1944; the extraordinary number of women in his life,
some of whom he was married to briefly, and finally his seemingly
sudden decision to leave New York for the Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   As he explores these matters in detail, they sometimes remind
you of the shocking end of Joseph Heller's ``Catch-22,'' where
Yossarian finally reveals what happened to ``the Snowdens of
yesteryear.'' The details of his past also reveal what Schueler was
after in his paintings, down to the decision to place his horizons
low on the canvas, as if one were viewing the landscape from the
vantage of a B-17 navigator on a bombing run.
</P>
<P>
   The book ends on a note of modest triumph so far as Schueler's
career is concerned, with his 1973 show at the Whitney Museum of
American Art, with substantial sales of his paintings and with his
dealer, Ben Heller, telling him: ``I think you are one of the
leading American painters. But few people know this. We have to do
something to make your name known.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration continues today. In conjunction with this book's
publication, several retrospectives of Schueler's work are being
organized, some of them to tour the country in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But a clearer sense of his power as a painter is conveyed by the
two dozen color plates in the volume and by an anecdote Schueler
records about a man who came to him during an exhibition of his
work in the Highlands and described how his wife, who had lost her
sense of color during a severe nervous breakdown, regained it from
looking at his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing Schueler's movingly honest struggle to get in
touch with and channel those ``forces beyond him'' onto the canvas
and into these pages, one can sense what peeled the grayness from
that woman's eyes.

   NEW YORK _ ``It made me very nervous, I can tell you that,''
said Carol Krinsky, an architectural historian. She was referring
to a picture on the front page of The New York Times on Saturday
showing the auditorium seating being carted out of Radio City Music
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krinsky, the author of ``Rockefeller Center'' (Oxford
University Press, 1978), was not the only one to feel a twinge of
concern over the sight of dozens of plush red cushions being
wrestled into a trailer truck. Anyone who had been cradled by them
during performances by the Rockettes, Frank Sinatra or the Who, in
``Tommy,'' might have wondered: Where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   Radio City closed on Feb. 16 for a six-month renovation
estimated at $30 million to $40 million. This will be ``the first
true restoration of the music hall,'' said Hugh Hardy, of Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer, architects for the project with the Rockwell
Group. Hardy, who is in India on vacation, says that the renovation
will include going back to original color schemes, fabrics,
wallpaper and carpet, as well as returning the famous armchairs by
Donald Deskey to their place in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't already spoken with Hugh Hardy, who swears he's
going to restore it to exactly the way it was, I would have been
exceedingly nervous,'' Ms. Krinsky said. ``Now let's see if the
owners will let him do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the interiors of Radio City Music Hall were designated
a landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission at a ceremony
witnessed by the lieutenant governor at the time, Mary Ann Krupsak,
a former Rockette. Its art deco splendor was created in 1932 by an
impressive array of artists and designers commissioned by Donald
Deskey. Besides Deskey himself, they included Stuart Davis, whose
painting for the men's room, ``Men Without Women,'' now hangs in
the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   What about the seats? While the metal casings, in some cases,
were still intact, the upholstery had deteriorated and been
replaced over the years, Ms. Krinsky said. The small lights on the
back of each seat and the distinctive black piping that made them
look so modern were long gone. The Landmarks Preservation
Commission gave permission for them to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not wildly fabled chairs, just typical chairs of the
day,'' said Evan Blum, owner of Irreplaceable Artifacts in New
York. He had been contacted about finding a buyer for the 5,901
seats by Radio City Productions, a subsidiary of Cablevision, which
leases Radio City Music Hall from Tishman Speyer Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, employees in the Hardy and Rockwell offices and their
consultants were offered the chairs for $75 a pair. Susan Arons,
spokeswoman at Radio City Entertainment, said that proceeds of this
sale went to ``Sharing for Children,'' but that the bulk of the
chairs had been deposited in storage and would ultimately be sold
to benefit the same charity.
</P>
<P>
   If they show up on the market, here's a shopper's tip. ``The
only ones worth anything are the ones on the end with the
decorative panels on the aisle,'' Blum said.

DENVER IS LAPPING UP THE BRITISH ART OF A NATIVE SON

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For some people here on the South Platte, talk of
``Western civ'' may conjure up the image of a Remington oil
painting of a buffalo hunt, not a Gainsborough tableau of a
steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   But since October, 71,000 people have taken the elevators past
the Denver Art Museum's cherished American Indian floor, Spanish
Colonial floor, Asian floor and American West floor. Reaching the
seventh floor, they have disembarked, sometimes at the rate of 400
an hour, to visit the exhibition ``600 Years of British Painting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I often start out with 8 or 10 people, but when I end up I can
have 40 people following me,'' Ida Rifkin, a veteran gallery guide,
said of the popular response to this wide-ranging collection formed
by two Denver investors, Bill and Bernadette Berger.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell Taylor, art critic for The Times of London, said he
sampled this grass-roots response recently when he wandered lost
through Denver's airport. ``The first person I met in Denver was a
little gray-haired lady at the desk where they receive ski
parties,'' he recalled. ``She immediately cottoned on to the fact
that I was interested in art. `Oh, well,' she said. `If you are
spending any time in Denver, you should go to the British art
collection. It's really great. Everybody loves it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The interest in American ethnic diversity that blossomed in the
1960s made Anglophilia an embarrassment to many American
intellectuals. But if Denver's response to tableaux of fox hunts,
sea battles, Cotswold landscapes and Elizabethan aristocrats is a
measure, British art, culture and history in fact still exert a
powerful pull on the American mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are voting with their feet,'' said Malcolm Warner,
paintings curator at the Yale Center for British Art, which remains
the nation's largest collection of such works. ``Just look at all
the crowds that have gone in recent years to the Jane Austen
movies, and now to `Elizabeth' and to `Shakespeare in Love.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Berger collection's 215 paintings are but a small
fraction of the size of Yale's British collection, Warner hopes the
Denver phenomenon is a foretaste of things to come in New Haven.
After a year of renovations that cost $5 million, the Yale Center
reopened in January with shows by three 20th-century British
artists, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Henry Moore. A bequest by
Paul Mellon, who died this month, has since brought $75 million to
the center, which he founded in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense that Americans are starting to realize that an
interest in British culture is not necessarily insulting to fellow
Americans of other origins,'' Warner said, speaking with the
caution of a British transplant to the United States. ``Whereas for
many years there has been a slight stigma about Anglophilia,
perhaps that is wearing off now.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger doesn't tiptoe around the issue. ``Why British art?'' the
Bergers ask in a preface to their collection's lavish 290-page
catalog. ``Because it represents a heritage that belongs to all of
us today, no matter where our forebears come from. And because the
British people and their culture did more to advance our material
well-being than did any other country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection stretches from a 1395 Crucifixion panel to a
stormy landscape painted in 1996 by Sir Howard Hodgkin. During
World War II, Berger, a fourth-generation Coloradan, interrupted
his studies of English literature at Yale to drive an ambulance for
Britain's Eighth Army. After the war he founded the Berger Group of
mutual funds here, all the while maintaining friends, business
partners and an apartment in London.
</P>
<P>
   After selling his mutual fund business five years ago, he and
his wife entered the British art market so forcefully that they are
said to have driven up prices. Although Berger declines to reveal
the cost of assembling the collection, art experts estimate that he
spent about $25 million in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening on Oct. 10, the exhibition apparently has tapped a
latent vein of interest in Britain here. About 20 percent of
Coloradans claim British ancestry. Every winter Britons account for
a third of the foreign skiers who visit Colorado. Last fall, when
British Airways inaugurated a direct daily flight between here and
London, it sold out for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The show greets visitors with a room dedicated to England's love
affair with horses _ steeplechases, horse races and horse markets _
which is not an unknown passion here. In one equine portrait, the
rider is a blur, but the noble steed is lovingly detailed, down to
the hairs in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Covering an entire floor, the show is broken up into small,
digestible rooms. Each is painted in a ``British color'' like teal,
plum or ultramarine and is equipped with comfortable armchairs and
sofas.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding a chronological approach that might make a visitor feel
deficient in his knowledge of the sequence of kings and queens, the
exhibition is organized into theme rooms: everyday life, empire and
military, medieval, landscapes and a central salon hung floor to
ceiling with portraits in the style of a great manor house.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits are devoted to stamps, coins, royal wax seals and a map
that shows California as an island and Colorado as an unexplored
wilderness. In the costume room, children can try on wigs, corsets,
an Edwardian top hat and Elizabethan lace ruffs.
</P>
<P>
   Each gallery has only one wall caption, with few dates and
names. ``We have taken the art history out of it,'' Timothy J.
Standring, the collection's curator, said over lunch at Palettes,
the museum's ground-floor restaurant, which is offering British
dishes during the six-month show. ``We have taken away the
stuffiness that has been equated with British art.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers often chose their paintings for their accessibility,
for their ability to tell a story. ``We are trying to get kids to
connect with art, to understand that there is a wonderful, big
world out there,'' Standring said. The exhibition runs through
March 28.
</P>
<P>
   To allow for more visitors, the Bergers waived a separate show
admission fee, heavily subsidized the cost of preparing the catalog
and donated $120,000 to prepare audio tours for children and for
adults. The museum, which hopes to become the permanent home of the
collection, charges nothing for the audio or guided tours. The
Bergers also have set up a Web site, www.thebergercollection.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers venture that, in Denver, home to four major league
athletic teams, art can compete with sports.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Berger said that 3,000 people saw the show the Saturday
that the Broncos beat the Jets before going on to winning the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said: ``We want to enliven the intellectual level of the
city, to bring a little more balance into our lives. Not all of us
are fascinated by football.''

<P>
   I come from a family of cabinetmakers who worked in Alabama at
the time of Thomas Day,'' Derrick Joshua Beard said last week from
his cabinetry shop in South-Central Los Angeles. Beard, 40, has
introduced a line of handmade reproductions of pre-Civil War
furniture by free black craftsmen, including Day, based on pieces
in Beard's own collection of original furniture. The Day
reproductions, including a pier table, side chairs and a secretary,
are known as the Sankofa North Carolina Heritage Collection and are
made of solid mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   Beard has been collecting Day's furniture for 10 years. ``If it
weren't for Derrick Beard's enthusiasm about Thomas Day, very few
people would know about his work,'' Joan Gibbs, a New York interior
designer, said.
</P>
<P>
   The line is handmade in South-Central Los Angeles and
hand-finished on New York City's Lower East Side by Eduardo Fontan
and Baron Perez, who polish each piece with natural varnish. The
reproduction Day side chair is $1,200; the pier table, $3,500, and
the secretary, $18,000, available on Web site,
www.sankofaheritage.com. reproductions will be exhibited on
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Antique Castle, 900 Park
Ave., Plainfield, N.J.; no charge for admission. Information: (908)

TETE-A-TETES WITH NATIVE FRENCH SPEAKERS, SANS ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was about a year after moving to Paris that I first heard the
question pop up from friends and relatives back home: ``Are you
fluent yet?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I would answer in the patient, slightly smug tone that
expatriates use with their less fortunate cousins in the New World.
Fluency in French, I explained (yawn), would very likely be long in
coming.
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, it was longer in coming than I had imagined. As
the years passed, the question ``Are you fluent yet?'' became the
more ominous ``So you're fluent, of course.'' Only the answer
remained the same: No. Proficient _ sure. Fluent _ pas de tout.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive me if, back in the States after three-and-a-half
years in France, I still get a bit touchy on the subject of
fluency.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is precisely what many French
language-instruction CD-ROMs on the market seem to be promising.
(``The fast and effective way to all-around fluency,'' says the
cover of the Berlitz French program from the Learning Company.) It
is hard, though, to imagine becoming truly adept at a foreign
language without being immersed in a setting where the language
predominates _ and having a live teacher to coax you through the
rough spots and force you to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that there isn't much of value in many of
the French language products. The CD-ROM technology, far less
static than a book or tape, seems well suited to helping people
learn a language or, at least, speak it. You can hear people speak
words and phrases and repeat them as many times as you wish.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially important for French since, for all the
beauty of the language, it can be daunting to understand. Moreover,
CD-ROMs can present a wide variety of written and spoken quizzes to
reinforce learning, and they let you find out instantly if you have
made a mistake. Some of the programs allow you to connect to Web
sites for further study, and all the programs reviewed here also
feature native French speakers, not the usual fare in many North
American classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature unique to language CD-ROMs is the ability to let
students speak and, on the more sophisticated programs, to
evaluate, to some extent, their attempts to do so. Several programs
come with microphones, of varying quality, that can be easily
plugged into the computer. The simpler language programs have you
repeat a word or phrase, then play it back, letting you compare it
with the words of the native speaker. The more elaborate ones,
using increasingly sophisticated voice-recognition technology,
actually assess your efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, users should be aware that some programs are rather, er,
forgiving in their assessments of accent and word choice _ much
more so than, say, a certain people for whom French is the native
language. Moreover, whatever the benefits of CD-ROMs for honing
your speaking skills and teaching some basic vocabulary, they seem
less useful for teaching the backbone of any language: grammar.
</P>
<P>
   And in French grammar, especially, mistakes there will be. We
are, after all, talking about a country where people take a
perverse pleasure in the pitfalls of their own language and avidly
follow on television and in newspapers accounts of regular events
in which a reigning French literary figure has contestants _
adults, mind you _ sit together in public and try to take down
correctly a complicated dictation.
</P>
<P>
   Learn To Speak French
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Company; $79.95; $50 rebate available until Feb.
28; Windows 3.1 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   The corny accordion music that opens this program, accompanied
by timeworn images like the Eiffel Tower and a vineyard, does not
really prepare you for the high-tech scenes to follow. Learn to
Speak French, the most ambitious of the Learning Company's
French-language offerings, does not miss a trick. It draws on
extensive video, audio and other resources to present an
impressive, demanding course plan. And its language-recognition
software is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The course is broken into 10 units, each with three chapters and
a short film about various parts of France. The first unit begins
with an elementary chapter teaching students ``please'' and
``hello''; in the video clips and animation that follow, students
are shown the words being spoken in context. A series of exercises,
grammar lessons and games allows students to practice what they
have learned. Interspersed throughout are useful tips about the
language and the culture. Each chapter culminates in the piece de
resistance: a ``conversation'' with a videotaped figure.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, it is impressive stuff, even if
the program did crash several times when it got to this spot. From
a pedagogical standpoint, I don't know how useful this exercise is,
but it can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The program can also be a bit unsettling, like many real
encounters in Paris. I, for one, felt chills go up my spine when I
was forced to have a conversation with the dreaded gardienne _ sort
of a super with police powers _ as she wielded a broom outside ``my
building.'' When she was unable to understand my answers, she
looked at me as if I must be feeble-minded and delivered a
disgusted ``Pardon?'' My knees shook. If I had really been in Paris
at the time, I might have thought about packing my bags.
</P>
<P>
   My accent aside, the reason she was confused was that my answers
did not track the narrow responses she was programmed to accept. As
impressive as the technology is, it does not, of course, provide a
real conversation. So when she asked me if I was looking for a
taxi, determined at all costs to give me directions, she was at a
loss when I told her I wanted a train. She also did not seem to
know what to do when, after she introduced herself as the
gardienne, I replied (with a rash defiance French tenants
everywhere would applaud), ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, another character reacted with aplomb when I told her
I had 16 children and that my sister was 120 years old and was a
prisoner. ``Interesting,'' she responded to each answer, ``very
interesting.'' When we were through ``conversing,'' she concluded,
``You have a very charming family.''

<P>
   French Your Way 2.0
</P>
<P>
   (Random House/Syracuse Language Systems; $69.95; Windows 3.1 or
later.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a thorough, serious approach to teaching French. But
because multimedia is not used in an imaginative way, it is not a
very engaging one.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shame because a lot of thought and work clearly went
into the lessons, and its voice-recognition features are
impressive. For the motivated student, there is a lot to be learned
here. The French spoken is impeccable, and the students are held to
high standards to pass the various tests in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is the way Syracuse Language Systems, a leader
in the field, has chosen to present the dialogues. A Syracuse
spokeswoman said the company had made a considered decision not to
use videos, believing that students learned better with a focus on
an audio presentation. In practice, this means that in lesson after
lesson, a student sees screens of panel cartoons with word balloons
that, when clicked, produce dialogue that is about as animated as
the drawings. (Syracuse also puts out Smart Start French, which
also relies on still cartoons but is considerably more lively.)
</P>
<P>
   The dialogues concern such staples of French life as a trip to a
restaurant, a visit to someone's home and making one's way around
town. Depending on their levels, students begin by listening to
simple conversations and watching as the appropriate cartoon panels
are highlighted. You can listen to the dialogue again and, in a
very useful feature, slow down the speakers (not that they are
breaking any speed records to begin with). That produces an
unnatural sound but allows the listener to get a handle on what is
being said.
</P>
<P>
   The French Your Way designers wisely allow a student to control
just how much help is wanted in understanding a dialogue. You can
have the words appear in French as they are said. You can also add
the English translation. Students are quite rightly urged to use
the minimum help possible.
</P>
<P>
   As you progress, you begin to guide the conversation, first by
using your mouse to choose from a series of possible answers and
then, when you are ready, by reading the answers aloud into the
microphone that is included. But be warned: French Your Way is a
tough teacher. Your accent counts. It caught some intentional
errors on my part _ and many more unintentional ones.
</P>
<P>
   The program is strong on grammar and pronunciation. It offers an
extensive dictionary that includes an audio rendition of how the
words should sound, which is a nice touch. It also comes with an
audio cassette tape to supplement the lessons.
</P>
<P>
   I question the decision by the designers to make the course
essentially without structure. Rather than following a sequence of
lessons, you can jump into it pretty much anywhere by choosing a
subject that interests you. The idea is that students will be more
stimulated if they can tailor the program to their needs, but I
think a beginner might find this more confusing than hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   Berlitz French
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Company; $49.95; Windows 3.1 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the other programs, Berlitz French takes a more
traditional approach to teaching the language. Students follow a
clear lesson plan, and while lessons can be skipped, you will be
reminded that you may be overlooking material.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Berlitz imprimatur, this is far from the most
thorough or even the most inspired language program. It is probably
of more value to tourists than to those who want to learn the
language fully.
</P>
<P>
   Berlitz French is organized into 12 units, each consisting of
separate topics on subjects like how to ask directions or greet
people. At the beginning of each topic, you are shown a list of the
new vocabulary words and phrases that will be covered, along with
drawings showing their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Within each topic is a series of exercises, including
fill-in-the-blank and true-false questions, and ``closer looks''
that provide additional information about the lesson. Every three
units, there is a review test.
</P>
<P>
   At any point, you can consult a dictionary or a grammar guide.
And the CD-ROM is accompanied by an audio-only disk that allows
more practice.
</P>
<P>
   Berlitz French also uses voice-recognition technology. But it
must be said that it was sometimes rather simple to fool the
program, sometimes by just repeating approximations of the key
words in a sentence. In one case, asked the location of the post
office, I was supposed to reply: ``The post office? Very close. To
the left.'' The machine settled for ``Post office close.'' ``Pool,
bus'' and ``theater hotel'' also made the grade. Not very useful to
anyone needing directions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   French for the Real World
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure; $20; Windows 3.1 or later, Power
Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   This program provides reassuring news: when low tech meets high
imagination, the latter is what counts. French for the Real World
has no speech-recognition software and makes no exaggerated claims
(``guaranteed to help you succeed in first-year French'' is as far
as it goes). What it has is a good sense of humor, a deft way of
enticing you into the program and an oily but likable guy named
Stephane.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane is your partner on an animated car race that takes you
across France. To make the trip, you have to undergo a series of
rigorous tests, from correctly trading pieces of fruit at a market
to negotiating with a sales clerk to buy something yellow. In each
case, the correct answers allow you to collect directions for the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on in!'' Stephane invites you in French-accented English
(he later speaks French) as he jumps into his blue car. ``The
language is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. Before you can go anywhere, you have to
fill out your driver's license _ along the way, you learn French
words for your date of birth and nationality. Then you have to
choose from a selection of cars. And finally, le visage _ your
face. You choose everything from your mouth to your eyes and hair,
with Stephane making humorous comments along the way. (One quibble:
many of these comments will be incomprehensible to beginners.)
</P>
<P>
   Then you are on the road with music coming from the car's radio.
Stephane narrates as you pass everything from cows to people and
trucks. All the while, a dictionary sits at the ready; you can
click on it to review the phrases being used in the lesson.
Periodically, a driver will pass you, lean out the window and
challenge you. ``Hey, snail!'' one says. ``Want to duel?'' What
follows next is a series of ``Concentration''-type memorization
drills designed to teach words by associating them with pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers can also take shortcuts, but only by proving that they
have learned to conjugate verbs. In one case, to build a bridge
over a crocodile-infested river, you must arrange the tiles of the
bridge so the right subject is aligned with the right form of the
verb.
</P>
<P>
   The language is lively and slangy _ like the way it is spoken in
real life _ and is punctuated throughout by quirky sound effects
straight out of the Saturday morning cartoon shows. While this
animated program is aimed at a younger audience, there is no reason
it should not appeal to anyone who would like to learn some
beginner French. And don't be fooled by its elbow-in-the-ribs
presentation: its underlying approach to teaching the language is
perfectly serious.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIDGEFIELD, Conn. _ Monica Brunen and her husband, Cal, live in
the kind of perfectly detailed Federal-style mansion that could
grace the cover of a magazine. So what's that bulbous green thing
sprouting like a mushroom at the end of their driveway?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tired of the mailbox getting knocked over and the rain
getting inside,'' said Mrs. Brunen, who replaced the family's
metal-and-post model with a one-piece, dent-proof, leak-proof
plastic mailbox big enough to hold a dozen magazines (no rolling!)
and strong enough to stand up to a Range Rover's nudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one friend who's a purist, and he doesn't like it,''
she said. ``Everyone else thinks it looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   That solid citizen of the countryside, the sheet-metal mailbox,
``U.S. Mail'' embossed on its front door, is threatened with
extinction. For nearly 90 years, it's been the punctuation mark
alongside America's roadways. ``One of the most beautiful things in
the world,'' said James H. Bruns, the director of the National
Postal Museum in Washington, ``is a row of metal boxes on posts,
stretching out on a winding road as far as the eye can see.''
</P>
<P>
   On today's winding road, plastic boxes stand out like Humvees in
a soapbox derby. ``They're big and ugly,'' said a Home Depot
salesman, who would not give his name. That's how customers
identify them, or as he put it: ``They come in and say, `Do you
have any of those big, ugly mailboxes?' and I know just what to
show them.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-piece plastic box _ the brainchild of John Sinchok, a
product designer who wanted his magazines to arrive flat _ offers
convenience: front and back doors with magnetic latches, separate
newspaper compartments and enough room for the latest issues of
Wallpaper or Fine Woodworking, no scrunching required.
</P>
<P>
   What it can't offer is charm. Compared to the sheet-metal
``tunnel'' designed by a post office engineer, Roy J. Jorolemon, in
1915, the plastic box is graceless _ an echo of that other boxy
gotta-buy, the minivan. With its top-heavy profile and
color-saturated skin, the box's resemblance to a sore thumb is more
than metaphoric.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been other kinds of boxes. The poor
have relied on assemblages of scrap lumber and cedar shingles,
while the rich commissioned elaborate wrought iron or masonry
models. But until now the humble metal box had held its own against
newcomers. A Quonset hut on a stick, it seemed to satisfy Arizona
ranchers and Kennebunkport swells alike.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the roto-molding, a technology in search of a
problem. It was about six years ago that Sinchok first noticed that
his mailbox in Macedonia, Ohio, left a lot to be desired. ``I hate
when my magazines arrive rolled up,'' Sinchok said, recalling the
``eureka!'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sinchok, now the design director for Step2, a roto-molder in
Streetsville, Ohio, spent a couple of weeks building models of a
box with an extrawide compartment. After receiving Post Office
approval, Step2, which was founded by defectors from Little Tykes,
a toy company acquired by Rubbermaid, introduced the box in five
colors. The company is still the industry leader, despite inroads
by Rubbermaid and others. Hundreds of thousands of boxes have been
sold, mostly through chain stores or over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Size is a draw. ``My mother sent a pound of candy, and the
package was too big for my old mailbox, so the mailman left it out
on the front steps,'' said Kathy Crane, who was mailbox-shopping in
a Connecticut hardware store last week. ``The upshot was, the dog
ate the candy, and the kids were crushed. So I needed something
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy lovers aside, the biggest fans of mega-mailboxes are
people who have their hands in them all day. ``People in this town
get a heck of a lot of mail,'' said Eddie Powers, a carrier in
Ridgefield. Too often, he has to ``stop the truck, get out, and
bend the mail with two hands to squeeze it in,'' he said. The new
box is ready for easy sliding and has no sharp edges, nailheads or
screws to damage mail or fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect box also had to be vandal-proof. In a trend some
people trace to the 1986 coming-of-age movie ``Stand by Me,''
mailbox-bashing has become a popular suburban pastime. Then there
are the snowplows and errant tree-trimmers that make the mailboxes
sitting ducks. ``We've had big guys at the plant test the new
boxes,'' Sinchoksaid, ``and nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But their greatest advance may be the ``why didn't someone think
of that before?'' back door. Frank Healey of Ridgefield remembers
the time his mother was sideswiped by a car's side-view mirror as
she was reaching for the mail; she broke her elbow and needed 15
stitches.

   Unlike injection molds, which can cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars and are designed to spit out precision products in seconds,
a roto-mold is a kind of low-tech, low-cost, high-tolerance metal
mold that spins on a giant arm. It's the spinning that distributes
the resin, a powder heated to the consistency of maple syrup,
through the mold _ often imperfectly. In the suburbs, roto-molded
swing sets and tricycles are increasingly common sights. In cities,
newspaper boxes now bear the genre's telltale bulges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Czechowicz, the director of consumer marketing for
Rubbermaid in Wooster, Ohio, said, ``There's a love-hate
relationship with the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gail's Station House, a gingham-and-french toast kind of
place in Ridgefield, a woman who refused to be identified said, ``I
saw one in my neighborhood for the first time, and I almost ran it
down.'' Local critics speak of a cartoony look, like the
Flintstones but out of focus. A decision to put the post near the
back, which makes it easier to reach the box from a vehicle,
suggests a disconcerting lack of balance.
</P>
<P>
   Probably there were some who didn't like Jorolemon's metal box
when it first came out. Its origins lay in the creation of Rural
Free Delivery in 1896, a centerpiece of the nation's
turn-of-the-century economic modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Bruns of the National Postal Museum said, ``farmers
didn't believe RFD would last.'' He continued: ``So they weren't
going to invest money in mailboxes. Instead, they used nail crates
and bushels.'' As RFD caught on, dozens of manufacturers began
making real boxes, often paying mailmen commissions for selling
them along their routes, an illegal and short-lived practice, Bruns
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1915, the post office, hoping for uniformity, began licensing
Jorolemon's design to manufacturers free of charge. It is still the
most common type of mailbox. Its appeal seems to rest, in part, on
the individuality it permits despite mass production _ the height,
angle and demeanor of the post, the placement of numbers and
letters, even the shape of the dents, like clefts in a chin, give
metal boxes personality. That they still sell for about $10 is a
tribute to the simplicity of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Americans seem to like their future high-tech. And so,
although it sells for five to seven times as much as its
predecessor, the plastic box is probably here to stay. New features
are already being planned. ``They're holding newspapers and mail
quite well,'' Sinchok said. ``The question is, `What else could
they be holding?' ''
</P>
<P>
   How about a freezer compartment, for those steaks you just
ordered by mail?

   NEW YORK _ There are no requirements, grades or academic credit
_ and no promises _ but the playwrights program in the Juilliard
School's drama division is a hot ticket, one of the training
grounds that hopeful young playwrights covet the most. The
atmosphere is charged with enthusiasm and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the program is Marsha Norman, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright. Along with Christopher Durang, Jon Robin
Baitz and occasionally such guests as John Guare, Terrence McNally,
Eric Bogosian, Wendy Wasserstein, Steve Martin and Spalding Gray,
she has been guiding this class for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday evening from 4 to 7, seven young playwrights meet
for a master class at the Juilliard School. Their new plays or
parts of plays are read aloud, usually by the other students. The
reading is followed by a vigorous and frank discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norman and her associates offer direct, practical advice
drawn from their own years as professional playwrights. They talk
about structure, characterization and motivation as well as
problems of production, including casting and the division of
responsibility between the writer and the director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high-intensity individual program,'' Ms. Norman said.
By involving working playwrights in the process, ``it is a
front-line kind of teaching operation, out of the trenches,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what they have seen and heard, the students rewrite
their work, and every other Saturday one is read by Juilliard
actors in a playwrights' lab. An advantage of the program is that,
in contrast to many other schools, the writers can have their work
performed by highly skilled young actors. At the lab as in class,
there is a critical colloquy among the students and the teachers,
with only one stricture. No one is supposed to tell the playwright
how to rewrite the play. The feeling is collegial rather than
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In a profession in which writers spend a great deal of time
waiting to hear from theaters and producers, the Juilliard program
offers an instant response. The class is like an artist's atelier,
with the teachers taking a hands-on approach to each play and each
playwright. Other institutions have sometimes had as many as 30
writers in a class. In the Juilliard program, there have never been
more than eight, and they are led by two teachers. Students are
given a certificate rather than a diploma; they are drawn to
Juilliard by the process.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, playwriting was taught _ when it was taught _ by
academics, with George Pierce Baker in the early part of this
century the emblem of Ivy League dramaturgy, the man who instructed
Eugene O'Neill and Philip Barry, among others. In some cases,
playwriting was taught by the book, one of the books being Lajos
Egri's ``How Not to Write a Play,'' in which the author arbitrarily
insisted that any play should be reducible to a one-sentence
summary.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, prominent playwrights have been teaching
playwriting: Edward Albee at the University of Houston, Romulus
Linney at the New School, Paula Vogel at Brown University and and
many more.
</P>
<P>
   The playwriting curriculum at Juilliard was restructured in 1993
when Michael Kahn became the director of the drama division. The
first year, the class was taught by Guare and McNally, followed by
Ms. Norman and Durang, with Baitz filling in this year when Durang
is on leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach playwriting by rules,'' Kahn said, ``Marsha
and Chris _ and now Robbie Baitz _ have a wonderful sense of how to
impart knowledge and criticism without getting in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of the young Juilliard playwrights are unfamiliar to
the public, but each has a strong individual talent and several are
on the verge of a breakthrough. Although most of them are in their
late 20s, each has solid professional credentials and several have
already won awards. And they are productive. These are not one-play
phenomena but artists with a growing body of work.
</P>
<P>
   This week Jessica Goldberg was named the winner of the Susan
Smith Blackburn Award for ``Refuge,'' a play about siblings
grappling for life support in a world of drugs and
dysfunctionalism. The prestigious prize is given annually to a
female playwright in the English-speaking world. Ms. Goldberg and
Robert Kerr, a recent Juilliard graduate, are also two of the first
winners of the Helen Merrill Award for Playwriting, a new prize
established in the will of Ms. Merrill, a play agent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Brooke Berman won the Francesca Primus Prize (for a
female playwright) for ``Wonderland,'' an anarchic comedy about
Hollywood and religion. She is also this year's winner of the
10-minute play contest at the forthcoming Actors Theater of
Louisville New Play Festival in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berman said of the Juilliard class: ``I've been forced to
justify what I'm doing, why I'm doing it and who I'm doing it for.
It's been an extraordinary experience to be in a community where
you're accepted and you're challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In his absurdist comedy ``Middle-Aged Hipster,'' Daniel Goldfarb
spoofs everything from academics who lean too far over the cutting
edge to the heavy-duty basic training of women who enlist in the
Israeli army. Another Goldfarb play, ``Adam Baum and the Jew
Movie,'' is to be directed by Daniel Sullivan at the Drama Dept.
next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The class' other playwrights _ Alexandra Cunningham, Adam Rapp,
Michael Develle-Winn and Deborah Laufer _ also have current
productions or ones in the near future, as do Kyra Obolensky, David
Lindsay-Abaire and others from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   One of Develle-Winn's plays is about Tupac Shakur. Of the
Saturday laboratories, Ms. Norman said: ``In Michael's labs, the
room is hot because all the actors of color at Juilliard have been
waiting for `Othello' to come up. Suddenly Michael's here, and he's
writing about them. There's electricity in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is practical rather than theoretical. ``What I think
is useful is for them to learn to think about plays, to watch them
carefully, as a colleague,'' Ms. Norman said. ``We're trying to
give careful, constructive feedback about what's clear and what's
not, what's moving, disturbing or dull. We almost never talk about
art. We talk about what works, about what's necessary. At the heart
of the failure of most plays is the inability to carry on a
thoughtful conversation about your work with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, playwrights are urged to audit classes
in other disciplines, like acting, directing and design. They are
given free tickets to Broadway and off-Broadway plays, and they
talk about that work in the classroom. Juilliard also helps them
find part-time jobs so they can support themselves while writing.
</P>
<P>
   In guiding the playwrights, the teachers call upon their own
experience. At one class, after hearing the first act of Rapp's
poetic play in progress, ``Dreams of the Salt Horse,'' Ms. Norman
said that first drafts of plays are often ``like character
auditions.'' Characters are introduced and ``you decide which ones
you want, which you really need,'' she said. ``There has to be time
for the audience's expectations to brew. It's like that great Toni
Morrison line: The audience needs to have a little dread before we
go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally there is a group assignment. One year, each student
was asked to write a nine-minute play about a cat, with Ms. Norman
and Durang contributing their own sketches _ nine plays about nine
lives _ with Durang's play informally acknowledged as the most
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 writers apply to the Juilliard program every year.
After the applicants are narrowed to 20, Ms. Norman and her
colleagues choose four, with three or four returning from the
previous year. Ms. Goldberg is back for a third session. Those who
are rejected often reapply again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the current students have already gone through other
playwriting programs: Ms. Cunningham at Columbia, Ms. Goldberg and
Goldfarb at New York University. Develle-Winn was discovered at
Howard University, where he was performing his own one-man show.
Ms. Norman found Ms. Laufer, then a comedy writer, at the
University of Montana in Missoula. Her play, ``Fortune,'' was just
optioned for a commercial production.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to talent and commitment, Ms. Norman looks for a
comic sense: ``Chris and I both believe that there's a kind of
intelligence that manifests itself through humor.'' It is also
clear that the course is in playwriting, not screenwriting. She
realizes, however, that most students, trying to diversify their
craft, are privately writing screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent class, three Juilliard actors read Goldfarb's
``Dulce de Leche,'' a dark comedy about a young married couple
haunted by Holocaust memories during a honeymoon in Buenos Aires.
Hitler is a character in the play.
</P>
<P>
   That day Guare joined Ms. Norman as team leader. Following the
reading, he said: ``What's so brilliant about the play is in using
the terrors of a wedding night to deal with survivor guilt. The
play is about the fear of the future and our need for the past.''
He added that he felt the humor could be even more manic. Shifting
to the question of structure, he suggested that there might be some
way to indicate earlier that the play was going to have such
enormous stylistic shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question you have to ask yourself is, What do we
do with memory?'' Guare added. ``You're the only one who can answer
that. In a sense, all American theater is about memory: `Long Day's
Journey,' how to keep the memory alive; Tennessee in `The Glass
Menagerie,' trying to get rid of it, but it keeps coming back. Your
answer will define you as a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   For an exercise, he recommended that Goldfarb write a draft of
the play from the point of view of the female character. ``You
might end up with only five lines from that draft, but it might
answer questions.'' He said it would also help the actors: ``Actors
are like truffle hounds'' looking for clues on the trail of their
characters.
</P>
<P>
   After the playwrights gave their comments, Guare warned: ``Keep
the freshness. Watch out for workshops! This is where plays can get
killed. You have to know when to say goodbye to a play'' and move
on the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The training at Juilliard is meant to be rigorous but
supportive. As Ms. Norman says: ``This is a place where it's safe
to be a writer. We have no agenda so if the work doesn't come in we
sit around and talk. The slate is clean, the door is open, and
anybody who writes something gets it read that week.''

A BRUSH WITH GREATNESS: MARDEN MAKES POETRY IN PAINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Brice Marden is an old-fashioned blue-chip artist. His
beautiful abstract pictures, early and recent, grace museum and
high-end private collections worldwide. His activities, inside and
outside his studios in Greece, rural Pennsylvania and his home base
of New York, are the stuff not only of art-critical writing but
also of ``Vanity Fair, Vogue'' and ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, recent paintings, drawings and prints by Marden, 60, are
being presented in a Dallas Museum of Art show that has drawn its
share of international interest. Walking through it is a bit like
bumping into a dynamic acquaintance of long standing: There are
intriguing changes, but the character is consistent _ as
intelligent and engaging as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by DMA Curator of Contemporary Art Charles Wylie,
``Brice Marden, Work of the 1990s'' continues through April 25 and
then goes on tour to Washington, D.C.; Miami; and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes about 50 works, most on loan from
collections. In varying degrees of complexity, each picture
features sensitively painted lines that meander, loop, jog and
otherwise slowly map their respective surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier works, the strokes of paint and the clusters of lines
they create echo Chinese calligraphy, which Marden claims as an
important influence. Moving into the later images, some of Marden's
lines retain a certain calligraphic irregularity, while others
thicken and become less halting and more fluid.
</P>
<P>
   In either case Marden works slowly, standing back and painting
with a long brush at certain times, moving in more closely at
others, looking to see what developments the painting suggests.
While in close, he also scrapes at the wet paint until bumps from
the picture's canvas surface emerge through the pigment _ a
procedure that further integrates paint and surface.
</P>
<P>
   When Marden was in Dallas for the show's recent opening, he
described his painting process, echoing his words with deft
movements of wrist and arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put one thing down, then go back in with another color and a
form that relates to the other forms _ like an echo, maybe,'' he
said. ``And then I make a lot of readjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of free association ... a sort of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Marden's work nurtures and challenges people who savor the
experience of looking at arbstract art. This is not always a bad
thing _ although Marden often makes paintings that are, despite his
best efforts, simply pretty.
</P>
<P>
   But the work, on balance, is both thoughtful and alluring. If
Marden seduces the senses through his use of color _ with celadon,
rich yellow and other hues that suggest Chinese porcelain glazes _
his best works also contain the aesthetic equivalent of dietary
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Marden has always been known as a superb colorist _
even during the '70s, when he was coating canvas panels with opaque
layers of color that resulted in, say, a putty-coated rectangle
hung atop one covered with gray.
</P>
<P>
   True, along one edge would be evidence of preceding layers of
paint, which suggested that what was seen wasn't all there was.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Marden for years was classified as a minimalist _
and more or less went along with that pigeonholing, presumably
because it helped him sell artworks.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, however, Marden changed what he was doing. He took
a leave of absence from painting for about a year and tried to
figure out ways to marry painting (widely regarded as the most
desirable art form) with drawing and line (which he loved).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always drawn, and I kept thinking my drawings and
paintings would eventually grow together,'' Marden said. ``But it
didn't happen, and I decided I had to get the drawing in there
somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I have now are linear paintings, although I never
consciously thought, `I'll do linear paintings.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese poetry and Jackson Pollock showed Marden the way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of layering colors one on top of the other as he did in
his '70s paintings, he began applying color in a more melodious
way. But, despite the obvious change, Marden's work today strongly
relates to his '70s canvases _ and in a way that shows how far from
minimalistic those early, opaque rectangles were. By opening up his
layers of colors now, Marden reminds us how layered and complex
were his colors 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity. Change. Simplicity. Complexity.
</P>
<P>
   This is engaging work. Go visit it at the Dallas Museum of Art.

SUBURBIA OUTGROWS ITS IMAGE IN THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Md., Calif., Conn., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)  
(mk) 
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Samuel G. Freedman is the author most recently of ``The
Inheritance.'')
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film ``Pleasantville,'' a teen-age boy named David
flops onto the couch of his suburban home, eyes fixed on the
television for a rerun of a 1950s sitcom, all banter about Mom's
meatloaf and the school science fair. Just behind David, meanwhile,
his mother argues over the telephone with her ex-husband about
who's stuck with custody of the boy this weekend. Before long, in
the pivotal moment of ``Pleasantville,'' he finds himself
transported through the picture tube and into the show.
</P>
<P>
   That scene conflates the two standard images of suburbia in
American culture. It is either the scrubbed and cheerful utopia of
such actual television series as ``Ozzie and Harriet'' and ``Leave
It to Beaver'' or else it is the miserable, materialistic dystopia
of novelists like John Cheever and Rick Moody. From either extreme,
the chroniclers of suburbia agree on this much: It is white and
upper middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In the last generation, however, suburbia has evolved in
startling ways, becoming ever more varied by race, class and
ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of perceptive
artists and entertainers. As highbrow films like Todd Solondz's
``Happiness'' and popular-culture phenomena like ``The Brady
Bunch'' revival peddle the same old cliches, reaping money and
praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug
presumptions, figures as disparate as the author Junot Diaz of
``Drown,'' the filmmaker Tamara Jenkins of ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' and the comic D.L. Hughley of the television series ``The
Hughleys'' are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel really alone in this conversation,'' says Diaz,
a Dominican immigrant reared in central New Jersey. ``The world
I've created feels lonely.'' He could be speaking for the fellow
artists who depict a suburbia of low-rent apartments beside gated
developments, of strip malls and toxic-waste dumps, of the
improbable commingling of ambitious immigrants, upwardly mobile
minorities and working-class whites whose security is imperiled by
downsizing and deindustrialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs have changed, but our way of looking at them
hasn't changed,'' says Rosalyn Baxandall, a professor of American
studies at the State University of New York in Old Westbury and
co-author of the forthcoming book ``Picture Windows: How the
Suburbs Happened.'' ``The stereotype has always been that the
suburbs are for rich people who ran away from the city, and there's
alienation and conformity. But when I teach my classes, my students
are mostly nonwhite. I've had 17 languages in a class. Some of
these families are taking in boarders. It's a big, big
revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Demographic data lend authority to what Diaz and Ms. Baxandall
describe. The percentage of blacks who live in suburbia rose from
23 percent in 1970 to 32 percent in 1990, the demographer William
Frey of the State University of New York at Albany has found. Some
40 percent of all minorities are suburbanites, according to the
1990 census. The Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park, which is 60
percent Chinese, has emerged as the archetype of the so-called
``ethnoburb.''
</P>
<P>
   The counterbalance to the successful movement of immigrants and
minorities into suburbia, though, is the deterioration of
inner-ring suburbs. These communities, clinging to the borders of
cities, have been growing poorer, more segregated and more troubled
for decades, losing population nearly as rapidly in some cases as
urban ghettoes. Several years ago, the federal government
surrounded its own office complex in Suitland, Md., a suburb just
outside Washington, with a chain-link fence topped by razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   The seismic shifts that have engaged scholars, though, have
escaped many of the makers and consumers of culture. ``What's
missed is the diversity of suburbia,'' says Greg Hise, a historian
at the University of Southern California who specializes in urban
planning. ``At least with urban novels and films, you see cities as
a place of freedom, autonomy, possibility. With the suburbs, the
writers and producers and directors are working with a set of
accepted wisdom. We see the same stories about suburbia because we
expect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, suburbia actually received a more nuanced
portrayal. Academics like Graham Taylor and Chauncey Harris
delineated a variety of suburbs _ commuter, industrial, working
class. F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``Great Gatsby,'' set in a fictional
version of Great Neck, N.Y., memorably etched the tensions between
old money and parvenus, treating Gatsby's social climbing as the
stuff of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   With the suburban boom after World War II, however, the
stereotype of nuclear families in split-level homes was born. If in
truth suburbia was already more stratified than that, with
white-collar Scarsdale, N.Y., virtually next door to blue-collar
Mount Vernon, the myth nonetheless reflected a certain amount of
fact about the fast growing middle class and the extraordinary
increase in home ownership. It was true, too, that federal mortgage
regulations and private covenants conspired to keep much of
suburbia white.
</P>
<P>
   Television mirrored this version of the suburbs to the nation
and the world. ``Father Knows Best,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' and
their ilk delivered what the historian Stephanie Coontz has termed
``our most powerful visions of traditional families.'' Homogeneity
was part of the package. Desi Arnaz of ``I Love Lucy,'' perhaps the
only Hispanic star on a network show in the 1950s, lived in the
city. So did Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) on ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show,'' one of television's first identifiably Jewish characters.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably the counterattack came, replacing one cartoonish
version of suburbia with another. Journalists and social scientists
_ David Riesman in ``The Lonely Crowd,'' William Whyte in ``The
Organization Man,'' Betty Friedan in ``The Feminine Mystique'' _
argued that beneath the contented exterior of the salaryman and his
stay-at-home wife lurked an anomie that Ms. Friedan called ``the
problem that has no name.'' Only the rare contrarian like Herbert
Gans in ``The Levittowners'' portrayed a nourishing sense of
community among the tract houses.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dollie Gentry was leaving church on a recent
Sunday morning when a longtime friend stopped her with a special
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hurry up and get my man Payton a new liver,'' the man
urged.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton, the Chicago Bears' legendary running back, is on
the waiting list for a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., but the churchgoer's faith in Gentry is not
misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry leads the country in inspiring organ donation _
especially among African-Americans. Although most of the organs she
helps procure stay in Texas, some save lives as far away as New
York, California and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   She has turned around organ donation among African-Americans in
the Fort Worth area since she became LifeGift's first ``minority
requester'' in 1992. ``We had one minority donor in 1990, none
before that, none in 1991,'' says Ron Ehrle, managing director for
the North Texas Region of LifeGift. By 1994, the rate had increased
to 60 percent of the suitable donors asked, and by 1995, it reached
a high of 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the clinical transplant coordinator at Harris Methodist
Fort Worth and a LifeGift volunteer, Gentry is now LifeGift organ
procurement coordinator. Over the past three years, she has asked
24 minority families to consider organ donation, and 17 have
consented.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry's success is especially noteworthy because, although
African-Americans represent 29.8 percent of the at-risk population
for transplantation, historically they have made up less than 10
percent of the donor pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need to increase organ donation across all racial lines
and ethnic groups is critical, but the gap between need and
availability is especially severe for African-Americans,'' Gentry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the development of ant-rejection drugs, only about 20
percent of the African-Americans waiting on transplant lists
require organs from donors of the same ethnic background or gene
pool.
</P>
<P>
   However, black recipients reject organs more often. And because
heart disease, stroke, diabetes and lupus take a disproportionately
high toll on African-Americans, black people are more likely to
need transplants.
</P>
<P>
   When she joined LifeGift, Gentry says, she knew no black person
who had donated or received an organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew a lot who were on dialysis because of end-stage
renal disease. They were not interested in transplant surgery
because they didn't know enough about it,'' Gentry says. ``We have
more hypertension and more diabetes in the black community, so we
have more end-stage renal disease. We need more kidney
transplants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry started education and recruitment efforts in the Como
neighborhood, where she organized a neighborhood walk, getting the
police and fire departments involved and giving out LifeGift T
shirts to participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we inundated the radio stations, especially the Christian
stations that a lot of our folks listen to, and we talked at the
Minority Leaders Luncheon that has its programs broadcast over a
religious cable television station,'' Gentry recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes success just takes the appropriate messenger with the
appropriate message at the right time, Gentry says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment of death is not the time to approach a grieving
family for the first time. The family doesn't need to worry about
whether their loved one will be mutilated, whether they will be
able to have an open casket, whether their religion approves of
donation, whether it's going to cost them to donate. They should
know all of that ahead of time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes death comes without warning.
</P>
<P>
   When Grover Stoglin died of intracranial bleeding April 27,
1992, his death was unexpected. He was active and in good health
except for his high blood pressure _ and he was 37 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden death was hard to believe, says his brother, Joe
Stoglin, who was reluctant to consider organ donation that tragic
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry reassured the Stoglin family that she had never had a
family who later regretted the decision to donate.
</P>
<P>
   She told them about the woman who came running out to her car to
hug her and thank her when she dropped by a home three months after
her 12-year-old granddaughter was killed on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother had been so deeply involved in blaming herself
for buying the new bike that she couldn't talk about anything else
when Gentry first approached her about donating, but she was so
grateful for the opportunity later, Gentry recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Stoglin's brothers and sister had never thought about organ
donation, but they said they knew their brother was such a generous
man that he would have given the shirt off his back if someone else
needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, Joe said, `You've convinced us,' '' Gentry says.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Stoglin's heart was transplanted into a 54-year-old South
Texas father of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It thrills me every time I think about it,'' Joe Stoglin says.
``Ninety percent of all my relatives want to be donors now. We, as
black families, were taught through the ages that you were supposed
to leave this Earth with everything we came with; but the way I
look at it, God wouldn't have given man the knowledge to do these
things if he did not mean for them to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Gentry, Joe says, ``She's a blessing.''

 UNDATED: tract houses. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novelists, in turn, transmuted the theme of suburban malaise in
fiction. Sloan Wilson created both a character and a catch-phrase
with the public relations man Tom Rath in ``The Man in the Gray
Flannel Suit.'' (Gregory Peck starred in the film adaptation.)
Robert Sheckley (``The Ticket to Trania'') and Frederick Pohl and
C.M. Kornbluth (``Gladiator-at-Law'') made their critiques in the
form of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was three naturalistic writers who supplied
literature's most indelible images of postwar suburbia as the
American dream gone awry. John Updike's ``Couples,'' set in a town
dismissively dubbed Tarbox, put wife- swapping into the cultural
lexicon. In a vast body of short stories and novels, John Cheever
painted the WASP elite in the moral emptiness of its country clubs
and commuter trains; the places he created _ Bullet Park, Shady
Hill, St. Botolphs _ defined a social geography that could be
reduced to the shorthand ``Cheever Country.'' Philip Roth,
meanwhile, disposed of the ethnic arrivistes, typified by the
gauche and acquisitive Patimkin family in his novella ``Goodbye,
Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   The young radicals of the 1960s put the critique in overtly
political terms. In their founding manifesto, the Port Huron
Statement, the Students for a Democratic Society pointedly
described themselves as having been ``bred in at least modest
comfort'' in ``the wealthiest and strongest country in the world''
and yet ``looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.''
Suburbia, in other words, was something to rebel against.
</P>
<P>
   Folk music took up the cry. Malvina Reynolds' 1963 song ``Little
Boxes,'' later covered by Pete Seeger, reduced suburbia to the
refrain ``Little boxes, little boxes, little boxes all the same.''
The contempt for suburbia became so nearly unanimous in the
emerging youth culture that even the Brill Building songwriters
Gerry Goffin and Carole King and the made-for-television band the
Monkees collaborated on ``Pleasant Valley Sunday.'' ``Another
Pleasant Valley Sunday,'' went its chorus, ``charcoal burning
everywhere. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday here in status symbol
land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dylan or the later Beatles had been singing that, being
social critics, it almost would have been expected,'' says Paul
Levinson, a visiting professor of communications at Fordham
University in New York. ``But the Monkees _ they're so suburban
themselves, in effect. It's as if suburban people themselves were
skewering the vacuity of their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such perceptions continue to thrive in some of the most highly
praised recent films. Even as affirmative action, mass immigration
and growing income inequality have altered the shape of suburbia,
these movies, whether satirical, realistic or fantastical in tone,
trot out all the familiar indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Ang Lee's screen adaptation of ``The Ice Storm,'' Rick Moody's
novel about family discord in affluent New Canaan, Conn., had as
its centerpiece that hoariest of cliches, a ``key party'' in which
married couples trade partners. Peter Weir's ``Truman Show'' puts a
patina of fantasy on its predictable attacks. Truman Burbank, an
insurance agent whose life is the subject of a continuous sitcom,
literally cannot escape the oppressive perfection of a
made-for-television suburb called Sea Haven.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by Gary Ross, ``Pleasantville'' carries
a similar sensibility to even more overwrought ends. The visual
conceit of the film _ that the eponymous suburb is shown in black
and white _ merely hints at the didactic style. It takes David, the
teen-ager deposited from the 1990s, to bring art, emotion and color
to town, and when he does, such predictable villains as the local
bowling league and the Chamber of Commerce respond by desecrating
paintings and burning books in Nazi style. The World War II
veterans who thronged to actual suburbs in the 1950s might quibble
ever so slightly with Ross' choice of analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Solondz, a native of New Jersey who calls his production
company Suburban Pictures, means to speak for the misfits in a
monochromatic world. His debut film, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,''
centers on a girl gawkily teetering into puberty who is tormented
by her classmates and ignored by her family. In tracing the lives
of an extended family in his next feature, ``Happiness,'' Solondz
reserves his greatest affection for the outsiders among them _ a
failed songwriter, a boy discovering his sexuality, a grandmother
being divorced by her husband of 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such compassion, though, relies on cheap shots against whatever
or whomever represents the suburban status quo. The white-collar
father in ``Happiness,'' a Cheeveresque figure with his car phone
and rep tie, cannot simply be unmasked as a hypocrite or a souse;
no, he turns out to be a pederast who rapes his son's playmates.
When Solondz's camera in ``Dollhouse'' surveys a suburban home, it
lingers over a veritable catalog of bad taste _ gaudy afghans,
mismatched paneling, green shag carpet, cabinets stuffed with
Yodels and Ring Dings. This kind of satire, far from seeking to jar
an audience out of its complacency, sneers along with it from a
superior distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, people are always putting New Jersey down,'' says
Helen, a writer who is a major character in ``Happiness.'' ``None
of my friends can actually believe I live here. But that's because
they don't get it. I'm living in a state of irony.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony, though, is an indulgence of the entitled. The material
comforts ridiculed in a film like ``Happiness'' shimmer like
mirages for the artists of new suburbia. Tamara Jenkins, the writer
and director of the autobiographical film ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' (1998), grew up with a car-salesman father obsessed with
getting his children into the renowned schools of that tony Los
Angeles suburb. That meant bouncing from apartment to apartment,
often with an unpaid landlord in the family's wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone like me, who didn't have things, the usual
middle-class sitcoms created an anxiety, an inferiority complex,''
Ms. Jenkins says. ``With `The Brady Bunch' I was fixated on the
architecture; their house had an upstairs and a downstairs. I used
to wonder, How did the people on the shows get that stuff _
couches, end tables, clothes? Because we had so much trouble
accumulating stuff.''

   She says she ``identified with the black sitcoms _ `Good Times,'
`Sanford and Son' _ because those people were struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember an episode when Fred Sanford was flying and had
never been on a plane before and brought his own food. That was
something I understood.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Jenkins ultimately put her experience onto film, not
even her colleagues quite understood just how marginal suburban
life could be. ``After shooting the interiors of the apartments,
people got concerned it looked too depressing,'' she recalls. ``It
was like, `Oh, all the walls are so bare. Can't we put some color
in there?' I'd told the production designer that these apartments
are bare except for what the previous tenant left behind. They
said, `But it's a comedy.' I said, `You read the script; poverty is
not funny.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bogosian captured a similarly tenuous existence in his 1994
play ``Suburbia,'' which was later filmed by Richard Linklater. The
characters, gathering nightly around a convenience store, have been
through the military or menial jobs, and their sense of stunted
horizons and vanished opportunities infuses several of the most
dramatic scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a high school classmate-turned-rock-star arrives
at the convenience store in his limousine. One of the regulars, a
former football star now drinking away his nights, starts to flirt
with the musician's young publicity agent. ``You think we're alike,
Erica?'' he asks. ``Deep down, way down,'' she answers. He fixes
her in his stare and says, ``It's a mistake to think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in ``Suburbia,'' a girl from the convenience-store group
overdoses. The Pakistani manager, already exasperated by the
``drunks'' and ``bums'' on his property, cries: ``You people are so
stupid! What's wrong with you? Throw it all away. You throw it all
away.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bogosian cites several influences on ``Suburbia'' _ the
television show ``Roseanne'' and Donna Gaines' book about a plague
of suburban suicides, ``Teen-Age Wasteland'' _ he drew primarily on
his own past. Bogosian grew up as the son of a bookkeeper and a
hairdresser in Woburn, Mass., the same blue-collar suburb of Boston
that is the setting for the book, and now the film, ``A Civil
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't writing about `The Other,''' Bogosian says. ``I
wasn't writing about the exotic. A lot of my experience in Woburn
had to do with class. One of my best friends' fathers was a
carpenter. Another was a truck driver. I had a friend whose father
was a laborer, who'd come home from the job and lay on the couch
and get drunk. We were being told in school that Woburn was a town
to be proud of because it'd been a capital of shoe manufacturing in
the 1890s. But we knew that was all gone. When I ran cross-country
in high school, I went past all the empty factories.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants like Junot Diaz have often inherited exactly such
suburbs, and many of the short stories in ``Drown'' capture the
social geography in meticulous detail. Diaz's characters live, as
his actual family did, in a low-income apartment complex surrounded
by the malls, cineplexes and municipal pools of the middle class.
The autobiographical Yunior, as much as he is a bilingual and
bicultural figure, does what so many Anglo suburban children before
him have done: get car-sick on family trips to relatives in New
York; take a boring job in the shapeless years after college;
experiment with sex in the basement; waste afternoons smoking pot.
</P>
<P>
   In painting this milieu, Diaz came to realize his distance not
only from the white chroniclers of suburban privilege but also from
black and Hispanic writers who, like him, were reared outside the
city. ``One of the things I see in an MFA program is how many of
the writers of color are from very middle-class backgrounds,'' says
Diaz, who teaches at Syracuse University. ``But what they portray
are low-income people. You can't begrudge anybody what they want to
write about. But it shows that even writers are responding to
pre-set notions of who `we' are and how `we' are supposed to be
viewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere may such self-abnegation be more pronounced than in rap
music. Such bands and performers as EPMD, Public Enemy, Busta
Rhymes and Boss were reared in suburbia but rarely if ever reflect
it in their songs. The most extreme example, Ice Cube, spent much
of his childhood in a Los Angeles suburb attending integrated
schools and then a trade college. Yet he went on to fame for his
gangsta raps celebrating drug deals, drive-by shootings and sexual
conquests in the South-Central slums that his own family had
labored to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because hip-hop started off in the inner city, the street was
the place where you had to get your pedigree,'' says S.H. Fernando
Jr., a rap producer and the author of the social history ``The New
Beats: Exploring the Music, Culture and Attitudes of Hip-Hop.''
``You hear a lot of rappers saying, `You have to represent' _
meaning represent the inner-city lifestyle, the 'hood, even if you
didn't come from it. The suburbs are seen as corny, bland, Middle
America. Who wants to know about that?''
</P>
<P>
   As if to answer that question, every Tuesday night several
million viewers watch the ABC sitcom ``The Hughleys,'' the story of
a middle-class black named Darryl Hughley who has just moved with
his family into a mostly white suburb. The running gag of the show
relies on Darryl's belief that his neighbor Dave is a closet bigot.
``The man does wear a lot of flannel,'' Darryl says to his wife in
one episode, ``and he got those big belt buckles, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The most trenchant moments come when Hughley himself, the owner
of a vending-machine company, grapples with his fear that by moving
his family out of a black, urban neighborhood he has compromised
his racial identity and solidarity. ``You're on the slippery slope
to lose your blackness,'' a friend from Los Angeles chides Darryl
in the series pilot. Later in the episode, having watched his
daughter choose a white doll rather than a black one in a toy
store, Darryl moans, ``I feel like a stranger in a strange land.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that land surely looks stranger to the artists and audiences
who remain stuck in the stock images of ``Beaver'' and Cheever than
it possibly could to someone like Darryl Hughley, who is both a
pioneer and a citizen of the new suburbia.

BAD ENERGY ATTRACTS RATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday Feb. 26)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if New Yorkers do not have problems enough already, what with
trigger-happy cops and the very real possibility that Hillary
Clinton will be their next senator, a self-described ``angel
therapist'' has suggested that the city's sewer rat problem may be
caused by New Yorkers' surly attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Angels Guide,'' author Belinda Womack says sewer
rats are psychic sponges that absorb negative energy from humans.
</P>
<P>
   New York has an abundance of rats, she says, because residents
have negative attitudes and foul moods that magnetically attract
rats.
</P>
<P>
   If New Yorkers could ``... create a reality of joy, oneness and
good,'' she says, then the negative feelings would disappear along
with the rats.
</P>
<P>
   While one might wonder if it is not the surly rats whose
negative energy is responsible for attracting swarms of
disease-ridden New Yorkers to New York, I think that Ms. Womack may
well be on to something here, and not simply a new species of
hallucinogenic mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   I am often in a cranky mood (out of beer, can't find the TV
remote, no clean underwear, you name it), which could explain why
my yard is overrun with fire ants. Fire ants are much meaner than
rats. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if rats moved to New York to
get as far away from them as possible. There are some chemicals
that would take care of my fire ant problem, but they're expensive,
smelly and, from what I've been told, cannot be applied from the
confines of one's air-conditioned living room while watching senior
golf on TV.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution, I see now, is to simply think happy, generous
thoughts about fire ants and then watch them march off toward the
yard of my neighbor, whom I've always found to be annoyingly jovial
and badly in need of something to send him spiraling down the black
hole of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will take more than the threat of rats or fire
ants to make some people rewire their energy generators from
negative to positive. Take Congress, for instance. (There is so
much negative energy in Washington that some congressmen have even
started looking like rats. Take Henry Hyde for instance.) Could, as
Womack described it, the ``reality of joy, oneness and good'' have
prevented the mess we just went through if the House of
Representatives had looked upon President Clinton not as
``impeachable'' but as ``handsome, neatly coifed and
approachable?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   As with New Yorkers and sewer rats, it's hard to tell whether
negative vibrations bring on unpleasant consequences or the other
way around. I have entered restaurants exuding such positive
vibrations that I half expected to be charged for leaving visible
pits in the walls. Yet that sunny aura is not always sufficient to
ward off unpleasant consequences, including, but not limited to,
the waiter who quit immediately after taking our order. (This
actually happened. We never learned what set him off; perhaps the
thought of serving up yet another grouper amandine was more than he
could bear.)
</P>
<P>
   Service in a restaurant can be fast or slow for a variety of
reasons, but having one's waiter quit before the salad course
arrives is not a possibility that pops first into most people's
minds, ours included.
</P>
<P>
   This incident happened years ago and it is possible that we may
have been sitting there to this day, staring forlornly at our empty
bread plates, wondering if the calamari appetizer we ordered had
arrived yet from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately another waiter became curious as to why two people
would sit in a restaurant booth for four hours without ordering any
food or even a glass of water and explained the situation, as best
as a situation of that sort can be explained.
</P>
<P>
   My vibrations, needless to say, were considerably less positive
upon leaving the restaurant, but not so bad that I was besieged by
rats.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably a good thing because, hungry as I was, I might
have eaten one.
</P>

V-6 ENGINE A BIG BOOST FOR SUZUKI  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, FEB. 27)

<P>
   PHOENIX - Pleasant surprises arrive in all shapes and sizes. And
sometimes it's true that good things come in small packages.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope nobody takes offense when I say:
</P>
<P>
   Despite its weird name, the 1999 Grand Vitara is such a
good-looking, nice-driving vehicle, it's hard to believe that
Suzuki builds it.
</P>
<P>
   As a motorcycle builder, Suzuki earns top marks, especially for
its hyper sport bikes. But as an automaker, Suzuki's record has
been spotty, offering little more than basic transportation at a
budget price.
</P>
<P>
   From the much-maligned Samurai to the diminutive Swift, Suzuki
has fallen consistently into the lower tier of Japanese automakers.
Granted, the motorcycle champ came onto the automotive field late
in the game, but it still rates consistently behind such stalwarts
as Toyota and Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6-powered Grand Vitara could be the start of a whole new
role for Suzuki. With a new body and chassis, it's so much better
than Suzuki's last subcompact sport-utility vehicle, the boxy
Sidekick, that it ascends to a new category. Now, it's no longer a
budget compromise but a desirable sport ute in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the only thing held over is the reasonable price tag,
competing well against Toyota and Honda.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing tinny about the Grand Vitara, unlike Suzukis of
the past. Doors close with a solid thunk, and the interior feels
roomy and well-finished, not at all spartan or cheaply made.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Vitara is powered by a V-6 engine that performs quietly,
smoothly and strongly. The demi-truck also steers and handles
nicely. It's equipped with a rugged, trucklike four-wheel-drive
system for fairly serious off-road excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the new Vitara comes a new Tracker for Chevrolet,
also much improved. The body and underpinnings are pretty much
identical, except the Tracker doesn't get all the stylish plastic
body cladding of the Grand Vitara. It looks better without it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Tracker doesn't receive the benefit of the V-6 until
next year, apparently so that Suzuki can reap the benefit of the
upgrade without competition from its stronger partner. A recent
road test of the four-cylinder Tracker found it to be eager, fun to
drive and a giant step up from the previous version.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder is not as strong, smooth or quiet as the V-6,
but it's not bad, either. It cruises well at highway speeds, and
accelerates well, at least with the five-speed stick shift of our
tester.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 engine, though, really transforms the Grand Vitara,
making it seem more substantial and generally quieter, especially
on the freeway. Acceleration is strong but not too brisk, with a
feeling of torque, like a truck, rather than horsepower, like a
car.
</P>
<P>
   But let's get down to brass tacks here: Grand Vitara is a
ridiculous name that sounds more like a lodge leader than a sport
ute. Really, what were they thinking? After such cool names as
Samurai and Sidekick (for fairly mundane vehicles), whoever thought
that a name like Grand Vitara would help attract people to buy
Suzukis?
</P>
<P>
   Not me.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki started the whole genre of mini-sport-utility vehicle,
with the teeny Samurai, which received a nasty reputation for
flipping over, followed by the better-designed Sidekick, which
became the double for the Chevrolet Tracker. Korean automaker Kia
followed suit with its attractive but limited Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Toyota and Honda, which moved up the bar
considerably with their well-turned-out mini-utes, the RAV4 and
CRV, respectively. And Subaru, champion of all-wheel-drive cars,
came up with its Forester model, which is really a trucklike body
on the subcompact Impreza automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it looks like Suzuki (and Chevy) have something to offer
that rivals RAV4 and CRV, and in some respects, tops them.
Especially with price tags starting under $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 is a major boost, though Honda plans to offer one soon
in the popular CRV. The other is Grand Vitara/Tracker's
full-fledged four-wheel-drive system, a rugged Jeep-like system
with low range for tackling the tough stuff. Toyota and Honda make
do with carlike all-wheel-drive systems that are limited in
off-highway usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon's four-wheeling with the Grand Vitara _ nothing
terribly challenging, mostly rocky trails with a few stints in
high-range four-wheel drive _ the Suzuki was well-controlled and
comfortable, in spite of small dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was firm and rattle-free, handling well on the
switchbacks and easily controlled on loose surfaces. And the ride
on pavement is also firm but compliant, exhibiting none of the
stiff, rough-ride behavior of some sport utes.
</P>
<P>
   The only real complaint about the Vitara/Tracker is its small
size, which limits legroom in the back seat and keeps cargo to the
minimum. The driver and front-seat rider will find lots of space,
however, with plenty of driving comfort for a tall person.
</P>
<P>
   The Vitara and Tracker tested here were both four-door models.
Two-door Vitaras and Trackers are built on a shorter wheelbase and
have a folding canvas top over the back seat. The two-door gets
only the four-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to see Suzuki earn a solid hit. At this price,
Vit-ara/Tracker is still a bargain, but also with value beyond the
bottom line. &QL;

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Back then, it seemed that on every street corner in
Dorchester and Roxbury, young African-American men like John
``B.J'' Mills were trying to sing their way out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our way of trying to get off the streets,'' said Mills.
``It was our way of getting the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1968. Unemployment was up in Boston, the country was in
turmoil, Martin Luther King had been assassinated, riots had
erupted, and the government had released a report warning that
America was dividing into two societies: one black and one white _
separate and unequal.
</P>
<P>
   For Mills, a Vietnam-era veteran, the divisions that ripped
through America went against what he was beginning to learn about
himself: that he came from a long line of American soldiers and
musical pioneers. That he was a direct descendant of Barzillai Lew,
a free-born black man who had fought at Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, Mills, now 54, still struggles with the
importance of knowing his family's history and the reality of being
black in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel connected. I'm vested in this country, more than
most,'' said Mills, a clerk at the Boston Medical Center. ``But
when you are black, people don't look at your background or what
your family has done. To them, you are only black. You are
invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how long blacks have lived in America and how much
they have contributed, they will always face the dilemma of being
true Americans, said Richard Newman of Harvard University's W.E.B.
Du Bois Institute of Afro-American Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central question of black identity in America is `Who am
I?' '' said Newman. ``You might be American, but you can't get a
cab to Roxbury. You are never allowed to forget that you are
black.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened to one Lew descendant, Eric Brooks, 28, a
cousin of Mills. In 1997, when he was accepted to the University of
California at Berkeley School of Law, he found himself in the
center of the national debate on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California Board of Regents had repealed all
race and gender-based preferences programs, and Brooks was left as
the only first-year black law student enrolled at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult,'' he said. ``But I didn't want to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Brooks was marching with Jesse Jackson and speaking
for affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, he began to recall the drives to Martha's
Vineyard with his grandmother, Ethel Buzzelle, and his great aunt,
Mae Theresa Bonitto. The two women would tell him stories about
Barzillai Lew and Barzillai's father, Primus, who was also a
musician and soldier in the French and Indian War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would roll my eyes. I didn't want to hear another Barzillai
and Primus Lew story,'' said Brooks, a native of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, to say my family goes back to the Revolutionary War is a
very proud statement to make,'' he said. ``But at the same time
there is the question of where would they be if my family were
white?''
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of Lew family members is as diverse as
Mills and Brooks. They range from mechanics to engineers. Gerard
Ashe, 46, is a state trooper. Kym Lew Nelson, 41, a Harvard
University graduate, is an executive at Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP;
Gamble. Many live in eastern Massachusetts, but others are
scattered across the country, from Indiana to California.
</P>
<P>
   Although they share the same heritage, some don't know each
other. For instance, Mills and Brooks have never met. In this
sense, they are typical of many American families. And as in many
families, one or two older members keep the memories alive.
</P>
<P>
   The musical thread that has run through the family for 200 years
still remains, but it has frayed somewhat. And while some family
members like Mills and Brooks have remain interested in Lew family
stories, others are like Brooks's uncle, Neil Brooks, who says
``that and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mills _ as for Brooks _ it was an aunt, Laura Ashe, who
began passing down family history. He was serving a tour of duty in
Korea during the Vietnam era when he began receiving letters from
his aunt. She wrote of the family's military and musical
background, how ancestors had harbored runaway slaves, died in the
Civil War, served in World War II, and had become music pioneers,
breaking color barriers time again in the 19th and 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   These stories were especially important to Mills, who still
doesn't know his own father: ``That has been the most painful thing
of my life, to never know the other half, the man who fathered
me.''
</P>
<P>
   While overseas, the stories he read in letters from home helped
him know who he was. Even so, life was not easy for him, especially
after his discharge from the military in 1966. Like many black
Americans, Mills returned to a society that still overflowed with
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became an angry young man,'' said Mills. ``Boston was a
hostile place for people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers wearing his military uniform while waiting for a
table at a swank restaurant in downtown Boston. He was skipped over
several times, as if he wasn't there. And like every black person
who has ever felt invisible _ Mills was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was in my uniform, my country's uniform, and I was
being ignored,'' he said. ``By the time the young lady asked me
what I wanted, I had lost my appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills worked in a factory at the time, but he believed it would
be music that lifted him out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It was the era of ``Doo-wop,'' a form of a cappella singing
popularized by groups like the Temptations and Frankie Lymon and
Teenagers. Young men would gather on the street corners singing.
The best four singers would become a quartet, said Mills.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Mills, a baritone dared to try out twice for a spot in
the Temptations. He was good, but not that good.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in his musical career came in 1968, recalled
his wife, Linnell Mills.
</P>
<P>
   His group, ``The Elegant Four,'' was singing at Estelle's
Riveria, the popular black entertainment spot in Roxbury. They were
wearing black bell bottoms and Mills wore a hot pink top with a
large collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they began singing, there was a hush. You could hear
every word,'' Linnell Mills recalls.
</P>
<P>
   They all believed the successful gig would be their start to
fame, but the group disbanded after one of the member's personal
life got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Mill's idea of the American Dream changed from fame to a family.
He would marry Linnell in 1970. While he found steady work for 20
years with the Boston Public Schools, he still loves music,
breaking into song in the middle of conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Without a high school degree, he would rise to the assistant
director of medical records department for Boston City Hospital.
After Boston City merged with Boston University Medical Center, his
job was scaled down to clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Mills received his high school diploma in 1995. Over the years,
his anger cooled, his feelings warmed toward the country that his
family had done much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, he placed a large American flag outside his
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way I feel about this country,'' he said. ``I didn't
have this (the flag) up when I came out the military, believe me.
It was an evolutionary process.''
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, he has reached the American dream: A good job, a
loving family, including Leah, his 14-year-old daughter, and his
son, Kharay, 19, a student at Boston College of Communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what anybody else thinks about me, and aside
from my Lew background _ I paid my dues,'' Mills said. ``I am an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his heritage, Mills is proud, but he keeps it in
perspective: ``I tell my children being a Lew is not going to open
any doors.''
</P>
<P>
   And in spite of their long history, stretching back to before
the Revolutionary War, the Lews are not mentioned in the same
breath with the other noted families of old Boston _ the Adamses,
Lowells, Forbeses. They have gone largely unheralded in the history
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been lost, invisible in the making and remaking of
Boston's history,'' said Gerald Gill, a professor of history at
Tufts University..
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mills has taken the torch from his aunt and is
passing the family's history down to the young. As he looked over
family photos last week, he grabbed a visiting cousin. They sat
down and he pointed to an old photo of four young children. Their
names are scribbled at the top of the picture. It's his grandmother
and her siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' he starts. ``This is you. This is your history.''

murder, could be the only witness to take the stand in King's
defense. Defense lawyers were to begin Wednesday afternoon
presenting their case to jurors about why King should not be

   TYPHOID-OUTBREAK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Frozen mamey products
from countries such as Guatemala have been pulled from the
marketplace because of a typhoid outbreak in Florida. But fresh
mamey from these nations was never allowed in the United States
because of sanitary conditions in the countries of origin, and with
health officials conceding salmonella typhi can survive prolonged
periods of freezing, one wonders why frozen mamey was ever allowed
into the country. The FDA is putting thought into the question now.
Investigators are focusing on processing points in Guatemala, the
source of more than one frozen brand name. Meanwhile, tests on
confiscated samples conducted by Department of Agriculture have
been inconclusive, failing to isolate any `salmonella typhi.

   AIRFORCE-CUTS _ The Air Force's effort to squeeze more space

at Wright-Patterson Air Force and elsewhere, lawmakers and
congressional sources say. The Air Force Research Laboratory is
preparing to announce job cuts nationwide, possibly by the end of
the month, as it struggles to downsize to a smaller budget by Oct.
1. Lawmakers are irate because the cuts reflect abrupt changes as
the Air Force has killed or severely cut back some programs to
funnel an extra $100 million into space-based radar and laser
programs. ``The abruptness of it all will result in an enormous
waste of science and human capital,'' said Michael Gessel, an aide
to U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News).

<P>
   BOSTON _ William Edward Lew, who was born in 1865, the year
slavery was abolished in this country, moved audiences of all races
with a tenor voice so strong it seemed to shake a room.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in 1943, when he was 78, too old to be a star any more,
his life took on an unusual turn _ he joined the merchant marine
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they needed `men,' '' a Boston Globe article quoted
him as saying at the time.
</P>
<P>
   From the turn of the century to the second world war, members of
the Lew family, one of the oldest in Massachusetts, distinguished
themselves as African-American artists during an era when the
country was struggling to find its own identity.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from Barzillai Lew, who was born a free man in Groton,
Mass., and who fought at the battle of Bunker Hill, the Lews are
rare among modern black American families. Their history was not
obliterated by slavery. They can trace their story to before the
founding of this country.
</P>
<P>
   A fifer and drummer during the Revolution _ and later the leader
of a popular family band in the Boston area _ Lew passed his
musical skills down to his descendants.
</P>
<P>
   By early in this century, William Lew's nephew had become an
arranger for the white minstrel star Al Jolson. Another nephew,
Harry ``Bucky'' Lew, a trained violinist, broke racial barriers in
1902 when he joined the Pawtucketville Athletic Club of The New
England Basketball League and became the first black man ever to
play professional basketball. And yet another relative was the
first woman of color to play with Arthur Fiedler's Boston Pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the family upbringing,'' said Frank Dorman, a Cambridge
author who documented the family in his book, ``Twenty Families of
Color in Massachusetts.'' ``The education, the atmosphere. They all
had instruments. Whenever they got together they played. Music
became a family tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughters, nieces, and cousins of these musical pioneers are
still alive. They are now great grandmothers and grand aunts _ true
last links to the family legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember my uncle Willie had a marvelous tenor voice,''
said 83-year-old Mae Theresa Bonitto of William Lew. ``I can see
him as an elderly man at my aunt's home playing the piano and
singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ashe, 79, recalls that her mother, Marion, a pianist,
would treat her children before bedtime to a mini-concert. ``She
would play Handel's `Largo' _ my favorite,'' said Ashe. Francis
Johnson, 69, the youngest of Bucky's daughters, still has her
father's violin: ``It's precious to me, it's all I have of my
father,'' she said. ``As the story goes _ my mother fell in love
with my father while he was playing in a band.''
</P>
<P>
   It was essential as children that they take piano and violin
lessons. As adults, they joined choirs and frequented operas and
jazz sets. Of all these women, only Bonitto would become a
professional performer, a dancer in the 1930s for Jimmie Lunceford,
one of the big band greats.
</P>
<P>
   Music is still central: Bonitto's home often hums with the
sounds of John Coltrane. Ashe, who resumed piano lessons at age 60,
practices on her small electric piano.
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, they are keeping their family's history
alive. Bucky's middle child, Phyllis Lew, 78, of Roxbury has tried
since the 1970s to get her father's name into the Basketball Hall
of Fame in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ```My father certainly deserves to be recognized,'' said Lew.
</P>
<P>
   By family rights, Bucky's oldest daughter, Eleanor Johnson, 88,
the oldest of these women, should have inherited her ancestor's
Revolutionary War powderhorn. Instead, she prefers that it stay at
the DuSable Museum of African-American History in Chicago for
people to see _ and where her uncle, one of the museum's founders,
placed it.
</P>
<P>
   And Bonitto has collected hundreds of photos and documents to
prove that the extraordinary stories they tell of the family are no
myth.
</P>
<P>
   The Lew family's musical path had been paved long ago by its
patriarch. After the Revolutionary War, Barzillai Lew, his wife and
13 children formed a musical band known from Boston to Maine. In
those days, black musicians performed classical songs for
high-society events. But after the Civil War, blacks began to
develop their own style of music. It was symbolic in a way, helping
the country detach itself from the strains of European culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the beginning of American popular music,'' said Gerald
Gill, associate professor of history at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, blacks saw ways to develop their talents
``despite the fact that for every new avenue open to them twice as
many barriers were thrown to prevent their advances'' said Eileen
Southern, a music historian and former Harvard professor, in her
book ``The Music of Black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Until early in this century, blacks were barred from performing
in operas, but many like William Lew were accepted in some of the
finest music schools in New England.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, probably in the 1870s, Lew and his sister Edith
White performed duets at local churches. Initially, he was
musically educated by his father but would later study piano and
voice at the New England Conservatory of Music.
</P>
<P>
   When he was only 18, in 1884 Lew formed the Lew Ensemble, a male
quartet that toured the country. He played organ for Morning Star
Baptist Church in Boston and was known as the first black person to
conduct an all-white orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Carl White, achieved even greater success. As
evidence of how few opportunities were available to black
musicians, White, who also trained at the New England Conservatory,
would become the first known black man to sing in a Boston cafe in
the early 1900s, according to historians and family members.
</P>
<P>
   But his talent would take him much further than cramped, smoky
restaurants. In 1923, he formed a trio that would include the black
entertainer Paul Robeson, according to a letter he wrote to
Bonitto. Later, White would become a special arranger of spirituals
for Jolson, the white entertainer who gained fame with his black
face routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing with Al Jolson would be a racial breakthrough,'' said
Gill. ``But at what cost? How do you think they felt with Jolson
singing `Mammy' and in black face?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was one of few avenues a black entertainer could
take at the time. It allowed White to form his own successful bands
and to travel the country.
</P>
<P>
   But most black musicians, regardless of their talent, needed a
second job to make a living. William Lew and his sister Edith were
tailors.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, said Gill, black musicians taught piano lessons to
Boston's black elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman was supposed to know how to play the piano. It was
part of the dating ritual. She was suppose to entertain her suitor
by playing the piano,'' said Gill.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, Bonitto would take piano lessons from a close
relative, Doris Dandridge, who had a studio on Massachusetts and
Columbus avenues in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ashe recalls finding Dandridge, who had by now studied in France
and was a popular pianist in Boston, sometimes playing alone in the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Dandridge appeared as a guest pianist for The
Boston Pops. To see a relative and a black woman perform at
Symphony Hall was the height of the family's pride.
</P>
<P>
   World War II was just beginning and William Lew who had achieved
unthinkable goals as a black musician, was now a retired music
professor. He wanted to do more for the country, said Bonitto. In
1943, at age 78, he joined the merchant marine and for one year
served as a cook. He died five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of how proud the family was of his service, his wife in
1949 made no mention of his illustrious music career on his death
records, points out Dorman, the Cambridge author. Instead, he was
simply described as a seaman.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With misty-eyed dancers invoking the departed Martha
Graham and Doris Duke, the curtain came down last week on a
long-running real estate drama involving a small tract below an
off-ramp on the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckers began tearing apart the Martha Graham School for
Contemporary Dance at 316 East 63d Street, the home of the renowned
dance company for almost 50 years and for a studio that draws about
500 students a year from all over the world. It was a finale that
the artistic director, Ron Protas, said would have been
inconceivable in the lifetime of Miss Graham, the dance modernist
who died in 1991 at 96, or in the lifetime of Miss Duke, the
tobacco heiress who was her fervent champion and died two years
later at 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris' passions were jazz, gospel, and preserving old
houses,'' said Protas, as workers pried up the floorboards of the
vine-draped, three-story town house where Nureyev, Fonteyn, and
Makarova danced, where Madonna, Woody Allen and Liza Minelli
studied and where Jacqueline Onassis watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris also took classes here,'' Protas said. ``She said,
`Martha, darling, don't worry, this will always be.'''
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons entangled in the intrigues over the $1.2 billion
Duke estate and the financial struggles of many arts groups today,
the heavily mortgaged headquarters was sold under pressure last
summer, sending the company to temporary sites downtown while
leaving it nearly $1.5 million richer. It expects to be housed in
larger new quarters in the apartment building that is to rise on
the East 63d Street site next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia ruled on Friday as dozens of dancers and students
stepped one last time through the wrought iron gate to wander the
building, snip sprigs of ivy and pluck souvenirs from boxes of
waterlogged photographs (there had been a flood in the basement).
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lofsnes, a teacher and principal dancer who performed the
role of He Who Summons in ``Dark Meadow'' this season, drafted a
fellow dancer to help him carry off a chipped stone bench from the
garden. ``Better it should go to family,'' said Protas, who waved
his approval.
</P>
<P>
   Many gravitated to a far corner of the garden where the gnarled
trunk of a towering sumac tree bulged through an unyielding chain
link fence that cut deep into the wood. The fate of the tree is
uncertain, although Protas remembered that Miss Duke once spent
$225,000 to save a single tree in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teachers in school would tell me about this tree, how it
grew through, basically, steel,'' said Jennifer Binford of Utah, a
first-year student. ``The first time I came here I just lay my body
on it, wanting to absorb the energy and the history.''
</P>
<P>
   For three and a half decades starting in the '20s, Miss Graham
operated out of a studio in Greenwich Village, developing a new
vocabulary of movement that thrust dance into the 20th century. In
1952, Lila Acheson Wallace, co-founder of Reader's Digest,
presented her with the building on East 63d Street, which had been
owned by the Baroness Bethsabee de Rothschild. It was there in the
'70s that Miss Duke, the only child of James Buchanan Duke,
president of the American Tobacco Company, and thought to be the
world's richest woman, met Miss Graham and became a dance student,
patron and member of the Graham board.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave in an erratic way,'' recalled Protas, who also became
close to Miss Duke. ``We'd ask for $5,000, and she'd give
$30,000.'' Around 1992, he recalled, the company needed money and
discussed with Miss Duke a $1 million loan that she would ``stand
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The company already had borrowed $200,000 in a mortgage on the
school. Protas said that Miss Duke agreed to ask Chemical Bank to
grant the Graham company a second mortgage of $1 million with the
idea, he said, of asking the bank later to forgive the loan.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months before Miss Duke's death in October 1993,
Protas said, his frequent calls to her suddenly went unreturned.
She had rewritten her will several times, in the end naming her
butler, Bernard Lafferty, as co-executor, along with the U. S.
Trust Company, an investment management house.
</P>
<P>
   U. S. Trust later lent Lafferty $825,000 under circumstances
that led a New York judge in May 1994 to remove the two as
co-executors. The state's highest court, however, restored them as
executors on appeal in January 1996. Lafferty, who had acknowledged
problems with alcohol and was taking medications, was found dead in
his bed in November 1996 at age 51.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Miss Duke died, Protas and Barbara M. Groves,
then the company's executive director, had continued calling her,
fruitlessly, for word about the loan. Finally, they heard from a
lawyer for Lafferty and Miss Duke, William Doyle of Chicago, that
Chemical had been replaced and U. S. Trust would not grant the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   After spirited appeals, the two Graham officials said, U. S.
Trust agreed, but on difficult terms: the money was to be repaid in
five years, with no mention of a guarantee by Miss Duke.
</P>
<P>
   As feared, the company fell behind in its monthly payments of
more than $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for U. S. Trust, Allison Kellogg, said the company
never commented on client relationships. Doyle said he would have
no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, Todd Dellinger, who was hired by the Graham
board as development director, then managing director, found that
the Graham company had stopped making payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was maladroit,'' acknowledged Mr. Protas. ``But we
were in a moment of rebirth.''
</P>
<P>
   Delores Barr Weaver, who sits on the Graham board and with her
husband, Wayne, owns the Jacksonville Jaguars football team,
offered U. S. Trust $350,000 to excuse the loan but the offer was
refused, said Bill Prescott, the Weavers' chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   When the sale of the property seemed the only option, he said,
the Weavers asked U. S. Trust to settle for the $1 million, without
the interest. That too was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1997, the Duke estate's assets had been transferred to
the Doris Duke Charitible Foundation. Protas said he offered to
name the building for Miss Duke for the foundation's help in saving
it, but got no response.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Edelman Spero, the foundation's president, said last week
that the policy was to award grants to arts agencies for
redistribution, rather than to give money directly to individual
arts companies.
</P>
<P>
   J. Carter Brown, a trustee of the Duke foundation, subsequently
said that the foundation would soon be announcing a $1 million
grant to the Library of Congress to acquire archives and videotapes
of performances by the Graham company.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham board sold its property to an East Side developer,
Benedetto Caiola, for $3 million. U. S. Trust collected the full
amount due, nearly $1.5 million. After paying debts, the Graham
company ended up with about $500,000 cash plus $400,000 to be put
into an endowment. The Weavers severed their own business
relationship with U. S. Trust.

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... independent nation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The revolution was about achieving freedom, but not about
ending slavery,'' says James Horton, author of ``Black
Bostonians,'' which chronicles black life in Boston from slavery to
the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about attaining freedom from the British. For blacks,
it might have meant that too for them, but mostly it offered the
hope of ending slavery as an institution, or personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew joined Captain John Ford's company of the 27th regiment as a
fifer in the summer of the 1775. About that same time, the mounting
concern that black men bearing arms could eventually turn on white
patriots led General George Washington to bar all blacks from
enlisting in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Washington reversed that order after the British promised
freedom for those black men who fought for them. Eventually, 5,000
black soldiers would risk their lives in the American cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black enlistment was generally longer,'' said Horton. ``They
were at a disadvantage, often serving in the place of their master,
their master's kids. This didn't mean they didn't serve for the
same patriotic reasons. They were fighting the same injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1775, Lew and other black men fought in the Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States allowed slavery until the mid-19th
century, Massachusetts _ one of the first colonies to legalize
slavery _ abolished it in 1783.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Lew built a home on a sizable tract of land in
what is now Lowell, near Varnum Road and Totman Street. As
Barzillai aged, his large family and the townfolk called him by the
nickname ``Old Zeal.'' For a century, the street where he lived was
called ``Old Zeal Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew and his sons tended the farm and worked on construction of
the Middlesex Canal, between 1793 and 1805, said Martha Mayo, a
historian at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. Much of the
waterway is filled in now, but it was once the main corridor to
transport goods from Boston to Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   With the sparse written record of Lew's life, it is difficult to
separate fact from legend. One story from the DuSable Museum of
African-American History in Chicago places Barzillai and Primus
among the group of black men at the Boston Massacre, where ex-slave
Crispus Attucks was killed in 1770. Family members and a few
history books claim the family performed at the inauguration of
George Washington. ``The Colored Patriots,'' written by black
Bostonian abolitionist William Nell, has Lew leading a ``guerrilla
band'' made up of his sons. That would have been nearly impossible,
however, since his oldest child was only 9 when Lew was discharged
from the service.
</P>
<P>
   What is known through books and newspaper articles is that in
the post-Revolution years Lew, his wife, and children made up a
traveling dancing band that performed from Boston to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all possessed a natural talent for music, and most of
them could play any kind of wind or stringed instrument _ the girls
as much as boys,'' according to a Dec. 31, 1889, article in the
Lowell Morning Mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Lews would perform at elegant parties and college
commencements in New England. Although blacks were relegated to the
balconies of white churches at the time, the Lews would sing in
choirs and play the piano during the services. Always standing
proud, the Lews on Sundays were known as some of the most stylish
citizens in town. Lew's children spent so much time performing in
Boston that they lived there in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   As adults, most of the Lew children became laborers, farmers and
musicians. Some, however, took on prominent social roles.
</P>
<P>
   Lew's daughter, Lucy Dalton, lived with her husband, Thomas
Dalton, a black abolitionist, in Charlestown. One son is described
in the 1889 Lowell Mail reminiscence as tall, dignified in
appearance with ``fine features.'' He was well-educated ``and a man
of some property and consequences.'' He rode in a coach and owned
the largest library in the Lowell area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for the degradation to which the race had been
reduced, he would have been chosen for the first offices of his
town if not the state,'' according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Through records, it's clear that owning land was important to
Barzillai Lew. He sold land to his children, and when he died in
1822 he left the farm to sons, Zadock and Zimri. The latter died in
a train wreck. When Zadock, a popular musician, died, his wife,
needing money to live on, sold a large part of the farm and a
collection of his instruments, many of which were bought by his
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Even to this day, the Lews have tried to keep their ancestors'
belongings in the family. For a while, Barzillai Lew's powder horn,
now in Chicago's DuSable Museum, was passed down to the oldest
grandchild in each generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bonitto, who in her youth danced for Jimmie Lunceford, a popular
black band leader in New York, keeps photos and vital records of
each family member in neat, organized folders. The stories of
Barzillai Lew, the proud musician and landowner, are passed down to
the young just like they were once passed to her and her older
sister Ethel Ursela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been told about our family. Always,'' said
Bonitto.
</P>
<P>
   That Lew tradition of passing down information and land would be
instrumental in the next chapter of American history. The Lew
farmhouse, a simple six-bedroom home built by one of Lew's
grandchildren, would become a secret station on the road to freedom
in the years leading to the Civil War.

 &HT;    HIGH DRUG PRICES SPUR BUYING IN MEXICO, FORUM TOLD
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans pay higher prices for prescription drugs
than consumers in any other country, a panel of experts said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is broken in this market,'' said Steven
Schondelmeyer(cq), associate dean of the College of Pharmacy at the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Schondelmeyer and other pharmacy experts told a congressional
forum that pharmaceutical companies make the highest profits of any
business in the U.S. _ about 16 cents of each dollar paid by the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The average Fortune 500 company makes about five cents per
dollar profit, and the gap between them and pharmaceutical
companies ``has been getting wider over the last decade,''
Schondelmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The expense of prescription drugs and the stress and hardship it
causes senior citizens has been a focus for Rep. Jim Turner,
D-Texas, one of three members of Congress who organized the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has been trying to make prescription drugs available to
Medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices. As part of
a congressional task force on the issue, Turner commissioned a
study that found that some senior citizens in his district are
paying twice as much as drug companies charge large customers such
as health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Turner spoke of a growing problem in Texas,
where cash-strapped senior citizens resort to buying prescription
drugs in Mexico, and not only in the border towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran into a fellow the other day in my East Texas district
who says that he's got a buddy that flies him down into the
interior of Mexico, and they get a better price down there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying drugs in Mexico is a dangerous practice, since drugs sold
in Mexico are not approved by the federal Food and Drug
Administration and are not sold by trained pharmacists who can
answer questions or give advice, said Marvin Shepherd, director of
the Center for Pharmacoeconomic Studies at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like buying a Hershey bar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the prescription drug business in Mexico
is thriving. One out of four people who cross the border comes back
with prescription drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nuevo Laredo, pharmacies and tequila drive the economy,''
Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people who buy prescription drugs in Mexico are
under 35 and buy drugs such as Valium and Rohypnol to sell in large
cities around the United States for recreational purposes, there is
still a population of seniors who cross the border because they
simply can't afford to pay U.S. prices for medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the Mexican market can also be seen on Internet
pages. One page offers an e-mail list of Mexican pharmacies
offering medicines for 80 percent less than at U.S. pharmacies _
and without a prescription.

BOOK TALK: BETTING ON BUZZ AND SYNERGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wagering wonder world of book publishing, celebrity has
its purpose. And so it is almost appropriate that without
publishing a single book, Tina Brown's new book-publishing company
is receiving and encouraging submissions from literary agents, has
already consummated two deals and hopes to announce two bigger
nonfiction ones next week.
</P>
<P>
   How does a new publisher demonstrate effectiveness in the
editing, marketing, promoting and distribution of books? Can Ms.
Brown's skills and pizazz as a magazine editor translate to books?
</P>
<P>
   Many agents think the answer is yes. Others in the industry are
more doubtful. For the believers, it is partly wishful thinking,
because an agent's happiness quotient zooms whenever there is a new
buyer for a writer's work. This is particularly true now because of
the perception that the book-publishing universe is in contraction,
not expansion. This is why it is not surprising that much of the
talk in publishing is about Talk Miramax Books, a shank of the new
Brown, Miramax and Hearst company called Miramax Talk Media.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also publish Talk magazine, edited by Ms.
Brown, with movies and television programs to come. The books will
be distributed by Hyperion, which is a sister company and which
will initially handle such matters as foreign rights.
</P>
<P>
   When publishers are ``being gobbled up at a terrifying rate, we
welcome any newcomers,'' said agent Lynn Nesbit. ``Why would we
think they couldn't succeed?'' she said of Talk Miramax Books. ``It
helps to have somebody hip, and they have a serious editor in
chief.'' Ms. Nesbit said she had not submitted any projects to the
new publisher, but that younger agents in her agency had.
</P>
<P>
   There had always been a nonwincing snap about Ms. Brown's method
of putting out Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, a belief that she
not only had a mastery of marketing and hype, but also the ability
to somehow eyeball that trend just around the curve. There is no
reason to believe she will lose her ability to divine trends, but a
trend has to last a long time to make a successful book. Moreover,
it is a lot harder to generate the excitement for a book that
roosts on bookstore shelves than it is for a sizzling magazine
article that's here today and gone tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is the gamble of Gail Ross, a Washington-based
literary agent who sold Talk Miramax Books for a low six-figure
advance in one of the company's first two acquisitions: a sort of
the art of how to run a business based on the psychological lessons
culled from Shakespeare, to be written by former diplomat Kenneth
Adelman and former Lockheed Martin Corp. chairman Norman Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major publishers were after the manuscript, but Talk
Miramax Books won out, not only because of Ms. Brown's glitz but at
least as persuasively because of the speed with which its editor in
chief and president, Jonathan Burnham, moved to make the purchase.
( Burnham came to the new venture from Viking Penguin, where he was
a senior editor.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention was to bring the authors to New York to meet
publishers,'' Ms. Ross said, ``but Jonathan was in Washington, was
told about the book, came to my office and took it back to New
York. The next day he bought it.'' Such decisiveness isn't always
the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster also has a Shakespeare on business leadership
in the works. ``There's a race, so why not do something to get a
lot of attention?'' Ms. Ross said. ``Why do we care about
Shakespeare? It's a book that could use a little dazzle, and this
is the extra dazzle we gained. With Tina involved, we'll get a lot
of attention, and their first list of books will get a lot of
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The other book acquired by Burnham, for about $90,000, is a
novel by Frances Park to be titled ``When My Sister Was Cleopatra
Moon,'' which will be excerpted in Talk, where Burnham also is the
literary editor. There it is, that media hip-hop word, synergy.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Friedrich, Ms. Park's agent, said, ``There's no reason,
with all their backing, they can't thrive as book publishers.'' She
added: ``Jonathan gets on a plane to close a deal. There's great
dispatch and energy there. When you get an editor who blubbers for
a book, you can't do better than that.'' (Ms. Friedrich sold the
novel's German rights Wednesday for $50,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The company's philosophy is all about synergy, a pinballing of a
writer's work from book to magazine excerpt, or magazine article to
book, or either one to movie or television, or even movie to novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a shared taste,'' Ms. Brown says of herself and
Burnham, ``and the guy with the shared taste is just down the hall.
Something in the works now came about because of a photographer
doing covers. We suddenly realized a big truth _ Jonathan talked to
him and we talked and we thought book.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said: ``We can put together very convincing arguments to
come with us. There's a lot to be said for being on a small list
like ours, with our energy and the marketing abilities we bring to
it. We think laterally, and when we buy a book we buy a lot of
potential elements _ buy a magazine, television, movies, on a
case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   What Talk Miramax Books actually buys is not only the book, but
the first option to turn a project upside down into something
additional and quite different from its original packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what worries some authors and their agents.
One agent in a prominent talent agency who talked only on the
condition of anonymity said: ``If I submit a book to them it will
be read by movie people and magazine people, and I can't control
that. And not many of us are willing to let rights slip away in
such a fairly dramatic fashion. This is particularly dangerous
because of the many hats everyone wears over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the agent said that the book market ``is terrible right
now; a lot of publishers are publishing books poorly. There's
something sexy about being on the ground floor with a new
publishing house with an aggressive stance.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company's first catalog will be out this fall with its
2000 Spring list of 15 books, including titles inherited from
Miramax Books, which published mainly film scripts and other
movie-related books. Miramax Books was merged with the new company
and its former head, Susan Dalsimer, is now publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham's answer to author-agent trepidation is speed. Decisions
on what Miramax Talk Media will want to turn into what will be made
very quickly, within days of submission, and the agents will get
their option rights back in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Velocity. Publishers competing for a book with Ms. Brown and
Burnham will find themselves running. Perhaps sometimes in circles,
but nonetheless running.

ECHOES OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. _ As a child, Laura Ashe would listen intently to
the stories told of her great-grandparents, who hid runaway slaves
in a hallway closet of her childhood home.
</P>
<P>
   She would spend what seemed like hours staring, wondering how
could those poor souls survive all packed up in the closet?
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven decades later, Ashe, 79, of Boston walked through the
Lowell home with Marie Desheneaux, the woman who bought it from her
family 50 years ago. Hand in hand, they rediscovered its legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstairs, that's where the slaves hid in the long closet,''
Ashe recalled. ``And that's the chimney corner,'' she said, moving
to the dining area. ``It was where the slaves would come down, sit
and tell their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The home was built about 1850 in the middle of a secluded forest
area by Ashe's great-grandfather, Adrastus Lew. He was the grandson
of Barzillai Lew, a black musician who in 1775 fought in the Battle
of Bunker Hill. Lew's skills as a musician would be passed down
through eight generations.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Lew family of Massachusetts _ carefully
preserved by family members over the years _ intersects time and
again with key episodes in the black struggle for freedom in
America.
</P>
<P>
   While Adrastus Lew, a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Freeman,
would live a seemingly simple life, they became an important part
of the Underground Railroad, a secret system developed in the years
before the Civil War to harbor slaves making their way to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Historians only recently have determined that it was black
northerners like the Lews who made up the majority of the
abolitionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a chapter that has never been told,'' said Richard
Newman, research officer at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute of
Afro-American Studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The role of whites was important because they had the homes and
power, he said. ``So, I don't want to minimalize the white
abolitionist role, but the black role has been minimalized.''
</P>
<P>
   They were not always abolitionists in the formal sense, said
James Horton, who examines the interactions of free blacks and
ex-slaves from the South in his book ``Free People of Color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just people helping people. Some people helped one
person in their whole life, and others helped thousands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The slaves who crept to the Lew home were probably fugitives
hiding out in Boston or runaways from the South heading to Canada.
Most of them couldn't read or write. They were farmers who were
guided by the stars and the streams in their travels north.
</P>
<P>
   The infamous fugitive slave law in 1850 placed severe penalities
on anyone harboring slaves. During that year, an estimated 200
fugitive slaves left Boston for Canada, according to Horton,
professor of American studies and history at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   When runaways arrived at Ashe's great-grandparent's home, the
family quickly hid them in the closet. ``My (great-) grandparents
would put a pallet down there and the slave would sleep there
during the day and come down to the kitchen at night,'' Ashe
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   There, they ate and told their stories. Later, they would climb
into a horse-drawn wagon, and Adrastus Lew, said by family members
to be nearly seven feet tall, would pack it tight with hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take them to the Pelham, N.H., line. They were met
by someone else to take them to Canada. If no one else was there to
take them, then my (great-) grandfather or Elizabeth Lew would,''
said Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   During these dangerous journeys, free blacks and runaway slaves
had created a secret system of communicating. The popular black
jockey statue, for example, served as a message for those slaves,
said Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the statue was in front of the house and lit, it meant it
was an abolitionist safe house. But if it wasn't lit, it meant
don't come in. Something is wrong,'' said Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Now historians are discovering that even quilts and spiritual
songs contained obscure messages for the journeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Canaan really meant `go to Canada,' '' said Newman.
``They developed a vocabulary of secret coded messages. It's in
everything _ the songs, the quilts. Here is an enslaved people but
they are not just sitting down, they are communicating in front of
white people who didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Adrastus and Elizabeth chose to discreetly participate in
the abolitionist movement, some years earlier Barzillai Lew's
daughter, Lucy Dalton, and her husband, Thomas Dalton, were in the
thick of a radical antislavery movement in Boston. Dalton, a
caterer and bootblack, was also the president of an all-black
antislavery society that preceded the efforts of the white
abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   The family continued through the years to be engaged in the
fight for freedom. In 1865, for instance, Adrastus Lew's brother,
Zimri, died at age 38 in South Carolina while serving in the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, a white minister named Theodore Edson was
riding in a carriage with a man believed to be 47-year-old Adrastus
Lew, according to Martha Mayo, a historian at the University of
Massachusetts in Lowell. As they turned toward the Merrimac River
to a cemetery to bury Lew's brother, Adrastus told the minister of
his grandfather, Barzillai Lew, who bought the freedom of his wife
for $400 before the Revolutionary War, according to a copy of an
excerpt from Edson's diary.
</P>
<P>
   While Adrastus Lew never mentioned his or his wife's role in
helping blacks gain their freedom, his conversation with Edson was
one of the first records of a Lew family member passing down his
history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, Adrastas' wife, then 89 and the oldest woman in Lowell,
told a reporter of their participation in the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I helped many of the escaping slaves to get
safely to Canada, giving them rest for the night, food and clothing
and money to help them on their way. Those were terrible times,''
said she in the article in the Lowell Sunday Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Their home was the second to be built in the area, she is quoted
as saying: ``We had to cut a path through the woods to get to the
other side of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no street cars at the time, and the children would
play and catch rabbits in the pasture.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership forged between Elizabeth and Adrastus during the
Underground Railroad days would end when she filed for divorce,
alleging her husband committed adultrey. She kept the home.
Sometimes she'd sit on the porch smoking a pipe. Later, she passed
the home down to her son. When he died, his wife _ Ashe's
grandmother _ would find herself in the center of a fight for the
land around the house. Her husband's siblings, raised by Adrastus
and Elizabeth in the home, believed they had the right to the land.
</P>
<P>
   But according to family members, Ashe's aunt, Theresa Lew, a
popular Lowell teacher who had gone to law school, successfully
fought the case on her mother's behalf. The land across the street
from the home would be distributed to the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the home would be sold to Desheneux and her
now-deceased husband, a childhood friend of Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   As Ashe and Desheneux walked through the home earlier this
month, Ashe noticed the changes _ the chimney corner is now
occupied by a stereo system and the closets, in which the slaves
once hid, have been renovated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had a large, old-fashioned piano right here,'' Ashe
said, standing in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of Lew children raised in the home would become
accomplished musicians and singers.
</P>
<P>
   As Ashe walked down the front steps of the house with the help
of her son, Gerard, she patted the stone stairs. ``I use to sit
here and read,'' she said.``There were many of good days in this
house,'' she told her son. ``Many of good days.''

IN DISCOVERED LETTER, SLAVES' CRY RISES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the kind of discovery historians spend a lifetime
searching for and almost never find. But for Elizabeth Reilly, a
local historian in central Massachusetts, the rarest glimpse into
New England's black Revolutionary War history came by quiet
accident, nestled in the crates of a town's forgotten archives.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, president of the Hardwick Historical Society, had begun
a tedious job going through handwritten tax records from the 1700s.
Last month, as she went about sifting through the reams of flaking
documents, she stumbled upon the signatures of four Boston slaves,
and their early, radical plea for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect great things from men who have made such a noble
stand against the designs of their fellow men to enslave them,''
read the request to Massachusetts legislators, dated April 20, 1773
and signed by the slaves on the brink of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the brown-ink broadside to experts, Reilly soon
learned how rare her finding was: The letter is among the earliest
political writings by slaves. Printed by the hundreds and
distributed like fliers across Massachusetts two centuries ago,
only three other original copies remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just stunned that it was sitting there, tucked in among
all these old tax records,'' Reilly said of the discovery. ``It
felt so immediate to know that this little piece of paper came to
this rural town, that I could sit here in the 20th century and read
it, knowing their petition would never be granted, knowing it would
be 90 more years before slavery was abolished. It was almost like
reading the letter of someone who was going to die in battle and
didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea was as reverent as it was radical. Strategic in their
request, the slaves asked for only one day a week of freedom. And
subversive beyond their time, they used the reading skills given
them by their masters to rebel, and held a shaming mirror to a
people that cried for liberty even as they held blacks in bondage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the people of this province seem to be actuated by the
principles of equity and justice,'' the letter read, ``we cannot
but expect your house will again take our deplorable case into
serious consideration, and give us that ample relief which, as men,
we have a natural right to.''
</P>
<P>
   But like every other slave petition of the era, the letter was
tabled indefinitely. It was 10 years later that Massachusetts
abolished slavery. The nation as a whole would have to wait close
to a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost never think of blacks speaking up themselves about
the evils of slavery,'' said Reilly of the letter, soon to be
placed on permanent loan at the American Antiquarian Society in
Worcester. ``To know there were vocal black leaders talking about
freedom and writing it more than 100 years before the Emancipation
Proclamation, it pushes our whole vision of the movement for
freedom back in a profound way. It was such a long, long
struggle.''

`PERFECT MURDER' A PERFECT STUDY OF JONBENET CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town''
</P>
<P>
   by Lawrence Schiller
</P>
<P>
   Crime reporting
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, $26
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Schiller made his mark as an investigative crime
reporter two decades ago, when he was Norman Mailer's chief
researcher for ``The Executioner's Song,'' the Pulitzer
Prize-winning study of Utah killer Gary Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Schiller topped bestseller lists with his own book,
``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense,''
penned after he helped O.J. write ``I Want to Tell You.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Schiller, in his customary fascinating-but-exhaustive way,
addresses the 1996 Christmas-night slaying of JonBenet Ramsey in
Boulder, Colo. As with Schiller's previous subjects, we know much
about the case: A picture-perfect little girl who won juvenile
beauty pageants was found dead in the basement of her home. Her
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, appeared to many to be the most
logical suspects, but shoddy investigative work by the Boulder
police supposedly allowed them to escape a properly exacting
investigation. The case remains open. A grand jury is expected to
return some sort of initial finding this month, but whoever killed
little JonBenet Ramsey remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   This killing seems particularly repugnant because of the victim:
JonBenet's photos display her either as a lovely, smiling, normal
child or an overly made-up, strutting parody of adult beauty
queens. Either way, she evokes sympathy, and the circumstances of
her death and the discovery of her body _ her father found her in a
cellar room after Boulder police had searched the house _ lend
themselves to speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller's is the first ``serious'' study of the case. (A few
quickie paperbacks did little but rehash newspaper accounts.) With
``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' Schiller demonstrates why he is
the perfect writer to chronicle murder stories that have captured
public attention. Schiller never embellishes facts, never spends
page after page laboriously explaining his conclusions. Instead, he
simply interviews everyone involved, records what they say, and
lets the reader work it out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best thing about ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town'' is
Schiller's commanding demonstration of how the nature of Boulder,
Colo., hampered the investigation. Boulder, we learn from
residents, is a place where rich people congregate to enjoy
luxurious lifestyles without interference from outsiders or law
officers. The district attorney's office had instituted pre-trial
bargaining for prominent citizens about to go into the dock for
drunken driving, speeding, and other nonmurderous transgressions.
When officers first went to the Ramsey house on the morning of Dec.
26, 1996, the head of the Boulder homicide unit cautioned them to
treat the Ramseys with respect instead of as suspects. John Ramsey
owned and operated a billion-dollar business in downtown Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Ramseys were allowed to roam the house freely before
forensic evidence was collected and later bargained with police
over ground rules for how and when they would be questioned. This
despite these details: A ransom note was written on a pad of paper
already in the house; although a basement window had been broken,
there were no real signs of forced entry; the
``kidnappers/killers'' signed their note with an acronym also used
for a base where John Ramsey had once been stationed; the amount
($118,000) of the ransom matched exactly Ramsey's annual bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Using interviews with friends and business acquaintances,
Schiller skillfully depicts JonBenet as a bright, sometimes bratty
child who was used by her mother, a former Miss America contestant,
to live out Mom's dreams. One dance teacher hired to instruct
JonBenet in stage performance declares herself perplexed at the
child's sexy gyrations in some pageants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never taught her that,'' the teacher protests, and the clear
implication is that Patsy Ramsey decided sensuality had to be part
of her first-grader's allure.

<P>
   By book's end, readers will not like John or Patsy Ramsey, nor
Boulder's rich-can-do-no-wrong ambience. And it seems obvious that
Schiller believes that one or both parents are implicated in
JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking part of ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,''
the passage that will haunt readers, is Schiller's cut-and-dried
description of JonBenet's autopsy. It is impossible to read about a
skull fracture, an abraded vaginal area, blood on a blanket,
suspected semen on a thigh and a self-inscribed red ink heart on
JonBenet's left palm without realizing, in a stomach-lurching way,
that a little girl was brutally, horribly killed, and whoever did
it is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mailer's ``The Executioner's Song'' and Truman Capote's
``In Cold Blood,'' Schiller's ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town'' will
eventually be considered a ghastly classic about brutal murder.
Schiller is, for now, the best at what he does; but considering his
subject matter, he must have nightmares all the time.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Mae Theresa Bonitto, 83, who in the 1930s
graced the stages of New York and Boston as part of a dance troupe,
now shifts her frail body on a piano stool to try her hand at a
song she used to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, isn't it awful,'' she says after a half-dozen attempts.
``I can't think of these things anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Her memory of the song comes and goes. But Bonitto, who lives
with her husband in Cambridge, can pinpoint the beginning, more
than 200 years ago, of her family's fame for musical talent: an
African-American fifer and drummer in the Revolutionary War named
Barzillai Lew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started . . . '' she says as she points to a framed
painting on her living room wall of a young black man holding a
flute, ``It started with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting _ a copy of a portrait called ``The Flutist'' that
hangs in the Walter Thurston Gentlemen's Room of the State
Department building in Washington _ is believed to be of Bonitto's
great-great-great grandfather, who fought at the Battle of Bunker
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Lew's father passed the musical skill to him, and Barzillai
(pronounced BAR-zeal-ya) passed it down to his 13 children. Thus
began a musical heritage that would thread through the Lew family
for eight generations _ through classical music, jazz, gospel and
soul, through all the ages of American history and the struggle of
black Americans for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Lew was immortalized in song by Duke Ellington in a 1943 piano
composition entitled ``Barzillai Lou.''
</P>
<P>
   Few black American families can trace their stake in this
country back in time so directly. Slavery and prejudice saw to
that, separating them from their families and _ with only a few
exceptions _ keeping black Americans and their achievements out of
history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here in the North, census takers and town clerks tended to
make mistakes and to leave (blacks) out entirely, like they were
invisible,'' said the Rev. Frank Dorman, who documented the lives
of the Lews and other families in his 1998 book: ``Twenty Families
of Color in Massachusetts.'' ``The Lew family represents the fact
that European-Americans had on blinders, and that is why they
couldn't see them. But they were here, in the center of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Barzillai was a war hero and family members like Bonitto
kept treasured vital records and passed down oral history, the
Lews' story was never lost, said Dorman.
</P>
<P>
   Barzillai Lew was born Nov. 5, 1743, in Groton. Two years later,
his father, Primus Lew, went off to fight in conflicts with French
and Indian forces, helping to set a precedent for black men joining
the War for Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Primus, a musician, was born about 1715 (it is not clear where)
during a time when trading black people in Massachusetts was as
common as stock market trading is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston was deep in the slave trade, because there was money in
it, fortunes to be made,'' said Richard Newman, research officer at
The W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the vast agricultural tracts of the South, New England
never had much need for a large slave population, but most blacks
who lived in New England were slaves _ and remained slaves until
the late 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, they could own land, go to court, marry within
their race, but slaves were restricted in where they could travel
and where they could sit in church, and they were not allowed to
bear arms. They were mostly domestic servants, field hands for
small farms, or sailors.
</P>
<P>
   In Groton, Primus was able to earn a living as a cooper, making
the barrels that would hold the rum often traded for slaves. He
bought land on the west side of Nashua River in Pepperell. He
married twice and was initially described in records as the servant
of a Captain Jonathan Boyden. While living descendants emphasize
that Primus was no slave, that can't be confirmed. The word
``servant,'' says Dorman, a Cambridge genealogist, often meant
slave in the mid 1700s. ``It was a nice way of saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after Primus Lew's first marriage, according to
Dorman, records in Pepperell call Lew a free man. His firstborn,
Barzillai Lew, would be given the stamp of freedom at birth,
offering him more _ though still limited _ opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Barzillai was 17, he had fought in the French and
Indian War. In 1768, when he was 25, he had saved $400, enough to
buy the freedom of the woman he would marry, Dinah Bowman, a
biracial slave. That same year, the young couple had their first
child _ a boy named Zadock. Like his father, he was named for an
Old Testament figure.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, sentiment toward slavery was beginning to
change in New England, the first hint of a schism in America that
would eventually become the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes out of that is that more and more black people
start getting set free,'' said state Representative Byron Rushing,
a historian. ``People voluntarily set them free or cut deals and
allowed the slaves to buy themselves out of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   For free black men like Lew, the Revolutionary War offered the
possibility that slavery would be abolished in a new, independent
nation.

 &HT;    __ The Amish are famous for shunning technology. But their
secret love affair with the cell phone is causing an uproar. __
 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    The Amish communities of Pennsylvania, despite the retro image
of horse-drawn buggies and straw hats, have long been engaged in a
productive debate about the consequences of technology.
 &HT;    So we can turn to them for a glimpse of the future.
 &HT;    Amish settlements have become a cliche for refusing technology.
Tens of thousands of people wear identical, plain, homemade
clothing, cultivate their rich fields with horse-drawn machinery
and live in houses lacking that basic modern spirit called
electricity.
 &HT;    But the Amish do use such 20th-century consumer technologies as
disposable diapers, in-line skates and gas barbecue grills. Some
might call this combination paradoxical, even contradictory. But it
could also be called sophisticated, because the Amish have an
elaborate system by which they evaluate the tools they use.
 &HT;    Last summer, I traveled around the countryside of Lancaster
County, Pa. Everywhere, there were freshly planted fields,
farmhouses with handsome, immaculate barns and outbuildings. At one
farm, a woman was sitting a hundred yards from her house on the
edge of a kitchen garden. She wore the traditional garb of the
conservative Old Order _ a long, unadorned dress sheathed by an
apron, her hair covered by a prayer bonnet. She was sitting in the
middle of the garden, alone, the very image of technology-free
simplicity. But she was holding her hand up to her ear. She
appeared to be intent on something, strangely engaged.
 &HT;    ``Whenever you see an Amish woman sitting in the field like
that,'' my guide said, ``she's probably talking on a cell phone.''
``It's a controversy in the making,'' he continued.
 &HT;    A rather large one, it turns out _ yet part of the continuum of
determining whether a particular technology belongs in Amish life.
They've adopted horses, kerosene lamps and propane refrigerators;
should they add cell phones?
 &HT;    Collective negotiations over the use of telephones have ignited
intense controversies in the Amish community since the beginning of
the 20th century. In fact, a dispute over the role of the phone was
the principal issue behind the 1920s division of the Amish church,
wherein one-fifth of the membership broke away to form their own
church.
 &HT;    Eventually, certain Amish communities accepted the telephone for
its aid in summoning doctors and veterinarians, and in calling
suppliers. But even these Amish did not allow the telephone into
the home. Rather, they required that phones be used communally.
Typically, a neighborhood of two or three extended families shares
a telephone housed in a wooden shanty, located either at the
intersection of several fields or at the end of a common lane.
 &HT;    These structures look like small bus shelters or privies;
indeed, some phones are in outhouses. Sometimes the telephone
shanties have answering machines in them.
 &HT;    Actually, the first Amish person I contacted, I reached by
answering machine. He was a woodworker who, unlike some of his
brethren, occasionally talked to outsiders. I left a message on his
phone, which I later learned was located in a shanty in his
neighbor's pasture. The next day the man, whom I'll call Amos,
returned my call. We agreed to meet at his farmstead a few days
later.
 &HT;    I couldn't help thinking it was awfully complicated to have a
phone you used only for calling back _ from a booth in a meadow.
Why not make life easier and just put one in the house?
 &HT;    ``What would that lead to?'' another Amish man asked me. ``We
don't want to be the kind of people who will interrupt a
conversation at home to answer a telephone. It's not just how you
use the technology that concerns us. We're also concerned about
what kind of person you become when you use it.''
 &HT;    The Amish are famously shy. Their commitment to ''plain'' living
is most obvious in their unadorned clothing _ Old Order Amish even
eschew buttons, requiring humble hooks instead. Any sign of
individuality is cause for concern. Until fairly recently, Amish
teachers would reprimand the student who raised his or her hand as
being too individualistic.
 &HT;    Calling attention to oneself, or being ``prideful,'' is one of
the cardinal Amish worries. Having your name or photo in the
papers, even talking to the press, is almost a sin.
 &HT;    Amos runs a factory of sorts in the vicinity of three memorably
named Pennsylvania towns: Bird-in-Hand, Paradise and Intercourse.
The sun was setting as I drove slowly down his unpaved driveway _
to a tableau that must have looked almost exactly the same 200
years ago.
 &HT;    Several men and young boys in identical black trousers,
suspenders, and straw hats were operating horse-drawn equipment in
the fields beyond. One of Amos's grandsons pointed me to a plain
wooden building beside the barn.
 &HT;    The aroma of cows gave way to the pungent smell of diesel fuel
and wood chips as I entered the workshop. Indeed, the price of good
farmland and the number of Amish families are both increasing so
rapidly that in recent decades they have adopted nonagricultural
enterprises for livelihood _ woodworking, construction, light
factory work.
 &HT;    This, in turn, has forced the Amish to adopt technologies that
can enhance their productivity. And the interface with the
``English'' brings its own set of demands. When the State of
Pennsylvania refused to certify Amish-produced milk unless it was
stirred mechanically and refrigerated according to state health
codes, the Amish installed stirring machines and refrigeration _
operated by batteries or propane gas.
 &HT;    Amos, like many other Amish craftsmen, uses electricity in his
workshop for certain tools. But the electricity does not come from
public utility lines. Amos runs a diesel generator to charge a bank
of 12-volt batteries. The batteries' DC charge is then sent through
a converter to create homegrown 110-volt ``Amish electricity.'' To
generate more, he has to haul the diesel fuel in from town on his
horse-drawn buggy.
 &HT;    To the obvious question why allow Amish electricity but not
public electricity, Amos answered slowly and deliberately, ``The
Bible teaches us not to conform to the world, to keep a separation.
Connecting to the electric lines would make too many things too
easy. Pretty soon, people would start plugging in radios and
televisions, and that's like a hot line to the modern world.
 &HT;    ``We use batteries and generators because you can use the
batteries for only a short time and because you have to fuel and
maintain the generator yourself. It's a way of controlling our use
of electricity. We try to restrict things that would lead to us
losing that sense of being separate, to put the brakes on how fast
we change.''
 &HT;    In today's Pennsylvania Amish country, a group of 20 to 30
families who live near one another constitute a ''district.'' Each
district has a bishop, and the bishops get together twice a year to
discuss church matters. This includes raising the recurring
questions about which technologies should be permitted in the
community, and which banned or regulated.
 &HT;    While the say of the bishops is binding, the Amish come to their
decisions quite consensually. New things are not outright
forbidden, nor is there a rush to judgment. Rather, technologies
filter in when one of the more daring members of the community
starts to use, or even purchases, something new. Then others try
it. Then reports circulate about the results. What happens with
daily use? Does it bring people together? Or have the opposite
effect?
 &HT;    Over time, it was felt that the automobile was enlarging
people's traveling radius too far beyond their extended family, to
diversions and recreations not related to the community, decreasing
the social cohesion and personal connection the Amish so cherish.
Some bishops accepted the use of the automobile under certain
conditions, while others rejected it outright.
 &HT;    The Amish are now split into traditional ``Old Order'' Amish who
still stick to horse and buggy, ``New Order'' Amish who approve use
of telephones and powered farm equipment but shun public
electricity and ``Beachy Amish,'' named for the '20s liberal leader
Moses Beachy, who permit both public electricity and automobiles.
 &HT;    While all orders now allow diesel engines in the barn to blow
silage, their use is still resisted in the fields _ the bishops
don't want increased efficiency to interfere with the practice of
fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, working together with
horse-drawn machinery and handheld implements.
 &HT;    Notably, some Old Order Amish allow some diesel-powered
equipment in the fields _ if it's hauled by animals. ``Does it
bring us together, or draw us apart?'' is the primary question the
bishops ask in considering whether to permit or put away a
technology.
 &HT;    ``The Amish employ an intuitive sense about what will build
solidarity and what will pull them apart,'' says Donald Kraybill,
author of ``The Riddle of Amish Culture.'' ``You find
state-of-the-art barbecues on some Amish porches. Here is a tool
they see as increasing family coherence: Barbecues bring people
together.''
 &HT;    Asked what kinds of questions the bishops will likely raise
about cell phones, Kraybill replies, ``Are cell phones being used
'to make a living' or just for gossip and frivolous chatter? Will
permitting cell phones lead to having phones in homes, and where
will that lead ... to fax machines and the Internet?''
 &HT;    I also sought out several of the more boldly experimental
members of the greater Plain community and soon was directed to
Moses Smucker, who runs a harness shop in Churchtown, Pa. He might
look like Abe Lincoln, in his black suit and mustache-free beard,
but he bore the same time-is-money air of any factory manager
taking a few minutes out of a busy day to talk to the press.
 &HT;    Where Amos was rough hewn and wry, Moses seemed shrewd and
slick. His office was certainly in a different century from Amos's.
An electronic rolodex and an electric calculator sat atop an old
roll-top desk. I noticed a clock in the shape of a horse and buggy.
The whip ticked back and forth.
 &HT;    ``When I started this business in 1970,'' Moses said, ``it
wasn't accepted to have a telephone in the building, even in a
business. But the telephone began to be accepted through popular
disobedience. More businesses put them in and the bishops didn't
stop them.''
 &HT;    Will the bishops also eventually allow phones in the home? I
asked.
 &HT;    ``When the telephone first came out here, people put them in
their homes,'' Moses explained. ``But they were party lines. One
time a woman overheard two other women gossiping about her. She
objected. That wasn't what we wanted for our families or our
community, so the bishops met and home telephones were banned.''
 &HT;    I had heard the same story from several other Amish _ in fact,
this story seemed to be a key part of community mythology.
 &HT;    A writer named Diane Zimmerman Umble, who grew up in Lancaster
County and had family roots in the Plain orders, traced the story
to its origin, a 1986 memoir written by an Old Order Amishman born
in 1897.
 &HT;    As a graduate student, Zimmerman Umble started investigating
Amish community telephones for a course on contemporary social
theory, and ended up writing a book on the subject, ``Holding the
Line: The Telephone in Old Order Mennonite and Amish Life.''
 &HT;    Zimmerman Umble pointed out that part of what makes cell phones
so handy _ the lack of a wire _ also poses a special challenge for
the Amish. ``In the early part of the community discussion,
electrical and telephone lines carried substantial symbolic
freight,'' she said.
 &HT;    The wires meant that anyone in the community could easily see
who was using electricity and phones. ``But now, in the absence of
the line, behavior can't be monitored in the same way. It is harder
to maintain separation between home and business when you have a
cell phone in your pocket. In that sense it tests the community
consensus about what is allowable.''
 &HT;    Though the Amish determination to allow phones at work but ban
them at home might seem hard to accept, I appreciate the
deliberation put into their decision. In fact, similar reflection
might highlight conflicts between our own practices and values.
 &HT;    How often do we interrupt a conversation with someone who is
physically present in order to answer the telephone? Is the family
meal enhanced by a beeper? Who exactly is benefiting from call
waiting? Is automated voicemail a dark hint about the way our
institutions value human time and life? Can pagers and cell phones
that vibrate instead of ring solve the problem? Does the enjoyment
of virtual communities by growing numbers of people enhance or

particularly loved ones, about where they stand in our priorities?
We technology-enmeshed ``English'' don't have much of this sort of

 &HT;    I came away from my journey with a question to contribute to the
dialogue: If we decided that community came first, how would we use
our tools differently?

 &HT;    __ The Amish are famous for shunning technology. But their
secret love affair with the cell phone is causing an uproar. __
 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    The Amish communities of Pennsylvania, despite the retro image
of horse-drawn buggies and straw hats, have long been engaged in a
productive debate about the consequences of technology.
 &HT;    So we can turn to them for a glimpse of the future.
 &HT;    Amish settlements have become a cliche for refusing technology.
Tens of thousands of people wear identical, plain, homemade
clothing, cultivate their rich fields with horse-drawn machinery
and live in houses lacking that basic modern spirit called
electricity.
 &HT;    But the Amish do use such 20th-century consumer technologies as
disposable diapers, in-line skates and gas barbecue grills. Some
might call this combination paradoxical, even contradictory. But it
could also be called sophisticated, because the Amish have an
elaborate system by which they evaluate the tools they use.
 &HT;    Last summer, I traveled around the countryside of Lancaster
County, Pa. Everywhere, there were freshly planted fields,
farmhouses with handsome, immaculate barns and outbuildings. At one
farm, a woman was sitting a hundred yards from her house on the
edge of a kitchen garden. She wore the traditional garb of the
conservative Old Order _ a long, unadorned dress sheathed by an
apron, her hair covered by a prayer bonnet. She was sitting in the
middle of the garden, alone, the very image of technology-free
simplicity. But she was holding her hand up to her ear. She
appeared to be intent on something, strangely engaged.
 &HT;    ``Whenever you see an Amish woman sitting in the field like
that,'' my guide said, ``she's probably talking on a cell phone.''
``It's a controversy in the making,'' he continued.
 &HT;    A rather large one, it turns out _ yet part of the continuum of
determining whether a particular technology belongs in Amish life.
They've adopted horses, kerosene lamps and propane refrigerators;
should they add cell phones?
 &HT;    Collective negotiations over the use of telephones have ignited
intense controversies in the Amish community since the beginning of
the 20th century. In fact, a dispute over the role of the phone was
the principal issue behind the 1920s division of the Amish church,
wherein one-fifth of the membership broke away to form their own
church.
 &HT;    Eventually, certain Amish communities accepted the telephone for
its aid in summoning doctors and veterinarians, and in calling
suppliers. But even these Amish did not allow the telephone into
the home. Rather, they required that phones be used communally.
Typically, a neighborhood of two or three extended families shares
a telephone housed in a wooden shanty, located either at the
intersection of several fields or at the end of a common lane.
 &HT;    These structures look like small bus shelters or privies;
indeed, some phones are in outhouses. Sometimes the telephone
shanties have answering machines in them.
 &HT;    Actually, the first Amish person I contacted, I reached by
answering machine. He was a woodworker who, unlike some of his
brethren, occasionally talked to outsiders. I left a message on his
phone, which I later learned was located in a shanty in his
neighbor's pasture. The next day the man, whom I'll call Amos,
returned my call. We agreed to meet at his farmstead a few days
later.
 &HT;    I couldn't help thinking it was awfully complicated to have a
phone you used only for calling back _ from a booth in a meadow.
Why not make life easier and just put one in the house?
 &HT;    ``What would that lead to?'' another Amish man asked me. ``We
don't want to be the kind of people who will interrupt a
conversation at home to answer a telephone. It's not just how you
use the technology that concerns us. We're also concerned about
what kind of person you become when you use it.''
 &HT;    The Amish are famously shy. Their commitment to ''plain'' living
is most obvious in their unadorned clothing _ Old Order Amish even
eschew buttons, requiring humble hooks instead. Any sign of
individuality is cause for concern. Until fairly recently, Amish
teachers would reprimand the student who raised his or her hand as
being too individualistic.
 &HT;    Calling attention to oneself, or being ``prideful,'' is one of
the cardinal Amish worries. Having your name or photo in the
papers, even talking to the press, is almost a sin.
 &HT;    Amos runs a factory of sorts in the vicinity of three memorably
named Pennsylvania towns: Bird-in-Hand, Paradise and Intercourse.
The sun was setting as I drove slowly down his unpaved driveway _
to a tableau that must have looked almost exactly the same 200
years ago.
 &HT;    Several men and young boys in identical black trousers,
suspenders, and straw hats were operating horse-drawn equipment in
the fields beyond. One of Amos's grandsons pointed me to a plain
wooden building beside the barn.
 &HT;    The aroma of cows gave way to the pungent smell of diesel fuel
and wood chips as I entered the workshop. Indeed, the price of good
farmland and the number of Amish families are both increasing so
rapidly that in recent decades they have adopted nonagricultural
enterprises for livelihood _ woodworking, construction, light
factory work.
 &HT;    This, in turn, has forced the Amish to adopt technologies that
can enhance their productivity. And the interface with the
``English'' brings its own set of demands. When the State of
Pennsylvania refused to certify Amish-produced milk unless it was
stirred mechanically and refrigerated according to state health
codes, the Amish installed stirring machines and refrigeration _
operated by batteries or propane gas.
 &HT;    Amos, like many other Amish craftsmen, uses electricity in his
workshop for certain tools. But the electricity does not come from
public utility lines. Amos runs a diesel generator to charge a bank
of 12-volt batteries. The batteries' DC charge is then sent through
a converter to create homegrown 110-volt ``Amish electricity.'' To
generate more, he has to haul the diesel fuel in from town on his
horse-drawn buggy.
 &HT;    To the obvious question why allow Amish electricity but not
public electricity, Amos answered slowly and deliberately, ``The
Bible teaches us not to conform to the world, to keep a separation.
Connecting to the electric lines would make too many things too
easy. Pretty soon, people would start plugging in radios and
televisions, and that's like a hot line to the modern world.
 &HT;    ``We use batteries and generators because you can use the
batteries for only a short time and because you have to fuel and
maintain the generator yourself. It's a way of controlling our use
of electricity. We try to restrict things that would lead to us
losing that sense of being separate, to put the brakes on how fast
we change.''
 &HT;    In today's Pennsylvania Amish country, a group of 20 to 30
families who live near one another constitute a ''district.'' Each
district has a bishop, and the bishops get together twice a year to
discuss church matters. This includes raising the recurring
questions about which technologies should be permitted in the
community, and which banned or regulated.
 &HT;    While the say of the bishops is binding, the Amish come to their
decisions quite consensually. New things are not outright
forbidden, nor is there a rush to judgment. Rather, technologies
filter in when one of the more daring members of the community
starts to use, or even purchases, something new. Then others try
it. Then reports circulate about the results. What happens with
daily use? Does it bring people together? Or have the opposite
effect?
 &HT;    Over time, it was felt that the automobile was enlarging
people's traveling radius too far beyond their extended family, to
diversions and recreations not related to the community, decreasing
the social cohesion and personal connection the Amish so cherish.
Some bishops accepted the use of the automobile under certain
conditions, while others rejected it outright.
 &HT;    The Amish are now split into traditional ``Old Order'' Amish who
still stick to horse and buggy, ``New Order'' Amish who approve use
of telephones and powered farm equipment but shun public
electricity and ``Beachy Amish,'' named for the '20s liberal leader
Moses Beachy, who permit both public electricity and automobiles.
 &HT;    While all orders now allow diesel engines in the barn to blow
silage, their use is still resisted in the fields _ the bishops
don't want increased efficiency to interfere with the practice of
fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, working together with
horse-drawn machinery and handheld implements.
 &HT;    Notably, some Old Order Amish allow some diesel-powered
equipment in the fields _ if it's hauled by animals. ``Does it
bring us together, or draw us apart?'' is the primary question the
bishops ask in considering whether to permit or put away a
technology.
 &HT;    ``The Amish employ an intuitive sense about what will build
solidarity and what will pull them apart,'' says Donald Kraybill,
author of ``The Riddle of Amish Culture.'' ``You find
state-of-the-art barbecues on some Amish porches. Here is a tool
they see as increasing family coherence: Barbecues bring people
together.''
 &HT;    Asked what kinds of questions the bishops will likely raise
about cell phones, Kraybill replies, ``Are cell phones being used
'to make a living' or just for gossip and frivolous chatter? Will
permitting cell phones lead to having phones in homes, and where
will that lead ... to fax machines and the Internet?''
 &HT;    I also sought out several of the more boldly experimental
members of the greater Plain community and soon was directed to
Moses Smucker, who runs a harness shop in Churchtown, Pa. He might
look like Abe Lincoln, in his black suit and mustache-free beard,
but he bore the same time-is-money air of any factory manager
taking a few minutes out of a busy day to talk to the press.
 &HT;    Where Amos was rough hewn and wry, Moses seemed shrewd and
slick. His office was certainly in a different century from Amos's.
An electronic rolodex and an electric calculator sat atop an old
roll-top desk. I noticed a clock in the shape of a horse and buggy.
The whip ticked back and forth.
 &HT;    ``When I started this business in 1970,'' Moses said, ``it
wasn't accepted to have a telephone in the building, even in a
business. But the telephone began to be accepted through popular
disobedience. More businesses put them in and the bishops didn't
stop them.''
 &HT;    Will the bishops also eventually allow phones in the home? I
asked.
 &HT;    ``When the telephone first came out here, people put them in
their homes,'' Moses explained. ``But they were party lines. One
time a woman overheard two other women gossiping about her. She
objected. That wasn't what we wanted for our families or our
community, so the bishops met and home telephones were banned.''
 &HT;    I had heard the same story from several other Amish _ in fact,
this story seemed to be a key part of community mythology.
 &HT;    A writer named Diane Zimmerman Umble, who grew up in Lancaster
County and had family roots in the Plain orders, traced the story
to its origin, a 1986 memoir written by an Old Order Amishman born
in 1897.
 &HT;    As a graduate student, Zimmerman Umble started investigating
Amish community telephones for a course on contemporary social
theory, and ended up writing a book on the subject, ``Holding the
Line: The Telephone in Old Order Mennonite and Amish Life.''
 &HT;    Zimmerman Umble pointed out that part of what makes cell phones
so handy _ the lack of a wire _ also poses a special challenge for
the Amish. ``In the early part of the community discussion,
electrical and telephone lines carried substantial symbolic
freight,'' she said.
 &HT;    The wires meant that anyone in the community could easily see
who was using electricity and phones. ``But now, in the absence of
the line, behavior can't be monitored in the same way. It is harder
to maintain separation between home and business when you have a
cell phone in your pocket. In that sense it tests the community
consensus about what is allowable.''
 &HT;    Though the Amish determination to allow phones at work but ban
them at home might seem hard to accept, I appreciate the
deliberation put into their decision. In fact, similar reflection
might highlight conflicts between our own practices and values.
 &HT;    How often do we interrupt a conversation with someone who is
physically present in order to answer the telephone? Is the family
meal enhanced by a beeper? Who exactly is benefiting from call
waiting? Is automated voicemail a dark hint about the way our
institutions value human time and life? Can pagers and cell phones
that vibrate instead of ring solve the problem? Does the enjoyment
of virtual communities by growing numbers of people enhance or
erode citizen participation in the civic life of geographic
communities?
 &HT;    Indeed, what does one's use of a tool say to other people,
particularly loved ones, about where they stand in our priorities?
We technology-enmeshed ``English'' don't have much of this sort of
discussion with our tools.
 &HT;    I came away from my journey with a question to contribute to the
dialogue: If we decided that community came first, how would we use
our tools differently?

U.S. DOLLAR COULD BECOME OFFICIAL ARGENTINE CURRENCY, OFFICIALS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ A month after President Carlos Saul
Menem first floated the idea of trading the Argentine peso for the
U.S. dollar, U.S. and Argentine officials are considering the
complexities of making the Federal Reserve the central bank of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of both countries say there is a long way to go
before negotiations take hold and actually produce a treaty. Still,
no one is completely dismissing the idea that dollars could become
the currency of Argentina and the Fed could become the lender of
last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Menem also went a step further by suggesting that neighboring
Brazil resolve its economic crisis by pegging the value of its
currency one-to-one to the dollar, just as Argentina did in 1991.
That, too, would be a move toward replacing Brazil's currency, the
real, with the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine officials say that once Argentina and Brazil converted
their currencies to the dollar, they could move the entire Western
Hemisphere decisively toward a regional currency like Europe's new
euro. More than likely, the officials say, Mexico would also follow
Argentina's lead, and the hemispheric currency would inevitably
become the greenback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shocking novelty for a country like Argentina to make
this kind of a proposal,'' said Carlos Fedrigotti, president of
Citibank in Argentina. ``President Menem has started the debate and
it has to do with the future of not only Argentina but of the
entire continent, which will have to eventually fall under the
influence of the dollar in trade, capital flows and ultimately in
geopolitics.''
</P>
<P>
   The dollar is already omnipresent in Argentina. Most cab drivers
and restaurants accept dollars. ATM machines offer both dollars and
pesos. Virtually all mortgages and apartment rental contracts are
drawn up in dollars. Even cellular phone bills are stated in
dollars and customers are free to pay in in either U.S. or
Argentine currency.
</P>
<P>
   As of Feb. 15, $36.9 billion in Argentine certificates of
deposit were denominated in dollars compared with $13.6 billion in
pesos. Nevertheless Menem's proposal to totally replace the peso
with the dollar has been greeted by sneers by much of the Argentine
opposition and the news media. Brazil has said it has no interest
in the idea, although that could change if its currency continues
to slide.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed
skepticism. Argentine private sector enthusiasts and government
economists say the idea is probably years away from fruition, even
as they argue that replacing the peso with the dollar would lower
interest rates and boost foreign trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 10 months remaining in his term, Menem has made
what he calls ``dollarization'' of the economy his top economic and
diplomatic priority. Senior Argentine officials have begun informal
talks with officials at the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal
Reserve, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has
encouraged the Argentines to make a formal treaty proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollarization could be just a good idea that disappears in a
few months because of politics,'' Miguel A. Kiguel, Argentina's
undersecretary of finance, said in an interview. ``Or, it could be
a good idea that will generate its own positive momentum. My guess
is Argentina could be a very important pilot case that would open
the door to other countries, mostly in Latin America, to adopt the
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Today only Panama and Liberia, two tiny countries with long
historical attachments to the United States, use the U.S. currency
as their own. (Panama ran short of the greenbacks several years ago
but generally it has had enough of them to go around.) And in no
country in Latin America is the dollar exchanged anywhere nearly as
freely as it is here.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine economists note that in technical terms, converting
Argentina into a dollar economy would be no large feat. Under the
1991 convertibility scheme, all peso notes issued by the Argentine
central bank are backed by dollar or gold reserves. In the last
year, all government bonds, even those sold on local markets, have
been denominated in dollars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Menem has asked his senior economic advisers to draw up plans to
pay government employees in dollars and collect taxes in dollars,
moves that would speed a transformation to a dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   Argentines became attached to the dollar in the 1980s, when
inflation galloped so fast that people converted their paychecks to
dollars as fast as they could. Of the $5 billion in Argentine bank
accounts in April 1991, when the peg was installed, nearly 40
percent were in dollars. The peg virtually ended capital flight,
and Argentine bank accounts have grown to $78 billion, 57 percent
of which are now held in dollar accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people already can freely choose whether they deal in
pesos or dollars,'' noted Sen. Domingo Cavallo, a former economy
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But by publicly raising the issue of a future replacement of the
peso with the dollar almost immediately after Brazil devalued the
real six weeks ago, government officials said Menem was sending a
powerful signal to the international investment community that
Argentina had no intention of following Brazil's example. They said
Menem would convert Argentina into a dollar economy by emergency
decree should the peso come under a severe speculative attack.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's move succeeded in reducing the difference in interest
rates between Argentine bonds and the lower rates on U.S. Treasury
bills over the last month. And in another sign of renewed
confidence, Argentine commercial bank accounts have accumulated
funds since Menem first spoke of ``dollarization.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentine officials said they want to negotiate a treaty with
the United States that would make the Federal Reserve the lender of
last resort in case an Argentine bank should fail. They also want
the U.S. government to compensate the loss Argentina would sustain
of $750 million in yearly interest earned from the U.S. Treasury
bills the Central Bank currently holds. That interest would be
automatically lost once the Central Bank sold its dollar reserves
to the public to take pesos out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
   To entice Clinton administration officials _ and eventually U.S.
senators whose approval would be needed for any treaty negotiated _
Menem's advisers are drawing up a series of proposals. One would
give the Federal Reserve a strong supervisory role over Argentine
financial institutions. Another would guarantee that the Argentine
government would control its fiscal and current account deficits.
And a third would liberalize the Argentine private sector's ability
to fire employees to make local businesses and products more
competitive on international markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed and the Treasury,'' Kiguel, the undersecretary of
finance, said, ``are taking an interest.''

 WHITE HOUSE SEEKS CERTIFICATION OF MEXICAN ANTI-DRUG (FUS-MEXICO-HNS   r use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top State Department official told Congress
Wednesday that Mexico should be recertified as a drug-fighting U.S.
ally, but two other government officials accused the Mexican
government of drug-related corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Beers, the State Department's assistant secretary for
narcotics and law enforcement affairs, praised the Mexican
government for embarking on an ``unprecedented anti-drug campaign
that, to my knowledge, has never been duplicated with any other
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Beers acknowledged that Mexico should do more to stem the flow
of illegal narcotics but insisted that the country was making
strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a black record _ it's a mixed record,'' Beers said,
adding that Mexico spends a higher percentage of its budget to
fight drugs than does the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Constantine, the head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, said corruption in Mexican law enforcement was the
worst he'd seen in his 39-year law enforcement career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuing reports of corruption and the rapidly growing power
and influence of the major organized criminal groups in Mexico
cause us great concern about the long-term prospects for success,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said, ``There is little effective law enforcement
activity leading to the arrest of major traffickers in Mexico.'' He
declined to discuss his view of re-certification but said the
Mexican drug cartels ``have little to fear except the slim
possibility that they will be extradited to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Nelson, the director of international relations and
trade issues for the General Accounting Office, the congressional
research arm, said corruption is a major impediment in the drug
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption remains widespread within Mexican government
institutions, including the criminal justice system,'' said Nelson.
He said the cartels spend over $6 billion annually to bribe Mexican
government officials ``at all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Mexico's overall drug-fighting record was lax. Drugs
continue to flow over the border at the same rate as 1997, he said,
while ``there have been no significant increases in drug
eradication and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has yet to extradite a major drug trafficker to the
United States or to aggressively prosecute money-laundering
operations, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most drug trafficking leaders continue to operate with
impunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials testified Wednesday before the Senate caucus on
international narcotics control.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days, President Clinton is expected to
certify that Mexico has been fully cooperative with U.S.
counter-narcotics activities. The administration is required to
rate about 30 countries each year on their drug-fighting efforts.
Those that are decertified face possible economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked under what circumstances the Clinton administration would
decertify Mexico, Beers said there would need to be drug-related
corruption at the senior levels of the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   That was the standard applied in 1996 when the administration
decertified Colombia over allegations that Colombian President
Ernesto Samper accepted $6 million dollars in campaign funds from
the Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could vote to cancel Mexico's recertification as it
unsuccessfully attempted in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have hinted they might try again because of their
unhappiness with Mexico's efforts to halt the drug flow.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., announced Wednesday that he wants
Mexico decertified.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was disappointed that
Mexico has not extradited alleged drug kingpins to the United
States for trial. But she declined to say whether she would support
the recertification of Mexico. Feinstein opposed certification last
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Constantine, Mexican narcotics cartels operating in
the United States have grown ``virtually geometrically'' over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican drug cartels have penetrated the United States to the
extent that, for the first time, they ``virtually dominate the
nationwide drug trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine called the cartels ``the greatest challenge to law
enforcement agencies in the United States that are enforcing
narcotics laws today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican cartels are responsible for shipping approximately
two-thirds of the cocaine available on U.S. streets.
</P>
<P>
   They are responsible for smuggling in precursor chemicals for
methamphetamine production and starting up laboratories in
California to produce and distribute the drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is common now to find hundreds of traffickers from Mexico
... most of them illegal aliens, established in communities like
Boise, Des Moines, Omaha, Charlotte and Kansas City, distributing
multi-pound quantities of methamphetamine,'' Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana from Mexico dominates the U.S. import market, while
Mexico accounts for a steadily increasing amount _ now 14 percent _
of heroin available on U.S. streets, Constantine said. But the DEA
estimates that more than 29 percent of heroin used in the United
States is smuggled in by Mexican cartels.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Windswept snow will batter extreme southeast New England
Thursday as a formidable low pressure system moves slowly off the
Northeast coast. Depending upon the precise track of the low,
anywhere from several inches to over a foot of snow could
accumulate on parts of Cape Cod. Winds near 40 miles an hour will
cause considerable drifting of the snow. The snow will spread north
into southern New Hampshire and eastern Maine during Thursday night
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a sharp line marking the leading edge of the
precipitation with little snow expected from just west of New York
City to the Connecticut River. Indeed, sinking air currents
associated with high pressure over eastern Canada will suppress
clouds, causing intervals of sun from northern Pennsylvania to
western Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of mainly light snow will accompany a jet stream
disturbance crossing the central Appalachians Thursday morning. The
snow will spread east, reaching the Middle Atlantic coast by
evening. The system will produce a modicum of snow, though a few
inches may blanket the West Virginia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sun will combine with air warming on decent from the
Rockies to bring unusually mild conditions to the Front Range and
western Plains. It will also be rather warm from the desert
Southwest to Texas as sunshine mixes with intervals of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent showers will continue to plague western portions of
Washington and Oregon with snow falling in the Cascades above 5,000
feet. Snow is also likely along the west slopes of the Sierras and
in the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wet Washington
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, a record amount of rain fell on
Washington's northwest coast when a potent disturbance from the
North Pacific moved inland. The town of Quillayute has measured
23.31 inches of rain so far in February, eclipsing the previous
record of 20.60 set in 1982. In fact, this winter season, which
began on Dec. 1, has brought 59.92 inches to Quillayute, less than
one inch below the record wet season set in 1966-67. Another
barrage of Pacific fronts this weekend should guarantee that this
cold season will be the wettest ever on Washington's Olympic
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast for Thursday, Feb. 25
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday: The jet stream will lift up into Canada
allowing much milder air to flow into the Northeast. In the
Southeast, it will be mild with clouds and showers arriving late in
the weekend. A cold front will bring rain and snow showers into the
Great Lakes region. The Plains states will be generally dry and it
will be warming in the Dakotas. Pleasant, warm conditions will
continue in Southwest, while the Northwest remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday: A departing storm will leave behind clouds and
windy conditions in New England. It will be mainly dry and cooler
in the Southeast. A disturbance will bring a wintry mixture to the
Great Lakes and a few showers to the Ohio Valley. Warmer air will
blow in to the southern Plains, while the northern Plains will be
cool and breezy. The West will be cooler with snow in the
mountains. Dry air will cover California.

CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS CRITICIZE DOLE `ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION' AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Dole's current TV ad urging men to seek
treatment for erectile dysfunction has prompted a protest from a
conservative Christian leader who wants Dole to drop the word
``partners'' and use ``spouses'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, a folksy but subdued Dole is seen talking about his
own 1991 bout with prostate cancer and his post-operative concern
over impotence. ``You know, it's a little embarrassing to talk
about ED (erectile dysfunction), but it's so important to millions
of men and their partners that I decided to talk about it
publicly,'' Dole says.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values
Coalition, sent Dole a letter Wednesday that carefully avoided
blaming the 1996 Republican presidential nominee for mentioning
``partners'' in discussing male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon instead blamed a ``politically correct copywriter at the
pharmaceutical company'' sponsoring the ad. The New York-based
pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., manufacturer of the popular drug
Viagra, is underwriting the ad. However, Dole does not offer a
direct endorsement of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the word `partner' is problematic,'' Sheldon wrote
in a letter to Dole. ``It is inconsistent with the common sense,
traditional values of Bob and Elizabeth Dole that Americans know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Sheldon offered no alternative to ``partner.''
But an accompanying press release from the coalition, which draws
members from 40,000 mainly conservative evangelical churches, urged
its replacement with the word ``spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sheldon said it was ``out of
character'' for Dole to refer to a partner instead of a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of a marriage oath is extremely vital to people
of faith,'' Sheldon said. Dole ``certainly doesn't support the kind
of promiscuity that the word `partner' can easily be interpreted to
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between partner and spouse is especially
important during a time when President Clinton and other political
leaders have been under the spotlight for marital infidelity,
Sheldon said. ``I think it's very important that Bob Dole, as a
national leader, does not encourage words that are interpreted
clearly as promiscuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Dole and Pfizer did not return repeated phone
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Montgomery, spokesman for People for the American Way, a
group that has done battle with the Christian right, called
Sheldon's appeal to Dole ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of mindset that says (Dole) shouldn't talk about
a health issue except for people who are married, not acknowledging
the reality that there are plenty of people who have health
problems who are not married, everyone from older people who have
ED (erectile dysfunction) to teenagers in sex ed,'' Montgomery
said. ``A lot of people who are married would not find `partner' to
be a scary word as Lou Sheldon does. I would guess Bob and
Elizabeth Dole would consider their marriage a partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' on Feb. 18,
Dole said that ``if I have any credibility, maybe I can encourage''
some of the estimated 30 million men afflicted with impotence to
seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just from prostate cancer,'' he said. ``It can be
from depression, heavy smoking, heavy drinking, diabetes,
hypertension ... I don't know how else we're going to reach out to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole added that he does not ``prescribe anything or endorse
anything. I tell men to call their doctor.''

 &HT;    INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW ATTACKED AT SENATE HEARING
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law that launched the independent counsel
investigation of President Clinton should be abandoned after two
frequently stormy decades, senators were told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But what, if anything, should replace it is far less certain,
witnesses told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate Republican leader who
helped write the anti-corruption law in the post-Watergate era,
told the panel he now opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act ought to expire'' as scheduled next June, Baker said,
urging Congress to go slow in writing a new statute. ``We ought to
cool off, let some time go by'' after the Clinton impeachment
battle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for what form any new law would take, he acknowledged, ``In
good conscience I cannot say that I know what the answer is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran official who was present at the creation of the
statute also told the panel that the government doesn't need an
independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin B. Bell, who was the first attorney general to work
under the act, said the country should ``go back to the system that
we have always had and under which the Watergate prosecution was
conducted, the Teapot Dome oil scandal was handled, and the Carter
peanut warehouse was investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell recalled that before the statute was passed, President
Jimmy Carter had been accused of laundering bank funds through his
peanut warehouse. Bell appointed an outside investigator who spent
six weeks going over the case with help from Justice Department
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he accounted for every peanut and every nickel'' and
exonerated the president, Bell, now an Atlanta attorney, told the
senators. ``We can go back to that system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at a news conference Wednesday that he had ``some
ideas'' about rewriting the law, but he withheld announcing them.
``I think it would be better for me at this time to say less so
that others can say more,'' he said. He said administration lawyers
would give their views to Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has also agreed to testify on the
issue next month on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes floated during the initial meeting, Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., proposed replacing the current system with an
expanded Office of Professional Responsibility within the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested limiting the jurisdiction of the investigators
to just three officials, the president, vice president and attorney
general, instead of the current total of about 70 officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Senators in both parties took turns taking pot shots at the
current system, which has triggered 21 independent counsels since
1978, angering first Republicans in the Iran-contra probe and now
Democrats, who have blasted Kenneth Starr's investigation of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wrong,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., of
his party's previous backing of the law. He added that his
opposition was so entrenched that he would filibuster any effort to
renew the law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, chairman of the Governmental Affairs
Committee, which has jurisdiction over the law, said he had always
opposed independent counsels for having unlimited time and money to
go after a single target.
</P>
<P>
   He expects changes ``now that Capitol Hill is littered with
gored oxen from both sides,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators raised concerns about dropping the independent
counsel law altogether, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can the executive branch be trusted to investigate itself for
potential criminal wrongdoing?'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``The answer, hopefully, is 'Yes,' but what do we do when
the answer is 'No'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel law is not about sex scandals and spin
doctors and mud throwing,'' he said. ``It's about good
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that many people have already written the
epitaph for the law. In fact, that was an idea endorsed by Bell,
who said, ``I was hoping that today would be the beginning of the
funeral.''

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS CERTIFICATION OF MEXICAN ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top State Department official told Congress
Wednesday that Mexico should be recertified as a drug-fighting U.S.
ally, but two other government officials accused the Mexican
government of drug-related corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Beers, the State Department's assistant secretary for
narcotics and law enforcement affairs, praised the Mexican
government for embarking on an ``unprecedented anti-drug campaign
that, to my knowledge, has never been duplicated with any other
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Beers acknowledged that Mexico should do more to stem the flow
of illegal narcotics but insisted that the country was making
strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a black record _ it's a mixed record,'' Beers said,
adding that Mexico spends a higher percentage of its budget to
fight drugs than does the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Constantine, the head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, said corruption in Mexican law enforcement was the
worst he'd seen in his 39-year law enforcement career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuing reports of corruption and the rapidly growing power
and influence of the major organized criminal groups in Mexico
cause us great concern about the long-term prospects for success,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said, ``There is little effective law enforcement
activity leading to the arrest of major traffickers in Mexico.'' He
declined to discuss his view of re-certification but said the
Mexican drug cartels ``have little to fear except the slim
possibility that they will be extradited to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Nelson, the director of international relations and
trade issues for the General Accounting Office, the congressional
research arm, said corruption is a major impediment in the drug
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption remains widespread within Mexican government
institutions, including the criminal justice system,'' said Nelson.
He said the cartels spend over $6 billion annually to bribe Mexican
government officials ``at all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Mexico's overall drug-fighting record was lax. Drugs
continue to flow over the border at the same rate as 1997, he said,
while ``there have been no significant increases in drug
eradication and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has yet to extradite a major drug trafficker to the
United States or to aggressively prosecute money-laundering
operations, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most drug trafficking leaders continue to operate with
impunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials testified Wednesday before the Senate caucus on
international narcotics control.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days, President Clinton is expected to
certify that Mexico has been fully cooperative with U.S.
counter-narcotics activities. The administration is required to
rate about 30 countries each year on their drug-fighting efforts.
Those that are decertified face possible economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked under what circumstances the Clinton administration would
decertify Mexico, Beers said there would need to be drug-related
corruption at the senior levels of the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   That was the standard applied in 1996 when the administration
decertified Colombia over allegations that Colombian President
Ernesto Samper accepted $6 million dollars in campaign funds from
the Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could vote to cancel Mexico's recertification as it
unsuccessfully attempted in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have hinted they might try again because of their
unhappiness with Mexico's efforts to halt the drug flow.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., announced Wednesday that he wants
Mexico decertified.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was disappointed that
Mexico has not extradited alleged drug kingpins to the United
States for trial. But she declined to say whether she would support
the recertification of Mexico. Feinstein opposed certification last
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Constantine, Mexican narcotics cartels operating in
the United States have grown ``virtually geometrically'' over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican drug cartels have penetrated the United States to the
extent that, for the first time, they ``virtually dominate the
nationwide drug trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine called the cartels ``the greatest challenge to law
enforcement agencies in the United States that are enforcing
narcotics laws today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican cartels are responsible for shipping approximately
two-thirds of the cocaine available on U.S. streets.
</P>
<P>
   They are responsible for smuggling in precursor chemicals for
methamphetamine production and starting up laboratories in
California to produce and distribute the drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is common now to find hundreds of traffickers from Mexico
... most of them illegal aliens, established in communities like
Boise, Des Moines, Omaha, Charlotte and Kansas City, distributing
multi-pound quantities of methamphetamine,'' Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana from Mexico dominates the U.S. import market, while
Mexico accounts for a steadily increasing amount _ now 14 percent _
of heroin available on U.S. streets, Constantine said. But the DEA
estimates that more than 29 percent of heroin used in the United
States is smuggled in by Mexican cartels.

A LURID MOVIE, BUT MAYBE NOT LURID ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``8MM,'' in which Nicolas Cage stars as a clean-living,
conservative private eye who is pulled into the world of snuff
films, looks as if it might emit the same kind of grimy charge as
``Hardcore.'' ``(Hardcore'' starred George C. Scott as a hard-nosed
Calvinist who has to thunder into the world of porno to get his
daughter back.) But ``Hardcore'' had a new-to-movies messiness,
although it was finally too pat to be very interesting. ``8MM,''
however, plants a flag where too many have been before.
</P>
<P>
   Cage is Tom Welles, a man uses the distance of professionalism
to view the scummy world of lies and affairs that he monitors for
other people. He is hired because of his sterling reputation for
discretion. Cage internalizes the cramped, slightly cold nature of
such a guy a little too efficiently. Unfortunately, he's not as
interesting playing a remote, unimaginative man as he is at
portraying a wild, impulsive one _ and the picture is built around
him. Which means ``8MM'' has a dried-out, flavorless center. When a
wealthy widow asks him to dig into the truth behind a snuff film _
a movie in which someone is killed on camera _ he gets to come to
life a bit. Although he warns the woman that snuff films are
``urban legends,'' watching what looks like the geek from ``Pulp
Fiction'' murder a worn-out and frightened young girl horrifies
Welles. It's the most arresting point of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``8MM'' refers to the size of the film _ 8 millimeter, a very
old format _ on which the film was shot, and figuratively to the
amount of imagination that went into the making of the film.
Directed by Joel Schumacher, whom many haven't forgiven for any
number of other films _ ``A Time to Kill, Batman Forever, Batman &AMP;
Robin, Falling Down'' _ ``8MM'' has a strange gleam of
professionalism despite its sordidness. The characters' fear seems
only decorative, as if it were just an element to spice up the
proceedings rather than an intrinsic part of the material.
</P>
<P>
   Welles leaves behind his wife (Catherine Keener) and young
daughter to stalk the seedy underworld of LA and find the men
responsible for the snuff film. He meets a weaselly but
good-hearted adult-film store employee (Joaquin Phoenix), who
introduces him to its perverse denizens. Phoenix gets to play the
live-wire second-banana role that Cage would have played 10 years
ago. And Cage, who made his bones with bravura, has a lead that's
even more thankless than his part in perhaps the stupidest movie
ever made, ``Con Air,'' in which he at least got to show some comic
flair.
</P>
<P>
   He is strapped to a movie that, given its potential low-rent
allure, takes itself way too seriously. He's stranded with a number
of fine actors, including James Gandolfini, currently giving the
most finely tuned performance in series TV on HBO's ``The
Sopranos.'' (Poor, talented Keener is relegated to the role of
perching a baby on her hip and, inevitably, warning her husband
that if things keep him away too long, she won't there when he gets
back.)
</P>
<P>
   As written and conceived by Andrew Kevin Walker, who created
``Seven'' (and did an uncredited major rewrite on ``The Game''),
``8MM'' is another feature about a man having to test himself in
circumstances that will probably scar him forever. When he works
with ``Seven'' director David Fincher, who has an intuitive gift
for getting under your skin, the seams don't show in the way they
do here. The only reason people may be talking about this movie
after today is because by blurring the line between sex and
violence _ which American movies do pretty often; this just calls
attention to it _ ``8MM'' is sure to stir up some controversy.

A NEW WAY TO GET AN EARFUL OF ART

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ You're at the Kimbell Art Museum to see
``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry.'' And dozens of people are
TALKING ON THE PHONE?
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, you fume, can't people leave their busy little lives
behind for just an hour or so to enjoy a little culture?
</P>
<P>
   Calm down. They are.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Kimbell patrons can use the ArtPhone, a
digital random-access audio guide that allows far greater freedom
than the old earphones-and-tape system. It rents for $4, $3 for
museum members.
</P>
<P>
   Black, thin, about a foot long and manufactured in Israel, the
ArtPhone does away with having to tour an exhibit in strict order
in a big mass of people _ and worrying about getting your hair
mussed or losing an earring.
</P>
<P>
   The phones come via Acoustiguide, the New York company that
distributes them to more than 100 sites worldwide, including the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, zoos, aquariums, botanical
gardens, and historic homes and sites such as the Roman baths in
Bath, England. The phones debuted at the Louvre in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Simply hit ``C'' for clear, the number of the stop on the tour
(there are 22 for ``A Gentle Rivalry''), and ``play.'' And you're
instantly listening to narration by Kimbell director Timothy Potts,
with guest curator Yve-Alain Bois doing the voice of Pablo Picasso
and former curator Joachim Pissarro doing the voice of Henri
Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   You can pause. You can repeat. You can skip numbers. Because the
ArtPhone has random access, you can go where you want, when you
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love it because they have control,'' says Judy
Wilbanks, who manages the ArtPhones for ``A Gentle Rivalry.'' She
adds that the Kimbell has 740 phones for the exhibit; each is
stored, programmed and recharged in a large rack. Charges last
eight hours. ``They can find out about the exhibit they're standing
right in front of. They feel more free with it,'' Wilbanks said.
</P>
<P>
   And if you just HAVE to have earphones, they're still available
_ by request.

 &HT;    Turner South to repackage stock films, TV shows
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse ``The Gov'' Ventura will wrestle again, this time in
reruns of his famous bouts to be aired on a new regional cable TV
channel, Turner South.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of Ventura's wrestling career illustrates the
strategy behind Turner Broadcasting's 18th cable TV channel,
formally announced Wednesday and scheduled to debut sometime this
fall. It will air in Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Mississippi
and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, Turner Broadcasting has signed neither cable or
satellite distributors. The sales effort for Turner South began
with the formal announcement of it at a morning press conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The channel is a classic Turner play. It will repackage and
market movies and TV shows from Turner's vast film libraries. ``We
have a history of launching new channels off our content,'' says
Bill Burke, the president of TBS, who will serve in the same
position for Turner South.
</P>
<P>
   Burke says a regional channel makes sense for Turner
Broadcasting because the company's brand is second only to
Coca-Cola in the South. It's a reputation built over the 25 years
since founder Ted Turner first began beaming Braves games across
the region in one of the first cable TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Turner South represents a new play for the
company. Turner South is the first regional cable TV channel and,
if it works, the company may try others in different parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have considered other regional networks,'' says Burke,
although he declined to disclose any details.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South also represents a change in the cable TV industry.
No longer are big new national channels the rage. They're too
expensive to launch, and channel space at cable systems is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult, if not impossible to start new networks,''
says Burke.
</P>
<P>
   So Turner Broadcasting is trying a niche channel that, at best,
would have no more than 6 million subscribers. That's the total
potential market for Turner South, according to its parent's market
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect full distribution but, even so, Turner South
will make money,'' says Burke.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? Because the expenses of Turner South would be
relatively low, with the company drawing on its current
administrative, sales and marketing staff to run it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most of the Turner South's content would come from
the film libraries of Turner Broadcasting and parent Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   For Turner South, shows will be packaged and marketed with a
Southern spin. The best of World Championship Wrestling, including
Ventura's old bouts, is an example. Another idea in development is
``Kudzu Theater.'' It will feature B movies with the marketing
slogan ``Movies that grow on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting executives will also heavily season Turner
South's programming with original shows. A big part of original
production will include live sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The company owns three local sports teams, the Braves, the Hawks
and nascent hockey team the Thrashers. Most of the rights to games
played by these teams are already owned by other channels,
including Turner Broadcasting's own TNT and TBS cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But Burke says he anticipates the broadcast rights for 30 Braves
games will be available each year. Turner South would try to
acquire the rights to a yet-undetermined number of these games, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South, though, is not modeled after Fox Sports South and
other regional sports channels, says Burke. He explains, ``This
channel is really a first of its kind, the first regional
entertainment channel.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ As the ethnic Albanian delegation to the
Kosovo peace talks near Paris prepared to return home, its leaders
announced plans to form a provisional government led by a member of
the major separatist guerrilla group, the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The move was clearly intended to create much-needed unity among
the ethnic Albanians, who have been hampered in their bid for
international recognition by their lack of a unified political
leadership. It will also give the rebels their first taste of
political power.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of unity was immediately dashed by an
announcement by Adem Demaci, an important political leader within
the rebel army, that he would not recognize the provisional
government. Demaci, a Communist-era dissident with strong support
among students, is an uncompromising supporter of independence for
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci opposed the guerrilla army's role in the peace talks and
refused to attend himself. The army nevertheless sent five members,
including a political representative, Hashim Thaci, who led the
negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci criticized the new plan, saying neither he nor the
general headquarters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a collective
body that leads the guerrillas, had been consulted. In a statement,
he described himself as the political leader of the rebels, and
said the provisional government would have no legal legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much support Demaci has among field
commanders, but his fierce opposition raised alarm in Kosovo that
he could split the guerrilla movement. That could prove disastrous
militarily for the separatists, who have been drastically outgunned
in their fight against Serbian security forces that have tried to
end the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The three men who signed the plan were Thaci; Ibrahim Rugova,
leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo and the current political
leader of the province, and Bujar Bukoshi, leader of the United
Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The three parties would have equal representation in the
provisional government, but the rebel army is emerging as the
strongest player. The prime minister of the government would be a
member of the separatist army, according to a KLA statement issued
in France.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes after years of sometimes acid rivalry
between the three movements. Until recently, Rugova and the army
had refused to recognize each other. Much of the rivalry centered
around the personalities of Rugova and Demaci. The United
Democratic Movement, which split with Rugova's party last March,
has also been a bitter critic of Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, during the 17 days of talks in France, the
delegates managed to contain their differences and even won praise
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for their work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main responsibilities of the provisional government,
which would rule until elections were organized, would be to
control the large sums of money donated by the Albanian diaspora.
Much of the money goes to support the guerrilla army, but some is
intended for educational and medical programs for ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
province's population, have been virtually denied access to the
Serb-run government services, and have set up their own educational
and medical networks in Pristina, the capital, and around the
province.

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS SCANDALS WON'T HAMPER DEALINGS WITH CONGRESS
 &HT;    460&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton dismissed concerns Wednesday that
a year of scandal has severed the trust between the White House and
congressional Republicans, even as he dodged new allegations
reaching 20 years into his past.
</P>
<P>
   With his Senate acquittal less than two weeks old, ''some of the
nerves are still raw'' on both sides of the impeachment issue,
Clinton said, and it should surprise no one to see an erosion of
confidence between him and his political foes.
</P>
<P>
   But ''their feelings are not important here _ just like my
feelings are not important,'' he said. ''We have an oath to
fulfill, a responsibility to fulfill. We were hired to do the
public's business, and they expect us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the president still can't put troubling questions about
his personal life behind him. In the session's first question,
Clinton was asked to comment on allegations by Juanita Broaddrick,
an Arkansas nursing home operator, that he forced her to have sex
with him in her Little Rock hotel room in 1978, when he was the
state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ''My counsel made a statement'' in response to those
allegations, Clinton replied. ''I have nothing to add to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, released a statement
Friday that said, ``Any allegation that the president assaulted
Mrs. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false. Beyond
that, we're not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick has never filed formal charges against Clinton. In
fact, she signed an affidavit a year ago contending that no assault
ever took place.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, she has said in interviews with The New York
Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and NBC
television that Clinton did assault her, and that her sworn
statement to the contrary was a lie to protect herself and her
family from the trauma of revisiting the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that question, Clinton focused on foreign affairs in
his 50-minute appearance with President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana. He
offered lengthy explanations of U.S. policy in Africa, Iraq and
Kosovo in his most expansive news conference since the Monica
Lewinsky sex-and-deception scandal erupted 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying questions that allowed him to step from the
shadows of his impeachment scandal and hold forth on policy
matters, Clinton smiled often during the press conference, joked
with Rawlings, held his hand and even offered an apology, of sorts,
for the dearth of questions from the U.S. press about Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really my fault, because I don't let them ask me enough
questions on other occasions,'' said Clinton, who has held only one
solo White House press conference since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I'm forcing them to use this opportunity to pepper me,''
Clinton joked to Rawlings. ``I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused Iraq of seeking a ''symbolic victory'' through
its almost daily attempts to shoot down U.S. warplanes patrolling
Iraqi skies.
</P>
<P>
   American pilots, however, will continue to fire on Iraqi
military positions whenever they are targeted by Iraqi radar and
anti-aircraft guns, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. jets have attacked Iraqi missile sites more than 80 times
since the United States led air raids and cruise missile launches
against the Mideast oil giant last December.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the almost daily attacks have done more
damage to Iraq than the hundreds of missiles and bombs that struck
the country during the December offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would prefer for the dangerous situation to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I regret this,'' said Clinton. ``I wish he would
stop doing that,'' he said, in an apparent reference to President
Saddam Hussein's orders for his military to target U.S. warplanes
that overfly his country every day to enforce a United
Nations-mandated no-fly zone across northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying, obviously, for the symbolic victory of
shooting one of these planes down and perhaps trying to intimidate
us from enforcing the no-fly zone, which we're still bound to do
under the United Nations resolution,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he (Saddam) would make an agreement with the United
Nations to let the inspections go back,'' Clinton said, referring
to the U.N. teams that were inspecting Iraq's alleged efforts to
produce and stockpile chemical, nuclear and biological weapons
until Saddam expelled them in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that we are not interested in hurting the Iraqi
people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Following an Oval Office meeting Tuesday between Clinton and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., both Republicans repeatedly declined to say
whether they trust Clinton in the wake of the year-long Lewinsky
sex-and-deception scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they parried reporters' questions on the subject and
spoke only of wanting to work with the White House across an array
of policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton refused to say on Wednesday whether he
trusts Hastert or Lott, both of whom voted against him in the
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we focus on the American people and doing our duty, and not
on whether we're mad or happy, disappointed or elated about the
events of the last year, then all this in the course of time will
work itself out, and the American system will be validated,'' said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a political leader, ''it is simply wrong for you to think
about what your feelings are,'' said Clinton. ``Your responsibility
is to fulfill your oath and do what the public needs, and if we
focus on that, we'll be just fine.''

 &HT;    Starbucks expansion plans stick with big cities
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask for a skinny decaf grande Espresso Macchiato in Marfa and
you might get some strange looks. Forget about getting a hot cup of
Guatamala Antigua in Goldthwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for that to change anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   That's because while Starbucks Coffee, maker of the big-named
bean juices like those, is adding 500 stores this year, most are
planned for big cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz stood
before a happy house of shareholders in Seattle and touted the
company's progress in bringing its coffeehouse culture to the rest
of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 2,000 stores worldwide, including 106 stores in
Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston. Not even El
Paso has made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Austin, where you can hardly hurl a stone without
hitting a Starbucks or some other java joint _ in some circles the
capital city has rapidly become the cappuccino city _ Starbucks is
opening at least one new store this year in mid-March at 24th and
Nueces streets just west of the University of Texas campus. The
Seattle-based company has opened nine Austin locations since coming
to town four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When determining where to place a new Starbucks, the company
looks at a number of demographic factors, including average age,
average income and whether a city's residents have been ordering
coffee from the company's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   While Starbucks may never make it to the Panhandle or the small
towns of East Texas, its presence still may be felt there. The
company tapped Pepsi-Cola Co. to sell its Frappuccino blended
coffee beverage, which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category,
said Schultz. Starbucks also joined Kraft Foods, Inc. in a
licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell its beans at
supermarkets around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in
America,'' said Schultz. ``We are going to have much, much more
than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise
you.''

``200 CIGARETTES'' IS SHALLOW PUFFERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is like a Rhino Records compilation with
pictures that move, a various-artists soundtrack that someone
draped a story on. It takes place on New Year's Eve 1981, with
several young characters drifting through New York en route to an
East Village party, but it could take place in 1998 for all the
'80s nostalgia it offers. Unlike ``American Graffiti,'' this
picture's most obvious influence, it feels more like an excuse for
young stars to play dress-up than a wistful look back at a simpler
era.
</P>
<P>
   After Christina Ricci had such a breakthrough year in 1998, it's
depressing to see this movie waste her, as it does Janeane Garofalo
and Martha Plimpton. With three such strong, watchable actresses in
the cast, it's surprising that Courtney Love gives the movie's best
performance. Her Lucy is a cliche, the tramp who just wants to be
loved, and it's probably fair to say that Lucy is close to Love's
heart. But she grabs hold of the old tough-vulnerable bit, using
her oversize mouth and astonishingly warm eyes to create the
movie's only fully rounded character.
</P>
<P>
   Why Lucy wants longtime friend Tom (Casey Affleck, Ben's
brother) is a mystery; he's a world-class moper, and he sports such
bad sideburns that you wish you could shave the screen. But then,
nobody here is a prize catch (hang on, because this gets
complicated). Angela Featherstone and Nicole Parker play friends
who believe that they'll be jinxed for all of 1982 if they don't
have New Year's sex; maybe this is be the Northern, pre-AIDS
version of eating black-eyed peas for luck. They both try to land a
clumsy bartender who's really a smarmy wannabe lawyer (Ben Affleck,
who gives a decent performance laced with self-mockery). Lucy has
her eye on him, too, but she also has her eye on Tom, who runs to
his most recent ex (Garofalo) at the most inconvenient time.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ there's more! There's Ricci's adventurous Val and her
nervous pal, Stephie (Gaby Hoffman), really Noo Yawking it up as
Long Islanders who get lost looking for the party; they hook up
with a shy, Adam Ant-inspired punk (Clueless' Paul Rudd) and his
silent buddy (Guillermo Diaz). And over here, we have Jay Mohr as
Jack, who can't help making women fall in love with him almost
immediately, including Cindy, the klutzy woman he just deflowered
(Kate Hudson). Jack doesn't know why he has this effect on women;
but then, neither does the movie, which can't figure out how to
explain this device. The Jack-Cindy plot thread, filled with bad
slapstick, is the movie's most annoying element.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ there's still more! There's Monica (Plimpton), the
party's host, verging on a breakdown because it's 9:30 and nobody
has shown up. Who should be the first person through the door but
ex-boyfriend Eric (Brian McCardie), a guy so bad in bed that women
dump him after first contact. The movie never explains this,
either; when Eric suggests that he can learn to be a better lover,
women simply tell him, no, he can't.
</P>
<P>
   Linking all this together is Dave Chapelle as a good-natured,
pot-smoking cabdriver who gives the characters unsolicited advice
(he has to be good-natured, because he's apparently the only cabby
in New York who picks up fares). He's a device like Wolfman Jack
was in ``American Graffiti,'' but he's used badly; it's a mistake
to get him to interact with the other characters. His real purpose
seems to be to get some Kool &AMP; the Gang and Manhattans songs onto
the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Costello, who has a credit as ``music consultant,'' shows
up in a gratuitous cameo that feels like a sitcom's sweeps-month
casting stunt.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first feature for director Risa Bramon Garcia and
screenwriter Shana Larsen, who may have bitten off more than they
chew with a movie so ambitious. Because it doesn't have the ease of
``Graffiti,'' and because its nostalgia is all surface, it comes
off as a shallow exercise for a bunch of stars who weren't out of
preschool when the movie takes place. This nostalgia thing is
getting frightening; one shudders to think of a 2010 movie that
looks back fondly on the '90s. Back in 1981, we probably thought
that by 1999, we'd be looking forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is rated R for strong language, sexual
situations, drug use and some crude humor.

 &HT;    BEGALA STILL LOVES TEXAS, BUT WILL STAY IN D.C.
 &HT;    (Attn: Texas)
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing personal, Texas. But now that presidential
adviser Paul Begala is leaving the White House, the former
Austinite plans to keep on living in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't love Texas. Cut me and I bleed orange,''
Begala said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's whole family is in Austin and I have family all
across Texas,'' Begala said. ``My undergraduate and law degrees are
from UT, and my wife got two graduate degrees there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I just couldn't stomach the thought of moving
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Diane moved their family to Washington after his
work with partner James Carville for Clinton's 1992 campaign led to
plentiful business as a political consultant, and to a position as
an unofficial adviser to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   They moved back in 1995 to Austin, where he represented
corporate clients at Public Strategies Inc. and taught a course on
``Politics and the Press'' at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Begala's old Washington friends became as distant
emotionally as they had become geographically because they thought
he was one of the major sources of the descriptions in Bob
Woodward's book, ``The Agenda,'' of liberal disenchantment with
Clinton's first-term record.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed when the Begalas moved back to Washington
in mid-1997, after Clinton asked him to join the White House staff
as part of an effort to jump-start the president's stalled second
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our kids are in school here, and I got some good jobs
lined up, so we won't have to move again,'' Begala said. ``I'll be
teaching, writing and lecturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala, who said he is ``37 and aging rapidly,'' said he plans
to hit the public lecture circuit, write a political column for
George magazine and start this fall at Georgetown University as a
research professor teaching graduate and undergraduate courses in
public policy and ``the inner workings of American government.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he won't be returning to Public Strategies, he consulted
Tuesday with its founder, Jack Martin, about how to announce his
departure. Begala revealed his plans Wednesday morning on Don
Imus's radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Imus asked Begala, one of Clinton's fiercest defenders on the
talking-head TV shows throughout the Monica Lewinsky debacle,
whether he would return to Clinton's side if another shoe drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about any shoes dropping; I feel like I spent the
last year in Imelda Marcos' closet,'' Begala joked.
</P>
<P>
   In an effusive written statement released shortly afterwards,
Clinton said, ``I am grateful that he has used his razor-sharp mind
and wit in the service of core values and the common good. Paul has
given long hours to the service of his country, and he has more
than earned the right to seek new horizons through teaching and
writing, and to spend more time with his three young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala said he was profoundly grateful for the chance to work
with Clinton, even though Begala was among those whom the president
misled about his private activities with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans understand loyalty. Only in Washington is loyalty a
dirty word,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of the policies this president has enacted for
the country,'' Begala said. ``And look what he did for me. He took
me from being a perfectly good Triple-A ballplayer and, when I was
barely 30, he put me in the big leagues.''

'98 TRADE DEFICIT SHOWS U.S. IS STILL STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The media treatment of the record 1998 trade deficit
has been a vivid reminder of how the issue promises to become
increasingly ripe for political exploitation in the next election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The general tone conveyed the view that the $169 billion
shortfall was a bad thing when it was nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   Do Japan's media characterize that country's huge trade
surpluses as beneficial developments? It would be difficult to do
so and be taken seriously with Japan mired in its worst downturn
since it became a global economic power.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, does it make sense to put the worst possible
face on a record U.S. trade deficit during the eighth year of
expansion? This growth occurred, incidentally, as most of the rest
of the world was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, exports of U.S. goods declined, which was troubling. It
should hardly be surprising, however, that America's exporters
would suffer when we're an island of prosperity in a sea of
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of whether the red ink was all that
humongous in relative terms. The previous record was $153 billion
in 1987. Since then the Consumer Price Index has soared well over
40 percent, which means the record really wasn't when adjusted for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Another way of looking at the deficit is in the context of gross
domestic product, which is the value of the economy's output. To
its credit, The Wall Street Journal distinguished itself by
providing this perspective. The trade deficit in 1987 was 3.3
percent of GDP, but only 2.2 percent of last year's GDP. Moreover,
it shouldn't be forgotten that total international trade was a much
smaller component of the overall economy in '87 than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, trade balance numbers can't be characterized
as best or worst. They're only accounting constructs. If deficits
were bad and surpluses good, Japan would have long ago surpassed
America as the biggest and strongest economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if anyone cares to make the bad-good argument, it could
be argued that the '98 trade deficit was a good thing. The most
obvious reason is that the deficit is a reflection of prosperity
that allows American consumers to purchase prodigious amounts of
both domestic and foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
   The less obvious reason is that without the affluence of
acquisitive Americans, most of the rest of the world would have no
hope of reviving their economic fortunes. Forget the International
Monetary Fund with its suffocating and often counterproductive
prescriptions for economic revival in troubled countries. The best
medicine for most of the world's economies is an open world market
that allows Americans to be the buyers of last resort. Without this
freedom to trade, the world would be a much less stable place
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obviousness of this situation, trade issues are
always easily distorted by politicians seeking to use economic
jingoism to woo voters. As a result, cries for protectionism will
be raised during the next election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If they're heeded, it will mark the beginning of the end of the
nearly two decades of rising prosperity Americans have enjoyed
thanks to increasingly liberal trade policies worldwide.

YOUNG FILMMAKER IS MAKING HER MARK WITH GUINEA PIG FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Mickey and Minnie, Donald and Daisy, Huey,
Dewey and Louie _ with these creations of ink, paint and celluloid
Walt Disney captured the world's imagination and built an
entertainment empire.
</P>
<P>
   On a more modest scale, Alyssa Buecker of Lawrence is doing much
the same thing with Hazel, Curly Fry, Milkshake, Slinky, Brown 'Un
and Winky and Dinky _ guinea pigs who are the stars of the
14-year-old's homemade video shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Although she hasn't yet launched a Disney-style show-biz
dynasty, Alyssa is making her mark. Her guinea pig films have won
prizes in the annual Kan Film Festival _ a competitive event for
film and video makers in Kansas and Missouri _ and her first three
shorts are playing on HBO Family, the kid-themed cable channel that
began operating earlier this month. (The channel is not yet carried
by local cable systems).
</P>
<P>
   The stories have such subjects as stolen lettuce leaves and an
alien guinea pig (in a lunchbox rocket), and _ in all candor but
quite understandably _ they aren't very technically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   But Alyssa is fearless about finding her own solutions to
cinematic problems in her shorts, which range from 2 to 5 minutes.
And that _ as Dolores Morris, vice president of HBO Family, notes _
may be the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astounding how much these kids learn on their own,'' said
Morris, who selected Alyssa's films for the channel's ``30 By 30:
Kid Flicks'' series. ``They aren't afraid of technology. They grab
cameras and computers and just figure it out. Some of the work is
so sophisticated it's almost scary. Other films _ like Alyssa's _
look like they were made by kids, but they're also spontaneous and
fresh and unself-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that Alyssa has been offered an HBO contract to create a
fourth guinea pig movie, she's mulling over topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought I'd make `Guinea Pig for President,' which
would be about an election,'' Alyssa said recently in an interview
in her south Lawrence home. ``But now I'm thinking about a medieval
movie. I could build cardboard castles, and I've got a friend who
could make costumes.''
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, Alyssa will have no problem staging crowd scenes.
She and her parents _ Brad Buecker and Nancy Pistorius _ share
their home with 19 of the South American rodents (as well as two
Yorkie dogs, a cat and a couple of African frogs). All those guinea
pigs require lots of wood-chip bedding, which leaves the Buecker
home smelling like a cedar chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend not to do things in moderation,'' said Pistorius.
``Both my husband and I have a soft spot for animals, but we've
finally drawn the line on accepting more guinea pigs. The pet
stores saw us as an easy touch, someone who would adopt all their
unsold pigs. At one point we even ended up with a gerbil with no
back legs that was destined for snake food.''
</P>
<P>
   But what are you going to do when your only child is a guinea
pig fanatic and the president of the local guinea pig club? Alyssa
seems to love everything about the cuddlesome creatures. Perhaps
most appealing are their distinctive personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel, for instance, is ``stupid but sweet.'' Onion Ring is
``short-tempered and rambunctious.'' Sonya is ``completely
laid-back. Not a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Alyssa's attraction to guinea pigs, it only makes sense
that they became the subject of her first movie, ``Hazel the Guinea
Pig's Package,'' which was shot three years ago as part of a
community filmmaking class at Oldfather Studio in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Her second effort was ``The Christmas Caper,'' shot in Alyssa's
bedroom with the family's video camera on a set dressed with Barbie
furniture. The story: When tasty lettuce intended as a Christmas
present is secretly gobbled down by a couple of young guinea pigs,
their mother calls in a detective _ Hazel again _ to solve the
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Alyssa turned out ``Guinea Pigs From Mars,'' in
which Earth pigs encounter a spacecraft inhabited by a rodent from
outer space. They provide the fuel the visitor needs to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa said that guinea pigs don't take direction well. As a
result, her films rely on luck and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I can get them to go where I want by waving carrots
just out of sight,'' she said. ``But mostly I just let them run
around the set and film them, and then see what I can do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa handles just about every aspect of production: building
sets, operating the video camera, dubbing most of the pigs' voices
and editing the footage.
</P>
<P>
   So far Alyssa isn't getting rich from her films _ she received
$100 from HBO for her three shorts _ and she's not even sure that
she wants to make a career of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do something with computers and pets _ maybe
become a vet,'' she said.

 &HT;    Kiwi halts trips to Atlanta

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kiwi International Air Lines is ending Atlanta service
Friday, citing a shortage of planes and a shift in strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi has served Atlanta since its 1992 founding by ex-Eastern
Airlines workers. But the schedule had shrunk to just two daily
Atlanta-Newark flights because of financial troubles lingering from
a 1996 bankruptcy filing. The carrier, which now operates just four
planes, is focusing on flights between New York and Puerto Rico and
Florida, a spokesman said.

WOMAN CONVICTED IN PHYSICAL ABUSE OF TWO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ They came to Kansas City last summer to enjoy the
area's attractions. But for the 8-year-old Wichita-area boy and his
6-year-old sister, the visit became a nightmarish month of torture
at the hands of the relative who was supposed to take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   Their 12-year-old sister was forced to watch as the younger
children were beaten and kicked. They were bound with duct tape and
burned with hot water and bleach, and clumps of hair were pulled
from their heads.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Merriam woman whom the children stayed with last
July and August pleaded no contest in Johnson County District Court
to two felony counts of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Silvia Wheeler, 35, leaned on a cane and cried as
Assistant District Attorney Sheri McCracken detailed the children's
injuries in the case against her.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing evidence that would have been presented at trial,
District Judge Peter Ruddick found Wheeler guilty of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler is a cousin of the children's father. Relatives told
police that Wheeler may have injured the children in an attempt to
obtain prescription pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler has a history of drug-related offenses, according to
Johnson County court records. She is on probation for prescription
fraud, and she illegally possessed methadone when she was arrested
in the abuse case. The methadone charge was dismissed as part of
Tuesday's plea.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam police Detective Mike Daniels said investigators were
never able to determine the motive for the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the injuries and trauma, this is one of the top two
child-abuse cases I've ever seen,'' said Daniels, who has been in
law enforcement for 12 years. A previous case involved similar
injuries to a younger child.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels was dispatched to Wichita to interview the children
after the abuse was reported there in August. They were scared and
withdrawn, he said. The little girl sat clutching a teddy bear and
wouldn't talk at all. He said it was obvious that they were
suffering painful injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs that McCracken offered in court Tuesday showed both
children with swaths of bright pink flesh on their faces, buttocks,
backs and arms where the outer skin had been burned or rubbed away.
</P>
<P>
   The children came to stay with Wheeler in early July. The abuse
was not discovered until Aug. 9, when their mother took them back
home to the Wichita area.
</P>
<P>
   A week before, their father had tried to get them, but Wheeler
turned out the lights and hid the children, McCracken said. Other
relatives assured the father that the children were fine, and he
went home without them.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old sister later told police that Wheeler had
threatened to blame her for the injuries if she tried to tell
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The older girl said she saw her siblings slammed into floors and
doors. Scalding water and bleach were poured on them and scrubbed
on their bodies. A chemical burn damaged the little girl's left
eye. Her brother was suffering extreme weight loss and dehydration,
according to McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   She said both children suffered second-degree thermal and
chemical burns. At times, the children were bound with duct tape,
had socks stuffed in their mouths and their mouths were taped shut.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police that Wheeler was ``always mad.'' Once, he
told police, he tried to run away, but she caught him and
threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler remained free on bond pending her sentencing, which was
scheduled for April 9. How long Wheeler may have to serve will be
determined by Kansas sentencing guidelines, which depend in part on
previous convictions.

Wednesday. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-ARIZONA (Washington) - President Clinton's trip to Arizona
represents a combination of political opportunities and personal
interests. White House sources say the president chose this visit
because his schedule had not allowed him to attend a memorial
service for Mo Udall last month in Tucson to meet privately with
Udall family members. Clinton also sees a chance to regain momentum
for his beleaguered Social Security rescue plan among Arizona
seniors who gave him surprising support (based largely on his
Social Security views) in the 1996 election. And the trip presents
an opening to thank Pima County voters, who campaign officials
considered the key to Clinton's becoming the first Democrat to win
the state since Harry Truman. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FORESTS (Grand Canyon, Ariz.) - Federal park officials plan to log
thousands, perhaps millions, of trees at Grand Canyon National Park
in an effort to reduce the fire danger in the forests that line the
canyon's rims. If their experiment is deemed successful, the entire
park could be covered with stumps, and the same `forest
restoration'' treatment could be used in logging other national
parks. With TREES. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will mve in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TREES (Flagstaff, Ariz.) - An account of the different efforts to

 &QL; 
GAYS-EPISCOPAL (Phoenix) - The Arizona Episcopalian bishop is
calling on the denomination to ordain non-celibate gay priests and
to find a blessing, though not marriage, for same-sex unions. He is
not calling for disobedience, though, but for compassion in the
contentious debate on human sexuality in the church. By KELLY

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Adding a new dose of uncertainty to the
Balkans, China said Wednesday that it would veto leaving a United
Nations peacekeeping force in Macedonia, which borders the region
where Serbs and ethnic Albanians have been locked in bitter
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force, which has served as a firebreak against
spreading instability in the Balkans since 1995, is due for renewal
with a vote on Thursday in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council's 14 members other than China have indicated their
support for the mission, but as one of the five permanent members,
China has veto power.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining Beijing's decision, its representative here, Qin
Huasan, said his government had previously made clear its
reservations about the Macedonia force but had taken a ``flexible
and cooperative approach.'' Now, he said, ``the situation is
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, Western diplomats here agreed, is that
Macedonia has become embroiled in China's dispute with Taiwan. Last
month the Macedonians granted diplomatic recognition to Taiwan in
return for a substantial aid package, estimated here at between $1
billion and $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Chinese diplomats told other Security Council
members that they ``cannot be responsible for the consequences'' of
Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan, which Beijing regards as
a renegade province, and they repeated their argument that the
Macedonia force was no longer justified.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Qin said, the 1,100-member force _ consisting mainly
of some 360 American soldiers, 640 Scandinavians, and 51
Indonesians _ had completed its mandate and ``should be
concluded.'' Consequently, China would exercise its veto for only
the fifth time and kill a resolution that would have extended the
mission for another six months.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that a Chinese veto means that the peacekeepers
will be forced to return to barracks and can no longer continue
their assigned task of monitoring Macedonia's borders with Albania
and the troubled southern Serbian province of Kosovo in order to
prevent the unrest in those areas from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that the force will be unable to play its other
role as a confidence-builder between the various ethnic factions
within Macedonia, which broke away from Yugoslavia in 1992.
Macedonia has a population that is about 30 percent ethnic
Albanian, with important Bulgarian, Turkish and Gypsy minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say they will now try to persuade China to let
the troops remain at the bases in Macedonia for another month or so
while they work out some other solution. Various possibilities are
under discussion, including turning the mission over to NATO, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or some group
of interested countries operating outside the U.N. framework.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a military force in Macedonia might come to seem less
necessary if the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians agree to the West's
peace plan for Kosovo and allow NATO to deploy a large force there.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when he recommended that the Security Council keep the
peacekeepers in Macedonia for another six months, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said their presence has helped
insulate the country against ``spillover'' from the conflict in
Kosovo as well as from the general instability pervading the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence inspired by its presence has been useful in
defusing tensions that could have arisen as a result of the
continued crisis in Kosovo,'' Annan wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has consistently sought to punish countries that afford
Taiwan recognition as an independent state. Conversely, Taiwan,
with a prosperous industrialized economy, is known to have offered
substantial rewards in the past to countries willing to defy
Beijing's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time China has used, or threatened to use, its
Security Council veto to block U.N. peacekeeping operations in
countries whose friendly relations with Taiwan angered Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 China blocked plans to send military observers to
Guatemala after that country tried to raise Taiwan's international
status in the General Assembly. But it lifted its veto 10 days
later after receiving private assurances from the Guatemalans. The
previous year China threatened to do the same over Haiti but gave
way again after receiving private assurances.

GOP MUST GO TO THE MIDDLE TO WIN, GERALD FORD TELLS AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ Republicans should concentrate on reclaiming
the middle of the political road, former President Gerald Ford said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to win if you retain only the policies of
the hard right,'' he said during a private reception at the Truman
Library in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats lost when they were on the hard left. Don't be
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford addressed more than 200 people in the Truman Library
auditorium. His appearance highlighted the public opening Wednesday
of a traveling exhibit, ``/{Time/} and the Presidency,'' which
showcases /{Time/} magazine photographs of every president since
Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   In prepared remarks, and later in responses to questions put to
him by longtime /{Time/} magazine staff writer Hugh Sidey and
Walter Isaacson, the magazine's managing editor, Ford discussed the
possibility of a woman president as well as his belief that the
country's politicians should be prepared to move beyond the
President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know something about healing a divided country,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why, last October, well aware that it wouldn't be
popular with many in my own political party, I proposed to end the
Lewinsky matter with a formal, public and bipartisan rebuke of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``I hope that anyone who wants to be president in 2001 will
focus on America's future rather than Bill Clinton's past. The past
we can leave to history. And there's no way to spin history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford insisted the country would soon see a woman president, and
even had a scenario as to how it would come to pass. A woman first
will get elected as a vice president, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the president will die, get shot or something, the woman
will become president and that will be the last time we have a male
president,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Sidey explained how sexual indiscretion is
not synonymous with the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Sidey, who has covered each president since Dwight Eisenhower
for /{Time/}, said that one result of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
was the rise of the dubious wisdom that ``everybody did it'' when
serving in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonsense,'' Sidey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I covered nine presidents. Two of them did, and one of them
possibly did. But six of them did not.''
</P>
<P>
   If Presidents Clinton and Kennedy did commit such indiscretions
while in office, and if Lyndon Johnson did also, as some historians
have speculated, Sidey said, that leaves many more presidents who
did not. That's one reason the institution of the presidency will
survive today's scandal, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no doubt in my mind that Bill Clinton's
presidency has been diminished,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson said the Lewinsky scandal demonstrated the strength of
the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be one of those optimists,'' he said. ``I believe
that the events of the last year showed the strength of the
presidency and the common sense of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The /{Time/} exhibit consists of several small galleries devoted
to presidents from Franklin Roosevelt through Clinton, all
featuring photographs from the pages of /{Time/}. The exhibit,
which will travel to other presidential libraries over the next two
years, starts at the Truman Library, where it will stay through May
15.
</P>
<P>
   Sidey conceded that the White House correspondents he joined
during the Eisenhower administration operated under different rules
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, the press was not as hostile or destructive. Most
of the media people back then wanted the president to succeed.
There was a feeling that we all were in this together, and there
wasn't this wretched hostility that has grown up over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Sidey said, was an indiscreet president whose
infidelities were not brought to light because he enjoyed what now
appears to be a ``window'' before the rise of more aggressive
broadcast television correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was before there was Geraldo, before the scrutiny that
was so intense,'' Sidey said.

 DEAR DR. ROSS: wHY LEAVE `ER' TO COME HERE?  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors love to localize the big story, give it a spin that
resonates with the hometown crowd. In a report from the Super Bowl,
for instance, you'll always find an item on the athlete who once
played for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a pre-emptive strike against any editors who may have
been watching George Clooney's valedictory on ``ER'' last week, we
offer this journalistic localization.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Ross,
</P>
<P>
   Word is you've ordered your last Chem-7 in the Windy City and
are heading west. Northwest, to be precise. Portland or Seattle, to
be more precise.
</P>
<P>
   What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   You think a hospital out here is going to hire a rule-flouting,
lip-pouting, authority-doubting guy just because he went to medical
school in Seattle and happens to love kids? I can't speak for
Portland, Dougie, but we don't brook any violation of protocol out
here in the Big Wheezy. Aside from Starbucks' plan for peace,
harmony and good parking kharma through self-espresso, we take
things seriously. Shoot, anyone who breaks a humerus has to go to
California for treatment. No funny business in Seattle. No sirree,
Bob, Doug.
</P>
<P>
   So don't get any ideas, Mr. pesky pediatrician. There'll be no
cutting in the latte line without permission, no honking the horn
without permission, and no upping the morphine drip without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   As to your job prospects, well, let's go to the videotape. You
engaged in a little unauthorized euthanasia, lied to your
supervisors, jeopardized their careers, walked out on the woman who
loves you, prompted her demotion and almost got her clinic shut
down, endangered the life of a colleague in a car wreck, and seem
to have lost the will to shave. Based on a preliminary scan of the
job market, the only things you're qualified for right now are
tortured country singer and special guest on Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle liked country before country was cool, Doug, but
Nashville might be the smarter choice here. As for Jerry Springer,
he tapes in Chicago. You wouldn't even have to leave town. (Carol
Hathaway would be so happy.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you must go, here's a tip. When you get out this way,
find KACL on the radio dial and tune in this shrink of the airwaves
named Frasier Crane. He's so haughty he makes Microsoft humble, but
he gives good counsel when not engaged in dilettantish foppery. You
may not like him, but he recently spent a few months in your shoes.
Unemployed, that is. Besides, he grew up here and has been back in
the area for almost six years. Might be a good contact.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. Before you leave Chicago for good, there's this
German place on Adams, just off State. It's called the Berghoff.
Been there forever. If you don't mind, could you pick up a hot
corned beef sandwich with potato salad? Hold the gastric lavage.
</P>
<P>
   Many thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Best regards,
</P>
<P>
   John

 &HT;    Air Force to cut research jobs
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Air Force is preparing to cut research jobs
at Wright-Patterson Air Force and elsewhere as it struggles to
downsize to a smaller budget.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in the Air Force Research Laboratory's highly technical
work force of about 6,000 people are expected as early as next
week. Congressional staff sources say the Air Force wants to
complete the lengthy reduction-in-force process by Oct. 1, when the
next fiscal year begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has not disclosed the size of the cuts, but
lawmakers are bracing for ``significant'' cuts in their districts,
one congressional aide said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Dayton) said the expected cuts will have
``a dramatic, long-term effect on our ability to design new weapons
systems'' and will ``affect the lives of hundreds of the scientists
who conduct the research.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is among several lawmakers critical of the sudden move. The
Clinton administration just delivered the budget for fiscal year
2000 at the beginning of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force is trying to push this change before Congress
has a chance to question it or examine other options,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources were uncertain how big the personnel cuts
will be, but the scale of the funding cuts has stirred concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know the magnitude of the personnel cuts until the
Air Force completes its (accounting) exercise. However, given the
magnitude of the budget cuts, the personnel cuts are significant,''
Hall aide Michael Gessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Any cuts in AFRL are likely to have a big impact on Wright-Pat.
</P>
<P>
   AFRL's headquarters is there and half of its 10 research
facilities, dubbed directorates, are located at Wright-Pat in the
Wright Research Site. The Wright site is responsible for nearly
half of AFRL's approximately $1.27 billion in science and
technology funds in this year's budget. About 2,400 civilian and
military AFRL personnel work at Wright-Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers contend the cuts result from an abrupt decision in the
Air Force to funnel an extra $100 million into space-based radar
and laser programs at the expense of other research.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and other lawmakers whose districts include AFRL research
sites said the Air Force is shortcutting the congressional budget
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't become law yet (but) they're already assuming it's
going to happen,'' U.S. Rep. Ciro Rodriguez (D-Texas) said Tuesday.
His district includes Brooks Air Force Base, where AFRL confirmed
it plans to eliminate research on pilot physiology and training.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's proposed budget would reduce applied research,
basic research and advanced technology development _ the three
accounts that form its science and technology budget _ by more than
$84 million.
</P>
<P>
   Research programs at Wright-Pat, such as advanced propulsion and
materials, would take significant cuts. One area _ hypersonics,
research on extremely high-speed aircraft and missiles _ would be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AFRL is boosting space-related research, mainly on
space-based radars and lasers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the space-based laser _ a derivative of the Reagan
administration's so-called ``Star Wars'' ballistic missile defense
program _ would get $63.8 million next year, nearly double this
year's funding level.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory cuts cause special concern because the Air Force was
founded on the notion that its war-fighting ability would be based
on science. Today's most advanced technologies, such as stealth,
``smart'' bombs and night-attack capability, reflect years or
decades of scientific research and technology development.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force's science capability resides in the brainpower
of its researchers. More than half of AFRL's work force _ about
3,500 _ are scientists or engineers. More than 800 have Ph.Ds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force has suddenly decided to dismantle a major part
of its capability,'' Gessel said. ``When these people go out the
door, it will be very difficult to get (the capability) back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez likened the research cuts to getting rid of farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't start a farm after you realize you need food. It
takes time to develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AFRL spokeswoman Maj. Ginger Jabour said she couldn't release
any information about job reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force is going to be making the announcement'' at the
Pentagon, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But AFRL Commander Maj. Gen. Richard Paul acknowledged the
``painful internal exercise'' of identifying jobs to be cut In an
open letter to AFRL personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's push to become an ``Expeditionary Aerospace
Force'' means research must focus on space-based programs, he wrote
in the February ``Commander's Corner'' on the AFRL Internet Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The above strategy will affect almost every AFRL site in terms
of reducing or eliminating programs and their associated manpower.
We are in the process of identifying specific numbers for each,
which we hope to have by the end of February,'' he wrote.

 &HT;    Isakson a civil influence for Washington
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If ever a town seemed to need somebody, Washington
needs Johnny Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   It's not simply Isakson's affable, low-decibel style that makes
one hopeful he can have a positive influence in the poisonous
atmosphere of present-day Washington. Many a rational,
bridge-building civic leader has gone off to Congress and been
turned into a partisan cynic.
</P>
<P>
   What's especially encouraging about the newly elected 6th
District congressman is that his civility has already been tested
under difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Before most of his Republican colleagues in Washington knew what
it was like to play hardball with James Carville and Paul Begala,
Isakson had the experience in his 1990 governor's race against Zell
Miller. He had a bitter battle within his own party in the 1996
U.S. Senate primary with Guy Millner, and has differed with the
religious right over the most contentious subject, abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Isakson family fortune is based on residential real
estate, a field in which the ability to smooth over disagreements
in order to make a deal is reckoned a virtue. It's been the
defining stamp of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   As a suburban legislator during the Georgia GOP's formative
years, Isakson learned how to operate within the House of Tom
Murphy and the party of Newt Gingrich, a contradictory challenge
that would test the skills of the most nimble negotiator. When
Miller reached across party lines to tap him for the job of state
school board chairman, his reputation, as one who could put old
grudges behind him and provide leadership for a bipartisan agenda,
was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan on being any different in Washington than I am in
Georgia,'' Isakson said Wednesday. As the most junior member of the
House, until Louisiana's 1st District elects a successor to Bob
Livingston this summer, Isakson's ability to work any change on the
prevailing culture of Washington will be modest, but he arrives at
a time when the capital is searching for signals of the national
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson said he thought his solid win in Tuesday's special
election ``sent a message about negative politics.'' It didn't hurt
that he had an overwhelming advantage in money and name
recognition, but after two bruising losses in which negative
attacks against him played a part, Isakson was entitled to draw his
own lesson from the victory.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever it means as a bellwether, there could hardly be a
sharper change in style than the transition from Gingrich to
Isakson. In the long run they are in the same party, however.
</P>
<P>
   His differences with social conservatives have been ``by degree,
but not by direction,'' Isakson said. Within Republican ranks that
direction isn't always clear right now.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert is backing away from the 10 percent
income tax cut Isakson campaigned on, but the new congressman said
he was confident the Republican Congress will continue to search
for ``responsible tax cuts'' and that the income tax would be ``the
major debate of the presidential election in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime there is the necessary work of making Washington
a more civil place, a job Johnny Isakson was made for.

U.S. AND 5 ALLIES REJECT GLOBAL TREATY ON TRADE IN GENETICALLY
ALTERED GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Attempts to forge the world's first global
treaty to regulate trade in genetically modified products failed
Wednesday morning when the United States and five other big
agricultural exporters rejected a proposal that had the support of
the rest of the roughly 130 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty would have required that a country approve in advance
any imports of agricultural commodities that have been genetically
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the treaty, led by European nations, said it would
reduce the risk of spreading harmful ecological effects as genes
from different species are introduced into plants, animals or
microorganisms. But Washington and its allies argued that it would
entangle the world's food trade in red tape and that a treaty
should exclude food products and cover only seeds, plants, animals
and microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 percent to 45 percent of major crops grown in the United
States are genetically modified, and American negotiators feared
the proposal could block or stall more than $50 billion in annual
farm exports.
</P>
<P>
   Bleary-eyed delegates from many nations, who have been
negotiating day and night for more than a week, expressed fury at
the United States, accusing it of intransigence and of putting the
interests of its world-leading farming and biotechnology industries
above the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's five nations against the world,'' said Joseph M. Goto,
the delegate from Zimbabwe, although Washington and its allies
actually total six. Those in agreement with the United States are
Canada, Australia, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. ``There could be
no greater injustice than that,'' he said. The United States, he
added, ``is holding the world at ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates agreed to suspend the talks and resume them no
later than May 2000. The United States had urged this, saying there
were still too many unresolved issues to allow a consensus to be
achieved by the deadline, which was Tuesday. In the meantime,
individual countries, particularly in Europe, will continue to
limit the introduction of genetically engineered agricultural
products, including food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be much better to get a sound instrument a year hence
than to get a flawed instrument today,'' said Rafe Pomerance,
deputy assistant secretary of state for environment and
development. But delegates from some other nations feared the
process would now lose momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has often taken a stance different from much
of the rest of the world on trade and environmental matters. It has
not ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity reached at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 because some senators fear
that American interests would be jeopardized. The current talks on
the so-called Biosafety Protocol are an outgrowth of the
biodiversity treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Biosafety Protocol would require exporters of genetically
modified organisms, such as seeds into which new traits had been
added by gene-splicing, to obtain prior approval from the importing
country. Such regulations are intended to allow countries to reduce
the ecological risks from introducing genetically altered plants,
animals and microorganisms into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists worry, for instance, that a gene conferring
insect resistance or drought tolerance on a crop could spread to
weedy relatives of that crop through cross-pollination, creating
superweeds.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point in the biosafety negotiations was
whether the requirement for advance approval by the importing
nation should apply to genetically altered agricultural commodities
meant for eating or processing, as opposed to planting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its allies argued that such a requirement would
not protect biodiversity because commodities like corn and soy
beans do not enter the environment. Developing nations and the
European Union argued that commodities should be included because
they have seeds that can be planted.

</P>
<P>
   Another unresolved point of dispute was Washington's position
that World Trade Organization rules should take precedence over the
Biosafety Protocol, to prevent other nations from using biosafety
as an excuse to erect trade barriers. The developing nations and
Europe wanted the biosafety protocol to be equal to WTO rules or
take precedence over them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williams, a spokesman for the United Nations Environment
Program, said this was the first environmental treaty he could
remember in at least 20 years in which an agreement was not reached
by the self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But officials here said the big stakes involved for industry
made this matter particularly difficult. ``It's the first time that
you have really possibly a legally binding instrument dealing with
trade and the environment at the same time,'' said Veit Koester, a
Danish environmental official who chaired the working group that
drew up the draft of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   It perhaps complicated things that the industry involved was
biotechnology, in which the United States holds a firm lead. There
have been a rising number of disputes in recent years between
developing and developed nations over the control of genetic
resources, the raw material for biotechnology, which some analysts
predict will be to the next century what oil and metal were to this
one.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in one sense was in a strong negotiating
position because it did not want a treaty as badly as the
developing nations and therefore had less reason to compromise.
Indeed, three years ago Washington opposed starting the biosafety
negotiations, and many people at this meeting thought its real
intention was to torpedo the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years of negotiation have been a constant attempt
to delay, not negotiate, block,'' said Chee Yoke Ling of the Third
World Network, a Malaysia-based group working on environmental and
development issues. ``They've always said, `No, No, No,' and they
delayed and they diluted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States could have been isolated. But it
strengthened its hand by aligning with Canada, Australia and three
agricultural exporters from the developing world: Argentina, Chile
and Uruguay. Without the support of such major exporters, any
protocol would have been meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just too important, too big and maybe too thoughtful
to be ignored,'' Pomerance, the American negotiator, said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Washington did make compromises. But he added: ``There
were two compromises we were not prepared to make. One is to tie up
trade in the world's food supply. The second is to allow this
regime, without a lot of deliberation, to undermine the WTO trading
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. government and the biotechnology industry would
have something to gain from a treaty, were it not too onerous. A
treaty could have helped assuage public fears about biotechnology,
which are much greater elsewhere in the world than in the United
States. And having a unified global regulatory scheme would be
easier for companies than having each nation adopt its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has extensive regulations restricting the
planting of seeds as well as the importing of food that has been
genetically altered. Individual countries have enacted their own
patchwork of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see a little more international harmonization
of the regulatory framework,'' said Willy De Greef, head of
regulatory and government affairs for Novartis Seeds AG, a division
of the big Swiss pharmaceutical company. ``It creates a level
playing field and clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the food and biotechnology industries and the U.S.
government argued that genetic engineering has not been shown to be
a big threat to biodiversity, especially compared with the
destruction of tropical forests to create farmland. They also said
that environmental groups and developing nations were trying to
expand the treaty to deal with human health and the social and
economic effects of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to get this protocol to develop issues that
are really important but not part of the protocol,'' said Joyce
Groote, a spokeswoman for Canada's biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have complained in the last few days that
the protocol had been watered down to the point of near
insignificance. But in the end, some said that even the weakened
treaty would have been better than none.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment's the loser, always,'' said Beth Burrows,
president of the Edmonds Institute, a nonprofit organization in
Edmonds, Wash., which deals with biosafety issues. ``There was no
moral high ground here,'' she added. ``There was no scientific high
ground here. It was just cheap power politics.''

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE CLINTON BUDGET FOR VETERANS
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers on Wednesday criticized the
administration's Department of Veterans Affairs budget for next
year, claiming it would degrade medical care for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's plan would freeze the VA medical care budget
at $17.3 billion, same amount appropriated this year. The budget
also called for new initiatives, including treatment of hepatitis
C, treatment of 54,000 additional veterans, and the opening of 89
new outpatient clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the president's budget supports a number of important
initiatives, it offers no new dollars to support them,'' said Rep.
Lane Evans of Illinois, the ranking Democratic member of the House
Committee on Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., who chairs the panel's health
subcommittee, called the VA budget proposal ``troubling. This
budget includes $1 billion in cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Mike Doyle of
Pennsylvania, said members on both sides of the aisle were
concerned about the proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee will work to increase the budget for the
Department of Veterans Affairs,'' Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   State veterans' officials who testified at the hearing were
sharply critical of the budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration ... does not understand anything about the
military or about our veterans and could care less,'' said Nick
Bacon, director of the Arkansas Department of Veteran Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Trujillo, a former Veterans Health Administration network
director for Arizona, New Mexico, and the western part of Texas,
said ``administering this budget will be like trying to build a
house of cards in an Oklahoma tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier Wednesday, several veterans groups
asked the department to release plans for any possible cuts in
veterans' medical care and services or the closure of any
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the organizations expressed concern at the
plan to eliminate nearly 8,000 fulltime employees from VA health
care nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation's veterans should be warned now what medical
services stand to be curtailed or eliminated in the event this
restrictive budget is allowed to prevail,'' said Homer Townsend,
Jr., national president of the Paralyzed Veterans of America.

   NEW YORK _ Users of a new Sony laptop computer can alternately
``point and click'' and ``point and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Technology Entertainment Design Conference, Sony
introduced the Picturebook, a $2,300 laptop computer with an
embedded digital camera. The camera, which sits at the top of the
monitor and can be swiveled 360 degrees, is designed to capture and
store still images and up to 60 seconds of video images. The
computer runs at 266 megahertz, with 64 megabytes of memory and a
4.3-gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to differentiate its new laptop from a zillion clone
computers with similar processing speed and memory, Sony promises
that the Picturebook is an ``all-in-one solution for professionals
on the go,'' including such disparate users as real-estate agents,
interior designers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company insists that the Picturebook will be a boon to
parents who want to store images of the family and use e-mail to
send them to far-flung relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be a while before desktop-based digital cameras
are seen as something more than a gimmick, particularly given that
limited bandwidth makes it time-consuming to send and receive
pictures. And users may still find it socially awkward to arrange
the children into a portrait, raise the mobile computer, and say,
``OK, everyone, smile for the laptop.''

   A Tag Knows Your Name, And It Knows Where You Are
</P>
<P>
   Should employees be paranoid about their own name tags? A new
technology called Arial View uses badges that emit infrared signals
every two seconds to monitor electronically the exact location of
employees. Receiver-transmitters can be placed in each room of a
business to pick up the signals and report an employee's
whereabouts to a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   But the maker of the Arial View, the Arial Systems Corp. of
Vernon Hills, Ill. (www.arialsystems.com), insists that employees
should not mind. It says the system gives salespeople and managers
more freedom to move around the office, while still being
accessible for urgent phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   What if the employee does not want to be found? It is not
possible to turn off a badge's infrared emitter, an Arial spokesman
said, acknowledging that some skeptical clients worry that the
monitoring technology may be less of a big help and more like Big
Brother.

   New Playstation Is Expected To Have the Power of a PC  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents who worry that their children while away too many hours
playing video games now have permission to become apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the Sony Playstation will be powered by a
processor many times more powerful than the current generation,
some video game industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   For nerds keeping score at home, the chip is expected to run at
250 megahertz, up from 33 megahertz in the current Playstation. The
processor is slated to be 128-bit, up from 33-bit (the bit
measurement indicates the amount of information that can be
processed at once).
</P>
<P>
   Translation: the game station is expected to include a big
upgrade in graphics, 3-D imagery and video capability that could
induce an entire generation to never leave the joystick.
</P>
<P>
   Sony acknowledged that it was working on such a chip in
partnership with Toshiba. But Sony did not confirm that it would
use the chip in the next generation Playstation, nor would it
disclose when the game system would be in stores. Industry analysts
expect it to be available late this year.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the advance in the microprocessor means that the
brain of the Playstation _ and for that matter, the brains of
competing game systems _ is matching and in some respects exceeding
the power of PC processors.
</P>
<P>
   Sega, a Sony competitor, sells a game station in Japan called
Dreamcast that can double as a CD player and Internet terminal.
Dreamcast, with a 128-bit processor and a 200-megahertz chip, will
be available in the United States in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Video game chips ``used to be the ugly stepchildren, while PCs
got the real he-man chips,'' said Tim Turley, senior editor of The
Microprocessor Report, which follows the chip industry. ``One of
the trends we're seeing is that chips in consumer items will give
PCs a real run for their money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gory details are uninteresting to most consumers,'' he
added, but he said the bottom line was that ``the next-generation
Playstation will be even cooler than the current one.''

   Private E-Mail Greetings Are Made Public by Mistake  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark, which encourages lovers to open their hearts,
inadvertently opened a database of supposedly private personal
tidings, leaving some of them in a public place.
</P>
<P>
   The Hallmark site permits well-wishers to send private e-mail
missives to one another. The trouble is, the company left a file
containing some private messages attached to the site's publicly
accessible search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark attributed the mistake to a ``programming error'' that
occurred when the company upgraded its servers in December. Julie
O'Dell, a company spokeswoman, said the messages were publicly
accessible for eight weeks, until Hallmark corrected the problem
earlier this month. She also noted that the affected messages were
from 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hallmark is having trouble with Web secrecy, it is not
having any problem keeping secret the number of messages affected
by the programming error.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Dell would say only that fewer than 1 percent of messages
sent from the site had been affected. She declined to give an
absolute figure or provide a number from which the percentage was
drawn.

   Hitachi Offers Bigger Notepad For the Screen-Tapping Crowd  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi has given the stone writing tablet a major upgrade. This
week, the company introduced the HPW-600ET Handheld PC, which is
something of a mix of a personal digital assistant and a stone
tablet. The computer is 6 inches long and nearly 9 inches wide, but
the surface area is taken up almost entirely by a touch-sensitive
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Users interact with the device either with a stylus or the
old-fashioned way, with a finger (or the really old-fashioned way,
with a stick). The computer comes loaded with Windows CE fare,
including Pocket Word, Powerpoint and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   Selling for $1,199, the gadget also includes a 56K modem and 16
megabytes of memory. It weighs less than two pounds and has a
battery life of nine hours, the company said. The company is
pitching the tablet not just for consumers but also for industrial
uses, like the documentation of patients' status by health-care
workers.

   Gateway To Give a Year Of Net Access With Computers  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the clearest evidence yet that the Internet is the main
catalyst for PC sales today, computer maker Gateway said Wednesday
that it would now include a year's worth of Internet access in the
price of nearly all new computers it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, customers had to pay about $15 a month to connect to
the Internet through Gateway's own Internet service, Gateway.net.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it had paid about $21 million for a 19.9
percent stake in the online retail operation of NECX, a company
based in Peabody, Mass., that sells computers, software and
peripherals over the Internet. NECX will operate a new online store
for Gateway called Spotshop.com, where customers can shop for more
than 30,000 computer products, not just Gateway products.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway customers will be able to have all of their computing
needs met entirely through Gateway's Internet services, said Ted
Waitt, the company's co-founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Waitt said he expected that other PC makers, including Gateway's
chief rivals, Dell and Compaq, would also eventually begin bundling
Internet access as a standard feature on new PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway was the first direct vendor of PCs to become a
nationwide Internet service provider, but early customers
complained of unreliable service and difficulty connecting to the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gateway subcontracted its Internet operations
to UUNet, a division of MCI Worldcom, which will provide service
under the new bundling plan.

 MIAMI: Florida ports.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been a serious effort to alter the tax rules,
and the industry has developed an effective lobbying presence in
Washington to protect its interests.
</P>
<P>
   While all the members of the International Council of Cruise
Lines are foreign businesses, campaign finance law allows the
organization to have political action committees and raise
donations from cruise line employees who are U.S. citizens. In the
1997-98 election cycle the group donated $166,146 to House and
Senate candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The council spent more on lobbying. In its latest full-year
report filed with the Senate, it said it spent $557,023 on lobbying
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $380,000, went to the law firm of Alcalde &AMP;
Fay for work on tax and immigration issues. The firm, which is run
by Hector Alcalde, a former congressional staff member, received an
additional $200,000 in the first half of 1998. Alcalde is the
father of Cynthia Colenda, who worked at his firm before taking
over as president of the International Council of Cruise Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the lobbying was evident in the budget bill
for the current fiscal year. An innocuous-looking item, Section
114, amended the immigration act by inserting a single word,
``state,'' and a comma. Doing so eliminated as much as $20 million
a year in fees from cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had been authorized
to assess $6 per passenger to cover inspection costs for people
arriving in American ports on cruise ships, unless their cruise had
begun in Canada, Mexico or a U.S. territory. Adding ``state''
expanded the exemption to passengers whose travel started in the
United States _ eliminating the fee for all but the tiny number of
transoceanic passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service calculated that the change cost it $20
million a year, a spokesman, Greg Gagne, said. ``We were aware that
it was going in, but it certainly wasn't our choice or our
preference,'' he said. ``We think all carriers should share in the
cost equally.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, the fee had not been assessed in recent years.
Gagne and industry representatives said they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   The change originated in the Senate, but records do not identify
its author. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, said through a spokeswoman that he knew
who wrote the section and that he had approved it, but he refused
to identify the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Stevens is respecting the confidentiality rules of the
Senate,'' the spokeswoman, Jen Siciliano, said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor ran into similar secrecy when he tried to close a
loophole that allows the foreign-registered cruise lines to operate
gambling cruises out of American ports.
</P>
<P>
   Under a century-old law intended to protect the American
shipping industry, ships flying foreign flags cannot travel between
American ports or leave from and return to the same American port
unless they visit a foreign port as part of the voyage. That is why
foreign cruise ships sailing from Miami or San Diego stop at a
foreign location before returning, a practice critics call
``cleansing the voyage'' for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, however, ruled that foreign vessels meet
the requirement in some cases if they merely sail three miles out
into international waters before returning. That ruling allows
foreign ships to operate gambling ``cruises to nowhere'' that
depart from an American port, travel briefly into international
waters and return to the same port without visiting another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Those types of cruises are operated by smaller foreign cruise
lines, operating from American ports, not the major lines.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to claim that business for American ships, Taylor won
House approval three times, from 1993 to 1995, for legislation that
would require foreign-registered vessels to stop at a foreign port
even on a ``cruise to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But each time the bill got to the Senate, at least one anonymous
senator put a hold on it, blocking any vote. Taylor said he was
unable to identify who stopped the measure, but he said he knows
who was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went to pass that bill in the House, I will
never forget what happened to me,'' Taylor said, describing a 1993
incident. ``As I'm walking across the street to go handle the bill
on the House floor, the chief lobbyist for the foreign cruise
industry comes up and offers me and my family a free cruise if I
withdraw my bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `It's just so that you get to know us.' It sure
sounded like a bribe to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the lobbyist was Alcalde. In a written response,
Alcalde called the accusation reprehensible. He said that the
congressman misunderstood what he said and that he did not even
have the authority to offer anyone a free cruise.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that I suggested he inspect the cruise ships,''
Alcalde said. ``It is important that to take a position as a
legislator, one must understand the industries that they are
attempting to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also true that I suggested that they are an excellent
vacation, especially for families. Never did I offer Taylor any
favor or incentive, and I am truly sorry that he misunderstood
those words.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The cruise trade group opposed Taylor's bill in 1992, telling
Congress it feared that the restrictions could be applied to
broadly to its members. The next year, the group said it could
support the bill with clarifications spelling out that it was aimed
at the ``cruise to nowhere'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's influence also paid dividends last October when
Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, preserved the monopoly held by foreign
cruise lines on entry permits to Glacier Bay National Park, one of
the most popular cruise destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to increase competition for concession business at
national parks, Congress last year eliminated a long-standing
provision that allowed existing operators to retain concessions by
matching the best offer from any other company. The provision made
it virtually impossible for an outside company to win a concession.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parks that would have been opened to competition was
Glacier Bay, where concerns over the environment and wildlife have
restricted entry permits for ships. The day the bill passed the
House, Young, chairman of the Committee on Resources, inserted an
amendment extending the preference for operators at Glacier Bay
until 2009.

   Young has received about $45,000 in contributions from cruise
industry employees in recent years. One of his former staff members
also works as the chief lobbyist for Holland American Line, the
division of Carnival that has the most entry permits for Glacier
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to interview Young over the course of a week were
unsuccessful. Last fall he said that retaining the preference was
necessary to avoid disrupting cruises and to protect Alaskan
tourism. ``Cruise ship companies depend on a smooth process for
bidding on permits to enter Glacier Bay in order to accommodate the
thousands of passengers who visit this park every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Apgar, the National Park Service concession manager for
Alaska, said in an interview that the exemption was
anti-competitive and not necessary to ensure smooth cruise
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any justification for it,'' Apgar said. ``The
industry made a special pleading and got special treatment over all
the other large concessions nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Three American companies with smaller ships submitted proposals
last year for some of 42 new cruise-ship permits being awarded by
the Park Service, but their prospects are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big operators still have a preference and we expect our
application to be denied,'' said Gary Sorrels, vice president of
American West Steamboat in Seattle, which is planning a
250-passenger cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Park Service in Washington said they
expected to award most of the new permits to Holland America, which
they said submitted the best proposal, within the next few weeks.
The company promised new studies on the impact of cruise ship noise
on whales and said it would finance on-site equipment and personnel
to respond to an oil spill in the park.
</P>
<P>
   The award is likely despite Holland America's guilty plea last
August to discharging oily waste in the waters of Alaska's Inside
Passage. ``We're aware of the dumping, but Holland America's
proposal was very good,'' said Bill Pierce, the Alaska desk officer
at the park service.

SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE ON CONFLICTING FEDERAL DISABILITY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday examined the complex
and at times conflicting relationship between two federal laws
dealing with disabilities that limit people's opportunities to earn
a living.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Social Security Act, people who are totally disabled
receive benefits to replace lost income. Under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, employers are obliged to offer the ``reasonable
accommodations'' necessary to enable people with disabilities to
stay on the job. Failure to make such an accommodation for a
``qualified'' person _ someone who could benefit from it _ amounts
to illegal discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the court Wednesday was whether someone who has
applied for, or received, Social Security disability benefits
essentially forfeits the right to sue an employer for disability
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the Justices challenged a ruling in which the
federal appeals court in New Orleans established a strong legal
presumption that a person who was disabled for Social Security
purposes could not also be ``qualified'' to work, even with
appropriate modifications, under the disability act.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``under some limited and highly unusual set of
circumstances'' could such a person pursue a discrimination case,
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said. The 1997 decision
upheld a summary judgment for the employer of a woman who suffered
a stroke and who tried after several months to return to her job,
conducting telephone background checks of prospective employees.
She was having difficulty with speech and requested several
on-the-job accommodations. The employer refused and discharged her.
</P>
<P>
   Before she had returned to work, the woman, Carolyn Cleveland,
had applied for Social Security disability benefits, certifying on
a standard form that she was totally disabled and unable to work.
She withdrew the application after her doctor cleared her to return
to work, resubmitting it after she lost her job. At the same time,
she sued her employer, Policy Management Systems Corp., for
disability discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit's approach to the case, Cleveland vs. Policy
Management Systems, No. 97-1008, alarmed both the federal
government and disability rights advocates, who said it threatened
to strip the millions of adults who receive Social Security
disability benefits of legal protections against discrimination if
and when they are able to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   During the argument Wednesday, in which the Clinton
administration argued on Ms. Cleveland's behalf, the justices
appeared to agree with the company's lawyer that a person should
not be able to have the benefit of two conflicting positions,
claiming both disability and entitlement to work. But they also
appeared troubled by the appeals court's approach, with several
expressing the view that fraudulent cases could rather easily be
weeded out without the need to construct novel and substantial
legal obstacles in the path of most people who are trying to return
to the workplace after a period of disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the taxpayers ought to be vindicated here,'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor told the employer's lawyer, Stephen G.
Morrison. ``Just get her off the disability rolls and back to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew D. Roberts, an assistant solicitor general arguing for
Ms. Cleveland, said that because the concept of disability meant
different things under the two laws, the laws were not mutually
exclusive and it was not as illogical as it might appear for a
person to turn to both of them.
</P>
<P>
   In making a disability determination, Roberts said, the Social
Security Administration does not take into account whether the
person would be able to work if the employer offered particular
accommodations. Such ``fact-intensive'' considerations were
impractical in a system that handles 2.5 million cases a year _ 10
times as many, he pointed out, as are handled by the entire federal
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia responded that it was ``extraordinary
that we have a law here that requires employers to make
accommodations, and yet your agency is giving away money to people
who are entitled to those accommodations and so are presumably
employable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by the court, Morrison, the company's lawyer, said he
did not defend the ``very high rhetoric'' by which the 5th Circuit
had appeared to bar most discrimination suits by people in Ms.
Cleveland's position. But he said the appeals court had taken the
right approach, to give discrimination plaintiffs the burden of
explaining how they could have signed a sworn statement of total
disability and then sued for the right to work.

SENATORS SPLIT OVER WHETHER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW IS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite growing pressure in Congress to kill the
independent counsel law, several senators warned Wednesday that
letting the statute die this summer would mean trusting the
president to police himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we truly going to let the executive branch investigate
itself?'' asked Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., at the opening of a
hearing by the Senate Government Affairs Committee into whether the
law should be extended beyond its June 30 expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici and other Republican senators pointed to the refusal of
Attorney General Janet Reno to recommend an independent counsel to
investigate possible campaign finance violations by President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. The refusal, they said, proves
that the Department of Justice cannot be trusted to investigate the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general has turned a deaf ear to this issue
despite overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing, and recommendations
from FBI Director (Louis) Freeh and her own top official to appoint
an independent counsel,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Reno's hand-picked campaign-finance prosecutor,
Charles La Bella, who left the job in July, urged that an
independent counsel look into charges of campaign law violations by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, also warned his colleagues against letting the law
expire. ``I don't think we should walk away from a noble goal: to
protect the integrity of this country's legal system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lieberman and other supporters of the law said it must
be changed. ``We've either got to fix it or drop it and look for
another mechanism,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a principal
author of the 1978 statute that was supposed to take politics out
of investigating high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and other senators suggested cutting the scope of such
probes and the time prosecutors can spend on them. The recommended
changes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting the tenure of independent counsels to 18 months;
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving the attorney general more power to investigate
allegations before requesting an independent counsel;
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring that the scope of the investigation be narrowly set;
</P>
<P>
   _ Barring prosecutors from practicing law privately while they
serve as independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting the subject matter of a probe to issues that arose
during an official's tenure in office, not before;
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring that lawyers considered for independent counsel
positions have significant prosecutorial experience.
</P>
<P>
   But many committee members, including Chairman Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, appeared skeptical that any changes could offset the
problems they say the law has caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is nobody's independent, and if they are, they're
probably dangerous,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he worried that the intense media spotlight placed
on independent counsels ``pressured'' them to produce results,
regardless of the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent counsels know that they will be judged by the
number of scalps they put on the wall,'' he said. ``That wouldn't
happen with a normal prosecutor in a normal case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said the law had created an
``out-of-control'' office that has no ``limits on its power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the mistake four years ago of voting to renew this
law,'' he said. ``I won't make the same mistake this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Former White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker agreed with the
senators who want the law to expire. He said almost any effort to
revise it so soon after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal
``is likely to be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who is also a former Senate Reublican leader, added, ``We
ought to write on a clean slate. We ought to cool off, let some
time go by'' before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was passed in 1978 in the wake of
the 1972-1974 Watergate scandal during which President Richard
Nixon ordered the attorney general to dismiss special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox after Cox refused to drop a subpoena for
Nixon's incriminating White House tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans complained about Independent Counsel
Lawrence Walsh's six-year, $48 million probe into the Ronald Reagan
administration's Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deals of the 1980s,
saying the investigation was politically inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The law lapsed in 1992. When it was taken up again in 1993, 28
Senate Republicans threatened to filibuster against renewing it.
But a newly-elected President Clinton lobbied for it and won.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when a three-judge federal court panel appointed
Kenneth Starr to investigate Clinton, Democrats have repeated many
criticisms of the law that Republicans had voiced earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that each side has seen its oxen gored by this law, there
isn't a whole lot of stomach left for keeping it around,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The law requires the attorney general to seek appointment of an
independent counsel when there is substantial and credible evidence
of a crime by any one of 49 top federal officials, including the
president. A panel of three federal judges then picks an attorney
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has an unlimited budget to hire aides and
investigate _ a frequent point of criticism. Starr has spent nearly
$50 million on his investigation of allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With approval from the attorney general and the appointing
judges, the independent counsel can broaden investigations far
beyond the original mandate, another target of the law's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's mandate, for example, began with inquiries into
Clinton's Whitewater land deals in Arkansas and widened repeatedly,
finally to the Monica Lewinsky scandal that led to his impeachment
and trial. The Senate acquitted him Feb. 12 of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Testifying before the committee Wednesday, a panel of legal
experts, including several former independent counsels, disagreed
on whether the law should be allowed to expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I long ago concluded that this statute is unworkable,'' said
Griffin Bell, attorney general under President Jimmy Carter. He
said that because of their unlimited resources and tenure,
independent counsels ``unfairly'' investigate every aspect of an
official's life.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arthur H. Christy, who in 1978 was the first
independent counsel appointed, said that while the law had
``flaws,'' it was necessary to check the power of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law is not perfect and needs to be changed,'' he said.
``But there must be some mechanism in place to ensure the executive
is not allowed to commit crimes and sweep them under the rug.''

BAR OWNER CHARGED IN NORTHERN IRELAND BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A 48-year-old bar owner was charged Wednesday
with complicity in the bombing that killed 29 people and wounded
more than 200 last Aug. 15 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh.
The attack was the deadliest in the violence that has killed more
than 3,200 in the northern British province since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The bar owner, Colm Murphy, from Dundalk, Ireland, near the
border with the North, is the first person charged in the attack.
He is said to have conspired to cause an explosion likely to
endanger life between Aug. 13 and Aug. 16 and was also charged with
membership in an illegal paramilitary organization.
</P>
<P>
   As he was charged here in the three-judge Special Criminal
Court, which has no juries, Murphy spoke only to acknowledge his
identity. The court was established to eliminate intimidation of
jurors in cases of organized crime and political terrorism. Murphy
was held pending another court appearance on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of about 60 people questioned since the attack. Last
weekend, the police in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland
arrested 11 people for questioning, of whom six were still being
held Wednesday. Murphy is believed by the police to have been close
to a splinter group calling itself the Real IRA, which opposes the
parent Irish Republican Army's 19-month-old cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, while refusing to disarm, is supporting the
participation of its political wing, Sinn Fein, in the effort of
the new Northern Ireland Assembly to put in effect the provisions
for new governmental structures under the peace agreement approved
by Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA's political affiliate, the 32-County Sovereignty
Committee, opposes the peace agreement as a sellout to the British
government and the Protestant majority in the North. Sinn Fein says
the agreement is a good start toward closer ties between the North
and the Catholic Irish Republic, although it does not guarantee the
end of British sovereignty in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Among those being held in the North in connection with the
bombing is Francis Mackey, chairman of the Sovereignty Committee,
and an Omagh city councilman who quit Sinn Fein after it approved
the peace plan.

INVESTORS BLAME GREENSPAN AS BONDS SLUMP FOR SECOND DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices plunged for the second day in a row on
Wednesday, sending Treasury yields to their highest levels since
August. The jump in interest rates also sent stocks sharply lower
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was the culprit again as
his hint of an interest rate increase in testimony before Congress
on Tuesday haunted bond investors another day.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are a bad sign for stock investors at a
time when most analysts think shares are already too expensive.
``Equity prices are high enough to raise questions about whether
shares are overvalued,'' Greenspan said in testimony Wednesday and
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the yield on the 30-year bond now at 5.51 percent, some
analysts think the stock market is about 20 percent overvalued,
which they see as a level that could set off a market correction.
And if rates move higher, the bond market will become more
attractive as a less risky alternative investment, while the higher
rates and the possibility of slower growth will undermine the
outlook for corporate earnings and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the rise in market interest rates could
generally be positive if they do not get out of hand. They will
make mortgages more expensive and raise the cost of other personal
and business loans. But in the process, higher rates could help
slow the economy by curbing home building and other activity. In
addition, higher rates could dampen consumer spending, one of the
strongest props of last year's nearly 4 percent growth, by putting
the stock market on hold for a while.
</P>
<P>
   All this would help the Fed deal with its biggest problem _
getting a slowdown in the economy that is enough to prevent the
central bank from having to raise its short-term interest rate
target to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   An engineered jump in interest rates by the Fed would have a
much more damaging effect on the stock market because once the Fed
acted, investors would be speculating that it would have to move
again. A rate increase could also unsettle the rest of the world's
much less stable financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed can let the market do the work itself,'' said Robert
V. DiClemente, chief U.S. economist for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   But Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency
Economics, does not think interest rates are going to move high
enough to do that. Even now, he said, long-term interest rates are
below the 6 percent level before last fall's global financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market Wednesday, the selloff came in the afternoon
after demand was disappointing during the Treasury's two-year note
auction, although the yield jumped to 5.009 percent. Kevin
Flanagan, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said, ``We have had a cautious and anxious environment since
February.'' And Greenspan's hint at just the possibility of rate
increase in testimony on Tuesday was enough to ignite a selloff.
Flanagan said that Greenspan did nothing Wednesday to backpedal
from that hint.
</P>
<P>
   In late bond trading, the price of the benchmark 30-year bond
fell 1 5/32, to 96 7/32, while its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, jumped to 5.51 percent from 5.43 percent on
Tuesday. This was the highest yield since Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Most major stock gauges moved higher nearly all through
Wednesday's session. But those gains were quickly erased when word
filtered out about 2:30 p.m. that the Treasury's two-year note
auction had not gone well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond vigilantes mugged the bull today,'' said Bryan
Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``We put in
four hours of hard work that melted away when the results of the
note auction were announced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 144.75 points, or 1.5
percent, to 9,399.67. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped
17.77 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,253.41, while the Nasdaq index
fell 36.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,339.38. The Russell index
of smaller-company stocks dropped 3.75 points, or nine-tenths of a
percent, to 395.26.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff in stocks erased a good chunk of the big gains
recorded on Monday, leaving some analysts to note that stocks
remain stuck in the relatively narrow trading range they have
occupied for much of the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is stuck in a trading range of
about 1,290 down to about 1,200,'' Piskorowski said. ``Now that
bonds are not in our corner anymore, we are not going to push
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several days, traders and analysts have worried
that if bond yields move above 5.50 percent and stay there,
portfolio managers may choose to move assets out of stocks and into
fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   The late drop in stock prices suggests that did not happen
Wednesday because trading volume was far from robust. On the Big
Board, 782 million shares changed hands. But analysts said the
worries are not misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is very fully priced,'' said Byron Wien, U.S.
equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. ``Interest rates need to move
down for it to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his calculations, the S&AMP;P 500 index is about 20
percent overvalued, Wien said, adding that the average has been
distended by outsized gains in the top 50 or 100 stocks that make
up the index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of that index is probably undervalued,'' he said.

YORK TAKES CONTROL OF 49ERS, LIMITS DEBARTOLO'S ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 and SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Denise DeBartolo York consolidated her control
over the San Francisco 49ers Wednesday, putting her husband in
charge of the team and moving to end her brother's access to club
cash to pay his personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   York issued the orders in writing to all 49ers personnel after
she consulted with National Football League Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue and following clashes within the organization over
demands by Edward DeBartolo Jr., the team co-owner, to pay his
bills, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The development is the strongest sign yet that DeBartolo's
banishment from managerial involvement in the NFL is not likely to
end soon, and could be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   York described in a memo to all 49ers personnel the details of
new lines of command and financial controls: ``I hope that you can
appreciate my efforts to provide you clear direction and to assure
compliance with NFL directives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be assured that Eddie was provided a copy of this ...
before it was issued. While I would not be surprised if he is not
in agreement with some of these decisions, I know that he
understands my concerns and appreciates that this memorandum was
issued at my direction to provide everyone with a clear set of
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   York, who is chairwoman and chief executive officer of the 49ers
parent company, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio,
gave her husband, John York, and an aide, Keith Lenhart, oversight
responsibility for the team. John York is a DeBartolo Corp. senior
vice president and member of the board of directors. Lenhart is the
corporate controller. Both men will become vice presidents of the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Denise York also named former 49ers head coach Bill Walsh as
team vice president and general manager, giving him day-to-day
command of the team. In recent weeks, Walsh served the organization
as an informal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   John McVay will remain team vice president and head of football
operations.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, apparently taken by surprise, had no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all the club's business,'' said NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello. ``I really don't want to try to interpret a club memo.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo stepped down as head of the team's operations in
December 1997 when his role in a federal gambling and bribery case
in Louisiana became public. He pleaded guilty in October to a
federal felony, failure to report an alleged extortion attempt in
connection with the government's prosecution of former Louisiana
Gov. Edwin Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's separation from the team was formalized by Tagliabue
and remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Denise York said she must pre-approve any request by DeBartolo
for cash reimbursements for his expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Eddie was involved in the direct management of this team,
he enjoyed many of the benefits, which are earned when undertaking
such responsibility. He no longer functions in that capacity,''
Denise York wrote.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's free-spending habits have been well-known to club
officials, players and sportswriters for years. After Super Bowls
in 1989 and 1994, he flew players and their wives and girlfriends
to Hawaii and Colorado Springs, Colo. He has lavished expensive
gifts on his players.

HONG KONG GOVERNMENT WANTS COURT TO CLARIFY RULING THAT UPSET
MAINLAND CHINA  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Seeking to quell a bitter dispute with mainland
China, Hong Kong's government Wednesday asked its high court to
clarify a recent landmark ruling that provoked strong objections
from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at the concerns expressed by a lot of
parties,'' said a government spokesman, Stephen Lam. ``Because
there has been such great concern in the community, we have decided
to seek clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled that
children born on the mainland who have at least one parent living
in Hong Kong have the right to residency here. Officials in Beijing
criticized the decision as a violation of the Chinese Constitution
and warned that they wanted it ``rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from calming the waters, Wednesday's move rattled legal
experts, who said the Hong Kong government appeared to be pressing
the court to retreat from the ruling before the Chinese government
forced its hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is close to a government subversion of the court,'' said
Yash Ghai, an expert in constitutional law at the University of
Hong Kong. ``I would almost prefer if China took the action itself
and bore the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers here have said that if China overturned the decision, it
would ignite a constitutional crisis. Under the agreement between
Britain and China _ known as ``one country, two systems'' _ Hong
Kong is supposed to be a semi-autonomous region within China, with
its own legal system.
</P>
<P>
   China has not formally demanded that Hong Kong overturn the
ruling. But many people here believe that if the local government
does not mollify Beijing, the Chinese government will probably
repudiate parts of the decision during the annual meeting of the
Chinese National People's Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could stain Hong Kong's reputation as an
international financial center, which depends in part on having
courts that operate without meddling from Beijing. The dispute has
already set off a crisis of confidence among Western diplomats and
business executives, some of whom fear that the rule of law could
become a relic of Hong Kong's colonial past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is central to Hong Kong's autonomy,'' Ghai said.
``If we lose out on this, Hong Kong will have no more autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   By asking the court to explain its decision, the Hong Kong
government is raising nettlesome legal issues. Lawyers here said
they were not aware of a precedent for the government to ask its
highest court to reconsider a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is the public supposed to view this?'' asked Margaret Ng,
a lawyer and member of the Legislative Council here. ``I can't help
feeling that the government hasn't thought this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam said the government was not acting on orders from Beijing,
though he acknowledged it had taken China's objections into
account. He also said Hong Kong was not trying to overturn the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very special case,'' Lam said. ``It's not like from
now on, whenever the court makes a ruling we don't like, we're
going to file a motion.''
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to resolve the dispute, Hong Kong is focusing on
the nature of Beijing's objection, which is not to the substance of
the ruling _ that some mainland Chinese children have the right to
live here. What troubles Beijing is that the court said it has the
right to strike down Chinese laws if they violate Hong Kong's
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts here said China was misreading the ruling as
an attempt to place Hong Kong's courts above the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel R. Fung, Hong Kong's former solicitor general who is now
a visiting fellow at Yale Law School, said the court asserted the
right to invalidate Chinese laws ``only insofar as they affect Hong
Kong, not the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Hong Kong hopes that if its highest court affirms it is
not challenging China's sovereignty, Beijing will let the matter
drop.

NEW ACCOUNTING RULES WRITE-OFFS PROPOSED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board that writes the nation's accounting rules decided
Wednesday that companies should no longer be able to write off
immediately the value of research acquired from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board is
preliminary but significant because it could soon stop a practice
that is being used by an increasing number of companies buying
other businesses and that recently has raised concerns among
federal securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have been able to acquire another company and
then make most of the purchase price vanish on their accounting
books by using a footnote in the accounting rules that relates to
research expenses. The rule allows companies to write off the cost
of continuing research they acquire by immediately deducting the
amount from the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The board decided Wednesday to abolish that rule and instead
require companies to put the value of the acquired research on
their books as an asset, which would then be slowly written off
over the years, reducing future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators and some accounting analysts have
criticized the current rules, saying they allow companies to mask
the real cost of their acquisitions and leave the buyers looking
more profitable than they are.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission recently has forced some
companies to reduce significantly the amount that they planned to
write off as projects involving continuing research, which is often
called ``in-process research and development.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, America Online said last year that it planned to
write off most of the $316 million it had paid for Mirabilis Ltd.
and Netchannel Inc. But the company then reduced the research
write-off to $70.5 million, or about 22 percent of the purchase
price of the two companies, after the SEC objected.
</P>
<P>
   If the rule proposed Wednesday by the board had been in place,
America Online would not have been allowed to write off even the
$70.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting rules relating to research are most often used by
high-technology, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. But
even companies like U.S. Filter Corp., the nation's largest
provider of water-treatment systems, have used the rules to write
off acquisition costs recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts said Wednesday that if the proposed
rule received final approval, some companies would think twice
about certain acquisitions because their future earnings would be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be deals that won't get done,'' said Robert
Willens, a managing director at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision is part of a larger set of rules relating
to mergers and acquisitions that the board expects to publish this
summer. Companies would then have three months to comment on the
proposed rules before the board's final approval.
</P>
<P>
   But securities regulators have asked the accounting board, which
is based in Norwalk, Conn., to move quickly on the rules relating
to research costs. Timothy S. Lucas, the board's research director,
said Wednesday that the board might decide to separate the research
rules from the rest of the merger accounting rules so that they
could be put in place more quickly. &QL;

 &HT;    MEDICARE PANEL HEADS FOR EXTENSION
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A commission on Medicare reforms remained sharply
divided Wednesday over the structure of proposed reforms and
appeared unlikely to meet Monday's deadline for issuing a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the 17-member commission's chairman,
said he would discuss the situation with panel members over the
weekend to determine whether to attempt to finish by the end of
March. The commission's deadline is March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're close to reaching and agreement, we're going to make
that effort,'' Breaux said Wednesday. He spoke after a three-hour
meeting to review savings estimates for his proposal to let managed
care programs compete for government-subsidized Medicare premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the panel's co-chairman, said he was
encouraged by Wednesday's meeting. Thomas said he counted 10 votes
for Breaux's plan, which needs 11 votes to win approval under the
rules that created the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest opposition to the plan came from several
congressional Democrats and former Medicare head Bruce Vladeck.
They objected to remarks by several commissioners who said they
expected savings from the plan to cover the cost of providing drug
coverage to elderly people with incomes of 135 percent the poverty
level, or about $11,000 for one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the premium support fairy is going to come down
out of the sky and give us a drug benefit,'' Vladeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Although various government agencies have estimated Breaux's
plan could save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next
decade by relying on competition to lower premiums, Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., said ``I have not gotten a shred of information
that this competition is going to result in any savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he didn't know if the plan would
result in any savings for Medicare, but said he believed it would
make health care delivery more efficient, which would pay for drug
coverage.

IN COLORADO, AVALANCHE POLICY STRESSES PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (With AUSTRIAN-AVALANCHE) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The kinds of deadly snow rivers that are crashing through Alpine
ski chalets this winter could be crashing through Rocky Mountain
ski condominiums in the future, according to avalanche experts
interviewed Wednesday in Colorado and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alps, some of the highest snowfalls in half a century
have set off vast snowslides that have killed dozens of people,
catching many of them in houses built on sites where avalanches are
most likely. Similar scenes could be repeated in the Rockies, where
the populations of some mountain counties are expected to double
over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the narrow, heavily inhabited valleys of the
Alps,'' said Knox Williams, director of the Colorado Avalanche
Information Center, a state agency. ``But if there is enough of
this condo-mania, enough of this expansion of home sites, we will
start to see this problem in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Because villages dot many Alpine valleys, avalanche control in
Europe involves mainly passive measures. In Switzerland, for
example, about 250 miles of steel and stone fences have been built
on high mountain flanks in order to hold snow in place, and near
the bases of mountains, washboards of earthen mounds have been
built to dissipate the energy of avalanches and to divert them from
houses.
</P>
<P>
   But this winter, with as much as 20 feet of snow falling in
Switzerland in the last six weeks, the barriers have not been
strong enough to hold or divert the snow. Winds have raged up to
150 miles an hour, whipping up dangerous snow packs above villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary series of weather fronts and strong
northwestern winds,'' Martin Schneebli, a researcher at the Swiss
Federal Institute for the Study of Snow and Avalanches, said from
Davos, which has been marooned by snow for several days.
</P>
<P>
   While Switzerland is one of Europe's leaders in avalanche
deaths, with an average of 20 a year, Colorado leads the United
States, averaging six a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Colorado's 20,000 avalanches a year occur on remote
federal land, typically posing no threat to people in towns. In
this setting, avalanche controllers use ``active'' methods, either
bombs or careful ski runs, to trigger smaller avalanches before the
snow masses become too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe they don't use explosives to trigger avalanches
because they don't know how big the avalanches will be when they
release them,'' said Dale Atkins, an avalanche forecaster in
Colorado. ``In Europe they have more towns, villages, highways and
rail lines'' along avalanche paths ``than we do in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on information from avalanche forecasters and snow
monitors, the Colorado Department of Transportation routinely
closes roads just before dawn and then sets off explosive charges,
either dropped by helicopter or fired from Army howitzers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole thing is prevention,'' said Chuck Loerwald, a
regional supervisor for the state DOT, as he prepared to trigger
mini-avalanches Wednesday on Berthoud Pass, a major ski-area access
route. ``We let the little ones come so we don't have the big
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   At Colorado's 20 largest ski areas, many built on historic
avalanche paths, about 300 ski patrollers check for avalanche
threats each morning. They trigger avalanches either by firing
mortar charges or by making ski-cuts _ traversing slopes on skis,
jumping up and down. Nationwide, about one ski patroller is killed
every winter while performing avalanche-control work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Rockies, this system has been successful so far. In
Colorado there has not been a skier killed by an avalanche in a ski
area since 1975. On the roads, the last travelers killed by
avalanches died in 1963. But several snowplow drivers have been
killed in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these advances, the American avalanche picture is
changing rapidly, owing to an explosion in back-country recreation
in the winter and a surge in home construction in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of a rapid increase in back-country skiers,
snowboarders and snowmobilers, the average number of Americans
killed by avalanches has more than tripled, rising from seven a
year in the 1970s to 24 a year in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 100 vacationers were caught in avalanches in
Colorado last year, the state has kept fatalities down through an
aggressive program of educating people on how to survive sliding
snow. Nine out of 10 avalanche victims in the United States set off
their own avalanches, fracturing fragile snow layers through noise
or movement.
</P>
<P>
   With February being the deadliest avalanche month in North
America, Denver television stations recently started broadcasting a
new public service announcement that shows a ``frozen'' snowboarder
hanging on a meat hook next to a pig's head. As the camera pans
around the meat locker, an avalanche beacon can be heard pinging.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the Colorado Avalanche Center held safety classes
for 3,500 vacationers, fielded 77,000 calls to its seven
avalanche-status hotlines, registered visits to its Web site, sent
out 30,000 avalanche-alert e-mail messages, and broadcast daily
messages on 11 mountain radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people's avalanche skills to catch up with their
athletic skills,'' said Knox, who trains people in the use of probe
poles, avalanche shovels and high-tech beacons.
</P>
<P>
   On the technological front, stores recently started selling
digital avalanche beacons that can cut search time in half, to
about 15 minutes. These transceivers can indicate with arrows and
distance measurements the location of a buried victim who is
carrying a beacon. Although only one-third of buried victims
survive, 90 percent are still alive 15 minutes after being buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is the enemy of the buried victim,'' said Atkins, who
teaches avalanche safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, some vacationers have started carrying a German-made
``avalanche airbag.'' With the pull of a ripcord, this backpack
device inflates into a large orange nylon balloon, carrying the
wearer to the top of the snow. It has been credited with saving 18
lives in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While training and technology may slow fatality rates, some
experts fear that the Rockies are following the residential
development of the Alps, allowing homes to be built at the bases of
old avalanche chutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avalanche run-out zones are terrific building sites,'' Atkins
said. ``They are down near the valley floor; they have great views
because of the lack of trees. Over the next 20 years, we will see a
significant increase in people building in avalanche areas.''

AT&AMP;T'S BUSINESS SERVICES CHIEF QUITS AFTER FIVE MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reviving questions about AT&AMP;T Corp.'s ability to
retain entrepreneurial managers, Robert Annunziata, who took over
AT&AMP;T's $22 billion business services unit less than six months ago,
quit Wednesday to become chief executive of Global Crossing Ltd.,
one of AT&AMP;T's fast-moving international competitors.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T bought Annunziata's previous company, Teleport
Communications Group Inc., for more than $11 billion last July
after Annunziata helped build Teleport into one of the nation's
largest local phone companies for business customers.
</P>
<P>
   In September, AT&AMP;T, the nation's biggest communications carrier,
made Annunziata the head of its business services operation.
</P>
<P>
   As AT&AMP;T has tried to shed its ponderous Ma Bell image, it has
occasionally held up Annunziata as the sort of versatile,
quick-thinking executive the company is trying to attract. Losing
him could reinforce the lingering perception among some
communications experts that AT&AMP;T is simply too big and stodgy to
hold on to some top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a dynamic opportunity, and that's really the
reason,'' Annunziata, 50, said Wednesday during a conference call.
In an interview, he added, ``I'm an entrepreneur and I know how to
run my own company, and this is just a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to talks over the last few weeks with Gary Winnick and
Lodwrick M. Cook, Global Crossing's co-chairmen, and with John M.
Scanlon, whom he will replace as chief executive, Annunziata said:
``We hit it off as people who can move quickly. And we moved
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon will become Global Crossing's vice chairman. Global
Crossing is based in Bermuda, but Annunziata said he would be at
the company's operational headquarters in Los Angeles on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the exploding market for international
communications, Global Crossing has raised more than $4 billion to
build and operate undersea fiber optic networks. After initially
offering shares to the public in August at $19, the company's
shares closed Wednesday at $57.875, up $4.25, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said that Michael Keith, 50, who has been with the company
for 21 years, would replace Annunziata. Keith will be the third
person to run AT&AMP;T's business unit in less than 18 months. AT&AMP;T's
shares closed at $84.5625, down $1.375, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the business services post, another top AT&AMP;T job
that has come to resemble a hot seat is the one at the top of the
company's international unit.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, two people, Pier Carlo Falotti and R.C. Mark Baker,
have left that job and the company after less than a year. Now,
seven months after announcing that it would fold most of its
international operations into a joint venture with British
Telecommunications PLC, AT&AMP;T has still not announced a leader for
the new unit.
</P>
<P>
   Such an announcement could come soon, however. Executives close
to the process said that among the people who had been or are being
considered for the job is David W. Dorman, the former chairman of
Pacific Bell. Dorman is now chairman of Pointcast Inc., an Internet
media company.

HUMAN SPIRIT PREVAILS OVER THE WORST EVIL IN `LAST DAYS'
</HEADLINE>
 DAYS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Holocaust has provided material for many thoughtful films,
from the relentless documentary ``Shoah'' to the stately
``Schindler's List'' to the almost naively romantic ``Life is
Beautiful.' But, as a subject in the Oscar-nominated documentary
``The Last Days'' says, unfortunately, the Holocaust was even worse
than what you see in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' is a brief attempt at showing how much worse.
Some may argue that it's too brief; by concentrating on the final
year of World War II and the experiences of five Hungarian Jews who
survived the Holocaust, director James Moll risks oversimplifying,
turning his movie into a sort of Holocaust Cliff's Notes. Yet the
brevity makes the movie more accessible, as does the structure of
present-day interviews interspersed with remarkable _ and graphic _
archival footage.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors, who have endured horrors most of us cannot even
imagine, are presented as tributes to the human spirit; they can
make your own self-indulgent angst look pretty silly. Among them
are Tom Lantos, who went on to become a California congressman _
and, not surprisingly, a human-rights advocate; Alice Lok Cahana,
an artist whose experiences are reflected in her work; and Renee
Firestone, who provided the movie's key sound bite, about her
refusal to let the Nazis take away her soul.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is wrenching because Moll doesn't try to make it
wrenching. He films with as objective an eye as possible, letting
the survivors tell their stories and even tracking down an
Auschwitz doctor who was acquitted at the Nuremberg trials because
he performed useless experiments that actually worked to help keep
Jews alive; as long as the people in his charge were scientific
subjects, they were spared execution. The doctor paints himself as
a person of conscience, but his evasiveness upon meeting Firestone
reveals another side of his character.
</P>
<P>
   Several survivors revisit death camps at Auschwitz, Dachau and
Bergen-Belsen, or their former Hungarian homes, often with their
children in tow. The memories move them to tears while Moll uses a
casual voyeurism to film the pastoral beauty of the Hungarian
countryside, the faded majesty of Budapest and the startling size
of the ghostly concentration camps. The immensity of the evil is
made clear when one of the survivors remarks on how the camps
didn't just exist; they had to be conceived and meticulously
planned. The camps were brutally efficient, from the crematoriums
and gas chambers right down to the latrines.
</P>
<P>
   But what emerges, more than a portrait of evil, is a celebration
of the survivors' vibrance. They have made their peace with what
happened, even while they are still unable to comprehend it. Many
survivors say that before they were routed to the camps, they never
expected the Holocaust to reach all the way to Hungary. Movies like
``The Last Days'' warn us that no one is immune from horrors but
also let us know that no one can take away our souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' is rated PG-13. It contains graphic footage of
Holocaust victims, including some nudity, but is more than
appropriate for thoughtful teens.  &QL;

NICE TRUE-TO-LIFE LOVE STORY CAN'T SAVE WEAK `SISTER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For about half of ``The Other Sister,'' I was trying to figure
out why I was guiltily enjoying it, despite these not-small
reservations: It's manipulative and condescending, it's a glorified
TV movie, it relies too much on cheap laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The love story, involving mentally challenged couple
Carla (Juliette Lewis) and Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi), is the least
tricked-up romance we've seen in ages. No messages in bottles, no
blasts from the past, no Pygmalion-style bets. Best of all, none of
that trio of devices we've seen way too often over the past couple
of years: fate, mistaken identities or fake boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this is a story about two people who meet each other
(fairly naturally), are attracted, discover enough common ground to
spend time together and enough differences to keep things
interesting and work with it from there. Along the way, they
experience joy, sadness, rage and much confusion, a lot like people
do in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks would shudder at the prospect of spending more than
two hours with Juliette Lewis; she's one of those actresses, like
Jennifer Jason Leigh, who throws herself into her roles so hard
that her performances can become mannered. What she's doing here is
a stunt performance; it works not because of the exaggerated slur
in her voice or the contortions in her face, but because of the
things she does with her body. As Carla becomes more confident,
Lewis' posture changes and braces harder against the many obstacles
in her way. Ribisi, taking advantage of his ``Saving Private Ryan''
fame, isn't quite her match, but he does lend Daniel a lot of charm
with his shy stutter and nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie had stuck with the love story, it could have been a
small gem, but director Garry Marshall and his battery of
co-screenwriters want it to be some sort of grand statement. The
result is an uncomfortable mix of ``Rain Man, Hannah and Her
Sisters'' and ``Ordinary People.'' Diane Keaton, trying hard to
suppress her natural charm, is a lighter version of Mary Tyler
Moore's ``People'' character as Carla's overprotective mother. This
mom is the type of perfectionist social butterfly who can't
understand how she had one daughter with an IQ of 50, another who's
a lesbian and yet another who commits perhaps the biggest sin:
She's teaching second grade when she could be a college professor _
not to mention that she's getting ready to marry an ordinary guy.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, whose career has been a real mixed bag (''Pretty
Woman'' and ``Exit to Eden,'' anyone?), can be a crass guy, and too
often he wants to have it both ways in ``The Other Sister.'' He
wants us to respect Carla and Daniel's independence, but he
includes scenes that make us laugh at their expense (Daniel's love
of ``The Graduate'' _ hey, another influence! _ leads to some
particularly awkward scenes). Marshall wants to condemn Keaton's
character for shunning her other daughter's lesbian lover,
Michelle, yet he and the writers barely make Michelle a character.
It's as if they were ashamed of her themselves. Marshall has been
making feature films for nearly 20 years, so you'd think by now he
would have grown past his TV roots, but he still stages comic
scenes as if he were waiting for a laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the love story keeps us watching, and the movie lifts itself
up whenever it has a scene featuring only Carla and Daniel. They
give the movie a sleeper appeal, because they're two people so new
and surprised by the game of love that they don't play it as a
game. When they want something, they say so; when they don't, they
say so. It's enough to make you wish we were all that smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' is rated PG-13 for strong language, frankly
sexual dialogue and situations, and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' 2 1/2 stars on a scvale of 1-5
</P>
<P>
   Director: Garry Marshall
</P>
<P>
   Featuring: Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi, Diane Keaton

ORDINARY MAN'S EXPERIENCES WITH GOD HAVE EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It no longer surprises people: God is immensely popular in U.S.
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Miles' ``God: a Biography'' (Vintage Books) won the
Pulitzer Prize for biography for 1995. Two years later,
``Conversations With God _ An Uncommon Dialogue'' (Putnam), by
Neale Donald Walsch, became a bestseller. It is still a bestseller,
along with its two sequels.
</P>
<P>
   But even before those bestselling books out, the Rev. Henry
Blackaby was drawing attention with his ``Experiencing God,''
published by Broadman &AMP; Holman in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why so much interest in the Almighty?
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from God,'' Blackaby said. ``There is a huge
heart-cry on the part of the American people not to just know about
God, but to experience God.''
</P>
<P>
   Once an obscure Southern Baptist pastor from Canada _ believe it
or not, Southern Baptists exist that far north in our hemisphere _
Blackaby is almost a guru among evangelicals seeking a deeper
relationship with God.
</P>
<P>
   His fame started to spread in 1990 after he left an affluent
church in Downey, Calif., near Los Angeles, to pastor a church near
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which was down to 10 members.
</P>
<P>
   He began conducting workshops on ``Experiencing God,'' and the
Canadian church flourished. Blackaby put his ideas into a book four
years ago, and it has sold 2.5 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Now he gets 4,000 to 5,000 requests to speak each year. People
from many denominations say his book changed their lives. Karla
Faye Tucker, a born-again Christian who was executed in Texas last
year for her role in a pick-ax murder, taught ``Experiencing God''
to her fellow prisoners on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Walsch's popular ``Conversations With God'' is very
nontraditional compared with Blackaby's book. Walsch says that God
spoke to him in the middle of the night and that he began writing
down notes on a yellow legal pad.
</P>
<P>
   Walsch concludes that there is no good and evil, no right or
wrong and that even Hitler went to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Blackaby's books take a traditional Christian view. When God
invites people to have a relationship with him, they should be
awe-stricken and willing to radically adjust their lives to God's
teachings, revealed through the Bible and Jesus Christ, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experiencing God'' teaches: God is love. His will is always
best. God is all-knowing; his directions are always right. God is
all-powerful; God can enable you to accomplish his will.
Experiencing God is a love relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Blackaby is the first to admit that his ideas aren't new, but he
says that finding God is not easy _ not even in church.
</P>
<P>
   Churches across America focus on entertainment and winning
converts, rather than helping people to experience an all-powerful,
holy and loving God, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Blackaby, an executive with the Southern Baptist North American
Mission Board in Atlanta, said his greatest challenge in trusting
God came when his youngest daughter, Carrie, was found to have
cancer when she was 16. He and his family still maintained their
faith in God's goodness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter came to me and told me that she had had a good
life, and that she had been able to serve God, and that she was
ready to go,'' Blackaby said. ``I just wept.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie's life was spared. Now in her late 20s, she holds a
master's of divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary. She and her husband, Wendell Webb, who is a student at
the Fort Worth seminary, have applied to become missionaries in
Eastern Europe or wherever God leads.
</P>
<P>
   Blackaby's five children graduated from the Fort Worth seminary.
The oldest, Gerald Richard Blackaby, is president of the Canadian
Southern Baptist Seminary near Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   TV camera crews followed Henry Blackaby to Canada and to Fort
Worth because the Southern Baptist broadcast division, based in
Fort Worth, is filming a three-hour special on his life that is
scheduled to air on various TV outlets this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackaby says his celebrity is unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises me because I see myself as a very ordinary
person,'' he said. ``I never sought to be recognized. I never
sought to speak. I've tried very hard to be faithful to the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's not so ordinary.

<P>
   ENUGU, Nigeria _ Nigerian politics are split by hard ethnic
differences and held together by fragile alliances, short on
ideology and long on ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Days before Nigerians vote on Saturday to elect the man who will
preside over the country's first civilian government in 16 years,
deals are being cut. Maybe in no place is the maneuvering going on
more furiously than here in southeastern Nigeria, which has become
the battleground for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the suddenly shifting fortunes of the Alliance for
Democracy, one of the three parties in Nigeria, Africa's most
populous country.
</P>
<P>
   A big loser in earlier elections in the last two months, the
party won most of Enugu State in legislative races last Saturday.
The rival, dominant party's choice of a presidential candidate from
outside the region reopened an old wound in the country's complex
history of ethnic rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wound that politicians for the Alliance for Democracy
were toiling to deepen before the presidential election. Feeding on
the region's longtime sense of ethnically motivated exclusion was
their best, and maybe only, chance to claim the nation's highest
political office.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced in a throne-like chair at the Alliance for Democracy's
headquarters here, Arthur Nwankwo, the head of the party in the
southeastern states, received a stream of reports that made him
ebullient on Sunday, including one from a party agent from a
neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of the people is outrage, outright anger,'' the agent
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you are exploiting that one?'' Nwankwo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very much.''
</P>
<P>
   What Nwankwo and fellow members of the Ibo ethnic group here
exploited was anger that one of their own, Alex Ekwueme, a former
vice president, had been rejected by the leading People's
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the party chose Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 61, a Yoruba
from the southwest who is popular with Nigeria's third main ethnic
group, the Hausa-Fulani in the north. Twenty years ago he became
the country's first military leader to give up power voluntarily,
winning respect here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Democracy and another group, the All People's
Party, have joined forces by presenting a common presidential
candidate, Olu Falae, 60, a former finance minister and a Yoruba
from the southwest. It is a union of two parties that share almost
nothing except a desire to win the presidency _ what Nwankwo
described as ``an unholy alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pragmatic alliance, not an unholy alliance,'' corrected
an official who said he was not Nwankwo's political consultant but
cheerfully kept giving him advice.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential election on Saturday follows one of the most
tumultuous periods in the history of Nigeria, which has been ruled
by the military for all but 10 years since gaining independence
from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death of its longtime dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, in
June, the country has opened up politically through reforms put
into effect by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. The military has promised
to transfer power to a civilian government on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Democratic Party of Obasanjo, which has the
best-oiled political machine and the backing of powerful retired
military officers, swept the earlier elections, including this
region.
</P>
<P>
   But over last weekend, in Enugu State, it lost all three Senate
seats and won only three of the eight races for the House of
Representative. The Alliance for Democracy and the All People's
Party also made some inroads in the other Ibo states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hoped that Ekwueme would come up as president, so we
are disappointed,'' said Silvanus Amadi, 62, a businessman who
previously backed Obasanjo's party.
</P>
<P>
   None of the presidential or vice-presidential candidates are
Ibo, but Amadi said he took consolation in the possibility that Ibo
voters might decide the election on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has ruled for so long without achieving
anything,'' he said. ``The country is like stagnant water, not
moving forward, not moving backward. And now the people from the
southeast are going to decide who is going to rule this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayogu Eze, the People's Democratic Party's secretary in Enugu,
explained the strategy to woo back voters like Amadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will tell voters if your party wins the presidency, the
party will take care of you,'' he said. ``You will benefit more
from the PDP than from another party. If another party wins they
will help their own people before they help people like you,
sympathizers, if they remember you at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Eze acknowledged the voters' deep anger over Ekwueme's rejection
but added: ``If the people are spoken to by their leaders, in 24
hours they will be singing a different tune. That is exactly the
strategy we have adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two other parties are also speaking to voters.
They are tapping into a national anti-military mood by portraying
the People's Democratic Party as the party of the military and an
Obasanjo presidency as a continuation of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the military to do what they did to an Iboman is a signal
to the Ibo that the Biafra war is not finished,'' Nwankwo said,
referring to the civil war in the late 1960s during which the Ibo
tried to secede from Nigeria. The message appeared to be resonating
last Saturday among voters who had solidly voted for the People's
Democratic Party just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ibos have been edged out, and we are not happy,'' said
Chijioke Nwankwo, 34, a construction contractor, unrelated to the
party official. ``Because of the AD and APP alliance, I will now
vote for Olu Falae. He is a credible candidate who will lead us to
the land of milk and honey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has been looting Nigeria for years. Look at all
the billions of naira Abacha stole,'' he said, referring to the
national currency. ``Is that not madness? That's madness! If a
military man like Obasanjo is elected, he will protect them. It
will be a military democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other voters, Nwankwo said he was confident that votes from
people like him would propel Falae to the presidency on Saturday.
But in a country at once so rich and so poor, Ebo Raphael, 30, an
engineering student, said he was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Nigeria,'' he said. ``Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Or pretty close. On Saturday a People's Democratic Party power
broker here, Jim Nwobodo, told a reporter in his living room that
his party would dominate. ``I'm not worried,'' he said, just as a
woman with a worried look was ushered in.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate candidate was sending carloads of thugs to intimidate
voters, she reported. The candidate belonged to Nwobodo's own
party. But he had been imposed by the national leadership and was
not Nwobodo's man. So Nwobodo found himself in the unusual position
of actively campaigning against him _ and for another party's
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He hopped into his Toyota Landcruiser to find the thugs. A
caravan of armed soldiers followed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just pray,'' read a sticker on the back of the van. ``Time
shall tell.''

   BALTIMORE _ It took scarcely the time needed to eat a Maryland
crab cake for the would-be successors to line up once Baltimore's
three-term mayor, Kurt Schmoke, announced in December that he would
not seek re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old president of the City Council, Lawrence Bell, is
widely considered the front-runner among Democrats, whose field
could swell to a half-dozen candidates or more by the June filing
deadline. Baltimore is so heavily Democratic that the winner of the
September primary is virtually assured of victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's own assessment is that ``it would be difficult for
someone to come from nowhere'' to beat him. But senior Baltimore
Democrats fear that the urban rebirth achieved during 15 years
under Mayor William Donald Schaefer and the next 12 under Schmoke
would stall with the election of any of the current prospects, a
field they see as distinctly lacking in vision and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The array of candidates is not very pleasing to the senses for
a lot of us,'' said Howard Rawlings, an influential Democratic
state legislator who has represented parts of western Baltimore in
the House of Delegates for 20 years. ``Some of us are greatly
disturbed about the caliber of candidates. It's a sad reflection on
the quality of leadership in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings' complaint is shared by Schaefer, who won two terms as
governor after serving as mayor and now, at the age of 77, is
beginning a four-year term as Maryland's chief tax collector. An
unabashed booster of the city who has often been critical of
Schmoke's leadership skills, Schaefer makes no effort to hide his
belief that Bell and the other hopefuls are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is standing still, and I'm really worried about it,''
Schaefer said. ``We have got to have new, dynamic leadership in the
city. We have to get the right man or woman to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer even gives signs that he would consider running again,
telling Baltimoreans who approach him that he has not made up his
mind. But that is largely a tease. Actually, he concedes, he and
others have been scouring the city's business and civic communities
for a candidate of leadership qualities and political shrewdness.
</P>
<P>
   And they think they have their man: Kweisi Mfume, the president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which has its headquarters in Baltimore. Mfume is a native
Baltimorean and served 7 years on the City Council, then 10 in the
U.S. House of Representatives. (He is also a cousin of Bell.)
</P>
<P>
   Schmoke said in an interview that if Mfume ran, ``the ball game
is over _ it would be his to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mfume insists that he does not intend to seek the office,
emphasizing a commitment to the NAACP, which he has helped turn
around after years of financial chaos. Besides, he lives outside
the city, in the neighboring town of Catonsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have repeatedly said I'm not running for mayor,'' he said.
``I am absolutely not running. I have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed on for five years,'' added Mfume, appointed in 1996,
``and I don't want to abandon it. Short of divine intervention, I'm
not prepared to walk away from the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   If that last part sounds less than unequivocal, it has not been
lost on Rawlings and other state lawmakers who are supporting a
measure that would shorten the residency requirement for elected
officials in Baltimore to 6 months before the general election,
from 12. That would give Schaefer, Rawlings and others more time to
lobby Mfume, who says he shares their concerns about the current
prospective candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal next mayor is a ``cheerleader, visionary and
inspirational leader,'' Mfume said, without whom Baltimore could
``fall into the second tier of cities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the kind of leadership that challenges problems,
that challenges the drug dealers, that challenges the citizens to
dig in and take hold of their city again,'' he said. ``The city has
grown flat, and that really hurts if you have grown up in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the glitter of a vibrant downtown, flush with
economic development that has made tourism a major industry here,
Baltimore has suffered in recent years with a high homicide rate,
rampant drug dealing, a struggling public school system and a court
system so overcrowded that judges have had to release criminal
defendants whose trials have been delayed beyond legal limits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Schmoke say he has become disengaged during his last
term, an accusation he acknowledges may appear true, because, once
he decided not to run again, he scaled back his public appearances
to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as visible at the neighborhood level,'' Schmoke said.
``But in terms of getting things done, working on problems, I'm
still as involved as ever, and I'm doing more economic development
than I did in my first two terms. But I know in this business
perception is the same as reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who enjoys high name recognition after serving 12 years on
the City Council, the last 4 as its president, has been among
Schmoke's most vocal critics, especially on crime.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bell described himself as a potential ``great
unifier'' of the city, and said his priorities were improving
public safety and the schools. He said his ``youthfulness enables
me to embrace new ideas.'' But he offered no ideas on crime
prevention, economic development or school improvement that have
not already been tried elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That is what chiefly concerns his critics and could provide an
opening for other prospective candidates, including Patricia
Jessamy, the state's attorney for the city; former City Councilman
Carl Stokes; city Comptroller Joan Pratt, and state Sen. Joan
Carter Conway.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Barbara Hoffman, who represents northwestern
Baltimore, said that one telling sign of concern was the reluctance
of state lawmakers to offer support for any of the current
prospects. ``That's highly unusual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings said he and others were hoping that Mfume would
reconsider. If not, he was asked, what is Plan B?
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan B is to pray,'' he said. ``It's that serious.''

DISUNITY IN EUROPEAN UNION'S HEADQUARTERS: A TOWER OF BABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Europe is a continent that loves languages.
From Lisbon to Helsinki, Europeans routinely learn, borrow,
mistreat and even covet their neighbors' tongues.
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, schoolchildren toil over difficult foreign
verbs. Bookstores and newsstands keep multilingual stocks, and
advertisers and television broadcasters think nothing of mixing,
say, German, English and French.
</P>
<P>
   But all this shrinks into insignificance compared with the
polyglot goings-on at the headquarters of the European Union in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is busily uniting on many fronts; it is merging
currencies and taxes and adopting common rules governing everything
from air pollution to the bacteria in cheese.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no such coming together on the linguistic front.
The 15-country union operates with 11 official languages _ and each
country wants its own to prevail and is adamant about protecting
it. Efforts to streamline communication and to drop a few languages
have got backs up all over the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is that all the languages of the union are equal,''
said Noel Muylle, director of interpretation at the union
headquarters. ``So the right that all member countries may use
their mother tongue is very, very deeply entrenched.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the European Union _ which would fit into the
United States with ample room to spare _ maintains the largest
translation staff in the world. The Commission, the executive body,
employs more than 1,900 full-time translators and interpreters, not
to mention a phalanx of freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   Including logistics and support staff, the Commission's language
service employs 3,890 people, or 11 percent of its personnel. Last
year they generated 1.2 million pages of translations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gargantuan enterprise, by any standard. The United
Nations, with its 185 members, has just five official languages. At
its New York headquarters it employs about 420 translators and
interpreters, fewer than one-fourth the number in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   And the European repertory is expected to grow. With talks under
way on plans for 10 Central and East European countries to join the
union, even ardent linguists agree that a tower of Babel looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing five new languages in the next few years,''
Colette Flesch, the director of translation services at the
Commission, said glumly, citing Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Estonian
and Slovenian. ``And there are another five further down the line.
I don't know of any other international institution that has to
keep adding languages.''
</P>
<P>
   For each addition, she said, the union needs to hire at least
100 new translators and interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that every so often someone tries to shrink this
enormous linguistic bureaucracy. Not long ago France and Austria
proposed that for most purposes the organization's languages should
be limited to five: French, German, English, Italian and Spanish.
In other words, forget Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Portuguese
and Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   This touched many a nerve of national pride. In the outcry that
followed, led by the deeply stung Danes, Dutch and Greeks, the idea
was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's an asset having all those languages, but it
can also complicate things,'' Muylle said cautiously. He and others
believe that it will be hard to change the rules, which date back
to 1958, when the incipient union had only six countries and four
languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can change the system only if everybody agrees, but
politicians are afraid to tackle the language issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, though, not every word or bit of paper is
translated elevenfold. In committee work, officials often waive the
right to use their native tongue, agreeing instead to a few working
languages _ usually English, French and German. That raises some
other touchy points.
</P>
<P>
   French, long dominant at the Commission, has been rapidly losing
ground to English, which, the French note acidly, is not even a
language of continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   German speakers also feel left out because their language plays
a lesser role. Germany believes it deserves more prominence,
befitting its station as the union's most populous country and
biggest paymaster. But not wanting to seem arrogant, it has not
dared to speak up enough for its language and has thus lost out.
</P>
<P>
   When interpreters talk about their job, they say there are many
pitfalls, no matter what language is used. They say Italians and
Portuguese are incurably wordy, the French obfuscate with flowery
turns and North Europeans can be blunt. But almost everyone has
fallen victim to Eurospeak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eurospeak is a separate in-house language, full of jargon,
acronyms, abstractions _ and a lot of it is gobbledygook,'' said
David Markcom, a British translator.
</P>
<P>
   He offered some samples: words like subsidiarity, comitology,
habilitation. Or sentences like: A reduction should be effected in
salaries. Or: The fish were observed to exhibit a 100 percent
mortality response.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Markcom and others began a campaign called ``Fight the
Fog'' to prod officials into producing clear sentences. ``Of
course,'' Markcom added, ``we realize that in this political arena,
often the aim is precisely not to be clear.''
</P>
<P>
   As in any good bureaucracy, things have become denser with time,
said Anne Buckingham, who has translated here for 22 years. ``More
and more, we have to deconstruct, understand and reconstruct before
something makes sense in English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the barrage of words _ there are 50 to 60 meetings
a day _ the translation section has developed a large data bank of
common terms, worked up great electronic dictionaries and, for
fairly standard texts, it has a computer program that can do
machine translations.
</P>
<P>
   Abram de Swaan, a Dutch sociologist who has written on
communication in Europe, says he hopes a time may come when
Europeans can all take part in public affairs in one language,
possibly English, the way citizens can across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be indispensable for creating a common political
space,'' he said. ``I believe that the more languages everybody
learns, the better, but Europe would benefit from having one common
language to use in the European Parliament, in all our public
business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument that horrifies others, who believe that Europe
is fortunate to have escaped the homogenizing effect of one single
language and that its very diversity is part of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   Muylle is among the latter group. The European Union's
translation services cost $70 million last year, a small price to
pay for Europe's linguistic wealth, he reckons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does expensive mean?'' he said the other day. ``A fighter
plane is expensive. So is an aircraft carrier. And compared to a
language, very few people ever get to use these.''

CLINTON REAFFIRMS U.S. WILLINGNESS TO HELP AFRICA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sought Wednesday to reassure
Africans that Americans will ``do the right thing'' for the
continent as the United States redefines its role in a world no
longer dominated by superpower confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, hosting Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, called on
Congress to pass the Africa trade bill that died last year and
announced his Cabinet would meet next month with ministers from 40
African nations to discuss economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accorded full ceremonial pomp to Rawlings, who received
an official state welcome on the South Lawn of the White House, a
lengthy meeting with the president and a state dinner in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the occasion paled in comparison to the welcome Ghanaians
gave Clinton last March as more than 500,000 people filled Accra's
Independence Square on a 102-degree day to give the president one
of the largest crowds of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The stop in Accra kicked off Clinton's historic 12-day journey
to six nations and focused Americans' attention  &UR;  &LR; on positive
aspects of the continent where democratic nations seeking
international investments are becoming the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not simply a continent with problems, it's a continent
with promise,'' Clinton said during a news conference with
Rawlings. Clinton said he and Rawlings spent half their time
discussing how to refocus the United States' attention onto Africa
and the investment opportunities that are producing 30 percent
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, after the president was, you know, pounding on me
to do better by Africa, I did say, `Reverend Rawlings, you're
preaching to the saved,''' the president joked.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton added a philosophical note, saying that the past
decade _ since the Cold War ended _ has been the first period in
U.S. history in which the United States engages with other nations
in a peacetime environment without its existence threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when you see a child die of AIDS or you see a child
step on a mine in Angola, or you see an economic opportunity going
unfulfilled, or you think that we could help you to end a war more
quickly, I know it's frustrating,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our friends in Africa have to understand what we have been
doing for the last 10 years is unique in more than 200 years of
history for us. I think we'll get it right and do the right thing;
but it requires a certain departure that I think most people who
don't know the history of our country have difficulty accepting,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clinton said, the United States will provide $800
million in economic assistance to Africa and debt forgiveness will
amount to $500 million over two years. He also renewed his call for
Congress to enact his Africa trade bill, which would provide
special tariff concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings called Africa a ``continent in transition'' and noted
the annual return on U.S. investments in the continent vastly
surpassed investment returns in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rather unfortunate that the stereotype image of Africa
as a continent full of conflict, lack of democracy, et cetera, et
cetera, continues to dominate the international media, and yet
there are many positive developments taking place on our
continent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 21 African nations have growing gross domestic
product rates, democracy is taking root, and many nations are
trying to create a favorable climate for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa could very well be the continent of the future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, during which Rawlings seemed bemused
by the domestic questions thrown at Clinton, the presidents
discussed the need for peacekeeping forces in the Congo and Ghana's
proposal to extend dual citizenship to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States would support ``whatever
necessary force'' was placed into war-torn Congo to stop the civil
war there. He said the United States would be willing to help with
logistical support, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings said the dual citizenship would mean U.S. blacks would
not need a visa to enter Ghana and would have the same rights as
Ghanaians without surrendering their American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My continent is the mother of, what do you call it, not all
continents, but humanity and civilization as we've come to know it
today. Is there any reason why you should not have the right to
enjoy the citizenship of where you come from?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton attempted to interrupt him, Rawlings jokingly shot
back, ``No no, you're not going to explain this for me.'' But
Clinton did press ahead, noting that many Americans returned to the
Eastern European nations after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ghana does this, it certainly won't hurt in trying to get
more Americans interested in Ghana, going to Ghana and contributing
to Ghana's future. I thought it was quite a clever idea, myself,''
Clinton said.

   NY-DOG-CONTROL (New York) _ Dog wars: a chronic conflict made
worse by a fashion among New Yorkers to own bigger, stronger, more
robust pets. As never before, big dogs are lunging out of
apartments to do what dogs must do. Tens of thousands of them are
dragging their owners (or paid walkers) to city parks. So to
preserve Central Park and especially Riverside Park, the city has
announced stiffer fines and increased enforcement. By getting tough
on free-range dogs _ an echo of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
``quality-of-life'' crackdown _ the city hopes to convince dog
owners that it is unhealthful and even shameful to let dogs run
free. ``You might call them dog terrorists,'' the parks

   SUBURBIA-FILMS (Undated) _ In the last generation suburbia has
evolved in startling ways, becoming ever more varied by race, class
and ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of
perceptive artists and entertainers. As highbrow films like Todd
Solondz's ``Happiness'' and popular-culture phenomena like ``The
Brady Bunch'' revival peddle the same old cliches, reaping money
and praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug
presumptions, figures as disparate as the author Junot Diaz of
``Drown,'' the filmmaker Tamara Jenkins of ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' and the comic D.L. Hughley of the television series ``The
Hughleys'' are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa
2000. By Samuel G. Freedman. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CRUEL-INTENTIONS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ It is the next logical
development in Hollywood high concept: the literary teen movie,
bringing together young people and their Cliff Notes in a way that
ends the need for all those dreary literary classics that clutter
up the high school experience. Think of the possibilities!
``Clueless II: Why Anybody Would Read Jane Austen,''``Lolita:
Summer Vacation!'' and ``I Still Don't Know What James Joyce Was
Talking About Last Summer.'' For the younger crowd there would be
the inevitable ``Ernest Hemingway Goes to Camp.'' Or just in time
for back to school ``Little Women: First Blood.'' It was just such
an impulse that gave Roger Kumble, 32, a former video store clerk,
the inspiration for ``Cruel Intentions,'' which he wrote, and later
directed, as `` `Dangerous Liaisons' in high school.'' The film
navigates the shiny surfaces of an Upper East Side world of Gothic
brownstones and even more Gothic behavior. And as with ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' it is a place where sex is neither furtive nor fun: it
is a weapon of mass destruction. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GIRL-POWER-FILMS (subslug) (Undated) _ ``Jawbreaker'' is the
latest in a slew of high school comedies aimed at the bulging
demographic blip of millennial teen-agers. Already we have had
``Varsity Blues'' and ``She's All That,'' each of which has gobbled
up nearly $50 million at the box office. Opening next week is
``Cruel Intentions,'' an upscale Manhattan teen version of
``Dangerous Liaisons'' that has much in common with ``Jawbreaker.''
After that come ``American Pie'' and ``Ten Things I Hate About
You.'' A cursory look at the high school movies that have opened or
are about to open might reinforce the cliche that the more things
change, the more they stay the same. Now as in the 1950s, the
decade that invented the modern teen-ager, the American teen movie
portrays high school as a brutal social and sexual testing ground
whose pecking order puts handsome jocks and pretty cheerleaders at
the top and relegates misfits, nerds and arty types to social
serfdom. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``The Mineola
Twins'' and ``Captains Courageous.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BERNADETTE-PETERS-THEATER (subslug) (New York) _ The woman at
the first preview was surprised. ``It's good,'' she told a friend.
``I thought I would hate it. I had dinner with some people, and
they said, `What are you seeing?' I told them `Annie Oakley' and
they said, (italics)`Why?'''(end italics) The answer to that
question is Bernadette Peters, who stars in the revival of Irving
Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' opening on Thursday at the Marquis
Theater on Broadway. By Alex Witchel. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   WEISSLERS-THEATER (New York) _ At the front of the expansive
rehearsal studio in Greenwich Village, looking typically coiffed
and fashionable, stand Fran and Barry Weissler, the mama and papa
of the production of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' the producers. ``Look
at all the people here,'' Ms. Weissler says, smiling. ``And
(italics)we're(end italics) paying them.'' The quip was striking
because, in the 16 years that the Weisslers have produced on
Broadway, they have earned a reputation for being _ among other
things _ cheap. The husband and wife team that started out driving
their acting company around to parochial schools in the Northeast
in a station wagon and U-Haul have, over the last several years,
presented Broadway revivals of ``Gypsy'' with Tyne Daly, ``My Fair
Lady'' with Richard Chamberlain and Melissa Errico, and ``Grease!''
with Ms. Rosie O'Donnell. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LIZZIE-BORDEN-OPERA (Undated) _ The composer Jack Beeson, 78,
concedes that in the context of American contemporary music, his
opera ``Lizzie Borden,'' which had its premiere at the New York
City Opera in 1965, is probably considered musically conservative.
Despite its angst and dissonance, the score is tonally grounded,
hews often to recognizable keys, has stretches of sweet lyricism
and set-piece arias, and even incorporates a likeness of a
Protestant hymn tune and a pastiche of a Victorian parlor song.
Operagoers can judge for themselves on Saturday evening, when
``Lizzie Borden'' returns to the repertory of the company that
presented its premiere but in a new production directed by Rhoda
Levine and conducted by George Manahan. By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-SALES (Undated) _ The good news from most of the
world's major classical-music labels is that the gloom of recent
years has largely been dispelled. Granted, classics account for
only 2.3 percent of the American record market, just less than jazz
(2.5 percent), according to Soundscan, a company that tracks sales.
But the executives who run most of the major labels say their
divisions are profitable and the future is secure. The bad news is
that this profitability has been attained through a series of
bloodlettings in recent years. Staffs have been cut, artists have
been jettisoned and project lists have been pared. By Alan Kozinn.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If, as they say, religion is the
opium of the masses, many composers today are heavy users _ and
pushers. Not a day goes by, it begins to seem, not a blessed day,
without a new recording of new music steeped in devotion. By
Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OLD-CLASSICAL-COMPOSERS (Undated) _ Grandparents rule. There
never was a time before when American composers of classical music
were so old: Elliott Carter, Henry Brant, Milton Babbitt, George
Perle, Lou Harrison, Leon Kirchner, Ralph Shapey and Gunther
Schuller count among the most venturesome creative musicians of the
present day, all of them going strong at ages ranging down to 73.
The definition of ``young composer'' in this context has to be
someone still under 50, and so far there are not too many high
achievers among them, as a listener was reminded at the recent
Focus festival in Manhattan of the Juilliard School, ``Toward the
Millennium, Part 1.'' By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BORIS-GODUNOV-OPERA (Undated) _ Mussorgsky, who either didn't
finish his operas or finished them twice, has always been a
yammerer's delight. His works inspire interminable discussion as to
who he really was, what he really meant, which (or whose) version
is best and why. Any review of a performance of ``Boris Godunov''
has to start with a description of just what it contains and an
evaluation of the performers' textual choices before the quality of
the performance can even be broached. A new recording by the Kirov
Opera of St. Petersburg, conducted by the indefatigable Valery
Gergiev (Philips 462 230-2; five CDs), seeks to still the yammering
by presenting both of the composer's originals _ the practically
all-male 1869 version, and the 1872 score replete with a Polish
princess and four little animal ditties for other women's voices _
in what are billed as meticulously faithful reproductions. By
Richard Taruskin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Andy Warhol began painting
Campbell's Soup cans nearly four decades ago, it wasn't long before
Pop Art became accepted as the Next Big Thing in the world of fine
arts. The newest development in a modernist tradition that had
already absorbed the shocks of Cubism, Dadaism and Abstract
Expressionism, Pop Art was quickly recognized as a movement ready
made for museum catalogues, history books and skyrocketing auction
prices. But if you turn the words Pop Art around and apply them to
music, suddenly you have a debate about cultural values and
hierarchy, about entertainment and art, that has never been fully
resolved. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-CLASSICAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Here's one you may have heard
before: Jazz is America's classical music. It's a declaration that
is always intoned with great seriousness and a touch of
argumentative pride; the intent is to grant jazz the respect it
undeniably deserves. But that formulation has always left me
skeptical, and I've come to think that it does current jazz more
harm than good. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-INTUITION (Undated) _ My father was unusually musical, but
that's not the point. He grew up in an America whose pop tunes, the
music he and his friends imbibed as youths, were often highly
sophisticated pieces of work. (My mother is from a musical culture,
too, but that's another story; she's Viennese.) My father's
generation, raised on Berlin, Gershwin, Porter and Kern, developed
a harmonic acuity, a suppleness of ear, that mine lacks. I grew up
on the three chords of rock-and-roll, on Phil Spector, Bob Dylan
and the Rolling Stones (and the Beatles, of course, but they were
an anomaly, their chord progressions unpredictable, their melodies
hard to harmonize to). By Tony Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-CAR-TALK (Cambridge, Mass.) _ For almost 22 years, Click
and Clack, the Tappet Brothers, have been doling out belly laughs
and _ they proudly proclaim _ bad car advice on public radio's
``Car Talk.'' Their audience on 489 stations around the country is
inching dangerously close to three million listeners a week. The
series (which is heard in New York on WNYC-FM Saturday mornings at
10 and WNYC-AM Saturdays at noon) is National Public Radio's most
popular non-news show, and nobody seems to know why. By Susan
Diesenhouse. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEACEABLE-KINGDOM-ANTIQUES (Williamsburg, Va.) _ Edward Hicks,
the early 19th century painter and Quaker minister, is a commanding
figure in American folk art. Hicks's works, especially his
``Peaceable Kingdom,'' paintings, continue to bring top prices in
the market: last month a version from 1837 was auctioned at
Christie's in New York for $4.7 million, a record for folk art. By

MEDICARE PANEL WILL TRY TO DEVISE NEW BENEFIT FOR PRESCRIPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal advisory commission studying the future
of Medicare agreed Wednesday to work past its March 1 deadline so
members could try to devise a major new benefit covering
prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit emerged as the linchpin of any agreement
between Republicans and Democrats on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   A top Medicare official told the panel Wednesday that its
proposals for far-reaching changes in Medicare would increase
premiums for most beneficiaries, even as they slowed the growth of
the program and saved money for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, the monthly premium for beneficiaries in the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare program is already scheduled
to double, to $105 in 2009 from $45.50 today.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Foster, chief actuary of the Medicare program, told the
commission that its proposals would further increase premiums for
these beneficiaries, perhaps by 10 percent. But, he said, costs
would be lower for many people who join health maintenance
organizations and other private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 of the 17 commission members support a proposal by
the chairman, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., to remodel Medicare in the
image of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which
covers 9 million people. The government would offer a fixed amount
of money to each Medicare beneficiary, who would then enroll in a
private health plan or in the traditional Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1997 law that created the commission, it is supposed
to submit its final report to President Clinton and Congress by
Monday, March 1, but it needs at least 11 votes to endorse any
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   As the commission finished work Wednesday night, Breaux said,
``We are close to agreement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Breaux is desperately trying to win support for his proposal
from two of President Clinton's appointees to the commission, Prof.
Stuart Altman of Brandeis University and Laura D'Andrea Tyson,
former chief economic adviser to Clinton. As a condition of their
support, they insist on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs,
not only for people in HMOs, but also for people in the original
fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tyson said she was ``sympathetic'' to Breaux's proposal to
redesign Medicare. But she added, ``If we are going to discuss drug
benefits, we certainly need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, the Medicare actuary, said the commission's proposals
would reduce projected Medicare spending by 10 percent over the
next decade and by 11 percent from 2000 to 2030. Under Breaux's
proposal, beneficiaries would have to pay more if they chose more
expensive health plans, so, he says, they would have a strong
incentive to switch to lower-cost plans, and plans would compete
for business by offering lower prices, or premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But Foster said most of the savings would come from other
changes proposed by Breaux. These include an increase in the
eligibility age, to 67 from 65; higher premiums for affluent
beneficiaries, and a new 10 percent co-payment for the frail
elderly people who receive home health care visits.

 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Samuel G. Freedman is the author most recently of ``The
Inheritance.'')
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film ``Pleasantville,'' a teen-age boy named David
flops onto the couch of his suburban home, eyes fixed on the
television for a rerun of a 1950s sitcom, all banter about Mom's
meatloaf and the school science fair. Just behind David, meanwhile,
his mother argues over the telephone with her ex-husband about
who's stuck with custody of the boy this weekend. Before long, in
the pivotal moment of ``Pleasantville,'' he finds himself
transported through the picture tube and into the show.
</P>
<P>
   That scene conflates the two standard images of suburbia in
American culture. It is either the scrubbed and cheerful utopia of
such actual television series as ``Ozzie and Harriet'' and ``Leave
It to Beaver'' or else it is the miserable, materialistic dystopia
of novelists like John Cheever and Rick Moody. From either extreme,
the chroniclers of suburbia agree on this much: It is white and
upper middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In the last generation, however, suburbia has evolved in
startling ways, becoming ever more varied by race, class and
ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of perceptive
artists and entertainers. As highbrow films like Todd Solondz's
``Happiness'' and popular-culture phenomena like ``The Brady
Bunch'' revival peddle the same old cliches, reaping money and
praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug
presumptions, figures as disparate as the author Junot Diaz of
``Drown,'' the filmmaker Tamara Jenkins of ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' and the comic D.L. Hughley of the television series ``The
Hughleys'' are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel really alone in this conversation,'' says Diaz,
a Dominican immigrant reared in central New Jersey. ``The world
I've created feels lonely.'' He could be speaking for the fellow
artists who depict a suburbia of low-rent apartments beside gated
developments, of strip malls and toxic-waste dumps, of the
improbable commingling of ambitious immigrants, upwardly mobile
minorities and working-class whites whose security is imperiled by
downsizing and deindustrialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs have changed, but our way of looking at them
hasn't changed,'' says Rosalyn Baxandall, a professor of American
studies at the State University of New York in Old Westbury and
co-author of the forthcoming book ``Picture Windows: How the
Suburbs Happened.'' ``The stereotype has always been that the
suburbs are for rich people who ran away from the city, and there's
alienation and conformity. But when I teach my classes, my students
are mostly nonwhite. I've had 17 languages in a class. Some of
these families are taking in boarders. It's a big, big
revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Demographic data lend authority to what Diaz and Ms. Baxandall
describe. The percentage of blacks who live in suburbia rose from
23 percent in 1970 to 32 percent in 1990, the demographer William
Frey of the State University of New York at Albany has found. Some
40 percent of all minorities are suburbanites, according to the
1990 census. The Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park, which is 60
percent Chinese, has emerged as the archetype of the so-called
``ethnoburb.''
</P>
<P>
   The counterbalance to the successful movement of immigrants and
minorities into suburbia, though, is the deterioration of
inner-ring suburbs. These communities, clinging to the borders of
cities, have been growing poorer, more segregated and more troubled
for decades, losing population nearly as rapidly in some cases as
urban ghettoes. Several years ago, the federal government
surrounded its own office complex in Suitland, Md., a suburb just
outside Washington, with a chain-link fence topped by razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   The seismic shifts that have engaged scholars, though, have
escaped many of the makers and consumers of culture. ``What's
missed is the diversity of suburbia,'' says Greg Hise, a historian
at the University of Southern California who specializes in urban
planning. ``At least with urban novels and films, you see cities as
a place of freedom, autonomy, possibility. With the suburbs, the
writers and producers and directors are working with a set of
accepted wisdom. We see the same stories about suburbia because we
expect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, suburbia actually received a more nuanced
portrayal. Academics like Graham Taylor and Chauncey Harris
delineated a variety of suburbs _ commuter, industrial, working
class. F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``Great Gatsby,'' set in a fictional
version of Great Neck, N.Y., memorably etched the tensions between
old money and parvenus, treating Gatsby's social climbing as the
stuff of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   With the suburban boom after World War II, however, the
stereotype of nuclear families in split-level homes was born. If in
truth suburbia was already more stratified than that, with
white-collar Scarsdale, N.Y., virtually next door to blue-collar
Mount Vernon, the myth nonetheless reflected a certain amount of
fact about the fast growing middle class and the extraordinary
increase in home ownership. It was true, too, that federal mortgage
regulations and private covenants conspired to keep much of
suburbia white.
</P>
<P>
   Television mirrored this version of the suburbs to the nation
and the world. ``Father Knows Best,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' and
their ilk delivered what the historian Stephanie Coontz has termed
``our most powerful visions of traditional families.'' Homogeneity
was part of the package. Desi Arnaz of ``I Love Lucy,'' perhaps the
only Hispanic star on a network show in the 1950s, lived in the
city. So did Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) on ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show,'' one of television's first identifiably Jewish characters.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably the counterattack came, replacing one cartoonish
version of suburbia with another. Journalists and social scientists
_ David Riesman in ``The Lonely Crowd,'' William Whyte in ``The
Organization Man,'' Betty Friedan in ``The Feminine Mystique'' _
argued that beneath the contented exterior of the salaryman and his
stay-at-home wife lurked an anomie that Ms. Friedan called ``the
problem that has no name.'' Only the rare contrarian like Herbert
Gans in ``The Levittowners'' portrayed a nourishing sense of
community among the tract houses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Novelists, in turn, transmuted the theme of suburban malaise in
fiction. Sloan Wilson created both a character and a catch-phrase
with the public relations man Tom Rath in ``The Man in the Gray
Flannel Suit.'' (Gregory Peck starred in the film adaptation.)
Robert Sheckley (``The Ticket to Trania'') and Frederick Pohl and
C.M. Kornbluth (``Gladiator-at-Law'') made their critiques in the
form of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was three naturalistic writers who supplied
literature's most indelible images of postwar suburbia as the
American dream gone awry. John Updike's ``Couples,'' set in a town
dismissively dubbed Tarbox, put wife- swapping into the cultural
lexicon. In a vast body of short stories and novels, John Cheever
painted the WASP elite in the moral emptiness of its country clubs
and commuter trains; the places he created _ Bullet Park, Shady
Hill, St. Botolphs _ defined a social geography that could be
reduced to the shorthand ``Cheever Country.'' Philip Roth,
meanwhile, disposed of the ethnic arrivistes, typified by the
gauche and acquisitive Patimkin family in his novella ``Goodbye,
Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   The young radicals of the 1960s put the critique in overtly
political terms. In their founding manifesto, the Port Huron
Statement, the Students for a Democratic Society pointedly
described themselves as having been ``bred in at least modest
comfort'' in ``the wealthiest and strongest country in the world''
and yet ``looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.''
Suburbia, in other words, was something to rebel against.
</P>
<P>
   Folk music took up the cry. Malvina Reynolds' 1963 song ``Little
Boxes,'' later covered by Pete Seeger, reduced suburbia to the
refrain ``Little boxes, little boxes, little boxes all the same.''
The contempt for suburbia became so nearly unanimous in the
emerging youth culture that even the Brill Building songwriters
Gerry Goffin and Carole King and the made-for-television band the
Monkees collaborated on ``Pleasant Valley Sunday.'' ``Another
Pleasant Valley Sunday,'' went its chorus, ``charcoal burning
everywhere. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday here in status symbol
land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dylan or the later Beatles had been singing that, being
social critics, it almost would have been expected,'' says Paul
Levinson, a visiting professor of communications at Fordham
University in New York. ``But the Monkees _ they're so suburban
themselves, in effect. It's as if suburban people themselves were
skewering the vacuity of their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such perceptions continue to thrive in some of the most highly
praised recent films. Even as affirmative action, mass immigration
and growing income inequality have altered the shape of suburbia,
these movies, whether satirical, realistic or fantastical in tone,
trot out all the familiar indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Ang Lee's screen adaptation of ``The Ice Storm,'' Rick Moody's
novel about family discord in affluent New Canaan, Conn., had as
its centerpiece that hoariest of cliches, a ``key party'' in which
married couples trade partners. Peter Weir's ``Truman Show'' puts a
patina of fantasy on its predictable attacks. Truman Burbank, an
insurance agent whose life is the subject of a continuous sitcom,
literally cannot escape the oppressive perfection of a
made-for-television suburb called Sea Haven.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by Gary Ross, ``Pleasantville'' carries
a similar sensibility to even more overwrought ends. The visual
conceit of the film _ that the eponymous suburb is shown in black
and white _ merely hints at the didactic style. It takes David, the
teen-ager deposited from the 1990s, to bring art, emotion and color
to town, and when he does, such predictable villains as the local
bowling league and the Chamber of Commerce respond by desecrating
paintings and burning books in Nazi style. The World War II
veterans who thronged to actual suburbs in the 1950s might quibble
ever so slightly with Ross' choice of analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Solondz, a native of New Jersey who calls his production
company Suburban Pictures, means to speak for the misfits in a
monochromatic world. His debut film, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,''
centers on a girl gawkily teetering into puberty who is tormented
by her classmates and ignored by her family. In tracing the lives
of an extended family in his next feature, ``Happiness,'' Solondz
reserves his greatest affection for the outsiders among them _ a
failed songwriter, a boy discovering his sexuality, a grandmother
being divorced by her husband of 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such compassion, though, relies on cheap shots against whatever
or whomever represents the suburban status quo. The white-collar
father in ``Happiness,'' a Cheeveresque figure with his car phone
and rep tie, cannot simply be unmasked as a hypocrite or a souse;
no, he turns out to be a pederast who rapes his son's playmates.
When Solondz's camera in ``Dollhouse'' surveys a suburban home, it
lingers over a veritable catalog of bad taste _ gaudy afghans,
mismatched paneling, green shag carpet, cabinets stuffed with
Yodels and Ring Dings. This kind of satire, far from seeking to jar
an audience out of its complacency, sneers along with it from a
superior distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, people are always putting New Jersey down,'' says
Helen, a writer who is a major character in ``Happiness.'' ``None
of my friends can actually believe I live here. But that's because
they don't get it. I'm living in a state of irony.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony, though, is an indulgence of the entitled. The material
comforts ridiculed in a film like ``Happiness'' shimmer like
mirages for the artists of new suburbia. Tamara Jenkins, the writer
and director of the autobiographical film ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' (1998), grew up with a car-salesman father obsessed with
getting his children into the renowned schools of that tony Los
Angeles suburb. That meant bouncing from apartment to apartment,
often with an unpaid landlord in the family's wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone like me, who didn't have things, the usual
middle-class sitcoms created an anxiety, an inferiority complex,''
Ms. Jenkins says. ``With `The Brady Bunch' I was fixated on the
architecture; their house had an upstairs and a downstairs. I used
to wonder, How did the people on the shows get that stuff _
couches, end tables, clothes? Because we had so much trouble
accumulating stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She says she ``identified with the black sitcoms _ `Good Times,'
`Sanford and Son' _ because those people were struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember an episode when Fred Sanford was flying and had
never been on a plane before and brought his own food. That was
something I understood.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Jenkins ultimately put her experience onto film, not
even her colleagues quite understood just how marginal suburban
life could be. ``After shooting the interiors of the apartments,
people got concerned it looked too depressing,'' she recalls. ``It
was like, `Oh, all the walls are so bare. Can't we put some color
in there?' I'd told the production designer that these apartments
are bare except for what the previous tenant left behind. They
said, `But it's a comedy.' I said, `You read the script; poverty is
not funny.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bogosian captured a similarly tenuous existence in his 1994
play ``Suburbia,'' which was later filmed by Richard Linklater. The
characters, gathering nightly around a convenience store, have been
through the military or menial jobs, and their sense of stunted
horizons and vanished opportunities infuses several of the most
dramatic scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a high school classmate-turned-rock-star arrives
at the convenience store in his limousine. One of the regulars, a
former football star now drinking away his nights, starts to flirt
with the musician's young publicity agent. ``You think we're alike,
Erica?'' he asks. ``Deep down, way down,'' she answers. He fixes
her in his stare and says, ``It's a mistake to think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in ``Suburbia,'' a girl from the convenience-store group
overdoses. The Pakistani manager, already exasperated by the
``drunks'' and ``bums'' on his property, cries: ``You people are so
stupid! What's wrong with you? Throw it all away. You throw it all
away.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bogosian cites several influences on ``Suburbia'' _ the
television show ``Roseanne'' and Donna Gaines' book about a plague
of suburban suicides, ``Teen-Age Wasteland'' _ he drew primarily on
his own past. Bogosian grew up as the son of a bookkeeper and a
hairdresser in Woburn, Mass., the same blue-collar suburb of Boston
that is the setting for the book, and now the film, ``A Civil
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't writing about `The Other,''' Bogosian says. ``I
wasn't writing about the exotic. A lot of my experience in Woburn
had to do with class. One of my best friends' fathers was a
carpenter. Another was a truck driver. I had a friend whose father
was a laborer, who'd come home from the job and lay on the couch
and get drunk. We were being told in school that Woburn was a town
to be proud of because it'd been a capital of shoe manufacturing in
the 1890s. But we knew that was all gone. When I ran cross-country
in high school, I went past all the empty factories.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants like Junot Diaz have often inherited exactly such
suburbs, and many of the short stories in ``Drown'' capture the
social geography in meticulous detail. Diaz's characters live, as
his actual family did, in a low-income apartment complex surrounded
by the malls, cineplexes and municipal pools of the middle class.
The autobiographical Yunior, as much as he is a bilingual and
bicultural figure, does what so many Anglo suburban children before
him have done: get car-sick on family trips to relatives in New
York; take a boring job in the shapeless years after college;
experiment with sex in the basement; waste afternoons smoking pot.
</P>
<P>
   In painting this milieu, Diaz came to realize his distance not
only from the white chroniclers of suburban privilege but also from
black and Hispanic writers who, like him, were reared outside the
city. ``One of the things I see in an MFA program is how many of
the writers of color are from very middle-class backgrounds,'' says
Diaz, who teaches at Syracuse University. ``But what they portray
are low-income people. You can't begrudge anybody what they want to
write about. But it shows that even writers are responding to
pre-set notions of who `we' are and how `we' are supposed to be
viewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere may such self-abnegation be more pronounced than in rap
music. Such bands and performers as EPMD, Public Enemy, Busta
Rhymes and Boss were reared in suburbia but rarely if ever reflect
it in their songs. The most extreme example, Ice Cube, spent much
of his childhood in a Los Angeles suburb attending integrated
schools and then a trade college. Yet he went on to fame for his
gangsta raps celebrating drug deals, drive-by shootings and sexual
conquests in the South-Central slums that his own family had
labored to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because hip-hop started off in the inner city, the street was
the place where you had to get your pedigree,'' says S.H. Fernando
Jr., a rap producer and the author of the social history ``The New
Beats: Exploring the Music, Culture and Attitudes of Hip-Hop.''
``You hear a lot of rappers saying, `You have to represent' _
meaning represent the inner-city lifestyle, the 'hood, even if you
didn't come from it. The suburbs are seen as corny, bland, Middle
America. Who wants to know about that?''
</P>
<P>
   As if to answer that question, every Tuesday night several
million viewers watch the ABC sitcom ``The Hughleys,'' the story of
a middle-class black named Darryl Hughley who has just moved with
his family into a mostly white suburb. The running gag of the show
relies on Darryl's belief that his neighbor Dave is a closet bigot.
``The man does wear a lot of flannel,'' Darryl says to his wife in
one episode, ``and he got those big belt buckles, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The most trenchant moments come when Hughley himself, the owner
of a vending-machine company, grapples with his fear that by moving
his family out of a black, urban neighborhood he has compromised
his racial identity and solidarity. ``You're on the slippery slope
to lose your blackness,'' a friend from Los Angeles chides Darryl
in the series pilot. Later in the episode, having watched his
daughter choose a white doll rather than a black one in a toy
store, Darryl moans, ``I feel like a stranger in a strange land.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that land surely looks stranger to the artists and audiences
who remain stuck in the stock images of ``Beaver'' and Cheever than
it possibly could to someone like Darryl Hughley, who is both a
pioneer and a citizen of the new suburbia.

INTEL'S ANTITRUST TRIAL WON'T BE LIKE MICROSOFT'S  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is at least one way in which the Federal Trade
Commission's antitrust case against Intel, &UR;  &LR; which goes to trial
next month, is similar to the Justice Department's suit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases focus on commonplace business practices that the
government says are OK when practiced by ordinary companies but not
when practiced by monopolists.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's case, the targeted practices are the ordinary
stuff of antitrust suits _ tying the sale of two products together
and entering exclusive contracts that cut off Microsoft's main
rival, Netscape, &UR;  &LR; from customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against Intel is doubly peculiar. It focuses on
Intel's alleged mistreatment of customers rather than of rivals.
And the FTC cites no actual harm to competition from Intel's
behavior, no instance of impeding innovation or thwarting specific
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   To win, some experts say, the commission will need to persuade
the courts to set forth new principles of antitrust enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Intel ``is intellectually coherent,'' says
William Kovacic of the George Washington University Law School.
``But it is also fragile, prone to destruct on key matters of
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel sells about 80 percent of general purpose microprocessors
_ the Pentium ``brains'' of personal computers. The commission
focuses on three manufacturers that buy Intel chips _ Compaq
Computer, &UR;  &LR; Intergraph and Digital Equipment &UR;  &LR; _ because they were
also engaged in patent disputes with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Compaq nor Intergraph sells microprocessors in
competition with Intel. Digital does produce a microprocessor for
high-powered computers, but the commission has not argued that
Intel's behavior stymied Digital's capacity to sell its chip.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says that Intel used its choke hold over the
supply of Pentium chips to wrestle patent rights away from the
three manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph held patents that Intel wanted to use without
compensation. Digital and Compaq accused Intel of violating various
patents that they held. Intel, the FTC says, bludgeoned each into
submission by withholding proprietary information that Intel
voluntarily issues to computer manufacturers before releasing a
new-generation chip.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers use the vital information to get a head start
redesigning their computers to take maximum advantage of the new
chip. A manufacturer shut off from the prerelease information would
be late to market its souped-up models.
</P>
<P>
   Intel admits to the hardball tactics. But, it asks, so what? Its
customers were not important rivals. So where is the antitrust
issue? Besides, Intel says, its major competitors in the production
of microprocessors _ Advanced Micro Devices, &UR;  &LR; National
Semiconductor's Cyrix unit and IBM _ are not customers for its
chips and do not get its prerelease information. So they would be
immune from the tactics cited by the commission. So where, Intel
asks, has the consumer been harmed?
</P>
<P>
   The commission admits that there was little direct competition
between the three computer manufacturers and Intel. But it says
Intel's tactics could still discourage computer manufacturers from
taking the chip company on in the future. Who, after witnessing
what Intel did to Compaq and friends, would lend anybody the
hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, to take on Intel?
</P>
<P>
   The route might be circuitous, the commission says, but Intel's
bullying tactics over patent rights could diminish innovation in
the market for microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Fox of New York University School of Law says that the
commission appears to want to go after coercive uses of monopoly
power ``even if the effect is to whittle down the domain of patent
rights.'' Beginning under the Reagan administration in the early
1980s, ``the courts moved toward protecting the monopolist's right
to use its patent rights to exclude competitors. The commission's
suit may herald a movement in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic says the case poses the interesting question: When is a
monopolist obligated to do business with other companies, even
those that are not direct competitors?
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's answer, Kovacic says, appears to range beyond what
courts have explicitly decided on in the past _ telling ``dominant
firms not to break off contracts unless they can point to reasons
that help consumers.'' The principle, Kovacic points out, could
dampen monopolists' enthusiasm to enter even noncoercive deals. And
in the case of Intel it might not prove a winning argument.
</P>
<P>
   Intel argues it had clear justification for its actions. It had
no obligation to share with plaintiffs proprietary information that
they could use to amend their patent applications or strengthen
their lawsuit. Besides, by using its bargaining power to knock down
licensing fees for use of the manufacturers' patents, Intel reduced
its costs, making it possible to cut consumer prices more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apart from all this, there is one way in which the Microsoft and
Intel cases are profoundly different. The Microsoft case has bogged
down in disputes over simple facts and questions about the veracity
of witnesses. In the Intel case, the basic facts are not in
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will there be reams of embarrassing e-mail, giving rise to
quarrels over who knew what and when they knew it. Intel admits to
its hardball tactics and is prepared to defend every one. That
should make this an intriguing investigation about the future of
antitrust enforcement rather than about which witnesses skirted the
truth. &QL;

CITING WAGE GAP, UNION PUSHES PAY PLAN FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (jw) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The average working woman's family would earn $4,205 more per
year if women were paid as much as men with comparable job
qualifications, according to a study released Wednesday by the
AFL-CIO and the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the study found, full-time working women earn just
under three-quarters of what full-time working men are paid,
meaning that altogether, working women's families lose $200 billion
of income to the wage gap each year. The AFL-CIO report said that
if equal pay was enforced by states, the poverty rate among married
women would fall to 0.8 percent from 2.1 percent, and the poverty
rate among single working mothers would be cut to 12.6 percent from
25.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the wage gap between men and women is a legislative
priority for the AFL-CIO this year, and the federation is planning
to sponsor new equal pay legislation in 24 states over the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, brand-new campaign, with a lot of momentum
behind it,'' said Karen Nussbaum, director of the Working Women's
Department at the federation. ``Even though we have an Equal Pay
Act making it illegal to pay women less than men in the same job,
it isn't adequately enforced, and most women are not covered,
because they're in female-dominated jobs, so there's no man around
to compare themselves with. These new bills would strengthen
enforcement and expand the notion of equal pay to work of equal
value.''
</P>
<P>
   But closing the gap is not a simple matter. For decades, the
Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have
prohibited workplace discrimination and pay discrimination against
women, but the wage gap, which had been narrowing throughout the
1980s, has widened slightly since 1993. And it remains true that
the higher the concentration of women in an occupation, the lower
the wage it commands.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation the AFL-CIO will seek, like most recent efforts
to address the problem, is based on the idea of comparable worth,
the concept that pay scales should be re-evaluated so that jobs
traditionally filled by women pay as much as men's jobs requiring
comparable skills, effort, responsibility and working conditions.
For example, a social worker earning $35,000 might be found
comparable to a probation officer paid $55,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have long backed the idea of comparable worth. In
Congress, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who began proposing a Federal
Fair Pay Act based on comparable worth in 1996, is continuing his
effort. But Republicans generally oppose such legislation, seeing
it as an unwieldy manipulation of the free market, and no
Republican has signed on as a co-sponsor for the legislation.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After wearing glasses for 31 years, Debrah Ward jumped at a
chance last May to give them up. Instead of receiving laser
surgery, an alternative to contact lenses and eyeglasses, Ms. Ward
had clear polymer arcs implanted in her near-sighted right eye.
</P>
<P>
   The arcs, known as Intacs, are an experimental treatment made by
Keravision, a tiny California company. The arcs, which can be
inserted during a 10-minute procedure in an ophthalmologist's
office, flatten the cornea to correct mild nearsightedness, or
myopia, a condition that affects some 22 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had vision this good,'' said Ms. Ward, a 38-year-old
accountant in Olathe, Kan., who took part in the Intacs clinical
trials. Her eyesight improved from 20/20 with glasses to 20/10 with
the implants. ``It's nothing short of amazing,'' she said. ``I've
gone around and told all my friends about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Food and Drug Administration, as expected, approves
Intacs this spring, it will be the first surgical corneal implant
for vision correction to be sold in the United States. At the same
time, companies like Bausch &AMP; Lomb, the contact lens giant, and
Staar Surgical, a small California concern, are racing to develop
other types of eye implants, technologies that are similar to
Intacs and essentially are permanent contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Still other developments are under way. Presby Corp., a tiny
biotechnology company in Dallas, is developing a plastic implant
that would eliminate the need for reading glasses and bifocal
lenses. Early clinical trials are set to begin in the United States
next month. All these products, which could be available in the
next several years, are aimed at grabbing a share of the $11
billion Americans now spend each year for glasses and contact
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors and analysts are leery of predicting how popular
vision-corrective implants may become _ they will cost as much as
$2,500 an eye and they involve surgery _ their development is a
result of the recognition that many graying baby boomers are eager
to spend lots of money to turn back the effects of time.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement last year over Viagra, Pfizer Inc.'s impotency
pill, showed that there was an increasing demand among middle-aged
Americans for medical treatments that make their lives easier and
more fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Americans increasingly are willing to undergo cosmetic surgery,
the kind of procedure needed to wear optical implants. Americans
had 697,000 cosmetic operations in 1996, the latest year that
statistics are available, according to the American Society of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons _ a 71.6 percent increase from
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Loarie, Keravision's chief executive, says he expects
that many of his customers will be 38 to 42 years old, who have no
problem spending on cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This age group has more income,'' he said. ``They are not
afraid of trying something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts also say that Americans may snap up implants
because they increasingly are becoming frustrated with contact
lenses. After expanding for years, the contact-lens market in the
United States is barely growing. The number of annual replacement
soft contact-lens wearers, who account for 36 percent of the
market, declined 7.9 percent last year. The only boom in the market
is for daily disposable soft contacts, sales of which increased 44
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intacs should have a broad appeal,'' said Katherine
Martinelli, an analyst with S.G. Cowen Securities Corp. ``People
won't have to worry about cleaning or replacing them. One of the
keys is that the products are going to have to be able to work in
broad range of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the potential seen in implants comes with a number of
caveats.
</P>
<P>
   Given the manufacturers' small size _ Keravision had only
$835,000 in sales last year _ analysts are worried that the
companies lack the resources to make their products best sellers.
Even after an FDA advisory panel recommended Intacs for approval
last month, shares of Keravision, which is based in Fremont,
Calif., continue to trade below their July 1995 initial offering
price of $13.50. The shares closed Wednesday at $12.0625 in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Possible side effects and complications range from blurred
vision with Intacs to a slim risk of cataracts with the Staar
Surgical lens. The implants are expensive, costing some $5,000 for
surgery to both eyes. Only 2,000 people have Intacs worldwide,
leaving their long-term safety unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a casual procedure,'' said Ken Taylor, a vice
president at Arthur D. Little, a corporate consulting and research
firm. ``Eyesight is very precious to people. They are going to have
to be confident about the procedure and the product before they
will have it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the implant technology has been received favorably by
doctors. Made of a clear polymer that is used to correct cataracts,
Intacs are two arcs that are inserted surgically in the periphery
of the cornea. The arcs flatten the cornea to correct vision
primarily between 20/40 and 20/300, a treatment that could be used
by nearly one-third of the 70 million Americans who suffer from
myopia. The surgery takes about 10 minutes and requires a local
anesthesia administered through eyedrops.
</P>
<P>
   Insertion of Staar Surgical's intraocular contact lens, made of
a bendable polymer, takes about 20 minutes. Like Intacs, the lens
can be inserted in a ophthalmologist's office under local
anesthesia, but the procedure is slightly more invasive. The
contact lens fits just over the eye's natural lens behind the iris.
</P>
<P>
   Though several years away from market, Bausch &AMP; Lomb is
developing a lens that fits in front of the iris, a position that
doctors believe should reduce the risk of cataracts. The device has
two thin Z-shaped arms with tiny foot plates to help hold it in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say there is a slightly greater risk of infection from
the lens procedures, but their uses are far broader. Intacs
primarily correct mild nearsightedness, while the implanted lenses
have proved effective in early clinical trials as a remedy for a
greater range of myopia and farsightedness. With both procedures,
the implants can be easily removed. In the Intacs clinical trials,
when the lenses were removed, the patient's eyesight went back to
its uncorrected vision in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Yourdon, a 30-year-old registered nurse near Kansas
City, Kan., had Intacs implanted in her left eye two years ago as
part of the trial. She became frustrated when she realized that her
vision was not 20/20. When her doctor looked at her incision, he
realized that it had not healed properly. It took him 10 minutes to
remove the Intacs implant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My incision healed once the ring was out,'' said Ms. Yourdon,
who has worn Intacs in her right eye since 1994. ``My vision went
back to what it was before, and I decided to have a laser
procedure. Now I see fine. The only thing is that when you go into
corrective eye surgery, you want to know that you'll have perfect
vision when you come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the 410 people who were evaluated after a year in the Intacs
clinical trials, 98 percent achieved 20/40 vision or better, while
78 percent attained vision that was 20/20 or better. Especially
noteworthy was that 56 percent achieved 20/16 vision or better.
Even though the data were not conclusive enough for the FDA
advisory panel to allow Keravision to state that Intacs provided
better vision, the results still caught doctors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting better eyesight is a bonus with the rings,'' said Dr.
R. Doyle Stulting, a professor of ophthalmology at Emory University
in Atlanta who participated in the Intacs clinical trials.
``There's no guarantee that the rings will give you vision that is
better than what you had before with contacts or glasses. But when
people discover that there's something better out there, in this
case better than 20/20 vision, they'll want to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Staar Surgical also reported excellent results in early trials
of its lens. In the trials' first phase, 9 of 10 patients who had
been legally blind without glasses achieved 20/20 vision or better
after receiving an implanted lens. The company began the third
phase of the trials last fall on some 300 patients.
</P>
<P>
   But not all wearers of such implants may be thrilled with the
devices. Given the cost of the procedure, side effects, while
minor, may prove a deterrent. Roughly 4.8 percent of the people in
the third phase of the Intacs clinical studies experienced
difficulty with night vision, while 2.9 percent reported blurry
vision. Other side effects included seeing double images, glare,
halos and fluctuating distance vision.
</P>
<P>
   The Staar Surgical lens caused no notable side effects during
its early clinical trials. John R. Wolf, Staar Surgical's chairman,
acknowledges that there is a slim chance that the lenses may cause
cataracts as a complication from poorly performed surgery. A
spokeswoman for Staar Surgical, which is based in Monrovia, Calif.,
said that there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of cateracts
in the 7,000 lenses that had been installed worldwide so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Staar lens, since it tucked underneath the iris, the
patient is less likely to experience glare and halos,'' said Dr.
Sheri L. Rowen, director of the eye and cosmetic center at Mercy
Medical Center in Baltimore. ``But you have to be gentle installing
it. You don't want to move the lens around.''
</P>
<P>
   Further reducing the allure of implants, patients still may need
glasses following the procedure. ``Eventually, 100 percent of all
people need reading glasses,'' said Dr. Penny A. Asbell, a
professor of opthamology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
Manhattan who participated in the Intacs clinical trials. ``A
nearsighted person who gets Intacs will also need them. There's no
surgical procedure yet that can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also share analysts' concerns about the small size of
Staar Surgical and Keravision, the leading implant companies. Staar
Surgical had sales last year of some $54.5 million compared with
Bausch &AMP; Lomb's $2.36 billion in sales and Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
$23.6 billion. Keravision's finances are especially precarious. The
company, which has yet to post a profit in its 13-year history,
gets the majority of its financing from bond and stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of Staar Surgical and Keravision, analysts have
speculated that either company could be acquired by a contact lens
giant, like Johnson &AMP; Johnson or Bausch &AMP; Lomb. Several analysts
and doctors said they would applaud such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question here really is execution,'' Ms. Martinelli,
the Cowen Securities analyst, said. ``It's great technology, hands
down. But great technology does not always mean great sales.''

COMMENTARY: SO GOVERN, ALREADY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody doubts President Clinton's ability to run a permanent
campaign: His interminable Rose Garden dispensation of goodies,
radio infomercials on Saturdays, photo-op forays to hospitals and
schools, and choreographed junkets display nonstop activity and
identify him personally with the concerns of interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   It works. The media get snack food for thought and the people
are incessantly reminded that their president is visibly right
there on the job.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, after six years of munching these sound-bite hors
d'oeuvres, a hunger grows for meat and potatoes. Now that we have
granted Clinton's oft-expressed wish to ``move on,'' perhaps we can
persuade him to move on from permanent campaigning to transient
governing.
</P>
<P>
   Long neglected in our governance is the presidential
demonstration of wide-ranging competence. That executive reach used
to be displayed at the once-traditional formal news conference.
Reporters ask some 20 questions; the president, who has prepared
answers for four times that many, fields them adroitly. The people
are better informed, and whether agreeing or not, feel secure that
the top man knows his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But a greater purpose is served. To prepare for ``question
time,'' as parliamentarians call it, a president's entire
administration is forced to make foreign and domestic policy
decisions. This discipline creates agonized, late-night sessions
throughout the bureaucracy. That's the serious business of running
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But since he burdened the nation with the Lewinsky affair,
Clinton has been in relative seclusion; the last formal East Room
news conference was 10 months ago. The White House can point to
other ``press opportunities,'' mainly at meetings with foreign
leaders, but nowhere near the 45 occasions of Clinton's first year,
including 18 East Room sessions.
</P>
<P>
   He had excuses. His lawyers would not let him; the press corps
would focus on the scandal. But because his hibernation from access
coincided with a rise in his job approval rating, the tradition of
regular questioning has been called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Availability is risky, his advisers say, and if not necessary
for public support _ who needs it? As a result, the governing
function that underlies preparation for wide-ranging questioning
has atrophied.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful tool for governing well has been all but
abandoned: the thoughtful speech. Not the hourlong State of the
Union blockbuster that touches on everything and deals with
nothing. Not the four-minute radio spot that urges reduced class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Missing are the serious addresses that will get little coverage
but will show that the administration has an economic philosophy or
an intellectual framework for its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whoops! I just used the dread ``I'' word, and every spinmeister
knows that intellectual stuff butters no polling parsnips. But
reviving the national radio address, recalling FDR's usage, was my
baby back in the campaign of 1968. As the press was rolling its
eyes at the Nixon stump speech, we astounded eggheaded critics with
a weekly series of substantive, 20-minute radio speeches. Drove 'em
batty, having to slog through philosophical rumination trying to
find a lead.
</P>
<P>
   But such mental ferment and internal debate helps the man at the
top figure out where he wants to take the nation. Clinton, the
reputed policy wonk, is presumably capable of this.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, we do not need a nibble about NATO solidarity, or
four minutes of dire warnings about rubbery deadlines. We need
someone to explain which lessons drawn from Bosnia apply to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   What is our military role in a Europe no longer faced with a
Soviet threat? What does America expect from NATO outside Europe?
When does a confirmed multilateralist go it alone? What sacrifices
in blood and treasure are we prepared to make to help Palestinians
and Kurds and Kosovars and African tribes achieve _ what?
Independence? Autonomy? Unity? Are all civil wars intolerable?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe sober analysis would be met with a national yawn, or comes
too late for the present White House residents as they devise their
exeunt strategies. But we can hope future presidents will restore
the traditions of answering and explicating that will help them
think more deeply and govern more effectively.

SENATE PANEL TOLD INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW UNFAIR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law that spawned investigations of sexual
misbehavior by President Clinton and of the Iran-Contra scandal
during the Reagan and Bush administrations should be scrapped, two
former government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell and former Senate
Republican leader Howard Baker told a Senate committee that the
independent counsel law is flawed, unfair and inefficient, and
urged Congress not to renew the statute before it expires June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who was instrumental in creation of the law after the
Watergate scandal, told senators that after appointment of 21
independent counsels, at a cost of $150 million over the past 20
years, ``the time has come to reverse directions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The act ought to expire. We ought to work from a clean slate.
We ought to cool off,'' the Tennessee Republican said, urging
lawmakers to revisit the issue when partisan tempers have calmed
after Kenneth Starr's investigation of the White House sex scandal
and Clinton's impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Baker later told reporters that ``political tempers are still so
warm that you're likely to make a mistake if you try to do it right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the attorney general during the Carter administration,
called the law ``poor governmental policy'' and told the Senate
Government Affairs Committee there is no need for the independent
counsel law, even if radical changes are made in the existing
statute. Urging the law's demise, Bell told senators, ``I was
hoping today would be the beginning of the funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1978 in the wake of the Watergate scandal that led to
President Nixon's resignation, the independent counsel law allows
the attorney general to seek appointment of prosecutors who are
free from political constraints to examine alleged criminal
wrongdoing by top administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic critics say that, instead of assuring
fair and independent inquiries, the law has set loose prosecutors
with unlimited power, no spending restraints and a mandate to
search until they find something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the law expires, the current independent counsels _ Starr and
four others who are investigating cabinet members and former
administration officials _ would not be affected, although some
Democrats want to cut off their appropriations and force their
inquiries to end within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who earlier this month was acquitted in the nation's
second presidential impeachment trial, has been targeted by Starr
in a five-year, $40 million inquiry that began with the president's
former Arkansas business partners and expanded to include his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton declined to be drawn into a discussion of
the independent counsel law. ``I have been, to put it mildly,
closely involved with the operation of the statute,'' Clinton said
at a press conference with Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings. ``I
think the important thing is that everyone feel free to express
their opinion,'' Clinton said, referring to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute is badly flawed from the standpoint of fairness
and efficiency,'' Bell told the Senate committee, which has
scheduled three more hearings into the law.
</P>
<P>
   Former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, the chief prosecutor
of Reagan and Bush administration officials in the Iran-Contra
scandal, said Wednesday that Congress is ``not going to get rid of
independent counsels by getting rid of the act.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, whose seven-year, $47 million investigation of
Iran-Contra drew heated Republican criticism, urges keeping the
independent counsel law but with some changes. He told CNN that
``with or without the statute, there's going to be somebody with
the power to conduct investigations of administration officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who is expected to testify before the Senate committee in
the coming weeks, said the investigations would be handled within
the Department of Justice, much as they have since the first
special prosecutor was appointed during the administration of
President Ulysses S. Grant in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving investigations to the Justice Department, or to a
professional prosecutor appointed by the attorney general, was
endorsed by Bell and former independent counsel Joseph DiGenova,
who spent three years investigating the Bush administration's
misuse of then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton's passport file.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., expressed skepticism
about the panel's ``ability to tinker'' with the law sufficiently
to overcome strident, bipartisan opposition in the Senate,
including the leaders of both parties _ Sens. Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
and Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Among members of Thompson's committee, three Democrats said
Wednesday they want to scrap the law. Two of them _ Sens. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. _ voted to revise and
re-enact the law in 1994. The third, Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said
the nation is tired of independent counsel investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much like the drunk on the Titanic _ I ordered ice, but
this is ridiculous,'' Cleland said. ``I feel like it's time to let
the independent counsel statute die the most ignominious death it
so richly deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of committee members, led by Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., favors overhauling the law instead of letting
it die. Others senators siding with Lieberman are Susan Collins,
R-Maine, Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we just going to trust the executive branch to investigate
itself?'' asked Domenici, referring to the concern that a
prosecutor appointed by the attorney general _ who is appointed by
the president _ cannot truly be considered an independent
investigator when examining the president or members of his
administration.

 &HT;    Holyfield predicts Lewis falling in 3rd
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield thinks pressure is the best way to
defeat Lennox Lewis. But Wednesday, he might have shifted the
pressure to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield predicted he would knock out Lewis in the third round
when the two meet in a heavyweight title unification March 13 in
New York. Holyfield has forecast victory before, but this is
believed to be the first time he has predicted a round.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's out of character for him,'' trainer Emanuel Steward
said from Lewis' training camp in the Pocono Mountains in
Pennsylvania. ``Lennox must be getting under his skin a lot, saying
things about his personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis earlier this week called Holyfield a ``hypocrite'' for
fathering children out of wedlock while claiming to be a devout
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield was asked on a national conference call Wednesday
about when he might retire, he responded, ``God will let me know.
That's the reason I know I'll win this fight. That's why I can say
I'm going to blow him out in the third round. If I blow him out in
the third round, it's because God wants me to _ and I will blow him
out.

 &HT;    Prestigious, but hardly next major
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Before the first ball was struck Wednesday
morning at the La Costa Resort, the Andersen Consulting Match Play
possessed instant credibility. Rare for a new event, but why not?
The top 64 players in the world meeting head to head in
single-elimination with a $1 million reward available Sunday?
What's not to like? Even if it isn't a major, and in some players'
minds, never will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that happening,'' Tiger Woods said. ``Golf is all
about traditionalists, and traditionalists don't ever want to see
another major added.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Masters, the British Open, the PGA and the U.S. Open have
got tremendous history behind them,'' Mark O'Meara said. ``These
World Championships are just another way to promote the game of
golf and to promote a lot of the best players getting together and
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. If the Match Play is not the one to
someday approach the significance of, say, The Players
Championship, it's probably not going to happen with any of the
World Golf Championships.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MANY NO-SHOWS
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, defending champion at this week's Australian Ladies
Masters, is disappointed that most LPGA stars chose to skip the
event. ``If the LPGA is prepared to sanction an event, then it
would be nice to see some of the top players give more support, but
I understand it's a long way to come,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament features five of the six former winners,
including England's Laura Davies. But among the missing are 1995
champion and world No. 1 Annika Sorenstam of Sweden and South
Korean star Se Ri Pak. Meg Mallon, Beth Daniel, Betsy King, Helen
Alfredsson and Liselotte Neumann did not make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The only women ranked in the top 10 on the 1999 money list who
are playing are Webb, Kelly Robbins, Alison Nicholas and Kris
Tschetter.
</P>
<P>
   NOD FOR NORMAN
</P>
<P>
   Offering a gesture that four years ago would have seemed
impossible, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem on Tuesday thanked
Greg Norman, whose own World Tour plans were steamrolled, ``for his
determination and suggestions in 1994.'' ... Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan
is not on Woods' bag for the second time in three weeks; no reason
has been stated, but Fluff has had back problems in the past. Bryon
Bell, Woods' college friend who was on the bag for his victory at
San Diego two weeks ago, will caddie again. Bell earned the
customary 10 percent, $48,600. Not bad for a guy going through
medical school. If Woods wins this week, the paycheck would be
$100,000. ``We've never lost a tournament together,'' Woods said.
``We're 4-0.'' David Duval's fondness for the BellSouth Classic was
demonstrated when he remained in the field but bypassed both Doral
and Bay Hill.

ADVERTISING: NEW AD CAMPAIGN FOR HERSHEY'S COMING ON STRONG  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as the willpower to stick to all those
calorie-cutting New Year's resolutions begins to wane, consumers
are facing a wave of new products from Hershey Foods &UR;  &LR; Corp. that
are being aggressively marketed with new commercials, print
advertisements and store promotions.
</P>
<P>
   So those who already find it hard to eat just one Reese's Peanut
Butter Cup will now have to deal with Reese's Bites, a miniature
version of the peanut candy that the company says is for ``mindless
munching.'' Translation: before you know it, you've eaten the whole
bag.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets worse. The company has also come out with ``bites''
of its Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds, Cookies &AMP; Cream and
Almond Joy candy bars. And Hershey is making it hard to miss the
treats because it is aggressively promoting them on network
television in various time slots and in national magazines and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which was introduced this month, is created by DDB
Needham Worldwide in New York, part of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey, the nation's largest maker of chocolate candy, has also
been expanding its nonchocolate brands. It introduced Jolly Beans
under the Jolly Rancher brand in 1997 and last month branched out
into lollipops by putting Jolly Ranchers on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as it may be to believe, though, Hershey is not simply
trying to break dieters' resolve with all of these new munchies.
Rather, the maker of Hershey Kisses, Twizzlers and Milk Duds, is
trying to sweeten its profits and fatten its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey has disappointed investors lately with two quarters of
earnings shortfalls and a stock value that has declined by about 5
percent in the last year. One reason is that like its competitors
Hershey has been struggling with flat sales of chocolate products.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of chocolate candy last year were flat at $3.2 billion
while sales of nonchocolate candy increased 32 percent, to $265
million, according to Information Resources Inc., a research firm
in Chicago. The seasonal and assorted candy category increased 9
percent, to $2.51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But in what it calls a key strategy, Hershey has been
diversifying its product mix in recent years. In addition to
maximizing best-selling brands through product extensions such as
the Hershey Bites, the company is also looking for opportunities in
areas in which it has not had a presence, such as lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that some people think chocolate is a dirty word
but they still want some kind of sugar fix, it's a proper strategy
to get those people as well,'' said Edward Froilich, an analyst who
follows the company for the Pershing division of Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking behind the company's $330 million purchase
in 1996 of the North American confectionery business of Leaf Inc.,
a unit of Huhtamaki Oy &UR;  &LR; of Finland. The acquisition gave Hershey
the Jolly Rancher, Good &AMP; Plenty and the Pay Day candy bar brands,
which added, in some cases, low-fat products that have been driving
much of the growth in the candy business.
</P>
<P>
   ``New products bring a lot of excitement to the candy category,
and we have obvious areas where we are underdeveloped,'' said
Kathie Rhyne, director of new products at Hershey. ``This allows us
to pursue those and we will develop products that help us gain
sales from other categories as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this month, Hershey is promoting the Jolly Rancher
lollipops through product sampling in schools and through
promotions with ads created by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather New York, part of
the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group &UR;  &LR; PLC. And to
promote Pay Day candy bars, Hershey is using a mischievous elephant
in new commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In the spots created by DDB Needham, the elephant goes to great
lengths to secretly swipe the peanut and caramel candy, including
stuffing himself in a toll booth and demanding the bars as fare
from passing motorists. The commercials, as well as print ads, use
the tag line ``Can't get enough peanuts?''
</P>
<P>
   To create an awareness of Hershey Bites as candy that is based
on already popular treats, DDB Needham uses the product logos and
packing to introduce new treats while reminding customers that the
products come ``in four of your favorite flavors.'' The commercials
use computer-animated candy bags that come to life in whimsical
spots under the tag line ``For a big taste, have a little bite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hershey Bites is a perfect example of creating a new brand
built on the equities of four popular brands already out in the
marketplace,'' said Peter Tate, president of DDB Needham New York.
</P>
<P>
   And with already strong brands to work with, said Charlie
Piccirillo, a group creative director at the agency, ``your job is
made much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we needed to do was keep it really simple and
entertaining,'' he added.

 &HT;    McGwire returns to strange new world of big expectations
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Life, in some ways, has remained constant. He
joined all the other dads watching their sons playing youth-league
basketball this winter. He traveled, went on vacation. He
reconsidered his life. And when January expired, Mark McGwire felt
compelled, as he always has, to make an early showing at training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Where, it turned out, precious little of his life was constant.
He dispelled a report that he had hired private bodyguards. New
parents came to him to say they'd named their children for him. And
not Mark _ kids named McGwire. A new teammate, Carlos Barega,
chirped that an 80-home run season is a possibility. McGwire had
kissed a pope over the winter. He's kissed Helen Hunt on network
TV. Everywhere he went, America seemed to need to confide in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had so many people join me for dinner,'' McGwire
said. ``It was amazing. These people just walk up and sit down and
tell me their stories. Sometimes I'm too nice a guy. And I'd sit
there and listen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than four months ago, a first baseman from St. Louis
changed baseball and the world as he knew it by hitting 70 home
runs. On Wednesday, McGwire took opportunity of the Cardinals first
full-squad workout to survey whom he had become. Someone asked if
it would feel normal to be at a ballpark again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will become normal,'' he said, ``but my life has
changed forever. And for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 70-minute exchange with some 100 media members, McGwire
resumed his spot at the game's center stage. He still worries about
baseball's future. He's still taking the muscle-building supplement
androstenedione. He still thinks he has five good seasons in him,
after which he will be 40. But most of what Wednesday proved is
that McGwire remains baseball's biggest story, even six weeks
before anyone actually plays a game.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out at a room filling with reporters, Cardinals general
manager Walt Jocketty said, ``This is more people than we used to
draw for spring-training games.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, McGwire stated that he is seeking no record this
season, which is what he has always said in the sspring. His goal,
as it has been for years, is to reach 50 homers. And while he will
continue to discuss what happened in 1998, Jocketty made no secret
that ``what we want to try to do is turn the page,'' to allow
McGwire to enter 1999. When the first question came about the
possibility of reaching 70 again, McGwire gave that piercing
red-eye look the nation saw after every game last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did last year, ball players have been trying for 38
years,'' he said. ``I never thought about it. Anything is possible,
breaking any record. In order to hit 70 home runs, I would have to
think you'd have to be at the 40-plateau by the All-Star break. I
can only imagine the amount of pressue. I know what it entails to
reach 60, 61, 62. Try going 10 more. Seventy is a really big
number. I was in awe of myself. I think I'm still in awe of
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his surroundings have changed. Only he and center
fielder Ray Lankford are holdovers from the Opening Day lineup of
last April. Rookie J.D. Drew will hit ahead of McGwire this season,
yet the public expectations mount daily. The Cardinals are 430,000
tickets ahead _ at 2.2 million _ of last year's advance sale at
this time. All for a team that was a mere four games over .500 last
year and finished six games out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' manager Tony La Russa said, ``is we were
our best in the second half and in Sepember. We had the best
September (18-7) in Busch Stadium history. It's real clear to me
that having people follow our club and Mark is good for the rest of
the team. It's tough to have a flat day when you have that kind of
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the afternoon was over, McGwire would discount his
chances to reach 700 home runs _ he stands at 437 _ and said the
only comtemporary player with a strong opportunity is Ken Griffey
Jr., with 350 at age 28. He defended his use of andro, claimed that
his 1998 season would need no asterisk if baseball banned it and
stipulated, ``I don't endorse the product.'' He also called the $3
million auction price for the 70th home run ball ``ridiculous,''
and could hardly believe that the legal squabble for ball No. 66
wound up televised on ``The Peoples' Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he had a sickening thought. After nearly two decades in
baseball, something was finally stolen from his locker last summer,
a protective cup he had used back through his minor-league career.
These have become strange times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gawd,'' he said, ``I hope that doesn't show up on the show.

 &HT;    Q&AMP;A with Atlanta Braves hitting instructor Don Baylor
 &HT;    By Carrol Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After six years as the manager of the Colorado
Rockies, Don Baylor has returned to the coaching ranks as the
Atlanta Braves hitting instructor. In the first of a series of
weekly question-and-answer sessions with key Braves personnel,
staff writer Carroll Rogers spoke with Baylor on his thoughts on
Braves hitters, his new job, and his outlook on the 1999 edition of
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is spring training going so far for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been a real good camp. It's a little different how
successful teams go about doing their job. I've been taking a lot
of notes. It's baseball _ no B.S. Everybody comes in, they get
their work, they get their throwing, get their groundballs. It's a
gradual work-your-way-into playing the games.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you look at the Braves' hitters as a group, what do they
have to offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Their work habits are outstanding. I have not found one guy
here yet that I say, ``Let's go to the cage,'' and they say, ``I
don't want to do this today.'' Not a one, and that's a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of your goals in your new job?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every day we go out there, we have a plan. Not just
freelancing the opposing pitcher. We're going to have enough
information on guys, what they throw in certain situations _ with
nobody on base, with the bases loaded _ and not throw away at-bats.
If you throw away 30 to 40 to 50 at-bats, that's the difference in
hitting .280 and .310, .290 and .300. I want every at-bat. To throw
away four at-bats, and say, `OK, I'll get him tomorrow.' No, I want
you to put in four quality at-bats. If we get some hits, fine. If
we don't, we'll come back tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What other area would you like to see improve?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last three years, the Braves have been over 1,000 strikeouts.
To me that's alarming. These guys are much better hitters than
that. But sometimes when you freelance, that's what's going to
happen. We're going to think about the off-field when we get two
strikes. That means we'll stay on the ball and not let our head
fly. I want us to be able to put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you go about helping Ryan Klesko improve his hitting?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know Bobby (Cox) would love to have Klesko play against
left-handers. I told Ryan today: ``My goal is for you to play every
day. That means we have to take the left-hander and put the ball in
play. We can't strike out because if you do, you're going to be
over here sitting with me.'' So if we go 1 for 4 against a lefty,
we've had a pretty good day. But then if you got 2, you had a great
day. Then we'll get those right-handers later.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much of a difference can a hitting coach make?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's like with (Andres) Galarraga. He got to a point (that),
if he didn't change something, he was going to be out of the game.
That was in 1992. He did. He won a batting title. The day they
presented him with the Silver Slugger he wanted me to go out with
him to accept it. I said `Hey, Cat, you did the work. It's all
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is it about you that makes you so successful at reviving
careers, like you've done with Galarraga and Vinny Castilla?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know what hitting is? It's about what every sport has _
try to be positive through working hard. These guys have tremendous
ability, because they're in the major leagues. It's that other
little mental part, the guy that sits up on your shoulder up here,
that little negative thing: ``I don't know. I'm not too good
today.'' A hitting coach or a pitching coach or a manager is trying
to get these guys focused and positive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will it take to get the Braves where they need to be?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of times when you have good pitching, as a position
player you say, ``We're going to win 2-1.'' Only if it's a No. 1
guy out there. But if it's a No. 3 or No. 4 or a No. 5 pitcher out
there, that's not acceptable. We want to pound those guys. Get the
hitters to think good about themselves and not rely on pitching all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can the Braves improve their offense in the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the playoffs, I watched these guys get beat. I watched
(Sterling) Hitchcock pitch against this team. It was one of those
twilight games, 5 o'clock, shadows. He threw one strike, one ball
in the dirt, one strike, one ball in the dirt. He got them out like
it was nothing. This was a team that won 106 games.
</P>
<P>
   I used to tell guys all the time in playoff situations, even in
the World Series, the game is still played the exact same way.
There are more people watching, a satellite here, a satellite
there, but the bases are still 90 feet (apart). They don't move the
mound in. Think, ``Slow the game down,'' so it's not racing through
your mind. You've got to say it's the same game you've played for
162 games. Don't put that pressure on your back. ``I'm the guy
who's got to do it'' _ then it gets away from you. Next thing you
know, you're sitting at home watching like I've been watching for
the last six years.

 &HT;    Wohlers impresses teammates
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The Mark Wohlers batting-practice
throwing session had two new features on Wednesday _ some big
Braves hitters in the batter's box and a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day of spring training, the stakes rise for
the Braves closer trying to make a comeback from a disastrous 1998.
Wohlers took the next step Wednesday by throwing for the first time
since position players reported. Instead of facing pitchers and
catchers and minor-league hitters, Wohlers was staring down such
hitters as Chipper Jones and Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Those two, as well as a group of about 100 fans who applauded
Wohlers on his way off the mound, liked what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had better control of everything,'' said Jones, who
reported that about half of the dozen Wohlers pitches he saw were
strikes. ``First time I've seen him this year. (He) had a couple
back-door sliders. The splitter had good action. The fastball was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone agreed. ``(A) few balls in the dirt, but nasty,'' Boone
said. ``Really good curveball. Some fastballs that were close. He
had his velocity there, I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers said afterward he's throwing the fastball at 90 percent.
``I'm getting close to the point now where you can really let it
loose,'' Wohlers said, and grinned. ``I'm about at the reckless
step.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, the applause was well-received. ``It's been awhile
since it's been fun,'' Wohlers said. ``It's nice to go out and have
some positives happen.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAVES SIGNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, who saved 30 games last year, agreed to terms
Wednesday on a one-year deal worth $250,000. He earned $175,000 in
'98 in his first full season in the majors. He came to the Braves
in 1997, after they found him in the Prairie League playing for the
Southern Minny Stars in Austin, Minn. ``I could be doing a lot
worse,'' Lightenberg said, smiling. ``I never got into this for the
money. That's not what it's about for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other Braves agreed to terms Wednesday: Bruce Chen to his
first major-league deal, worth $200,000 if he makes the 25-man
roster; rookie left-hander Odalis Perez; minor-league pitcher
Damian Moss; and minor-league outfielder George Lombard. That
leaves only Andruw Jones, Kevin Millwood and Randall Simon
unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN BACK
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Brian Jordan rejoined the Braves on Wednesday,
after spending Tuesday in Baltimore to visit his mother in the
hospital. Betty Jordan had found blood in her stool and doctors
haven't yet found the cause, Jordan said. Outfielder Gerald
Williams is still out of camp because of some personal business.
</P>
<P>
   DRIVING EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, manager Bobby Cox took his turn
behind the wheel of a stock car by driving in Disney's Richard
Petty Driving Experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cox won the team lead-foot award on Tuesday, reaching the
highest speed of any Brave who participated at 125.6 mph. That was
a 5-mph improvement over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Cox were pitchers John Rocker and Chen, shortstop Mark
DeRosa, outfielder George Lombard, third-base coach Ned Yost and
trainer Jeff Porter.

<P>
   LANDECK, Austria _ With more snow covering the Alps than almost
anyone could remember, Ulrike Schwarz came to the Austrian Alpine
resort of Galtuer from her home in Germany last week with her two
teen-age children, expecting the best skiing in years.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, though, it had been snowing too hard to ski.
So Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph,
were relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast
chalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m. Tuesday when, with an
almighty rumbling, clouds of snow blasted through the windows and
the whole house collapsed beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avalanche!'' Mrs. Schwarz screamed, pushing the children
toward the stairs in the back of the Tyrolean chalet, away from
millions of tons of highly compressed snow carrying rocks and
shredded trees and roaring down upon the village. All three
survived, climbing out of the house through a hole where the roof
had been, and were flown out to an emergency center in Landeck
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here said Wednesday that they had recovered the
bodies of 16 people, many of them German vacationers, from the
avalanche, which was 15 to 20 feet deep and 300 to 500 feet wide.
They were still looking for 20 to 30 other missing people, feared
dead under the snow.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 24 hours after the Tuesday avalanche, authorities
said another snowslide, up to 45 feet deep and 600 feet wide, in
the nearby resort of Ischgl had swept away four houses.
</P>
<P>
   Two people, a man and a little girl, were pulled alive from the
snow Wednesday in Ischgl, but a woman was killed and six other
people were believed missing, according to authorities and Austrian
television.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the avalanches were the worst in Austria since a
series of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in
January 1954.
</P>
<P>
   With Galtuer and Ischgl cut off from road access Wednesday by
the continuing danger of avalanches, information on the latest
deadly slide was scarce. Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian
military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making
their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the
most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in
by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow is like cement and it's full of pieces of wood and
wreckage,'' Schoenherr said.
</P>
<P>
   After heavy snows over the past two weeks set off avalanches
that killed seven people near the southern Swiss village of Evolene
and 19 people in France, the mood Wednesday at the height of this
Alpine vacation season is edgy. The vacationing skiers and those
who cater to them live for snow; now they are finding that they can
also die from too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian
authorities turned a military barracks compound into an
avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the
stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies. They
barred all civilian air or road traffic in the area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Landeck and Galtuer are separated by mountains more than 8,000
to 10,000 feet high, fearsome, jagged peaks that, from the air
Wednesday, looked softened and benign under their heavy coats of
blinding white snow.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, olive drab Austrian Huey helicopters beat their
way down into the narrow landing field of the Landeck barracks
compound for most of the day, taking out about 400 vacationers and
villagers before a heavy snowfall late Wednesday afternoon halted
the flights. Other choppers loaded up with meat, cabbage, potatoes,
tomatoes and milk for the 7,500 tourists in Ischgl and the 600 ski
vacationers still in Galtuer.
</P>
<P>
   The United States flew in six Blackhawk medical evacuation
helicopters to Innsbrueck airport, 60 miles northeast of Galtuer,
to help take people out, but they could not fly in Wednesday
because of the afternoon snow, Schoenherr said.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian television showed video tape, apparently taken by the
rescuers, showing dogs sniffing for survivors and long lines of
rescuers plunging sticks into the snow and digging holes 6-to-10
feet deep in hopes of finding victims still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The tape showed solid three-story concrete and stucco Tyrolean
houses torn apart as if by an earthquake, and automobiles rolled
into crumpled metal balls by the snow.
</P>
<P>
   And it showed rescuers lifting frozen bodies out of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most painful day of my life,'' said Wendelin
Weingartner, the top elected official in the Austrian Tyrol region.
Eight seriously injured victims were flown to hospitals in
Innsbrueck, where they were all said to be in stable condition
under treatment for hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   European authorities explained the spate of avalanches by the
almost unparalleled amounts of snow that have fallen since the
second week of February and the high winds that have whipped it
into drifts and made it unstable on the crust of earlier snow.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other resorts in Austria, Switzerland and France have
been cut off from road access for days by the mounting danger of
avalanches. Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and
mighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance
congregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible
by road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts
of Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off
for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost all the resorts have Web sites or television
advertisements that boast of fantastic ski conditions, and most are
clearly expecting a new infusion of guests as soon as the roads
reopen.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schwarz had a meal in the barracks mess hall after her
ordeal and waited for her husband to come from Germany to pick up
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Would she or her children ever go skiing again? ``Yes, but not
with this much snow,'' Mrs. Schwarz said.

COMMENTARY: PUSHING PEOPLE AROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may be that Rudolph Giuliani never has a
reflective moment. He just likes to push people around. He's pretty
indiscriminate about it. One day it's an indisputably worthy
target, like violent criminals, the next day it's jaywalkers. One
moment it's the organized thugs at the Fulton Fish Market, the next
it's cab drivers and food vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green, Carl McCall, New York magazine _ they've all been
targets. Giuliani shut down an entire neighborhood in Harlem and
buzzed its residents with police helicopters because he didn't like
Khallid Muhammad. Solid citizens trying to exercise their right to
protest peacefully have been fought at every conceivable turn. Many
gave up, their protests succumbing to fear or exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights? Civil liberties? Forget about it. When the mayor
gets it in his head to give somebody a hard time _ frequently
through his enforcers in the Police Department _ the niceties of
the First Amendment and other constitutional protections get very
short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   The latest targets are people suspected of driving drunk. The
cops have been given the power to seize their vehicles on the spot.
Why not? Why wait for a more sober mind _ say, a judge _ to assess
the merits of the case? Why even bother with an annoyance like due
process? Hizzoner _ who would like to be known as His Majesty _
makes the rules. And he says even if the drivers are acquitted they
may not get their cars back.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to him: ``Let's say somebody is acquitted, and it's one
of those acquittals in which the person was guilty but there is
just not quite enough evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. That
might be a situation in which the car would still be forfeited.''
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the royal robes and the crown. And get rid of those
pesky legislators and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Emery, whose Manhattan law firm, Emery, Cuti,
Brinckerhoff &AMP; Abady, is frequently called on to combat abusive
government practices, was blunt in his criticism of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' said Emery, ``is that Giuliani has a vision of
what is essentially an unconstitutional society. He views privacy
and the rights of innocent citizens as a far lower value than law
enforcement's domination of not only the streets, but also private
areas of people's lives. He's doing it for what he believes are
good reasons. He wants a civilized society. One understands his
vision. It's not new. But it's an idealistic, totalitarian vision
that tramples on everything a free society stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years of Giuliani's mayoralty most New
Yorkers, enjoying the increased order and the reductions in crime,
turned a blind eye to the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the killing of Amadou Diallo, the abuses are
being more closely scrutinized. And the extent of the erosion of
rights and liberties is coming into much sharper relief. (One
example: the thousands upon thousands of innocent young people,
most of them black and Hispanic, who are stopped and searched for
no good reason by the police.)
</P>
<P>
   I asked Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at
Harvard, why it is important for law-abiding citizens to be
concerned about any weakening of civil rights and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking generally, and not about the situation in New York,
Tribe said, ``The character of America and the nature of the
society that people have struggled to preserve and died to protect
turns on not just the opportunities for material advancement but at
least as importantly on the protection of basic aspects of human
dignity and personal freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the apparent increase in security that can follow ``the
sacrifice of what we tend to describe as civil liberties'' is often
illusory. But even if there were some gains in security, he said,
the price would be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of speech and freedom of expression,'' he said, ``are
important not just to the dignity of the individual who otherwise
feels stifled and silenced, but are a critical part of an active
and informed electorate without which we really are giving up not
just personal freedom but the very ideal of government of the
people, by the people and for the people. And that kind of
sacrifice essentially amounts to a sacrifice of really the very
essence of our whole way of life.''

SHARP DROP IN USE OF FOOD STAMPS SEEN BY SOME OFFICIALS AS A
PROBLEM

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's food stamp rolls have dropped so sharply that there
is growing concern it is not just a vibrant economy, but needy
people's hesitance to apply for benefits, that is causing the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of people using food stamps falling to fewer
than 19 million, from nearly 28 million people four years ago, many
in Congress; at the Agriculture Department, which administers the
food stamp program, and at some private poverty groups believe that
a significant number of people are not seeking help even though
they still lack food and are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials think that stringent rules intended to put
welfare recipients to work and reduce the welfare rolls may have
also discouraged people from seeking food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Some states and cities seeking to cut welfare rolls
aggressively, for example, require a month of job searching or more
before an applicant can get benefits of any kind. Often, officials
say, people in need of emergency food aid simply walk out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to get people off welfare programs, but people
may have failed to understand that the food stamp program is not a
welfare program,'' said Shirley R. Watkins, the undersecretary of
agriculture for food, nutrition and consumer service. ``It's
nutritional assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, Ms. Watkins and other officials say, it may
simply be the worsening stigma attached to public aid of all sorts
that is keeping people from applying for food aid, the officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other federal benefits, food stamps are based strictly on
financial need, independent of other circumstances and not
constrained by other rules or limits.
</P>
<P>
   The food stamp rolls are not the only ones reflecting big
declines in recent years. There has been a similar unexplained drop
in Medicaid rolls. Some officials have said that while some of this
is attributable to the economy, some may also be the result of
recipients believing that once they are off welfare, they are also
ineligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins said there are indications from states like
Wisconsin, which is in the forefront of efforts to require welfare
recipients to seek employment, that people leaving welfare for
low-wage work are not continuing to seek food stamps that could
help them make it through the month.
</P>
<P>
   Her misgivings are shared by some members of Congress from both
sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming apparent that the welfare reforms of 1996 did not
appreciate how tightly access to food stamps was linked to access
to welfare, said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chairwoman of the
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think there's a problem here,'' she said. ``We need to
see why state systems don't seem to capture the food-stamp eligible
population very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a big change in one system, it's going to have
ramifications for other systems,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``Some are
positive. If people aren't getting food stamps because they're
making more money, that's a good thing.'' She said her committee
was planning to hold hearings later this year on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only rough estimates have been made of how many people
have left the food stamp program for reasons other than rising
prosperity or stricter rules. Last year, for example, the
Congressional Budget Office calculated that 2.9 million people who
left the food stamp rolls between 1994 and 1997 did so for some
other reason. The budget office report, a projection of economic
conditions through 2008, proposed that the stigma and barriers
surrounding welfare offices could be driving eligible people away.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, no one disputes that the program has
shrunk drastically, both in the number of people enrolled and in
the cost of providing the aid. Since 1994, the annual cost of the
food stamp program has fallen from $24.5 billion to $18.9 billion,
according to the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservative poverty analysts say the drop in food
stamp rolls does not indicate a problem. Robert Rector, who studies
welfare for the Heritage Foundation, a private group in Washington,
said the drop is simply a recovery from a period through the early
1990s when access to food stamps and other assistance became too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s and early '90s, you had this notion of
one-stop shopping, getting people on as many benefits as you
could,'' he said. ``A lot of the decline now is hyped.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress would do well to make food stamps less readily
available, by instituting work requirements and other rules similar
to those already imposed on other forms of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Department of Agriculture, however, the notion that too
many people have abandoned food stamps has caused a flurry of
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The department recently commissioned a study to understand a
simultaneous rise in the demand on private food charities like
church-sponsored food pantries and soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to determine if some of these charity seekers are
seeking handouts at private charities because they have lost access
to public food aid, agriculture officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And department officials are pushing the states to be sure their
welfare offices are in line with federal rules, which require
prompt processing of food stamp applications.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, the administrator of the food stamp program, Samuel
Chambers Jr., sent a letter to the heads of commissioners of every
state welfare and food stamp program urging them to review their
policies to make sure they do not violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The letter pointed out how changes in efforts to trim rolls of
people receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families could be
deterring people from receiving food stamps, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage you to review your procedures and to make sure
that individuals denied, diverted from or terminated from TANF are
fully considered for food stamps and receive benefits if they are
entitled,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had been particularly worried about the
situation in New York City, where newly reorganized welfare
offices, now called job centers, were delaying food stamp
applications and often directing applicants to private food
pantries instead.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge last month ruled that the city food stamp
process violated federal law, the city promised to change its
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the city made another unrelated policy change
that city officials say will trim several thousand people from food
stamp rolls. Under the 1996 package of federal welfare changes,
single able-bodied adults can be cut off from food stamps after
three months if they do not work at least 20 hours a week or
participate in a workfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Counties can seek waivers to the work requirement if they have
high unemployment rates, and for two years the counties in New York
City had all sought the waivers, preserving the food aid.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the city has chosen not to seek the waivers,
so that city residents who are single and able to work must find
work or lose their food stamps, said Deborah Sproles, a spokeswoman
for the city Human Resources Administration.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, private groups focused on poverty issues decried
the city's decision, saying it could put as many as 25,000 people
at risk of hunger. But Ms. Sproles said, ``This is part of the
city's overall effort to start helping people gain self-reliance.''

61 KILLED IN JET CRASH IN CHINA

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ All 61 people on board were killed Wednesday when a
Russian-made jet crashed on its descent to Wenzhou, a southern
coastal city, according to the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The 61 people were all Chinese citizens, the agency said.
Airport officials said there were also casualties on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Tupolev-154 operated by China Southwest Airlines,
crashed in fields 25 miles south of Wenzhou at 4:29 p.m., said an
official in the manager's office at Wenzhou Airport who gave her
name as Ms. Lan. The plane was from Chengdu in Sichuan Province.
Ms. Lan said the weather was calm and visibility was good.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was not immediately apparent. Although
initial reports described a midair explosion, airport officials
said they believed the plane had first crashed and then exploded.
The area around Wenzhou is extremely mountainous. Ms. Lan said the
aircraft had been descending over a flat plain.
</P>
<P>
   The crash will almost certainly raise questions about the safety
of Russian planes, which have been involved in a relatively high
proportion of Chinese air disasters even though they make up just a
tiny fraction of the commercial air fleet.
</P>
<P>
   China's commercial airlines have had a good safety record in
recent years, industry experts said. Most Chinese commercial planes
are made by Boeing and Airbus. Those Western planes are used
exclusively for international and major domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is absolutely passionate about air safety, and that's
why you see aging aircraft _ and those are mostly Russian planes _
being hustled out of the fleet as fast as they can,'' said Thomas
Gallagher, managing director in charge of aerospace for CIBC
Oppenheimer, the investment bank in New York, who has worked
extensively in China.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gallagher called the Tupolev ``not a bad plane,'' though
he noted that it was ``probably more maintenance-intensive'' than
Western planes. Only 7 percent of commercial planes in China were
Tupolevs in 1995, a number that has almost certainly dropped
further, Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the propaganda department for China
Southwest Airlines, who gave only his surname, Xu, refused to give
the age of the plane in the crash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from China's civil aviation administration are
investigating, the news agency said. Earlier in the day, before the
crash, the newspaper China Daily reported that China planned to
spend $1.2 billion to modernize its air-traffic controls over the
next 10 years.

REUNION GOES AWRY; WOMAN AND 2 TEENS ARE MISSING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. Ariz., Colo., Minn., Nev., Ore., Texas, Wash.)   (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MODESTO, Calif. _ One thing Jens Sund can say about his wife,
Carole, is that she knows how to plan. When she created a detailed
itinerary for a trip to Yosemite National Park with the couple's
daughter, Juli, 15, and a family friend from Argentina, Silvina
Pelosso, 16, Sund said, he had no reason to believe Mrs. Sund's
plan would go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Over a week ago Tuesday, that plan called for Mrs. Sund and the
two teen-agers to return from Yosemite and rendezvous with Sund and
the couple's three younger children at the San Francisco airport.
Sund would fly in from the couple's home in Eureka, while Mrs. Sund
and the two girls were to drop off a rental car here in Modesto,
then fly to San Francisco. Everyone would then fly to Phoenix for a
trip to the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Sund and the girls did not show up in San Francisco,
and eight days later, they were still missing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, part of Mrs. Sund's wallet, holding her
credit cards but no cash, was found at a roadside here, more than
60 miles from El Portal, near the western edge of Yosemite, where
Mrs. Sund and the two girls had last stayed. The wallet appeared to
weaken one of the FBI's prevailing theories, that the women had a
car accident in a remote area of the park, and to strengthen
another, that they met with foul play.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said they could not rule out the possibility
of an accident. Along with teams from the California Highway Patrol
and the National Park Service, the FBI intensified its search in
Yosemite, focusing on the Highway 120 pass. The mother and two
girls had been spotted near Highway 120, asking for directions to a
meadow in Tuolumne Grove in Yosemite, on Tuesday morning, Feb. 16.
Their rental car, a red 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix, was seen in the
Tuolumne Grove parking lot on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A Holiday Inn a half mile from where Mrs. Sund's wallet was
found has become a headquarters for friends, family members and
volunteers who have been papering gas stations with fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sund, 42, comes from a prominent Santa Rosa family, the
Carringtons, who have been in real estate development for more than
a century. She is a principal in Carrington Co., based in Eureka,
which owns shopping centers in California, Colorado, Minnesota,
Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said they had no reason to believe that Mrs. Sund
and the girls had been kidnapped because there was no ransom note
or any other evidence of an abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Sund, 43, a Carrington vice president, has offered a $250,000
reward for the safe return of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said he last spoke to his wife on Monday, Feb. 15, when she
telephoned from the motel where the three were staying in El
Portal. Mrs. Sund and the girls were supposed to have met friends
at the University of the Pacific in Stockton on Tuesday afternoon
for a campus tour, then make the short drive to Modesto to fly to
San Francisco. When Sund's plane to San Francisco was late and his
wife was not there to meet him, he caught the last flight to
Phoenix. He said he took the flight because he figured that his
wife had already flown to Phoenix or had made other arrangements
when his plane did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very organized and resourceful,'' Sund said. ``My wife
has joked with me that if something should ever happen to her, I'd
be in big trouble, because she arranges everything. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sund said he was so sure that she made plans to meet him in
Phoenix, that he did not report her missing until after noon on
Wednesday, Feb. 17, after playing a round of golf.

DR. DAVID HAMILTON SMITH, HELPED DEVELOP MENINGITIS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., Ohio)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. David Hamilton Smith, co-developer of a vaccine that has
virtually eradicated childhood bacterial meningitis in the United
States, died of malignant melanoma Tuesday in his home in New York
City. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Smith was the chief of infectious diseases at Children's
Hospital Medical Center in Boston from 1960 to 1976. He was
chairman of the department of pediatrics and chief of the division
of pediatric infectious diseses at the University of Rochester,
N.Y., from 1978 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he and an associate, Dr. Porter W. Anderson, were
awarded the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for the
development of a vaccine against type B influenza, a bacterium that
in the mid-1980s was the most common cause of childhood bacterial
meningitis in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vaccine was developed, childhood bacterial meningitis
infected as many as 20,000 children in the United States each year.
It was one of the most dreaded childhood illnesses because of its
power to kill its victims quickly or leave them mentally retarded
or deaf. The vaccine has virtually eradicted the disease in the
United States and in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Smith was born in Canton, Ohio. He graduated from Ohio
Wesleyan University and the University of Rochester School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He was the founder of Praxis Biologics, which eventually became
Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He was a summer resident of Martha's Vineyard, where he was
instrumental in the preservation of the Polly Hill Arboretum, a
60-acre tract with more than 2,000 species of woody plants.
</P>
<P>
   He was the founder of the David H. Smith Foundation, which funds
conservation and scientific research. With the Nature Conservancy,
he created the David H. Smith Conservancy research fellowships to
support postdoctoral fellows in environemtal research. He was a
trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Joan; three daughters, Andrea of New York
City and Jennifer of Takoma Park, Md., and Rachel of New York City;
a brother, Richard of Delaware, Ohio; two stepdaughters, Jody
Leader of Brookline, Mass. and Kristin Leader of Rome; and five
granddaughters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After wearing glasses for 31 years, Debrah Ward jumped at a
chance last May to give them up. Instead of receiving laser
surgery, an alternative to contact lenses and eyeglasses, Ms. Ward
had clear polymer arcs implanted in her near-sighted right eye.
</P>
<P>
   The arcs, known as Intacs, are an experimental treatment made by
Keravision, a tiny California company. The arcs, which can be
inserted during a 10-minute procedure in an ophthalmologist's
office, flatten the cornea to correct mild nearsightedness, or
myopia, a condition that affects some 22 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had vision this good,'' said Ms. Ward, a 38-year-old
accountant in Olathe, Kan., who took part in the Intacs clinical
trials. Her eyesight improved from 20/20 with glasses to 20/10 with
the implants. ``It's nothing short of amazing,'' she said. ``I've
gone around and told all my friends about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Food and Drug Administration, as expected, approves
Intacs this spring, it will be the first surgical corneal implant
for vision correction to be sold in the United States. At the same
time, companies like Bausch &AMP; Lomb, the contact lens giant, and
Staar Surgical, a small California concern, are racing to develop
other types of eye implants, technologies that are similar to
Intacs and essentially are permanent contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Still other developments are under way. Presby Corp., a tiny
biotechnology company in Dallas, is developing a plastic implant
that would eliminate the need for reading glasses and bifocal
lenses. Early clinical trials are set to begin in the United States
next month. All these products, which could be available in the
next several years, are aimed at grabbing a share of the $11
billion Americans now spend each year for glasses and contact
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors and analysts are leery of predicting how popular
vision-corrective implants may become _ they will cost as much as
$2,500 an eye and they involve surgery _ their development is a
result of the recognition that many graying baby boomers are eager
to spend lots of money to turn back the effects of time.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement last year over Viagra, Pfizer Inc.'s impotency
pill, showed that there was an increasing demand among middle-aged
Americans for medical treatments that make their lives easier and
more fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Americans increasingly are willing to undergo cosmetic surgery,
the kind of procedure needed to wear optical implants. Americans
had 697,000 cosmetic operations in 1996, the latest year that
statistics are available, according to the American Society of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons _ a 71.6 percent increase from
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Loarie, Keravision's chief executive, says he expects
that many of his customers will be 38 to 42 years old, who have no
problem spending on cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This age group has more income,'' he said. ``They are not
afraid of trying something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts also say that Americans may snap up implants
because they increasingly are becoming frustrated with contact
lenses. After expanding for years, the contact-lens market in the
United States is barely growing. The number of annual replacement
soft contact-lens wearers, who account for 36 percent of the
market, declined 7.9 percent last year. The only boom in the market
is for daily disposable soft contacts, sales of which increased 44
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intacs should have a broad appeal,'' said Katherine
Martinelli, an analyst with S.G. Cowen Securities Corp. ``People
won't have to worry about cleaning or replacing them. One of the
keys is that the products are going to have to be able to work in
broad range of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the potential seen in implants comes with a number of
caveats.
</P>
<P>
   Given the manufacturers' small size _ Keravision had only
$835,000 in sales last year _ analysts are worried that the
companies lack the resources to make their products best sellers.
Even after an FDA advisory panel recommended Intacs for approval
last month, shares of Keravision, which is based in Fremont,
Calif., continue to trade below their July 1995 initial offering
price of $13.50. The shares closed Wednesday at $12.0625 in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Possible side effects and complications range from blurred
vision with Intacs to a slim risk of cataracts with the Staar
Surgical lens. The implants are expensive, costing some $5,000 for
surgery to both eyes. Only 2,000 people have Intacs worldwide,
leaving their long-term safety unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a casual procedure,'' said Ken Taylor, a vice
president at Arthur D. Little, a corporate consulting and research
firm. ``Eyesight is very precious to people. They are going to have
to be confident about the procedure and the product before they
will have it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the implant technology has been received favorably by
doctors. Made of a clear polymer that is used to correct cataracts,
Intacs are two arcs that are inserted surgically in the periphery
of the cornea. The arcs flatten the cornea to correct vision
primarily between 20/40 and 20/300, a treatment that could be used
by nearly one-third of the 70 million Americans who suffer from
myopia. The surgery takes about 10 minutes and requires a local
anesthesia administered through eyedrops.
</P>
<P>
   Insertion of Staar Surgical's intraocular contact lens, made of
a bendable polymer, takes about 20 minutes. Like Intacs, the lens
can be inserted in a ophthalmologist's office under local
anesthesia, but the procedure is slightly more invasive. The
contact lens fits just over the eye's natural lens behind the iris.
</P>
<P>
   Though several years away from market, Bausch &AMP; Lomb is
developing a lens that fits in front of the iris, a position that
doctors believe should reduce the risk of cataracts. The device has
two thin Z-shaped arms with tiny foot plates to help hold it in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say there is a slightly greater risk of infection from
the lens procedures, but their uses are far broader. Intacs
primarily correct mild nearsightedness, while the implanted lenses
have proved effective in early clinical trials as a remedy for a
greater range of myopia and farsightedness. With both procedures,
the implants can be easily removed. In the Intacs clinical trials,
when the lenses were removed, the patient's eyesight went back to
its uncorrected vision in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Yourdon, a 30-year-old registered nurse near Kansas
City, Kan., had Intacs implanted in her left eye two years ago as
part of the trial. She became frustrated when she realized that her
vision was not 20/20. When her doctor looked at her incision, he
realized that it had not healed properly. It took him 10 minutes to
remove the Intacs implant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My incision healed once the ring was out,'' said Ms. Yourdon,
who has worn Intacs in her right eye since 1994. ``My vision went
back to what it was before, and I decided to have a laser
procedure. Now I see fine. The only thing is that when you go into
corrective eye surgery, you want to know that you'll have perfect
vision when you come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Of the 410 people who were evaluated after a year in the Intacs
clinical trials, 98 percent achieved 20/40 vision or better, while
78 percent attained vision that was 20/20 or better. Especially
noteworthy was that 56 percent achieved 20/16 vision or better.
Even though the data were not conclusive enough for the FDA
advisory panel to allow Keravision to state that Intacs provided
better vision, the results still caught doctors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting better eyesight is a bonus with the rings,'' said Dr.
R. Doyle Stulting, a professor of ophthalmology at Emory University
in Atlanta who participated in the Intacs clinical trials.
``There's no guarantee that the rings will give you vision that is
better than what you had before with contacts or glasses. But when
people discover that there's something better out there, in this
case better than 20/20 vision, they'll want to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Staar Surgical also reported excellent results in early trials
of its lens. In the trials' first phase, 9 of 10 patients who had
been legally blind without glasses achieved 20/20 vision or better
after receiving an implanted lens. The company began the third
phase of the trials last fall on some 300 patients.
</P>
<P>
   But not all wearers of such implants may be thrilled with the
devices. Given the cost of the procedure, side effects, while
minor, may prove a deterrent. Roughly 4.8 percent of the people in
the third phase of the Intacs clinical studies experienced
difficulty with night vision, while 2.9 percent reported blurry
vision. Other side effects included seeing double images, glare,
halos and fluctuating distance vision.
</P>
<P>
   The Staar Surgical lens caused no notable side effects during
its early clinical trials. John R. Wolf, Staar Surgical's chairman,
acknowledges that there is a slim chance that the lenses may cause
cataracts as a complication from poorly performed surgery. A
spokeswoman for Staar Surgical, which is based in Monrovia, Calif.,
said that there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of cateracts
in the 7,000 lenses that had been installed worldwide so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Staar lens, since it tucked underneath the iris, the
patient is less likely to experience glare and halos,'' said Dr.
Sheri L. Rowen, director of the eye and cosmetic center at Mercy
Medical Center in Baltimore. ``But you have to be gentle installing
it. You don't want to move the lens around.''
</P>
<P>
   Further reducing the allure of implants, patients still may need
glasses following the procedure. ``Eventually, 100 percent of all
people need reading glasses,'' said Dr. Penny A. Asbell, a
professor of opthamology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
Manhattan who participated in the Intacs clinical trials. ``A
nearsighted person who gets Intacs will also need them. There's no
surgical procedure yet that can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also share analysts' concerns about the small size of
Staar Surgical and Keravision, the leading implant companies. Staar
Surgical had sales last year of some $54.5 million compared with
Bausch &AMP; Lomb's $2.36 billion in sales and Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
$23.6 billion. Keravision's finances are especially precarious. The
company, which has yet to post a profit in its 13-year history,
gets the majority of its financing from bond and stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of Staar Surgical and Keravision, analysts have
speculated that either company could be acquired by a contact lens
giant, like Johnson &AMP; Johnson or Bausch &AMP; Lomb. Several analysts
and doctors said they would applaud such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question here really is execution,'' Ms. Martinelli,
the Cowen Securities analyst, said. ``It's great technology, hands
down. But great technology does not always mean great sales.''

CLINTON MUM ON LATEST ASSAULT ALLEGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Clinton-Questions)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, still struggling to break free
from the aura of scandal, refused to comment Wednesday on an
Arkansas woman's allegations that he sexually assaulted her when he
was state attorney general in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned for the first time since Juanita Broddrick went
public with her story, Clinton said he had ``nothing to add'' to a
statement last week from his personal attorney, David E. Kendall.
The lawyer had called Broddrick's allegations ``absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   With his presidency still reeling from a yearlong sex scandal
and his impeachment, Clinton was forced to field questions at a
joint news conference with Ghanian President Jerry Rawlings about
some of the fallout, including the inability of some Republicans to
trust him and whether he thought the independent counsel law should
be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   But he also spent much of the time dealing with such
foreign-policy questions as US relations with Africa, including
Ghana's offer of dual citizenship for African-Americans, possible
US military action in Kosovo, and the continuing conflict with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In one of several surprising moments during the news conference,
which was far livelier and less formal than others Clinton has held
with foreign leaders, an African journalist said that based on the
questions from US reporters, Africa obviously does not play a major
role in the mindset of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the journalist not to take it personally. ``It's
really my fault, because I don't let them ask me enough questions
on other occasions, so I'm forcing them to use this opportunity to
pepper me,'' Clinton said. ``I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings said he had been briefed on the possiblity that most of
the questions would relate to ``American domestic situations and
not the fact that I'm here from Africa,'' a point that made Clinton
stiffen, suggesting he would have preferred Rawlings had kept that
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that ``nerves are still raw'' in the
aftermath of the impeachment process, which he said may account for
GOP congressional leaders' reluctance to say they trust him enough
to do business with him.
</P>
<P>
   After filing out of a White House meeting with Clinton Tuesday,
both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who had said just after the
impeachment trial that Clinton could not be trusted, and House
Speaker Dennis Hastert refused to directly answer when asked
whether they trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any answer they give makes it more difficult for them,
potentially at least, within their caucus or within the country,
depending on what answer they give,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
``Their feelings are not important here, just like my feelings are
not important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that last year he was able to work with the GOP
majority to pass a balanced budget and legislation to begin hiring
100,000 new teachers. ``It would be hard to imagine a year that was
more strained than last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we focus on the American people and doing our duty, and not
on whether we're mad or happy, disappointed or elated about the
events of the last year, then all this in the course of time will
work itself out, and the American system will be validated,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On renewing the independent counsel law, which expires this
summer, Clinton refused to say where he stood before White House
attorneys testify next week before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some ideas about it. But I think it would be better for
me at this time to say less so that others can say more,'' he said.
The president added that he didn't want his opinions about the law
to ``in effect, cast a shadow or illuminate what others might wish
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emphasis on impeachment and scandal, foreign policy
dominated Clinton's second meeting with reporters since he was
acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The president defended his decision to agree to extend the
deadline in the Kosovo peace talks, saying it was the ``right thing
to do'' if that was the wish of the parties involved. He also
justified his decision to consider sending up to 4,000 US troops as
part of a NATO peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the United States have an immediate, selfish interest in
what happens on some lonely road in Kosovo to some poor farm family
driving a wagon with horses that are underfed because they haven't
been able to get food? No,'' he said. ``But the United States does
have a direct interest in whether there is instability in the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, Clinton said he hoped the United Nations weapons
inspectors could ultimately resume their work, despite frequent
sqirmishes between the Iraqis and US and British forces in the
no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying obviously for the symbolic victory of shooting
one of these planes down and perhaps trying to intimidate us from
enforcing the no-fly zone, which we're still bound to do,'' Clinton
said. Saying the attacks were ``little encounters,'' he said he
wished Iraq would stop provoking them.
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed to endorse the idea of a bill the Ghanian
parliament is expected to pass that would grant black Americans
dual citizenship in Ghana, eliminating the need to apply for visas
and giving them freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked ``I don't qualify.'' But, he said he ``thought it
was quite a clever idea.''

MEXICAN DRUG GROUPS POSE GRAVE THREAT TO U.S., DEA CHIEF TELLS
SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
Thomas Constantine, warned Wednesday that Mexican drug trafficking
organizations pose the worst criminal threat to the United States
that he has seen in nearly 40 years in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking days before the Clinton administration deadline for
certifying that Mexico is cooperating in drug-fighting efforts,
Constantine sketched a bleak picture in testimony before the Senate
Caucus on International Narcotics Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the American organized crime leaders, organized crime
figures in Mexico have at their disposal an army of personnel, an
arsenal of weapons and the finest technology that money can buy,''
Constantine said. ``They literally run transportation and financial
empires, and an insight into how they conduct their day-to-day
business leads even the casual observer to the conclusion that the
United States is facing a threat of unprecedented proportions and
gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the administration on the brink of declaring that
Mexico deserves certification, he did not address the central
question of the level of official cooperation that Mexico has
offered to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department must submit an annual report to Congress by
Monday that lists which countries have failed to cooperate in
fighting drugs. Clinton said last week on a brief visit to Mexico
that it should not be penalized for ``having the courage to
confront its problems'' with illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, some senators who last year objected to seeing
Mexico certified found in Constantine's testimony fresh ammunition
for another challenge in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My purpose here is not to bash Mexico,'' said the chairman of
the caucus, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. ``But the problem is too
serious to ignore.``
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Constantine sidestepped a question about whether Mexico deserved
to be certified, talking instead about its decline in drug
seizures, its pervasive corruption and its failure to extradite any
Mexicans sought by the United States in connection with
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials sought to play down any
differences over Constantine's bleak assessment, which drew heavily
from reports by the DEA agents in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factually there's very little difference between any of us,''
said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House director of national
drug policy, who supports certifying Mexico. McCaffrey said U.S.
and Mexican officials agreed that drug-related crime in Mexico had
grown rapidly and become more violent and that its administration
of justice was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to protect the American people, you've got to work
with Mexico for the next 15 years,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Beers, the assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics and law-enforcement affairs, who also testified at the
hearing, said Constantine had been careful to distinguish between
the government and organized crime. ``He was not saying it was the
Mexican government that engaged in drug trafficking,'' Beers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Constantine made clear that Mexico had yet to staunch the
flow of cocaine, heroin and marijuana across its U.S. border. He
stressed that almost no traffickers of significance had been
arrested and or extradited.
</P>
<P>
   When his agency asked Mexico to help capture one trafficker,
Constantine said, officials replied, ``It would be difficult to
apprehend this individual, because he was too dangerous to pursue,
due to the number of bodyguards and corrupt law-enforcement
officials he employs.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine described a corruption so widespread that even
sensitive information shared with elite anti-drug units reached
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the unparalleled levels of corruption within
Mexican law-enforcement agencies with whom we must work to insure
that these individuals are brought to justice, our job is made that
much more difficult,'' Constantine said. ``Until we can work with
our law-enforcement counterparts in a relationship that is free
from suspicion, the burden to bring the drug lords before a jury of
their victims' peers will remain largely ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The failures listed by Constantine led Grassley to ask what
Mexico would have to do to be refused recognition as an ally in the
war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Beers referred to Colombia, which was denied certification after
President Ernesto Samper had been accused of taking drug money for
his re-election campaign. By contrast, Beers said, Mexico had made
``significant progress'' since President Ernesto Zedillo took
office in December 1994.

WILLARD ESPY, WHO DELIGHTED IN WORDPLAY, IS DEAD AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., France, Cuba)   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Willard R. Espy, who had such a winsome way with
words, such an elegant ear for rhyme and such a sure sense of the
absurd that he once began a poem with the words ``I do not roister
with an oyster,'' died on Saturday at New York Hospital. He was 88
and had elevated wordplay to a career, as the author of more than a
dozen informative books on words.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that Espy attached uncommon importance to words would
hardly do justice to a man who attributed a brief early marriage to
a woman named Ann Hathaway to a youthful yearning to become a poet
worthy of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to wonder what masterpieces he might have
produced if his wife had not promptly run off with a former
boyfriend, Espy did not give up his ambition altogether, merely
trimmed it a bit and with such flair that his outpouring of light
verse has been compared favorably to that of Lewis Carroll, W.S.
Gilbert, Ogden Nash and Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate punster who collected clerihews, dabbled in double
dactyls, limned lipograms, mixed macaronics and exulted in
anagrams, homonyms, oxymorons, palindromes and spoonerisms, Espy
could not help himself. It wasn't so much that he had a way with
words as that words had their way with him, or as he once put it,
``words choose their lovers arbitrarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Espy, a native of Olympia, Wash., who grew up in
Oysterville, a little coastal town founded by his grandfather in
southwest Washington, was both willingly seduced and well primed.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's family, he once observed, was a ``scribacious
lot,'' and his father, a onetime state senator, spoke in such long,
complicated and ultimately syntactically perfect sentences that
Espy was hooked early on the possibilities of language.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, before he found his true calling his life took a
long detour. A 1930 graduate of the University of Redlands in
California, he spent a heady year abroad, among other things
working as a male model in Paris and enrolling at the Sorbonne,
ostensibly to study philosophy but actually, he later conceded, to
conduct ``an extensive research project on girls,'' the results of
which led eventually to a thesis of sorts:
</P>
<P>
   I love the girls who don't.
</P>
<P>
   I love the girls who do;
</P>
<P>
   But best, the girls who say, `I don't . . .
</P>
<P>
   But maybe just for you.'
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States, he worked as a reporter for a
small newspaper in California, then worked for a short-lived
magazine in New York and a Cuban wire service before joining The
Reader's Digest in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually became the magazine's promotion director, a job
that entailed interviewing prominent people like Winston Churchill
and Albert Einstein for a cover essay in which the subjects were
invariably lured to say something nice about the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting the magazine in 1957, about the time his second
marriage ended in divorce, he worked in advertising and promotion
in New York until a fateful day in the late 1960s when he was
basking on the beach in East Hampton and began dreaming up
anagramic mystery ditties in which the reader was to fill in a
series of blanks with different words produced from a single group
of letters, for example, a, d, e, i, p, r and s in this one:
</P>
<P>
   When I ___ to be a father,
</P>
<P>
   You ___ my willingness to bother.
</P>
<P>
   Now you ___ ; you never knew
</P>
<P>
   I'd leave the ___ to you.
</P>
<P>
   The words are aspired, praised, despair and diapers)
</P>
<P>
   When he submitted the verse to Punch, the British weekly humor
magazine, the editors were so delighted they asked him to compose a
similar rhyme for every issue. He did for about two years before
his first collection, ``The Game of Words,'' was published in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   From then on Espy wrote like a man possessed, turning out nearly
a book a year, among them ``An Almanac of Words at Play'' (1975),
``O Thou Improper, Thou Uncommon Noun'' (1978), ``Say It My Way''
(1980) ``Have a Word on Me'' (1981), ``The Garden of Eloquence: A
Rhetorical Bestiary'' (1983) and ``Words to Rhyme With'' (1985), an
acclaimed rhyming dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he also turned out an autobiography,
``Oysterville: Roads to Grandpa's Village,'' and a guide to the
pronunciation of obscure Washington State place names ``Omak Me
Yours Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy is survived by his wife, Louise Manheim Espy; a son from
his first marriage, Ian Alden of Sarasota, Fla.; four daughters
from his second marriage, Mona Schreiber of Seattle, Freddy M.
Plimpton of Bridgehampton, N.Y., Joanna P. Espy of Manhattan and
Cassin E. Speziala of Cold Spring, N.Y.; two stepchildren, Dr.
Jonathan House and Penny House, both of Manhattan; a sister, Dale
Little of Oysterville, seven grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.

REPORT CITES INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IN LONDON POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Metropolitan Police, whose friendly London
``bobby'' made it one of the most recognizable police forces in the
world, is institutionally racist, according to a British government
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the most comprehensive examination of race relations in
Britain in nearly 20 years, Sir William Macpherson, a retired
judge, concluded that the London police force is riven with
``pernicious and institutionalized racism,'' and that racism among
the police reflects a problem in the wider society.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair responded to the
800-page report by announcing a radical overhaul of the country's
racial discrimination laws, saying they would now apply to the
police and all government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A solemn Blair told the House of Commons Wednesday that the
report on racism was ``an important moment in the life of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still
exists in our society,'' Blair told lawmakers. ``It is a moment to
learn, to reflect and to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned after police botched the investigation
into the 1993 racially motivated murder of a black teenager,
Stephen Lawrence, has put pressure on Sir Paul Condon, the
Metropolitan Police chief, to resign. But Condon, whose seven-year
term expires in January, said he will not step down and the British
government issued a vote of confidence in him after the report was
released.
</P>
<P>
   According to British government sources, Condon saved his job by
accepting the findings of Macpherson's report, and especially by
accepting the sweeping new definition of institutional racism
issued by Macpherson.
</P>
<P>
   He defines it as ``the collective failure of an organization to
provide an appropriate and professional service to people because
of their colour, culture and ethnic origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Macpherson's report is a scathing indictment of not only the
police but all those in Britain who have ignored or tolerated
racism.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where more than 20 percent of the residents are
minorities, only 2 percent of the police force is. Minorities make
up more than 5 percent of the population in all of Britain, but
less than 2 percent of all police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Lawrence, 18, has put police under scrutiny like
never before. But it has also touched off a wider national debate
about racism, and now brought about major reform.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, who are natives
of Jamaica, gave the report a guarded welcome, though they said
they were disappointed it had not called for the prosecution of
five suspects in their son's murder for perjury. Three of the
suspects were acquitted in a civil prosecution brought by the
Lawrences, but the report calls for allowing even those acquitted
of crimes to be tried again if new compelling evidence emerges.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrences, who watched from the visitors' gallery in
Parliament as Home Secretary Jack Straw announced a series of
reforms, said they were heartened that Macpherson had declared that
institutional racism was a major problem in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, a lot of people are aware of the
situation,'' Neville Lawrence said at a news conference, urging
people to ``try and do some good in the name of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone and sweeping conclusions of Macpherson's report
surprised even civil rights campaigners who have long complained
that the British establishment is in denial about the extent of
racism in their country. When he was a High Court justice,
Macpherson had a reputation for being a conservative and part of
the very establishment he was asked to critique. Lawrence's parents
initially complained about his appointment to review the police.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticized Macpherson's report as being too sweeping in its
conclusions and more aimed at being sensitive to grievances of
minorities than providing realistic solutions to complex social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Broughton, chairman of the police federation of England and
Wales, which represents rank and file police officers, said he does
not believe the Metropolitan Police is institutionally racist and
called Macpherson's report ``grossly unfair.'' He said the charge
of racism is being thrown around carelessly.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that some officers investigating the Lawrence
murder may have been insensitive to the victim's family, but added,
``There can be no justification for a blanket allegation that the
police did not care about this murder because the victim was
black.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrences, whose dignity and tenacity in demanding justice
has impressed many Britons, have repeatedly called for Condon to
step down, saying someone has to be accountable for the
incompetence and racial insensitivity by police that allowed their
son's killers to escape prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Straw, who is in charge of law enforcement, Wednesday backed
Condon as the ideal person to implement the 70 recommendations to
improve policing made in Macpherson's report. Straw ordered that
all unsolved murder cases in London be reopened. Some of those
murders are thought to be racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Condon accepted the findings, including
the new definition of institutional racism. He had previously
denied steadfastly that his force was institutionally racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Met feel a sense of shame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condon received bipartisan support in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hunt for scapegoats will help no one,'' said the opposition
leader, William Hague.
</P>
<P>
   While resigning from governmental posts for the errors of
subordinates has a long tradition in Britain, Condon said morale
within the force would collapse if he allowed himself to become a
scapegoat for the botched investigation and the bitterness it has
provoked among minorities. He said he made combating racism one of
his top priorities, devoted his first speech as chief to the
subject, and has doubled the number of minority officers on the Met
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Grant, one of the few blacks in Parliament, said the
report was a wakeup call for white Britons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last chance for British society to tackle
racism,'' he said, suggesting that failing to do so could
eventually lead to a repeat of the 1981 riots in Brixton, a black
section of London.

 &HT;    Georgia football coach offered $500,000 `longevity incentive'
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Spring practice is weeks away at Georgia, but the
football program is generating news away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Donnan has been approved for an $100,000-a-year salary
increase _ but he only gets the money if he stays at Georgia for
five more seasons. If he is still the Bulldogs' coach in December
2003, he'll receive a lump-sum payment of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ticket prices will be raised to $27 for all games. Last
season, tickets were $22 or $25, depending on the opponent, and the
increase is expected to generate more than $2 million a year in
additional revenue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia will expand the SkySuites at Sanford Stadium, which
could generate another $1.14 million annually. Twenty-two skyboxes
will be added to the existing 30 boxes and will be available for
occupancy in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were approved by the university's athletic board
meeting Tuesday. Donnan, who received a $295,000 raise in January,
1998, has five years remaining on a contract that currently pays
him $650,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The university will invest $100,000 a year for five years on
Donnan's behalf through the UGA Foundation and the coach can
collect the money, with interest, if he is still coaching Georgia
in 2003. Should Donnan leave, he would have to pay $300,000, the
amount of the buyout clause in his contract, and the invested money
would be returned to the athletic association.
</P>
<P>
   With the annuity figures included in his salary, Donnan ranks
among the top one-third of coaches in the SEC in compensation.
Florida's Steve Spurrier is the league's highest-paid coach at $2
million per year while Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer earns $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was to let Coach Donnan know that we like what he is
doing and we want him to be our coach for a long time,'' Georgia
athletics director Vince Dooley said Wednesday. ``It's a longevity
incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley added that he plans to recommend an ``increase in
base-salary compensation'' for Donnan at the board's annual spring
meeting in St. Simons. Donnan, who has led Georgia to 19 victories
the past two seasons, turned down an $850,000 annual salary and a
$1 million annuity package from North Carolina in 1997 to remain at
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the university supporting our program and me and
I intend on being here for a long time,'' Donnan said.

 &HT;    Falcons' wish list includes Ambrose
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons are interested in former All-Pro
cornerback Ashley Ambrose, one of the top unrestricted free agents
at his position.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, 28, was to visit Atlanta Wednesday, but team officials
postponed their meeting with the former Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons want to re-sign free agent corner Ronnie Bradford,
but they probably would not, and could not, sign both him and
Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan will count $3 million against next
year's salary cap, and Michael Booker $1.62 million, with $1
million guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Ambrose was a second-round choice of
the Colts in 1992 and would command money similar to that of
Buchanan, his close friend and Colt teammate from 1993-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to come (Wednesday), but they want to do it
later,'' Ambrose said from Houston. ``I would be the happiest guy
in the world ... but I'm not going to cheat myself to play with
Ray. I see the money guys are getting, like Carlton Gray,'' who got
a five-year, $17 million contract with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons would have to backload a contract for Ambrose, as
the Chiefs did with Gray. If, for example, Atlanta gave Ambrose a
four-year contract with a $2.5 million signing bonus, (like Gray's,
and the minimum $400,000 salary this season, his cap charge would
be $1.025 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a long-term deal, I wouldn't care if it was
backloaded,'' said Ambrose, who had 40 total tackles, 15 passes
defensed and two interceptions last season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was All-Pro with 57 total tackles, eight
interceptions and 20 passes defensed while playing for current
Atlanta secondary coach Ron Meeks. In 1997, he had 59 total
tackles, three interceptions and 28 passes defensed.
</P>
<P>
   If Ambrose signed with Atlanta, it might precipitate the move of
Booker, the team's 1997 first-round draft choice, to safety.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Chris Calloway, who led the Giants in receptions
twice while playing for Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, visited the
Redskins Wednesday, and will visit the Falcons today. ... Buchanan
had an MRI on his right shoulder and will have arthroscopic surgery
to repair a ligament partially torn from his rotator cuff during
the season.

 &HT;    Tiger takes win in first round of championship
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ His frustration became typified at LaCosta's
par-3 14th Wednesday. Heading into his downswing, a cell phone went
off at the tee box. Nick Faldo flinched and yanked his tee shot
into a eucalyptus tree, the ball falling about 80 yards from its
starting place.
</P>
<P>
   Finally at the green, standing over a 2-footer for bogey that
somehow halved the hole and temporarily delay his first-round loss
to Tiger Woods, Faldo became irritated by an ABC-TV cameraman who
approached from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, am I in your way?'' Faldo asked sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo (No. 64), of course, is no longer in the way of Woods (No.
1) in the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship. On a day of
great first-round upsets in the $5 million tournament _ Ernie Els,
Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara, Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood _
the sure thing held up. Playing decently but not spectacularly,
Woods won 4 and 3 over the guy who won the Masters 12 months before
he did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Had Faldo not scrambled for a few key up-and-downs early, the
match might have been over in proximity for Woods to grab a
clubhouse cheeseburger. He was 3-up at the turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, comfortable,'' said Tiger's mom, Kultida, at the 14th
hole, ``but you never know in match play.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom already wanted to know what David Duval was doing, hoping
for an eventual final against her son (he won 2 and 1 over
Australia's Stephen Leaney). Later, Tiger would offer respectful
comments for Faldo, who hits too many loose shots and unstable
putts these days to really scare anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a lot of good shots at crucial times in the match,''
Woods said. ``I was just able to hang in there and beat a great
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   After firing his approach to a foot at the 10th hole _ inside of
Faldo _ Woods moved in for the kill with birdies at the 12th and
13th. It ended at the 15th after Faldo bunkered his approach, came
out short, then rammed a desperation chip by the hole. With Woods
facing an easy two-putt for par, Faldo conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Woods faces Bob Tway, who beat Tom Watson 6 and 4, in today's
second round. Woods said he felt ``relieved ... It's always good to
get one match under your belt and get fired up about the next
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his game face firmly at the start, Woods immediately
jumped on Faldo with a 310-yard drive rocketed into the turquoise
sky on a perfect Southern California day. When Faldo pushed his
drive into the right fairway bunker, the mood had been established.
</P>
<P>
   From the gallery a cruel fellow said loudly, ``Ask for strokes,
Nick.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Group pays $975,000 for Atlanta Olympic chief's memorabilia
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne was paid $975,000
for his personal collection of Olympic memorabilia by the nonprofit
sports foundation that succeeded the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games and which he co-chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's collection includes a commemorative torch he carried in
Greece, the first Centennial Olympic Park brick and correspondence
with heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Payne received the payment two years ago from the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, an organization he founded in 1987 to
bid for the Olympic Games and which remains in existence to carry
on the Olympic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The money from GAAF, in part, paid off Payne's personal debt
accumulated during the years he volunteered for the Atlanta bid
effort. GAAF held that $606,000 loan on its books, and Payne paid
it off with the cash he got for his collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to give me the money to satisfy my personal loan,
but I wouldn't accept the money without giving something back,''
Payne said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   GAAF President Ralph Jernigan Jr. said Wednesday that the
foundation, whose board of directors is the original volunteer bid
team assembled by Payne, offered several times to pay off Payne's
personal loan with revenue left over from the roughly $12 million
in private funds raised during the 1987-90 bid effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy had run up a substantial debt during that period of
time,'' said Jernigan, a sports marketing consultant who has headed
GAAF since its inception. ``After the announcement in Tokyo (when
Atlanta won the right to host the 1996 Games), we tried to
reimburse Billy for his expenses, roughly $750,000. I had a check
cut, but he wouldn't take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne paid back part of the loan in 1993. GAAF then assumed the
debt from the original lender, who has been identified only as a
friend of Payne's.
</P>
<P>
   After three years working with no salary, Payne was paid
handsomely as chief executive of ACOG. His salary when the
organization was incorporated in 1991 was $519,000. In 1996,
Payne's last full year at ACOG's helm, he was paid $767,000,
according to federal tax returns. That amount was one of the
highest salaries in the country for a chief executive of a
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Payne's financial dealings with GAAF emerged as
Atlanta's Olympic effort is being scrutinized amid an Olympic
influence-peddling scandal of global proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The financial records of GAAF and ACOG indicate the interlocking
relationship between the two organizations, both founded and led by
Payne and several close friends. Payne co-chairs GAAF with former
Mayor Andrew Young. A former top executive at ACOG, Linda
Stephenson, is part-time executive director of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG will officially dissolve this summer, but GAAF will remain
to plan for an Atlanta Olympic museum, fund youth sports and help
coordinate an Atlanta Community Olympic Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   In spring of 1996, ACOG's board of directors turned over
responsibility for mountains of historic memorabilia and documents
to GAAF. Payne's personal collection was not included, according to
Jernigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was stuff he mainly kept in his house,'' Jernigan said.
``Billy was very careful after we won the bid to be sure his
personal gifts were kept separate from gifts for the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the foundation was to make the materials
not kept by Payne available to the public and would explore a
long-term plan for the collection's permanent home. To that end,
GAAF entered into a five-year agreement with the History Center in
1997 to archive the materials and to host exhibitions and Olympic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's private collection was valued by an independent
appraiser and is carried on GAAF's books as an asset worth $1.503
million, according to Jernigan. The $528,000 in value above what
was paid to Payne is identified on GAAF's books as a contribution
to the foundation, which would allow Payne a tax write-off.
</P>
<P>
   No other ACOG executives were paid for their papers, photos and
mementoes, but they concur that Payne's compensation was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an absolutely right thing to do,'' said A.D. Frazier
Jr., ACOG's chief operating officer. ``Billy sat on that debt for
years. He was sitting there with it at the end of the Games. This
isn't bonuses. It is about repaying loans. This was a proper way of
getting it done, at a fair value and something Billy would accept.
He was giving something of considerable value for what he was
getting in return.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: ETHNIC ALBANIANS THROW MONKEYWRENCH INTO U.S.
PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO, KOSOVO-CLINTON, KOSOVO-CHINA) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Clinton administration appears to have walked into
the Kosovo peace talks without a clear idea of what to do if the
ethnic Albanians failed to follow the script that had been written
for them.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations driven largely by the West's desire to stop
bloodshed in Europe and especially to stop it before NATO
celebrated its 50th anniversary, the administration expected the
ethnic Albanians, including their guerrillas, to accept the
insertion of NATO troops as their protectors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the administration calculated, the spotlight would turn on
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, and the threat of NATO
air strikes would force him to sign an agreement giving Kosovo, now
a province of Serbia, three years of self-government.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't turn out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose aides suggest she
is mindful of the success of special envoy Richard C. Holbrooke in
ending the war in Bosnia at Dayton, Ohio, hoped to enhance her
prestige with a similar victory at the Kosovo negotiations in
Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to embrace the ethnic Albanians, but they refused to
embrace her. She left the negotiations with a messy end and,
administration officials acknowledged, a significant loss of
impetus in solving the conflict. If left unchecked, Kosovo's war
could not only yield more harrowing scenes of massacres and
refugees, but mar the NATO anniversary party in Washington in April
and even spread to other parts of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   It remains uncertain whether the ethnic Albanians, who proved to
be so unpredictable during the 17 days of talks, will come back as
they promised in two weeks with a signed peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had counted on a successful resolution of the
war involving NATO: Either the alliance would inject its ground
troops as peacekeepers, or its planes and missiles would bombard
and destroy the defense forces of Milosevic. Either way, it was
hoped, Kosovo would be a showcase of what NATO could do after the
Cold War, rather than an example of what it cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   The failure at Rambouillet, the town 30 miles south of Paris
where the Serbs and the Albanians were cloistered, has pushed the
next attempt to solve the Kosovo problem much closer to the NATO
anniversary. By the time the talks resume, on March 15, three
former Soviet bloc nations _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
_ will have joined the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the potency of the threat of NATO air strikes
that were supposed to bring Milosevic to closure has, for now, been
largely frittered away.
</P>
<P>
   During the next three weeks, administration officials say, they
will have to work overtime to rebuild a consensus on air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's NATO partners, notably France, the hosts of
the Rambouillet conference, are much less enthusiastic about
bombing Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest upset at Rambouillet was the behavior of the ethnic
Albanian delegation, a 16-man group composed of known quantities,
such as the elected leader and pacifist writer Ibrahim Rugova, and
unknown men such as the five members of the guerrilla force known
as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, a 29-year-old political science graduate and
leading insurgent, stubbornly insisted that the peace document
contain a clause calling for a referendum. Given that ethnic
Albanians make up an estimated 90 percent of Kosovo's two million
people, such a referendum after three years of autonomy would
almost certainly grant Kosovo the independence from Serbia that the
guerrillas have sought.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum is anathema to Milosevic, and not favored by the
West, either.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegates have now pledged that after
selling the peace accord among the population at home, they would
sign it. Administration officials said they believed the idea of
peace was a popular one and that logic would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, Rugova's influential political party and a third
Kosovo movement announced on Wednesday upon returning home that
they would form a joint provisional government _ apparently a step
that would help sell the accord.
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means clear that all guerrilla commanders would
go along. Another obstacle to a guaranteed yes is Adem Demaci, 63,
self-styled political spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, who
refused to attend the Rambouillet talks. He has strongly criticized
the agreement and on Wednesday night said the announced new
provisional agreement has no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci was a political prisoner for 28 years in Yugoslavia. He
is a diehard supporter of Kosovo's independence but strongly
opposed to any deal with the Serbs. On Monday night, when the talks
were at their nadir, he received phone calls from Albright and
Former Sen. Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Both asked him to support the agreement. According to an
interview with Demaci published on Wednesday in a Kosovo Albanian
newspaper, he told them that the problems of Kosovo could not be
solved in a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   For Albright, the failure to get an agreement was, apparently, a
major disappointment. Without her presence, her supporters argue,
the outcome would have been worse. She hung in for three days,
trying every angle on the ethnic Albanians, including the call to
Demaci.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But she walked into unknown territory. Her strategists appear to
have misread the Kosovo Liberation Army, a recently formed, largely
mysterious group of insurgents who are barely known to diplomats.
Other guerrilla groups that have been dealt with over the years,
like the Viet Cong, were more of a known quantity.
</P>
<P>
   And Albright did not have the built-in advantage that Holbrooke
enjoyed at the talks in Dayton, Ohio, where the Americans
controlled the operation.
</P>
<P>
   At Rambouillet, the dynamics were diffuse. There were three
negotiators _ the American ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher
Hill, Austrian Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch representing the
European Union, and a Russian ambassador, Boris Mayorskiy. Further,
the French government controlled the ground rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, for example, wanted NATO military officials in
uniform present at the conference as a confidence-building measure
for the ethnic Albanians. The French government, according to
American officials, forbade this.
</P>
<P>
   At Dayton, all the leading protagonists were present and were
kept sequestered until they agreed. At Rambouillet, Milosevic and
Demaci were missing, and the French allowed two outside excursions.
One of them was probably fatal.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, went back to
Belgrade to talk to his mentor, Milosevic, and returned. Then, last
Friday, Thaci went off to meet Demaci in Ljubljana, capital of the
former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   It was after Thaci returned to Rambouillet from seeing his
mentor that his demeanor became clearer and tougher. And that was
when Albright encountered him for her first serious, ultimately
fruitless effort to convince him to sign an immediate peace deal.  &QL;

REPORT DETAILS FATE OF FAMILIES FORCED OFF WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In its first look at how families are faring who have
been forced off the welfare rolls in the last three months, the
state said Wednesday that most are working, at jobs that pay an
average of $200 a month more than what they got from welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are not working, the report says, are generally either
receiving child support, have shifted to federal disability
assistance programs or have moved in with other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time limits,'' said Transitional Assistance Commissioner
Claire McIntire, ``have obviously had a positive influence in
encouraging welfare recipients to enter the workforce and begin the
road toward self-sufficiency for themselves and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor said the study shows that the jobs these
women are finding are insufficient to lift their families out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transitional Assistance studied 444 of the
1,500 families who have been cut from the rolls over the last three
months under new welfare rules that limit benefits to two years.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not address another 3,600 families who have
reached the time limit but have applied for extensions. Their cases
are still being decided.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that 75 percent of the 444 former recipients
are working. Most of those working had already held low-paying jobs
while on welfare; 28 percent did not get jobs until their welfare
benefits ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The working parents are earning on average $772 a month, more
than the $565 monthly welfare grant that a family of three
receives. Childcare is free to families in their first year off
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Harris, an attorney specializing in welfare issues at
the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, believes the study's
findings are nothing to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' average earnings will amount to less than $9300 a
year, which, Harris noted, will be far below the federal poverty
level of $13,650 for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 1996 law overhauling the welfare system
originally sought to create an incentive for parents to work by
allowing them to receive partial welfare grants to supplement low
wages. For example, a single parent with two children earning $772
a month would still be eligible for a supplemental welfare grant of
$239.
</P>
<P>
   DTA, however, decided the supplemental grants should not be
available to anyone who reached the two-year limit on benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual,'' Harris said, ``the administration is trumpeting
success without bothering to look at the real facts. The fact is
desperately poor families are losing the partial grants that allows
them to survive on low wages. They were poor before and they are
poor now.''
</P>
<P>
   The DTA gathered its information on 444 randomly selected
families through telephone surveys, home visits and review of the
department's case files.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 percent of the group who are not working, seven
percent are receiving child support, five percent are receiving
cash assistance through other government programs such as Social
Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income and
six percent have moved in with someone else. Another seven percent
may have left the state, or no longer have children to support.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the latest in a series of statistical snapshots
that DTA has taken of families who have left the rolls since the
1996 welfare reform law went into effect. Earlier tracking studies
of families who left welfare on their own found that about half
found jobs that paid more than welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare reform is a work in progress,'' said DTA spokesman
Dick Powers. ``We continuously ahve to fine tune it and we can only
do that with accurate data.''
</P>
<P>
   The next study will focus on families who applied for extensions
of their benefits, but were denied.

TWO MFS MANAGERS LEAVE TO LAUNCH HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Chris Felipe and John Brennan, high-profile managers at
one of the hottest mutual fund companies, have resigned from MFS
Investment Management to launch their own private investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe, 40, managed the $6.3 billion Massachusetts Investors
Growth fund, which earned 40 percent last year and 48 percent in
1997. He also runs the $1 billion MFS Strategic Growth fund, ranked
as the second-best performing growth fund over the last three years
by Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 39, managed the highly rated $2.2 billion MFS Capital
Opportunities fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a very big deal,'' said Burton Greenwald, a
Philadelphia-based consultant who advises mutual fund companies.
``MFS has picked up extraordinary momentum. That's a reflection of
marketing and outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Felipe's funds invested in large growth stocks with a heavy
emphasis on leading technology issues like Microsoft Corp. and
Intel Corp. Brennan's fund tended to invest in a mix of stocks that
crossed investment categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``MFS was fantastic,'' Felipe said in an interview Wednesday.
``From my vantage point, I had accomplished what I wanted to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Brennan will form a ``hedge'' fund, a private investment
vehicle that caters to the wealthy and is not restricted by the
same rules that govern mutual funds. Hedge fund managers have more
freedom to invest in different investments and also to short
stocks, betting they will decline in price. Best of all: They are
rewarded with big payoffs in good years. Hedge fund managers
typically keep about 20 percent of fund profits, on top of a basic
annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe and Brennan said they were interested in managing a hedge
fund's investments and believed overvalued stocks would become an
opportunity instead of a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of overvaluation in different pockets of the
market,'' Brennan said Wednesday. ``I don't think the next 10 to 15
years will be as smooth a ride as we've had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   MFS has selected Stephen Pesek to manage Massachusetts Investors
Growth. Pesek has managed institutional portfolios at MFS and has
been running a similar large-stock growth fund. Pesek and Irfan
Ali, a software analyst, will team up to run MFS Strategic Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Maura Shaughnessy, manager of the MFS Utilities fund, was chosen
as Brennan's successor at MFS Capital Opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they were very good investors,'' MFS's chief executive,
Jeffrey Shames, said of Felipe and Brennan. ``We think we're
replacing them with very good investors who obviously aren't as
well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Felipe and Brennan each joined MFS straight out of business
school in the 1980s and rose from stock analysts to fund managers.
High-profile departures are rare at MFS, a subsidiary of Sun Life
Assurance Co. that has relatively low management turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Shames said the firm discussed ways to keep the pair, including
an arrangement so they could grow a hedge fund business at MFS, but
decided not to pursue them. ``We just felt it wasn't in the best
interest of the team approach at MFS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hot performance helped MFS attract net sales of $11.1 billion
last year, according to Financial Research Corp., a Boston firm.
That inflow was just behind the performance at local competitors
Putnam Investments and Fidelity Investments, which are much bigger
companies. Sales in 1998 increased the firm's assets by 25 percent,
triple Putnam's rate and about five times Fidelity's.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe's Massachusetts Investors Growth accounted for $2.3
billion of MFS's sales last year. His other fund and Brennan's
Capital Opportunities added about $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shames said early MFS sales figures for 1999 are substantially
ahead of last year. He doubted management changes alone would have
any impact on the individual funds' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're under scrutiny for the next three to nine months,''
Shames said. ``If there are dramatic slippages, you'll see sales
slow down. But as long as we deliver good performance, we don't
even think we'll notice.''

SHAYS-MEEHAN BILL TO BE REINTRODUCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It helped make Representative Martin T. Meehan a
darling of the public. It forced politicians to address the
trickiest of topics, and made ``campaign finance reform'' a
household phrase.
</P>
<P>
   But some three years after being unveiled in its original form,
Shays-Meehan, the legislation that would revolutionize the way
campaign contributions are made, remains in limbo. It still needs
to pass both houses of Congress. It still has a core of powerful
detractors.
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of a press conference _ being held Thursday by
co-authors Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Representative
Chris Shays, Republican of Connecticut _ to announce that the bill
will be introduced again, Speaker Dennis Hastert Wednesday
indicated that Republican leaders are still ready to stall it, as
they tried to do last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who controls which legislation is voted on, said he had
``talked to Shays, and we intend to see it on the agenda either
later this year or early next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added noncomittally: ``We have not set a date.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Republicans are ``so
focused on implementing the agenda, getting the budget moved
early'' that they have yet to address campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give any prediction about when that will occur,''
Armey said Wednesday. ``We've talked about it. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to pass the legislation has increased since last
year, its supporters said. Meehan insists that, in order for the
law to have an impact on the 2000 presidential race, it must be
implemented before next January, and hopefully within the next six
months _ well before Hastert intends to put it on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's greatest impact would be felt on so-called ``soft
money,'' banning the contributions to political parties that are
subsequently turned over to candidates. It would also place curbs
on the way special interest groups raise money for political
campaigns, and would create a roadmap for future reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long overdue, and we should pass it early on in the
session...We don't need a campaign finance reform bill passed too
late for 2000,'' Meehan said. ``Both parties continue to raise
unprecedented amounts of soft money. The special interest groups
are already planning campaign advertisements that masquerade as
issue ads...Unfortunately, the Republican leadership is unwilling
to make this a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith McGeehee, legislative director for Common Cause, a
public-interest organization that backs the bill, said there are
``three issues on the table _ timing, timing, timing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody acknowledges up on the Hill that there is a
majority, certainly in the House, and that, brought up under a fair
procedure, it will pass,'' McGeehee said. ``The question is, of
course, what will the Speaker do? Will he repeat his predecessor's
efforts to bury the bill and delay? Or will he let it come up
earlier? That's the $64,000 question.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan is prepared to circumvent Hastert, as he and Shays
circumvented former Speaker Newt Gingrich last time around, using a
parliamentary measure to force the House to a vote. The bill passed
in the House, 252-179, last August, with 61 Republican votes. It
was then blocked in the Senate, where Majority Leader Trent Lott
strongly opposed it. Although 52 senators were in favor of the law,
there were not the 60 Senate votes needed to bring it to the floor
for a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are signs the bill may move through the House
more swiftly than before, Meehan said. Some 110 members are
co-sponsoring the bill _ including 27 Republicans, among them
Representative Charles Bass of New Hampshire, who said he was
looking ``forward to participating in the fight for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it doesn't include every provision I support, it is a
step in the right direction and has the best chance of being signed
into law,'' Bass said earlier this year. At least three pieces of
legislation involving campaign finance issues are expected to be
introduced in the House this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for another House Republican, however,
``for anyone to say it's going to sail through is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see a process similar to last year,'' said Mike
Scanlon, spokesman for Majority Whip Tom Delay. ``It's going to be
an interesting navigation course that Mr. Shays and Mr. Meehan have
to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Meehan are gearing up, collecting support from both
sides of the aisle and preparing a discharge petition _ the piece
of paper they will need to file if they decide to bypass Hastert.
Wednesday, Meehan also met with Senator Russell Feingold, Democrat
of Wisconsin, who joined Senator John McCain, a Republican from
Arizona, in authoring the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert was preparing, too _ not for campaign finance but
for a host of other debates on agenda items, especially tax cuts
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, who has spoken with Hastert several times, said he has a
commitment the bill will eventually reach the floor. ``He's told me
that we will be voting on it this year, but the end of this year
would be too late,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan agreed. But according to John Feehery, a spokesman for
Hastert, the congressmen will simply have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not happen when Mr. Meehan wants it to happen,''
Feehery said, ``but there will be a vote on it.''

PIVOTAL MEETING UNCOVERED UNCLAIMED CHECK FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While former Massachusetts Treasurer Joseph D. Malone
defended Monday his management of the state's Treasury and Lottery,
it took the persistence of the head of a Boston heir finder's
company to provide guidelines on how the multimillion-dollar Unpaid
Check Fund was to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints by Kim S. Sawyer, president and general counsel of
Locator Services Group, about the fund's operation led to a pivotal
meeting with top Malone officials where, according to one, the fund
``came on our radar screen for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it had operated in the shadow the state's Abandoned
Property Fund, which was trumpeted annually in newspaper ads and
internet sites as Malone's way of returning millions of dollars
every year to those who had forgotten about bank accounts or stock
certificates that had long lay fallow in financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer was one of about dozen individuals and firms who had
operated as heir finders, locating money that individuals or firms
had been owed by an agency of state government and was part of the
state's Unpaid Check Fund. But there were no rules or regulations
to determine when Malone's office -- or John Trischitta, the Unpaid
Check Fund's sole manager -- should approve an application for
payment by an heir finder.
</P>
<P>
   Over the months, Sawyer said that her firm had not been paid for
85 claims on which she believed she had provided proper
documentation, such as power of attorney, to prove she represented
the company in getting the money it was due.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta did not attend the meeting but his boss, Deputy
Treasurer Robert E.Foley did and defended the Fund's operation. He
said any delay in approving Sawyer's applications _ and cutting the
checks to the firms _ were based on the need to be scrupulous in
proving it represented the company. ``It got into a `he said, she
said' but it was obvious there were larger issues involved that
needed to be addressed about authenticating claims, and I think we
did that,'' said one Malone official who attended the meeting but
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Foley issued a memo announcing that Marie M.
Lawlor, Malone's general counsel, had issued new procedures for
approval of claims submitted by heir finders. Not only would heir
finders have to present powers of attorney but they also needed to
provide a business card or letter and the company's taxpayer
identification to show they represented a corporate client. But no
more would heir finders have to wait months before knowing if their
claims had been approved or not - now such notification had to be
given in 30 days.

 &HT;    Isakson prepares for office, heads to Washington to be sworn in
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Johnny Isakson goes to Washington today, convinced
that bickering and finger-pointing will make representing his 6th
Congressional District harder, not easier.
</P>
<P>
   Happy but tired, Isakson spent the Wednesday after his election
saying his thank-you's, visiting the state Capitol, and tending to
the details of setting up an office and staff hundreds of miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   He was to board a 6:45 a.m. Delta flight to Washington for a
midmorning swearing-in ceremony, but will return later this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his campaign headquarters in Sandy Springs,
the Republican congressman-elect said voters can expect him to work
with Democrats and both wings of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be speaker of the House, but I'll have more
time to concentrate on my district,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson said the lesson in his 65 percent margin of victory is
that his constituents want a negotiator to free up federal funds to
protect the environment, unlock traffic and keep C-130Js rolling
out of Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson said he won't be the revolutionary in the mode of Newt
Gingrich, who stepped down as House speaker and vacated his seat
last month. ``Newt and I share the same principles and different
personalities,'' he said, and then quoted his working credo: ``To
seek consensus in the pursuit of conservative principles is no
vice.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson and his staff were anxious to see him sworn in quickly.
The election results haven't been certified, but Congress can allow
him to be seated via a vote of unanimous consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the kind of consensus builder who will not only be
beneficial to our state delegation, but the Congress as a whole,''
said U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal (R-Ga.), who served in the Legislature
with Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson's reputation for conciliation showed Wednesday, when he
was asked if he was irked at congressional Republicans, who on
election day were abandoning a 10 percent tax cut _ one of
Isakson's campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not upset with anybody,'' he said. ``I'll let you know
when I'm upset,'' he snapped when pressed.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal is lower taxes in general _ how that is
accomplished is immaterial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the tax issue, Isakson will focus on local issues
_ and the one at the forefront is getting metro Atlanta into
compliance with the federal Clean Air Act so it will be eligible
for federal transportation funds.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked to be on both the Education and the Workforce and
Transportation and Infrastructure committees, and seats have been
kept open for him.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson will do the homework on the bills and that will make him
effective, said U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) ``Johnny Isakson
reads the bills. When you know what you're talking about, a lot
more people will listen.

NRC TO CUT MOCK RAIDS ON ATOM PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission plans to weaken the program
that tests nuclear plant readiness for terrorist attacks even
though almost half of the tested plants did not repel the assaults,
according to a former Navy Seal who oversees the mock invasions.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC counterterrorism team found security problems at 27 of
the 57 nuclear plants at which they have staged mock assaults since
1991, including 14 where real invaders could have caused a nuclear
core meltdown. In New England, testers scaled fences undetected,
and they smuggled in a fake handgun at Vermont Yankee last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, amid nuclear industry complaints about the program, NRC
officials want to give reactor operators more control over the
drills. Under the new antiterrorism effort, plants would test
antiterrorism procedures more often, but with far fewer NRC
officials to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the nuclear industry nor the NRC senior staff appears
to be taking seriously the threat from terrorist attacks and
sabotage on commercial nuclear plants,'' Representative Edward J.
Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts said in a letter this week to the
NRC chairman, Shirley Ann Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has reversed a plan to phase out the antiterrorism
program to save money, after Markey objected in November. This
time, NRC officials say, the changes in the antiterrorism plan, are
aimed at safety rather than savings. By sending fewer inspectors to
each site, they say they can cover more ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have it my way, the licensees will test so often that we
won't even be able to get to a lot of the tests,'' said Dick
Rosano, the NRC's section chief for reactor safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has arisen as the Clinton administration has
requested an overall 12 percent increase in counterterrorism
spending next year, after attacks on US embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Although terrorists have struck just once at a US nuclear plant
_ sabotaging transmission wires at an Arizona reactor in the 1980s
_ plants have been threatened. Captain David Orrik, a retired Navy
Seal who runs the Operational Safeguards Response Evaluation
program, said the FBI had received a credible threat against a
plant this year.
</P>
<P>
   Orrik, mentioning Vermont Yankee, also said the nuclear industry
cannot be counted on to police itself, pointing to Vermont Yankee's
problems as proof. In a test of intruders' ability to sneak in
undetected, Orrik's team found six fences where monitors could not
see ladders.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Yankee officials said the test had helped them to
improve security. ``It was a challenge to our systems and we'll
continue to challenge our systems to make sure we maintain a high
level of preparedness,'' said Rob Williams, spokesman for the plant
in Vernon, Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Orrik's office runs two types of drills, one involving an open
attack bent on creating ``an American Chernobyl,'' the other by
intruders who try to sneak inside the plant undetected. The NRC
cited Vermont Yankee for two violations last year under testing for
surreptitious entry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the open attacks, plant operators are told 6 to 12 months
ahead of time the day of the drill, but not the exact targets of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the notice, Orrik said, ``at a minimum of 14 plants,''
of 57 tested, ``targets were hit such that there would be no saving
the plant . . . Security lost the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Pilgrim security repelled a mock assault last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rosano said the nuclear industry is better prepared for
terrorists than Orrik's figures suggest, but he agreed that the
mock attacks were valuable. Plant owners invested up to $1.5
million in new doors, perimeter defenses and the like as a result
of mock attacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rosano argued the attack drills are too rare, averaging
once every eight years per plant. He said smaller NRC teams of four
or fewer could visit more sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rosano added that industry complaints _ repelling Orrik's mock
invasions require security investments above legal requirements _
were not a factor in his changes. He argued that the industry will
have to work harder under his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Orrik formally objected to Rosano's recommendations this month,
saying much of his staff agreed. ``They are weak and non-committal,
and will reduce . . . the nuclear power industry's counterterrorist
capability,'' Orrick wrote.

NEWS ANALYSIS: ETHNIC ALBANIANS THROW MONKEYWRENCH INTO U.S.
PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO, KOSOVO-CLINTON, KOSOVO-CHINA) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Clinton administration appears to have walked into
the Kosovo peace talks without a clear idea of what to do if the
ethnic Albanians failed to follow the script that had been written
for them.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations driven largely by the West's desire to stop
bloodshed in Europe and especially to stop it before NATO
celebrated its 50th anniversary, the administration expected the
ethnic Albanians, including their guerrillas, to accept the
insertion of NATO troops as their protectors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the administration calculated, the spotlight would turn on
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, and the threat of NATO
air strikes would force him to sign an agreement giving Kosovo, now
a province of Serbia, three years of self-government.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't turn out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose aides suggest she
is mindful of the success of special envoy Richard C. Holbrooke in
ending the war in Bosnia at Dayton, Ohio, hoped to enhance her
prestige with a similar victory at the Kosovo negotiations in
Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to embrace the ethnic Albanians, but they refused to
embrace her. She left the negotiations with a messy end and,
administration officials acknowledged, a significant loss of
impetus in solving the conflict. If left unchecked, Kosovo's war
could not only yield more harrowing scenes of massacres and
refugees, but mar the NATO anniversary party in Washington in April
and even spread to other parts of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   It remains uncertain whether the ethnic Albanians, who proved to
be so unpredictable during the 17 days of talks, will come back as
they promised in two weeks with a signed peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had counted on a successful resolution of the
war involving NATO: Either the alliance would inject its ground
troops as peacekeepers, or its planes and missiles would bombard
and destroy the defense forces of Milosevic. Either way, it was
hoped, Kosovo would be a showcase of what NATO could do after the
Cold War, rather than an example of what it cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   The failure at Rambouillet, the town 30 miles south of Paris
where the Serbs and the Albanians were cloistered, has pushed the
next attempt to solve the Kosovo problem much closer to the NATO
anniversary. By the time the talks resume, on March 15, three
former Soviet bloc nations _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
_ will have joined the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the potency of the threat of NATO air strikes
that were supposed to bring Milosevic to closure has, for now, been
largely frittered away.
</P>
<P>
   During the next three weeks, administration officials say, they
will have to work overtime to rebuild a consensus on air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's NATO partners, notably France, the hosts of
the Rambouillet conference, are much less enthusiastic about
bombing Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest upset at Rambouillet was the behavior of the ethnic
Albanian delegation, a 16-man group composed of known quantities,
such as the elected leader and pacifist writer Ibrahim Rugova, and
unknown men such as the five members of the guerrilla force known
as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, a 29-year-old political science graduate and
leading insurgent, stubbornly insisted that the peace document
contain a clause calling for a referendum. Given that ethnic
Albanians make up an estimated 90 percent of Kosovo's two million
people, such a referendum after three years of autonomy would
almost certainly grant Kosovo the independence from Serbia that the
guerrillas have sought.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum is anathema to Milosevic, and not favored by the
West, either.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegates have now pledged that after
selling the peace accord among the population at home, they would
sign it. Administration officials said they believed the idea of
peace was a popular one and that logic would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, Rugova's influential political party and a third
Kosovo movement announced on Wednesday upon returning home that
they would form a joint provisional government _ apparently a step
that would help sell the accord.
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means clear that all guerrilla commanders would
go along. Another obstacle to a guaranteed yes is Adem Demaci, 63,
self-styled political spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, who
refused to attend the Rambouillet talks. He has strongly criticized
the agreement and on Wednesday night said the announced new
provisional agreement has no legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci was a political prisoner for 28 years in Yugoslavia. He
is a diehard supporter of Kosovo's independence but strongly
opposed to any deal with the Serbs. On Monday night, when the talks
were at their nadir, he received phone calls from Albright and
Former Sen. Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Both asked him to support the agreement. According to an
interview with Demaci published on Wednesday in a Kosovo Albanian
newspaper, he told them that the problems of Kosovo could not be
solved in a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   For Albright, the failure to get an agreement was, apparently, a
major disappointment. Without her presence, her supporters argue,
the outcome would have been worse. She hung in for three days,
trying every angle on the ethnic Albanians, including the call to
Demaci.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But she walked into unknown territory. Her strategists appear to
have misread the Kosovo Liberation Army, a recently formed, largely
mysterious group of insurgents who are barely known to diplomats.
Other guerrilla groups that have been dealt with over the years,
like the Viet Cong, were more of a known quantity.
</P>
<P>
   And Albright did not have the built-in advantage that Holbrooke
enjoyed at the talks in Dayton, Ohio, where the Americans
controlled the operation.
</P>
<P>
   At Rambouillet, the dynamics were diffuse. There were three
negotiators _ the American ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher
Hill, Austrian Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch representing the
European Union, and a Russian ambassador, Boris Mayorskiy. Further,
the French government controlled the ground rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, for example, wanted NATO military officials in
uniform present at the conference as a confidence-building measure
for the ethnic Albanians. The French government, according to
American officials, forbade this.
</P>
<P>
   At Dayton, all the leading protagonists were present and were
kept sequestered until they agreed. At Rambouillet, Milosevic and
Demaci were missing, and the French allowed two outside excursions.
One of them was probably fatal.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, went back to
Belgrade to talk to his mentor, Milosevic, and returned. Then, last
Friday, Thaci went off to meet Demaci in Ljubljana, capital of the
former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   It was after Thaci returned to Rambouillet from seeing his
mentor that his demeanor became clearer and tougher. And that was
when Albright encountered him for her first serious, ultimately
fruitless effort to convince him to sign an immediate peace deal.  &QL;

JUSTICES RULE RESIDENT IMMIGRANTS DEEMED UNDESIRABLE CAN BE
DEPORTED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave the attorney
general broad authority to begin deportation proceedings against
resident immigrants deemed undesirable, ruling that federal law
prevents those persons from turning to U.S. courts for help at the
outset of the process.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices also held that immigrants illegally
in the United States have no constitutional right to argue in court
that the attorney general has singled them out for deportation,
using selective enforcement of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, agreeing with the Clinton administration's
position, ruled that the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act prohibits immigrants from turning to
the courts to stop deportation proceedings from commencing.
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter and John Paul Stevens broke from their
colleagues in saying that the 1996 law does not apply to
deportation proceedings that were under way before April 1, 1997,
the effective date of the act.
</P>
<P>
   That time selection was no comfort to the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, which for 12 years has challenged
the federal government's effort to deport eight Arab U.S. residents
who belong to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The committee turned to federal courts in California, arguing that
the attorney general unconstitutionally selected the eight people
because of their affiliation with a group the Justice Department
has classified as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   The American-Arab group had won in the U.S. District Court for
Central California and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
stopped deportation proceedings so judges could rule on the merits
of the committee's claim.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court, overturning those decisions, said the
1996 immigration law gives the government latitude to commence
deportation proceedings against a variety of immigrants, including
those who overstay their visas to reside in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision drew a strong rebuke from the
American-Arab committee, which called the ruling ``a major blow to
civil liberties.'' The justices have given the government ``a green
light to use selective enforcement routinely against aliens it
doesn't like,'' added the group's spokesman, Hussein Ibish.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Justice
Department agency that enforces the law, welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the high court, said the
government's breadth of authority in deportation cases permits the
attorney general not only to begin proceedings but to halt them for
humanitarian reasons without fear that some group will oppose that
decision in court. In addition, the government may single out
specific immigrants for deportation once they have exceeded their
legal authority to remain in the United States, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general matter ... an alien unlawfully in this country
has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a
defense against his deportation,'' Scalia wrote. ``When an alien's
continuing presence in this country is in violation of the
immigration laws, the government does not offend the Constitution
by deporting him for the additional reason that it believes him to
be a member of an organization that supports terrorist activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Scalia's opinion on selective prosecution were Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Souter, the sole court member who would have upheld the lower
courts' decisions, said the high court should not have addressed
the issue of selective enforcement because that issue was not
directly before the justices. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the
case solely on the issue of whether federal courts had jurisdiction
to hear challenges to the government's commencement of deportation
proceedings, Souter wrote in a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens agreed that the American-Arab group was entitled to its
day in court but said the district court should not have stopped
the government from proceeding with deportation. ``I have no doubt
that the attorney general may give priority to the removal of
deportable aliens who are members of such a terrorist
organization,'' he wrote in an opinion concurring with the court's
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer agreed with
Scalia that immigrants have no recourse to ask courts to stop
deportation proceedings at the beginning. But the justices added
that immigrants have the right to press claims of selective
enforcement before a final deportation order is issued.

KAMAPA MAYOR   TO SERVE 15 MONTHS IN US FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In halting English, the man dubbed ``the George
Washington of Kampala `` invoked the names he'd pulled from the
history books: Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasser Ntge Sebaggala lingered longest on one name in
particular, the one whose crimes and causes he thought most closely
tracked his own: James Michael Curley.
</P>
<P>
   If the legendary Boston mayor could be pardoned after serving
time in federal prison for mail fraud -- and return triumphantly to
the mayor's seat -- perhaps US District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay
could do the same for Sebaggala, the first democratically-elected
mayor of Uganda's capital city, Kampala, who was convicted in
December of eight charges, including bank fraud and lying to US
Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if an outright pardon wasn't possible, maybe a just a short
prison sentence, like the six months Sebaggala's lawyer, Paul V.
Kelly, had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``His case is similar to mine,'' Sebaggala, speaking alternately
in English and his native Lugandan, said of Boston's popular
political rogue. ``I seek forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, cautioning that Curley wasn't a ``real good example''
of a role model, nonetheless did cut in half the 30-month sentence
recommended by the prosecution, ordering Sebaggala, 51, to prison
for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so, not because Sebaggala's continued absence from
the mayor's office could destabilize a fledgling democracy -- as
Kelly had argued - but because Sebaggala was the sole support of
his elderly blind mother and two young sons, circumstances he
termed ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden to safequard Ugandan democracy, ``should not fall on
me,'' said Lindsay, pointing out that it was Sebaggala's foray into
criminality and subsequent conviction that threatened the stability
of his hometown. Besides the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala must
repay $44,000 to the bank he defrauded and pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sebaggala's political advisor Matthias Nsubuga called
the sentence ``a political disaster.'' Under a deal worked out at
home, Sebaggala could hold on to his office as long as he was
sentenced to no more than 9 months in prison. He has been in
custody -- either under house arrest or in prison -- since he was
arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York last June, one
month after he took office. In his absence, the deputy mayor has
been in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala might be out in time,
but it will be ``close to the line,'' Kelly said. He will get
credit for the time he's been in prison since December awaiting
sentencing, as well as time off for good behavior, perhaps reducing
his actual sentence to about 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nsubuga was among a contigent of more than a dozen supporters,
both from Uganda and the Boston area, who attended Wednesday's
two-hour sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which ended with Sebaggala's conviction Dec. 4, drew
the attention of Ugandans here and abroad. Last fall, 40,000 of
Sebaggala's political supporters signed a petition urging that he
be freed pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan politics even seeped into what was a straightforward
fraud case. There were references to Sebaggala's beatings and
harassment at the hands of former Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, and
to the fact that his children had been granted political asylum in
the United States because of their father's political activities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, jurors were unswayed by suggestions of an
international political conspiracy. Rather, they were convinced by
a paper trial, including deposit slips, letters and doctored checks
with erasure marks.
</P>
<P>
   Sebaggala's trouble began on June 13, 1998 at Kennedy Airport,
where he was charged with lying to customs officials in Boston when
he entered the country on an earlier trip the previous January. He
was also charged with misstating the amount of traveler's checks --
$108,000 in all -- bundled in packages in his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a federal grand jury in Boston charged
Sebaggala, who owned a foreign currency exchange in Uganda, with
depositing four stolen and altered checks into an account at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   One check, originally made out to another party for $400, was
changed to $44,000 and made payable to Sebaggalla, according to
evidence presented at trial. Another check, originally for 99
cents, was changed to $39,000 and made payable to Sebaggala.

SO MUCH FOR TEXTUAL FIDELITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
(lh) 
Richard Taruskin is the author of ``Mussorgsky: Eight Essays and an
Epilogue'' and ``Defining Russia Musically.''  
By RICHARD TARUSKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mussorgsky, who either didn't finish his operas or finished them
twice, has always been a yammerer's delight. His works inspire
interminable discussion as to who he really was, what he really
meant, which (or whose) version is best and why. Any review of a
performance of ``Boris Godunov'' has to start with a description of
just what it contains and an evaluation of the performers' textual
choices before the quality of the performance can even be broached.
</P>
<P>
   A new recording by the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg, conducted
by the indefatigable Valery Gergiev (Philips 462 230-2; five CDs),
seeks to still the yammering by presenting both of the composer's
originals _ the practically all-male 1869 version, and the 1872
score replete with a Polish princess and four little animal ditties
for other women's voices _ in what are billed as meticulously
faithful reproductions. Sorry, yammer I must _ but wait.
</P>
<P>
   With Tchaikovsky it is different. Russia's first full-time
composing professional, he wrote quickly and with a minimum of
fuss. ``I sit down at my desk at 9 a.m.,'' he once remarked, ``and
the muse has learned to be on time.'' He finished what he started,
and started something else. Reviews of Tchaikovsky recordings,
especially of the more familiar works, are usually concerned with
performance quality alone, measured against the reviewer's personal
favorites. Tchaikovsky has never needed to be rescued from himself
or from his rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   But now come Andrej Hoteev (rhymes with Mendeleyev), a pianist,
and Vladimir Fedoseyev (rhymes with Hoteev), leading the
Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra Moscow (formerly the All-Union Radio
Orchestra) in a new Koch/Schwann release (3-6490-2; three CDs), to
tell us that the man we've been calling Tchaikovsky all these years
has been an impostor _ a creation of ``the `Party' and the KGB,''
no less (and no kidding) _ and that they have brought the real
Tchaikovsky back from Lethe.
</P>
<P>
   They have done this by traversing his four piano concertos (yes,
four, if you include the two-movement ``Fantaisie de Concert'') and
a couple of miscellaneous works for the same forces in what is
billed as the premiere recording of their ``unabridged original
versions.'' The packaging befits the grandiose claims: extensive
notes accompanying each CD, a deluxe booklet full of photos
(including a gallery of the ``Women in His Life'' _ don't you
believe that nasty KGB), and ambitious essays by the pianist and by
a pair of Russian specialists. There is even an ancient cylinder
recording of Tchaikovsky's voice: piping, jovial, not at all what
you would expect (especially if you've read those notes and
essays).
</P>
<P>
   No use beating around the bush. This misbegotten project is
surely the travesty of the decade. The performers' claim about
original texts turns out to be a fraud. The ``new'' and
``original'' Tchaikovsky they or their spokespersons so blaringly
tout is their own deranged invention, a pseudo-musicological
Frankenstein. Not only have they loosed on us a Tchaikovsky
Tchaikovsky would not have recognized, they have managed to create
a Tchaikovsky Tchaikovsky would have abominated and despised.
</P>
<P>
   Does that matter? In principle, of course, it needn't. There is
no reason today's performers must please a dead man, even if he
happens to be the composer. But in this case I doubt that anyone
not cowed by the bogus musicology will like the results. Whether
artlessly or cynically, the performers and their consultants are
abusing musicology the way the worst Early Musickers once did, to
justify inept and absurd performances. Yet beyond Early Music, and
beyond musicology, this loony release reflects some of the most
cherished assumptions of ``classical'' music-making and
music-thinking in a funhouse mirror. That aspect makes it, in its
inadvertently hilarious and improbable way, important.
</P>
<P>
   I will not speculate about motives. Hoteev is new to me. But
that Fedoseyev, a much-decorated Soviet hack, should be involved in
this farrago is not surprising. He began his career as a player of
the bayan _ a Russian-style accordion with buttons instead of a
keyboard _ and achieved fame as the leader of an ``orchestra of
folk instruments,'' one of those shimmering balalaika bands that
dispensed Soviet kitsch to tourists under the old regime.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over the All-Union Radio Orchestra in 1974 _ a
reward for faithful party work, it was widely assumed _ the members
staged a protest that led to a famous scandal. The string players,
greeting the new maestro, put down their bows and met his signal to
begin by presenting their violins and violas in balalaika position,
right hands poised to strum.
</P>
<P>
   Like many classical musicians coming from the other side of the
tracks, Fedoseyev compensated with bombast. (And like many loyal
Soviet artists in post-Soviet times, he now professes an abiding
interest in whatever the Party and the KGB proscribed: in the case
of Tchaikovsky, his ``mystical, visionary, romantic'' side.)
Fedoseyev's performances of Russian classics have always been the
``deepest'' and most ``serious'' around, for which read the
slowest, the thickest-textured, the most bloated in dynamics. And
so it is here with Tchaikovsky, except that the level of
sluggishness and tumescence breaks all records.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever it is possible to compare the tempos adopted by the
present performers with published metronome markings _ that is, in
the Third Concerto and the ``Fantaisie de Concert'' _ the
discrepancies are wondrous to behold. The opening tempo of the
``Fantaisie'' is given as 76 beats per minute. Hoteev and Fedoseyev
begin at 53 and actually slow down from there. Where in the midst
of the first movement's central cadenza the score says ``a little
faster,'' Hoteev slows down again.
</P>
<P>
   The second movement begins andante cantabile, at 66 beats per
minute. Hoteev starts off at 44, reaching the prescribed initial
speed only where the score specifies a faster one (84). Where the
music accelerates to Molto vivace, Fedoseyev again unaccountably
slows the tempo. Where Tchaikovsky writes vivacissimo (very lively)
and sets the beat value at 96 per minute, Fedoseyev grudgingly
rises to 76, which is slower than the tempo prescribed for a
section marked Moderato assai, ``Very medium'' (whatever that means
_ but whatever it means, it is not very lively).
</P>
<P>
   The tempos in the Third Concerto, a posthumously published work,
range even farther afield. The opening Allegro brillante (never to
be forgotten by anyone who has seen Balanchine's ``Ballet
Imperial''), marked at 138 beats per minute, loafs at 70 or less:
precisely half-tempo. A piano solo, marked poco meno (a little
less) and set at 126, goes at 55: appreciably under half-tempo. A
passage in the cadenza, marked allegro vivace (literally ``Merry
and gay'') and set at 152, rises to a leaden 100. But when the next
marking arrives _ Allegro non tanto (Not quite so fast), at 116 _
Hoteev plunges to 60, half-tempo again.

IN SPEECH TO ENGINEERS, WELD PLAYS MIDDLE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld pursued
his aggressive defense of the political middle Wednesday,
counseling both Democrats and Republicans to move toward the
center.
</P>
<P>
   In a luncheon speech summing up his view of domestic politics to
a convention of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers, Weld
outlined ``four slices of the American pie,'' two of which he
insisted ``just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are what Weld called the liberal left, including US House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt and more strident conservatives
such as novice Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, who
Weld said ``really needs to get a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld praised those who inhabit the other two pieces of the
political pie: more conservative Democrats such as Nebraska Senator
Bob Kerrey and more liberal Republicans such as New Jersey Governor
Christine Whitman. But he urged even them to move further from the
ideological extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans need to adjust their hard-line positions on issues
like abortion and immigration, Weld said, while Democrats need to
loosen up on tax laws, education, and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success in American politics, Weld said, is
recognizing that people embrace government when it helps them.
``Government _ and this is a little bit controversial _ is good
when it is setting out to redress wrongs,'' Weld said, adding that
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have ``absorbed that in
their bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld took a sarcastic potshot at ``my great and good friend
Jesse Helms from North Carolina,'' the Republican senator who
single-handedly torpedoed Weld's plan to became US ambassador to
Mexico after he resigned as governor of Massachusetts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Weld criticized Helms for opposing the return of control of Hong
Kong to China, saying Helms was arguing that, ``These people can't
possibly be trusted to govern themselves or do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld said Democrats ``miss the boat on what government is bad
at,'' and that Republicans do likewise ``on what the government is
good at. I hope you're going to see a convergence toward the center
there,'' Weld said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ruminating on the evils of political extremism, Weld,
now a partner in the law firm McDermott, Will &AMP; Emery, urged local
engineering firms to look beyond US shores for new business.
</P>
<P>
   Weld said all Asian nations except for Indonesia _ ``still
bedridden'' _ are in recovery from last year's economic ills.
</P>
<P>
   Weld said opportunities abound in Europe and elsewhere in
transportation, telecom, energy, and environmental areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is singing our song,'' he said. ``We're all lucky
English has become the international language of commerce.''

 UNDATED: half-tempo again.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are extraordinary deviations. You won't find Horowitz
committing anything of the sort, or even Glenn Gould, to name two
notorious meddlers. But of course, Fedoseyev and Hoteev bill
themselves as the opposite of meddlers. They claim a puritanical
fidelity to the composer, and all the authority to which the claim
entitles them. By what argument can they reconcile their preaching
with their practice?
</P>
<P>
   By the oldest dodge in the book. As noted, the Third Concerto
was a posthumous work. Tchaikovsky left the first movement more or
less complete but the two others in an unorchestrated
``particell,'' or sketch score. The three were published (by two
different publishers) as two separate works, the Allegro brillante
as Concerto No. 3 (Op. 75, 1894), the ``Andante and Finale'' as
Opus 79 (1897). Both publications were edited by Sergei Taneyev, a
brilliant pianist and revered composer and pedagogue, who authored
a celebrated textbook that reduced the study of counterpoint to a
set of mathematical principles. He began his career as a protege of
Tchaikovsky's and remained a lifelong friend.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Eckhardt van den Hoogen's notes to the recording
assert about Taneyev: ``This former `teacher's pet' had no
understanding at all of Tchaikovsky's music and felt that it was
his mission to approximate it to his own mathematical-speculative
ideas.'' In particular, Tchaikovsky's tempo markings ``had to rub
the `numbers man' Taneyev the wrong way.'' Consequently, ``the
metronome markings that he assigned to a number of different scores
were much faster than the composer had imagined.'' And since it was
the nefarious Taneyev who played the premiere performance of the
``Fantaisie de Concert'' as well, he must have meddled with the
published tempos there, too.
</P>
<P>
   So we can blame the spectacular tempo discrepancies not on
Hoteev and Fedoseyev, but on Taneyev, to whose list of crimes
against Tchaikovsky venality is eventually added as a banal
clincher. ``There were good commercial reasons for bringing the
master's unpublished works out on the market,'' van den Hoogen
raves in righteous wrath; ``after all, Taneyev's labors should
bring in at least a few rubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any evidence to support these allegations? Don't be
silly. Their purpose is to eliminate evidence that contradicts the
performers' absurdly swollen performances, in support of which
Hoteev offers no facts of his own but rather 12 oracular dicta
under the rubric ``Tchaikovsky's Piano Concertos for the Third
Millennium.'' They set a new benchmark in the annals of
pseudo-musicological huff and puff.
</P>
<P>
   Every button in sight gets pushed. ``The four piano concertos by
Pyotr Tchaikovsky have the same significance for Russian music as
do the five piano concertos by Ludwig van Beethoven for the world
of Western music,'' reads one. They are ``really symphonies for
piano and orchestra,'' another predictably asserts, which allows
another flattering comparison: ``In this case Tchaikovsky resembles
the Johannes Brahms of the Piano Concerto No. 2 and the Double
Concerto.'' Tchaikovsky's music exhibits all ``the classical logic
of musical form'' while at the same time ``revolutionizing the
piano concerto genre.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, ``it is clearly evident that Tchaikovsky was far closer
to the sources of Western culture at that time _ Wagner, Bruckner
and Mahler, not to mention Schopenhauer and Spinoza _ than has
generally been assumed over the past 100 years.'' What 19th-century
figure Hoteev had in mind when name-dropping the 17th-century
Spinoza is anybody's guess, but the remaining names are all
dependably German, giving Tchaikovsky the pseudo-musicological
equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal.
</P>
<P>
   Now here is what Tchaikovsky, on a visit to Vienna, wrote back
to his patron Madame von Meck in the fall of 1877: ``Altogether, it
seems to me Germany is deterioriating as regards music. I believe
the French are now coming to the fore.'' He wrote this in reaction
to the First Symphony of Brahms, ``a composer whom the Germans
exalt to the skies.'' Tchaikovsky's verdict: ``He has no charms for
me. I find him cold and obscure, full of pretensions but without
any real depths.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, in a letter to another correspondent,
Tchaikovsky returned to the subject with even greater vehemence:
``Isn't Brahms, in essence, just a caricature of Beethoven? Aren't
his pretensions to profundity, strength and power detestable, when
the content he pours into those Beethovenian forms is so pitiful
and insignificant?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is an accurate description of Brahms can be debated
some other time. But I can attest to its accuracy as a description
of Hoteev and Fedoseyev's turgid renditions, which in their
pretensions to a spuriously Germanic profundity, strength and power
make Tchaikovsky's aristocratically sumptuous and festive music
seem pitiful and insignificant indeed. All that these performers
succeed in proving is that Tchaikovsky makes an awful Bruckner,
which is something Tchaikovsky could (and should) have told them.
</P>
<P>
   But their dogmatic insistence that Tchaikovsky's ``originals''
were sacrosanct, and that all attempts at revision (whether by
Taneyev or by Alexander Siloti, who with Tchaikovsky's blessing
published a widely used abridgment of the Second Concerto) were
ill-intentioned, has an authentically Brucknerian ring. It is the
claim that Bruckner scholars, beginning with Robert Haas, have long
been making against the shortened Schalk and Loewe editions, which
helped the master's symphonies overcome early resistance, just as
Rimsky-Korsakov's colorfully orchestrated abridgment of his friend
Mussorgsky's ``Boris Godunov'' helped the opera achieve its present
status in worldwide repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Recent investigations by Benjamin Korstvedt, Bryan Gilliam and
Morten Solvik have shown the Bruckner question to have been tinged
with anti-Semitism. Well, what German question isn't? The ugly
specter makes people eager to turn away from the problem and, as
one critic put it recently, consign it to ``some leafy campus.''
The subtexts that inform our knee-jerk pieties are no mere academic
matter, though. We need to bring them to consciousness if we ever
want to shake free. The cases of Mussorgsky and, now, Tchaikovsky
show that the dogmatic anti-editorial stance has other roots as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Taneyev and Siloti, Tchaikovsky's mediators (or
``adulterators,'' to use their present accusers' ugly word) were
not Jewish. Even though Siloti, of Italian descent, was in the eyes
of rabid Russian nationalists also ethnically suspect, the
peremptory rejection of their interventions is tinged, rather, with
another sort of blanket intolerance. Its source lies in the ancient
and inveterately asocial modernist principle Jean-Paul Sartre
enshrined in the motto of his once-famous play ``No Exit'': hell is
other people.
</P>
<P>
   Not only editors, in this late-late-Romantic view, but also
performers, critics and (especially) audiences are a composer's
natural enemies. All, that is, are potential threats to the
sanctity of the creator's individual genius and his autonomy of
action and decision. It is by now the most tedious cliche of
20th-century criticism that ``an eagerness to please'' (to quote
another recent reviewer) is the worst composerly vice. After thus
lumping and damning the work of six young composers, the reviewer
found a seventh item ``refreshing in its disagreeableness,'' for
that connoted authenticity.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots will be speaking to and
examining Packers unrestricted free agent running back Travis
Jervey Thursday and do likewise with teammate Darick Holmes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team reportedly is close to bringing back former
linebacker Dwayne Sabb, who played for the St. Louis Rams last
year, which may mean the end for Todd Collins. Sabb was on the
Patriots' Super Bowl team of three season ago. Collins is drawing
interest from the Dallas Cowboys, New York Jets, and Rams, whom he
visited Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams may be considering Collins if linebacker Roman Phifer
signs with the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens are reportedly interested in Patriots tight
end Lovett Purnell and are preparing an offer for the restricted
free agent. The Patriots tendered Purnell at $429,000, the lowest
tender offer. It doesn't appear the Patriots would match an offer
of substance for Ben Coates's backup.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Browns remain interested in restricted free agent
kicker Adam Vinatieri, but it appears the Patriots would match
pretty much anything the Browns offer.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Mark Wheeler, an unrestricted free agent, is
expected to sign with Tennessee soon.

 UNDATED: connoted authenticity.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is easy to see how an attitude of extremist individualism,
bone-tired in ``the West,'' might still appeal to Russians recently
released from Soviet tyranny. But again, compare Tchaikovsky, who
wrote of Wagner (with whom Hoteev and Fedoseyev now want to
associate him) in solidarity with the audience. ``Before, music
strove to delight people,'' he complained. ``Now they are tormented
and exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sort of performance misanthropic modernism might
sanction would be a reconstruction of the earliest authorial text,
preferably one that existed before the work was ever performed _
before it was exposed, that is, to the corrosive atmosphere of
social mediation (or, more simply, to Other People). As it happens,
an ideal test case lurks among the Tchaikovsky piano concertos: the
famous First. Its initial exposure to an Other was a famous fiasco,
when Tchaikovsky played it at a private Christmas Eve gathering in
1874 for Nikolai Rubinstein, its intended soloist, and received a
cruel rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   This Rubinstein, who as director of the Moscow Conservatory was
then Tchaikovsky's employer, was the brother of the more famous
Anton (Tchaikovsky's main teacher) and a virtuoso of commanding
authority in his own right. As Tchaikovsky reported to Madame von
Meck, the pianist pronounced the concerto ``worthless, absolutely
unplayable; the passagework so broken, so incoherent, so
unskillfully written that it could not even be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The work itself was bad, trivial, common,'' Tchaikovsky (and
Rubinstein) went on. ``Here and there I had stolen from other
people; only one or two pages were worth anything; all the rest had
better be destroyed, or entirely rewritten.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting for once (and practically the only time in his life) like
a good modernist, Tchaikovsky published the concerto, in defiance
of Rubinstein, ``without altering a single note,'' as he thundered
to Madame von Meck. That was the version originally performed by
Hans von Buelow in Boston in 1875 but not printed in full score
until 1955.
</P>
<P>
   I assumed, from the proud proclamation that the present CDs
contain nothing but ``unabridged original versions,'' that I would
finally get to hear it. And while resurrecting superseded first
drafts (like the notorious Sibelius Fifth Symphony issued a couple
of years ago by Bis) is often just a bid for attention, and touting
them as revelations is nearly always folly, hearing them (once) is
always interesting. The prospect of hearing the ``Boston'' version
of the First Concerto, the very one reviled by Nikolai Rubinstein,
is what sparked my interest in the present set.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my disappointment, then, when the piano entered with the
familiar chords banged out by hands crashing from a great height in
three distinct keyboard registers, rather than rolled sonorously by
hands in constant contact with the keys and in the low-to-middle
register alone. The crash-bang effect was Siloti's idea, actively
solicited by Tchaikovsky and first published in an edition of 1889,
the last to appear during the composer's lifetime. Ten years
earlier, in a previous revised edition, Tchaikovsky, now over his
pique with Rubinstein, had gratefully incorporated the suggestions
of Edward Dannreuther, the pianist who had given the English
premiere, and who sent Tchaikovsky proposed revisions for 145
measures in the first movement. They simplified and regularized _
yes, and made more conventional _ the passagework, which in
Tchaikovsky's ``unpianistic'' original had tended to slow the
performer down.
</P>
<P>
   Hoteev and Fedoseyev's Brucknerian Tchaikovsky would surely have
rejected Dannreuther's help, or even made additional complications
to heighten viscosity. Yet while they continue to insist on tempos
on the far side of molasses that might easily have accommodated the
original figuration, Hoteev and Fedoseyev remain unaccountably
faithful to the familiar Siloti-cum-Dannreuther text. They excuse
the apparent contradiction with a typical pseudo-musicological
rationalization: Tchaikovsky is known to have conducted from the
1889 score.
</P>
<P>
   That gives evidence of his preference, all right. For those who
need the composer's permission to leave the room, that makes the
version recorded here ``authentic.'' But it is no more ``original''
than your Cliburn or your Horowitz. All it shows is that
Tchaikovsky did not fetishize his unabridged originals the way
modern pseudo-musicologists do, and that his blustery restorers,
like most performers who have made similar claims, practice what
they preach only to the extent that it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   So is there nothing at all worth hearing here? There is one
thing. In addition to the four concertos and a little Allegro in C
minor composed while Tchaikovsky was studying with Anton Rubinstein
at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, the set contains a concert
fantasy in F minor called ``Ungarische Zigeunerweisen''
(``Hungarian Gypsy Tunes''), by Sophie Menter, a rich pupil of
Franz Liszt, who got her teacher to write (or sketch) the piece for
her shortly before his death in 1886, and Tchaikovsky to
orchestrate it in 1892. It is a hoot. And it is given a relatively
de-Brucknered performance (Bruckner being as unlikely a gypsy as
Tchaikovsky is a Bruckner) in which Hoteev shows that he can play
the piano after all. The opening cadenza, which sounds the way a
cimbalom would if played by the Phantom of the Opera, is almost
worth the price of admission. If you buy it, though, remember that
I said ``almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and ``Boris''? It turns out that Gergiev is no more serious
about keeping textual matters straight than Hoteev and Fedoseyev.
The recording gives the 1869 and 1872 versions of the opera as they
appear to one casually perusing the 1975 Oxford University Press
score, edited by David Lloyd-Jones. To learn what was really in the
two versions (which overlap considerably) you need to read the
footnotes and critical report, and Gergiev evidently hasn't
bothered. Thus, the ``1869'' cell scene has the offstage choruses
added in 1872, and the ``1872'' opening and death scenes still
sport passages Mussorgsky cut from them when revising.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? Not if you are merely offering yours as another
subjectively motivated performance. As such, Gergiev's readings
have much to recommend them. They are exceedingly brisk, effective,
efficient. The orchestra digs into Mussorgsky's oft-scorned scoring
with a gusto and an eclat that make you wonder why Rimsky-Korsakov
was ever called in to doctor it. But the conductor is clearly the
star of the show, and that makes for a considerable flattening-out
of the drama. The only place where real characters emerge is the
1872 Polish act, thanks particularly to the forceful Marina of Olga
Borodina, who sings like a real prima donna. All the others,
including both Borises (Nikolai Putilin and Vladimir Vaneyev), sing
like troupers on good modernist behavior.
</P>
<P>
   So we have here the only ``Boris'' recording, maybe the only one
ever, to be dominated by the Polish act. And that kind of a
``Boris'' is not Mussorgsky's kind. Claims of textual fidelity turn
out, as usual, not to be much of a guarantee of authenticity. But
textual fidelity will matter greatly to those who buy this set out
of legitimate curiosity, thinking that now they will really hear
the two versions plain. They won't. Which is in every way a shame.

FAMILY HISTORY AND SEASON OF BIRTH LINKED TO SCHIZOPHRENIA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Iowa, Md.)   (jw) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A family history of schizophrenia remains the best predictor of
whether a person will develop the illness, but environmental
influences like place and season of birth are also significant risk
factors, according to the findings of a large epidemiological study
by Danish researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in Thursday's issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine, found that having a parent or a sibling with
schizophrenia increased a person's chances of developing the
illness by about sevenfold to ninefold. But people who are born in
the winter months, in particular in February or March, or who are
born in urban areas, are also slightly more likely to develop
schizophrenia than people born at other times of the year or in
rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   People born in Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, were 2.4 times as
likely to develop schizophrenia as those born in rural areas, the
study found. February and March were the months of birth associated
with the highest risk, while August and September were the months
associated with the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk to the individual represented by time and place of
birth is still very small, said Dr. Preben Bo Mortensen, the lead
author of the study, who is a psychiatric epidemiologist at the
Institute for Basic Psychiatric Research at Arhus University
Hospital in Riskow. ``One shouldn't panic if one is born in
March,'' Mortensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1.75 million subjects in the study, all of whom were
children of Danish women born from 1935 to 1978, 2,669 had received
a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The findings add weight to previous studies over several decades
showing a link between schizophrenia and season or place of birth.
Because the months of highest risk correspond to the flu season,
scientists suspect that a viral infection during pregnancy may
affect the development of a fetus. Living in densely populated
areas also puts people at higher risk of contracting viral
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reasonable that any number of insults or `hits' that
impact the system might impair the normal migration of nerve cells
to their proper place and their proper connections,'' said Dr.
David Shore, associate director of clinical research at the
National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the journal article, Dr. Nancy
Andreasen, who holds the Andrew H. Woods Chair of Psychiatry at the
University of Iowa College of Medicine, wrote that pinpointing the
causes of schizophrenia was ``clearly a complicated matter.'' The
disease runs in families, she said, and studies of identical twins
and children raised by adoptive parents show that genetic factors
play a role .
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Andreasen noted, ``Since schizophrenia persists as an
illness despite the fact that the majority of its victims do not
marry or procreate, and since it appears to have the same lifetime
prevalence throughout the world, it seems likely that multiple,
different, nonspecific, nongenetic factors that affect
neurodevelopment are implicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia afflicts about 1 percent of Americans, or about
2.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish study is the largest epidemiological study to examine
multiple risk factors in schizophrenia. The researchers took
advantage of the Danish Civil Registration System, in which every
Danish resident is assigned at birth a personal identification
number. Data from the birth registry were then correlated with
cases of schizophrenia identified through the Danish Psychiatric
Central Register, which keeps track of all admissions to
psychiatric hospitals. Psychiatric treatment in Denmark is free,
and there are no private psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that while family history of
schizophrenia represented the highest relative risk for an
individual, place and season of birth accounted for more cases of
schizophrenia for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen compared the relative risks of family history and
place of birth in schizophrenia to the role of asbestos exposure
and smoking as risk factors for lung cancer. A person exposed to
asbestos runs a relatively high risk of developing lung cancer, but
asbestos exposure is uncommon, Mortensen said. For the population
at large, smoking represents a larger risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   But Mortensen and other scientists pointed out that the Danish
study might underestimate the influence of genetic factors, since
some people might carry genes for the illness without showing
symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many individuals have genetic susceptibilities to
schizophrenia, even though they don't have affected parents and
siblings,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kendler, a professor in the department
of psychiatry and human genetics at the Medical College of Virginia
at Virginia Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   Mortensen and his colleagues found that the chances of
developing schizophrenia were also slightly elevated for children
born to Danish mothers who had emigrated to other countries. One
possible explanation is that the mothers were exposed to new
infectious agents in their adopted countries.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the case in an earlier study, which found an
increased risk for schizophrenia among second-generation black
Caribbean immigrants living in London.

SENATE APPROVES MILITARY PAY INCREASE THAT IS BIGGER THAN CLINTON
SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly approved a sweeping
military pay and pension increase on Wednesday that is bigger than
a plan President Clinton proposed two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a top Republican priority, was approved 91-8, with
most Democrats joining the politically popular measure that the
Joint Chiefs of Staff say is essential to help recruit and retain
the highest-caliber armed forces. Three Republicans and five
Democrats opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Pay raises and sweetened pensions are traditional Republican
issues that Clinton seemed to co-opt with his proposal in December
to increase military salaries by 4.4 percent for all 1.4 million
members of the armed forces on active duty, starting in January
2000. The administration also sought to give larger bonuses to
selected mid-career personnel and to improve the pensions of
veterans who joined after 1986. Although the administration has
said it was not happy with the bill in its current form, officials
said it was unlikely that the president would veto such popular
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, eager to show that Clinton's impeachment
trial had not derailed their legislative agenda, split off the pay
and pension provisions from the annual Pentagon budget bill to make
it the first major legislation the Senate considered this year.
</P>
<P>
   Senators then made the measure _ called the Soldiers', Sailors',
Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights _ more generous than the
president's version. The Senate bill authorizes a 4.8 percent pay
raise next year; allots bonuses of up to 10.3 percent, compared
with the administration's 9.9 percent, and provides for slightly
better pensions.
</P>
<P>
   It also adds more educational aid under the Montgomery GI Bill,
creates 401(k)-style savings accounts for service members and
provides $180 a month to as many as 10,000 low-ranking troops who
are eligible for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something of a bidding war going on between the
administration and the Congress,'' said Steven Kosiak, an analyst
with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a policy
research institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate plan
would cost $55 billion over 10 years, $18 billion more than the
administration's plan. Either proposal marks the largest pay raises
since 1982, when a newly elected President Ronald Reagan approved
increases of 14.3 percent for officers and 10 percent to 17 percent
for enlisted personnel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Senate action puts the White House in a bind. A policy
statement from the White House's Office of Management and Budget
said the administration ``does not support'' the bill in its
``current form.'' But the president cannot risk blocking a pay
raise for troops at a time that the Air Force is begging for
pilots, the Navy is short on sailors and recruiters are scraping to
meet their monthly quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The House, while undecided whether it will break out the pay
provisions as the Senate has, is likely to follow the Senate's lead
closely. At a hearing on Wednesday of the House Armed Services
Committee, lawmakers pressed the military service chiefs on their
personnel problems. ``Recruiting in the Army today is a very tough
challenge,'' said Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, the Army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen favors extra pay increases
but only if Congress increases the Pentagon's overall budget to pay
for them. Otherwise, Cohen, a former Republican Senator from Maine,
has said the Republicans' one-upsmanship could force the Defense
Department to cut training, spare parts or other areas that
Congress insists are vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be counterproductive and completely contrary to our
mutual desire not to undercut our modernization effort and other
readiness priorities,'' Cohen said in a letter last week to Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An influential conservative, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the
majority whip, expressed a similar concern on Wednesday about the
bill's cost. Nickles said the proposal to increase the pensions of
20-year veterans to 50 percent of their basic pay, from 40 percent,
was ``a mistake'' that would cost $14 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, who put the
bill on a fast track and helped rush it to the floor with no
committee hearings, dismissed any hand-wringing over budget
constraints. ``There is one thing that takes higher priority than
budgets, and that's the defense of our country,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner added, ``We simply cannot allow the best military force
in the world to wither and atrophy.''
</P>
<P>
   But some independent military analysts say Congress may be
overreacting to a problem that has yet to be fully analyzed. Some
specialists say, for example, that the frequency of overseas
missions has more sway over whether troops decide to remain in the
military than a sweetened pension.
</P>
<P>
   Major studies on pay and pension by the Congressional Budget
Office, General Accounting Office and the Pentagon are nearing
completion, and some lawmakers advised waiting until the study
results are known and the budget picture becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the ranking
minority member of the Armed Services Committee, ``represents a
promise to the troops that may or may not be possible to redeem.''

MUSEUM SEEKS TO RETURN PLUNDERED PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It measures just 5 by 10 inches. But the 16th-century
Flemish landscape by Herri met de Bles has been housed in two of
this century's most dissimilar art collections since it was whisked
out of the Netherlands after the Nazi occupation in May 1940.
</P>
<P>
   For the duration of World War II, it was in the notorious
private collection of Nazi Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering, a
collection of art looted or ``bought'' at gunpoint in occupied
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1946, an American dealer sold the de Bles to the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts, whose documents suggest the museum was
indifferent to its ownership history.
</P>
<P>
   Like other paintings that passed through soiled hands during and
after the war, the landscape raises embarrassing questions about
the postwar policies of museums such as the MFA, which first
learned 51 years ago that the painting might have been illicitly
traded during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Griffin, the MFA's spokeswoman, said the museum is eager to
return the landscape as soon as the evidence establishes its
rightful ownership. The MFA, she said, is continuing to search its
records to ensure that the rest of its artworks have no wartime
taint.
</P>
<P>
   No museum, Griffin noted, is immune from the possibility that it
might have inadvertently acquired art after the war that had been
looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch first alerted the MFA in 1948 that the painting had
been taken from Holland by the Nazis, according to MFA
correspondence obtained by the Globe. That year, Dutch authorities
asked for its return, but the MFA's director at the time, G. H.
Edgell, insisted that the Dutch provide ``definite'' evidence it
had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, trying to rebuild their country in the chaos of
post-war Europe, dropped the claim. And so, for 50 years, the MFA
shelved the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But last March, soon after the Globe raised questions about
other MFA post-war acquisitions and amid growing international
attention to Nazi-looted art, the museum discovered documents from
1948 and contacted the Dutch government with an offer to return the
painting if the Dutch would provide the long-overdue evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dutch officials said they are about to do so, and
they praised the MFA for coming forward to settle a case that
present-day Dutch officials say they were unaware of.
</P>
<P>
   To some art specialists, the tale of the tiny painting
underscores persistent moral issues that confront the art world,
including the eagerness of postwar collectors and curators to
acquire paintings like the de Bles even though the works crossed
the Atlantic with suspicious pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, for instance, the MFA's director unapologetically
acknowledged to the Dutch that the museum had virtually no
information about the prior ownership of the de Bles.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is even more awkward for the Netherlands. More than 90
percent of Dutch Jews perished in the Holocaust, by far the highest
rate in Western Europe. Recent public outrage has led to the
creation of a commission to examine why 90 percent of the artworks
recovered from the Nazis after the war, including major works by
Rembrandt, remain unclaimed in Dutch museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch government behaved despicably after the war and was
so intent on keeping the looted art that they dispossessed their
own citizens,'' Christine A. Koenigs, whose grandfather owned the
de Bles until 1940, said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs, who lives in Amsterdam, holds the Dutch, and not the
MFA, accountable. But others take a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch incompetence does not excuse five decades of inaction by
the MFA,'' said Willi Korte, a specialist in locating Nazi-looted
art who is not involved in the de Bles case.
</P>
<P>
   If the MFA needed evidence to support the claim, it arrived
unsolicited last July when Koenigs filed her own claim. She
included documents that leave little doubt that the artwork, like
tens of thousands of others, was a casualty of the war. The
documents, she said, were in official Dutch files in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents Koenigs has is a copy of a list of 19 of
Franz Koenigs's paintings that Goering acquired in 1940, including
receipts signed by Goering's administrative assistant at Carinhall,
his palace outside Berlin. The de Bles painting, ``Burning City,''
is on the list. Evidence that the painting was in Goering's illicit
collection has long been publicly available in the US National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   For the MFA, the case of the de Bles landscape is the latest in
a series of disclosures that raise questions about the museum's
collecting ethics. Those questions encompass both its postwar
acquisition of paintings and its recent acquisitions of antiquities
that the museum had reason to believe had been illegally taken from
grave sites in countries such as Italy and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other European paintings the MFA has acquired since
the 1940s have ownership histories that, according to art
specialists, raise suspicions they might have been looted during
the war. The MFA has refused to say whether it has subsequently
investigated the history of those artworks.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a panel of the Association of Art Museum Directors
that included the current MFA director, Malcolm Rogers, pledged
that AAMD members would look for evidence any of their art had been
looted by the Nazis, would deal ``promptly'' with any claims, and
would publicly disclose if any of their artworks had been illegally
confiscated during World War II and not restituted.
</P>
<P>
   Until asked Wednesday, the MFA had said nothing about the de
Bles. When the Globe inquired late last year whether the museum had
found any evidence of looted Nazi art in its collection, the MFA
sidestepped the question. ``We have no specific discoveries to
report to the Globe,'' the museum replied.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last March, according to Bob G.C. Lodder, the deputy
director of the Cultural Heritage Department of the Dutch Ministry
of Culture, Rogers wrote to the Dutch government about the de Bles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MFA contacted us to say they had been looking at their
records on this painting and had found some very strange things,''
Lodder said Wednesday. ``When we checked our own records, it became
clear the painting was ours.'' The Boston museum, he said, should
be praised for coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, when the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam asked that the de
Bles be returned, MFA director Edgell wrote that the MFA's trustees
``would return the painting to the Boymans Museum when definite
proof is given us that it was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Edgell admitted that the MFA knew almost nothing about the
landscape's origin. ``The dealer can tell us little beyond the fact
that the picture was bought in a small auction room in New York,
the owner of which says that the picture came to him from Chicago.
We are trying to get more information about its history but
probably shall not succeed,'' Edgell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Though the MFA was uncertain about the work's history, Edgell
told the Dutch that he thought it likely the painting ``may have
left the Koenigs collection before it was seized by the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Edgell concluded, ``We are not hedging and certainly
have no intention of being receivers of stolen goods, but equally
you will realize that our trustees cannot return a painting without
definite legal proof that it was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Korte, who has represented several victims of Nazi art looting
who have made claims against American museums, said there is a
double standard implicit in Edgell's 1948 explanation, one that
echoes through other cases in which museums have resisted claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same trustees and curators, who ask no questions, who
raise no suspicions when they acquire a painting, and who have no
records of where the painting came from, all of a sudden develop
very high standards of proof when a claimant comes along,'' Korte
said.
</P>
<P>
   How the de Bles landscape ended up in Chicago is unclear, but
Korte said it is likely that one of the American GIs who liberated
Carinhall took the miniature painting home in his duffel bag as a
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complex manner in which Franz Koenigs's massive
collection was lost, Korte said, the only issue is whether the
painting belongs to the Koenigs family or the Dutch government.
Lodder made it clear Wednesday that the government believes it owns
the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Koenigs was a wealthy German businessman who emigrated to
the Netherlands in 1931, bringing one of Europe's most
extraordinary art collections. It included numerous paintings,
among them the de Bles landscape and many works by Rubens. More
importantly, Koenigs had one of the world's best collections of Old
Master drawings, 2,144 in all.
</P>
<P>
   But Koenigs, who was not Jewish, fell on hard times, and used
the collection as collateral for a loan from a Jewish-owned bank.
With the Nazi invasion imminent, the bank was advised to liquidate
its holdings, selling most of Koenigs's collection and consigning
35 paintings to an art dealer to be sold. After the Nazi invasion,
the dealership was taken over by a Nazi art procurer, who sold 19
of the paintings, including the de Bles, to Goering.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1943 Allied declaration, adopted as law by the Dutch,
all wartime sales to Germans in Occupied Europe were deemed null
and void. Dutch policy, which has come under fire from claimants
like Koenigs, declares the state the owner of works that were sold,
even in questionable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In Koenigs's case, hundreds of his drawings were seized by
occupying Soviet forces and kept as war reparations. Those that
were returned, including many of the paintings from Carinhall, have
been kept by the Dutch government, despite Christine Koenigs's
insistence that her grandfather would have retained his collection
but for the invasion and the bank liquidation.

   &QL;  JOHNSTOWN AREA RESIDENTS GIVE TO CLINTON LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Fine
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 -- Retired Johnstown resident Louis Will was
so angered by the impeachment process, he wanted to help pay to
defend President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a check for $35 to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust,
which was set up to accept donations to help the president pay his
legal bills which are at $9 million -- and growing. ``I just
thought about the opposition he was up against,'' Will said. ``I
thought it was important that I help. I didn't like the tactics
used against Clinton. It was my vote they were trying to
overturn.'' Will was among more than 50,000 donors from around the
nation gave more than $4.5 million to President Clinton's Legal
Expense Trust in its first year, according to a report released
Wednesday by the trust. In the second half of 1998, there were
1,132 donors from Pennsylvania, about a dozen of whom are from the
Johnstown area. Contributions from the Keystone state came to more
than $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the numbers were made public in June, the trust
had received more than $1.5 million in contributions from about
10,000 people. In the second half of 1998, the trust received $2.2
million from about 29,500 contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of this year, the Trust has received 11,000
additional contributions totaling more than $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Essaye, director of the trust, said they referred to the
impeachment process in direct mailings to potential donors. But
they said donations came in at a steady pace without peaks,
regardless of turns in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort to impeach President Clinton is only the latest in
a series of legal actions that have left the First Family with a
staggering personal debt,'' the letter said. ``If you are disturbed
by the way politics is conducted today, then what better response
than to offer the First Family your own gesture of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six people asked for refunds of their $173 in donations,
after Clinton admitted having an ``improper relationship,'' with
the former White House intern, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trust has already paid $3 million to the lawyers
representing Clinton and the First Lady, in the past six years,
leaving about $6 million in bills that still need to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never set paying off everything as the objective,'' Essaye
said. ``But it is reachable.'' The trust attracted donations from
the likes of entertainer Tony Bennett, who gave $10,000, and writer
Stephen King, who gave $5,000. But half of the donations were $25
or less. About 95 percent of the donations were under $100,
trustees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed by how personal this is for people,'' Essaye
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstown area residents who donated include: Warren Feaster of
Bedford gave $1; Donald Young of Bedford gave $20; Lisa Fetzer of
Bensalem gave $5; Milton Richlin of Bensalem gave $15; Mildred
Zelenko of Bensalem gave $50; Mabel Hornbake of Edensburg gave $50;
Ralph Grove of Indiana gave $40; Pepita Himinez of Indiana gave
$25; Irene Luxenberg of Indiana gave $15; Esther Ondo of Indiana
gave $20; William Glosser of Johnstown, gave $25; Johanna
Mendenhall of Johnstown gave $10.

 By   JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As trading stocks becomes a national pastime, James
J. Cramer, the tireless fund manager, market commentator and
Internet entrepreneur, has scored a hat trick, earning renown as
the Wall Street equivalent of player, coach and owner.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, though, he's been in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   For Cramer-Berkowitz &AMP; Co., Cramer's high-flying, fast-trading
hedge fund, 1998 was the worst year in a decade. Though the fund
produced a positive return of 2 percent after fees for investors,
it fell short of the total return on the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index by about 27 percentage points. The bad year left
Cramer trailing the benchmark index for the last five years, though
he still beats it over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many other hedge funds did poorly in 1998 as well, including
some, like Cramer-Berkowitz, that specialize in U.S. stocks. But
Cramer is not just another hedge-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer-Berkowitz manages about $300 million on behalf of elite
investors who generally put up at least $2.5 million to become
partners in the all-star fund, known for its hybrid strategy of
long-term stock-picking and hyperactive buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer is also one of the investment world's most prolific
journalists, detailing his thoughts about the stock market online,
on air, in print, often many times each day. TheStreet.com, a World
Wide Web-based financial news and analysis service he started, just
announced an initial public offering that aims to raise $75
million. The New York Times Co. is the third-largest shareholder in
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing regularly on CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' stock-talk show and
writing for national magazines as well as on his own Internet
service, Cramer espouses active trading _ he has described his own
pace of buying and selling as manic _ as a way of beating the
market in good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   He has become an icon in the fast-expanding world of Internet
day-traders, a group many analysts see as driving the market these
days.
</P>
<P>
   His columns regularly contain exhortations like this one:
``Moral: Never let a trade turn into an investment. But just
because you are an investor, don't be afraid to trade. I am neither
a trader nor an investor, I am an opportunist. You should be too.''
</P>
<P>
   But last year Cramer-Berkowitz, which Cramer runs with Jeff
Berkowitz, stumbled with their stock picks, the partners said in a
letter to investors obtained by The New York Times. It also
suffered because many investors decided to withdraw money in
October, when the fund's performance was deep in the red and world
financial markets were shaky. The letter said that the fund had to
sell some good stocks at a bad time to return that money.
</P>
<P>
   One investor who made withdrawals was New York Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer, who at the time was running for his post and was
financing an expensive campaign. Two investors who asked not to be
identified said Spitzer's need for campaign funds prompted the
hedge fund to allow redemptions, which by law must be extended to
all investors.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer declined to comment about his relationship with Cramer.
A spokesman for Spitzer confirmed that he had made withdrawals from
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to investors, Cramer and Berkowitz said that
redemptions were one factor hurting the fund's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were also hit, at the worst possible time _ the bottom of
the 1998 market _ with requests for redemptions,'' they wrote.
``Our October opening forced us to sell stocks at precisely the
time we would have been buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Several big investors have stood by Cramer. ``There were many
superb hedge funds that did not have a good year last year,'' said
Martin Peretz, publisher of The New Republic and a longtime Cramer
partner. ``Many have already recouped some of their losses in the
first two months of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer declined to comment about the fund's performance. A
lawyer for the hedge fund said that Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations prohibit Cramer from commenting at this
time.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of last year's weak performance, Cramer-Berkowitz
has strengthened its research department, the partners wrote. The
hedge fund also sold many small company stocks in favor of big
company stocks that make up the main stock market indices.
</P>
<P>
   The partners said that they would not open the fund to
redemptions as often as they had previously, but did not provide
specifics. Unlike mutual funds, which allow redemptions at any
time, hedge funds may require an investment for six months, a year
or more.
</P>
<P>
   In his column for TheStreet.com entitled ``Wrong!,'' Cramer
deals more with day-to-day or even minute-to-minute market action,
than he does with long-term investment strategy. He also keeps
management of Cramer-Berkowitz separate from TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some columns that he wrote in the fall, when his hedge fund
faced the strongest head winds, reveal Cramer's gloominess about
unfavorable markets. But his writing does not flag a change in
investment strategy at Cramer-Berkowitz or give a reader a sense of
how far his trading strategy put him behind the market indices.
</P>
<P>
   He does complain, though, about how the near-collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that was rescued by a
consortium of Wall Street banks and brokerages houses in September,
soured investor sentiment toward hedge funds in general. In one
column he compared Long-Term Capital to the Three Mile Island
nuclear-plant accident 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fallout in hedge fund land hurts those of us who run by
hydro or natural gas or plain old No. 6 oil to generate solid
returns,'' Cramer wrote in late September. ``That's too bad,
because what I do for a living has nothing to do with what the
geniuses at Long Term _ and I use that term loosely _ claimed to be
doing, or were actually doing with investors' dollars.''

</P>
<P>
   Cramer has described his investing as taking two forms _ classic
value investing and shorter-term, trading-oriented transactions.
While it's hard to track the results of Cramer's short-term
trading, it's clear that big losses in several long-term stock
holdings dragged down his performance last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the SEC, Cramer's largest
holding at the end of September was Bay View Capital, a San
Francisco-based bank. But the 1.8 million Bay View shares the fund
then owned, most of which were bought for more than $30 a share,
would now be worth about $19 each.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer's September filing with the SEC, the most recent
available, also shows his second-largest position as being 2.2
million shares of the Fairchild Corp., an aerospace company. Those
shares were bought at an average price of about $16 each, but would
now be worth $12 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Wild market swings that have surprised even the most savvy
traders have continued so far this year, as has Cramer's frustrated
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market needs a double dose of Zyprexa with some lithium
laced in,'' he wrote in a TheStreet.com column this month. ``It has
to stop the manic-depressive behavior before it drives us all
crazy.''

KAMAPA MAYOR   TO SERVE 15 MONTHS IN US FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In halting English, the man dubbed ``the George
Washington of Kampala `` invoked the names he'd pulled from the
history books: Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasser Ntge Sebaggala lingered longest on one name in
particular, the one whose crimes and causes he thought most closely
tracked his own: James Michael Curley.
</P>
<P>
   If the legendary Boston mayor could be pardoned after serving
time in federal prison for mail fraud -- and return triumphantly to
the mayor's seat -- perhaps US District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay
could do the same for Sebaggala, the first democratically-elected
mayor of Uganda's capital city, Kampala, who was convicted in
December of eight charges, including bank fraud and lying to US
Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if an outright pardon wasn't possible, maybe a just a short
prison sentence, like the six months Sebaggala's lawyer, Paul V.
Kelly, had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``His case is similar to mine,'' Sebaggala, speaking alternately
in English and his native Lugandan, said of Boston's popular
political rogue. ``I seek forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, cautioning that Curley wasn't a ``real good example''
of a role model, nonetheless did cut in half the 30-month sentence
recommended by the prosecution, ordering Sebaggala, 51, to prison
for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so, not because Sebaggala's continued absence from
the mayor's office could destabilize a fledgling democracy -- as
Kelly had argued - but because Sebaggala was the sole support of
his elderly blind mother and two young sons, circumstances he
termed ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden to safequard Ugandan democracy, ``should not fall on
me,'' said Lindsay, pointing out that it was Sebaggala's foray into
criminality and subsequent conviction that threatened the stability
of his hometown. Besides the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala must
repay $44,000 to the bank he defrauded and pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sebaggala's political advisor Matthias Nsubuga called
the sentence ``a political disaster.'' Under a deal worked out at
home, Sebaggala could hold on to his office as long as he was
sentenced to no more than 9 months in prison. He has been in
custody -- either under house arrest or in prison -- since he was
arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York last June, one
month after he took office. In his absence, the deputy mayor has
been in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala might be out in time,
but it will be ``close to the line,'' Kelly said. He will get
credit for the time he's been in prison since December awaiting
sentencing, as well as time off for good behavior, perhaps reducing
his actual sentence to about 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nsubuga was among a contigent of more than a dozen supporters,
both from Uganda and the Boston area, who attended Wednesday's
two-hour sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which ended with Sebaggala's conviction Dec. 4, drew
the attention of Ugandans here and abroad. Last fall, 40,000 of
Sebaggala's political supporters signed a petition urging that he
be freed pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan politics even seeped into what was a straightforward
fraud case. There were references to Sebaggala's beatings and
harassment at the hands of former Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, and
to the fact that his children had been granted political asylum in
the United States because of their father's political activities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, jurors were unswayed by suggestions of an
international political conspiracy. Rather, they were convinced by
a paper trial, including deposit slips, letters and doctored checks
with erasure marks.
</P>
<P>
   Sebaggala's trouble began on June 13, 1998 at Kennedy Airport,
where he was charged with lying to customs officials in Boston when
he entered the country on an earlier trip the previous January. He
was also charged with misstating the amount of traveler's checks --
$108,000 in all -- bundled in packages in his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a federal grand jury in Boston charged
Sebaggala, who owned a foreign currency exchange in Uganda, with
depositing four stolen and altered checks into an account at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   One check, originally made out to another party for $400, was
changed to $44,000 and made payable to Sebaggalla, according to
evidence presented at trial. Another check, originally for 99
cents, was changed to $39,000 and made payable to Sebaggala.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With science outpacing military tradition, the
Pentagon has concluded that it will not place new remains from the
Vietnam War in the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National
Cemetery in Virginia, senior officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after a set of remains were removed from the tomb
and later identified as those of 1st Lt. Michael Blassie, the
officials said that scientific advances, including new genetic
tests, had now all but eliminated the chance that any recovered
remains from the war would remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's conclusion signals the end of a military rite
that dates in this country to the Civil War, when 2,011 unknown
soldiers were honored by a granite tomb at Arlington, just across
the Potomac River from here.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pentagon now taking DNA samples from everyone who joins
the military, there is little chance that future wars will produce
unidentifiable remains, meaning no other crypts are likely to join
those at the tomb honoring unknown soldiers who died in World War
I, World War II and the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who by law oversees the tomb
of the Unknowns, has not made a final decision on the tomb's fate.
But in the weeks ahead, Cohen is expected to select one of a
variety of proposals for what to do with the now-empty crypt that
for 14 years held the ``unknown'' remains of Blassie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll handle this in a dignified way that provides some
closure,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said, adding
that Cohen concurred with the conclusion that no new remains will
be placed in the tomb. ``We need to find some fitting and proper
way to honor'' those who died in Vietnam, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 2,069 Americans missing from the Vietnam War,
and some 200 sets of bones, teeth and other remains await
identification in an Army laboratory in Hawaii. But with
painstaking detective work continuing and archeological digs under
way in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the Pentagon's experts are
steadily reducing the list of the unaccounted. The officials said
it was impossible now to declare any remains unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday, for example, three more servicemen were
identified more than 30 years after they died, two in Vietnam and
one in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have another candidate for the tomb,'' Rudy De
Leon, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness,
said in an interview. ``Potentially, all the remains are
identifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   De Leon's office has collected suggestions from a variety of
veterans' groups and organizations representing the families of the
missing. One of the ideas _ submitted by the National League of
Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia _
would install a plaque near the tomb that declared, ``In honor of
those still missing, this crypt remains forever empty.'' Another
proposal would inscribe ``in memory of'' on the white marble tablet
that covers the crypt.
</P>
<P>
   Congress authorized the interment of an unknown soldier in 1973,
shortly after the United States ended its involvement in Vietnam's
civil war. It was not until 1984, though, that remains from Vietnam
were laid to rest in the tomb during an emotional state funeral led
by President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Cohen ordered the reopening of the tomb after evidence
emerged that the remains inside _ four ribs, the right humerus and
part of the pelvis _ belonged to Blassie, a decorated Air Force
pilot shot down near An Loc in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A genetic test not available in 1984 positively matched DNA
samples taken from the remains with a blood sample from Blassie's
mother. On July 11, Blassie was buried in a full military funeral
in the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, near his childhood
home outside St. Louis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Arlington, little has outwardly changed at the tomb, which
was dedicated on Armistice Day in 1921. After Blassie's remains
were removed, workers sealed the crypt and replaced the marble
tablet, marked now, as it was before, with the duration of American
involvement in Southeast Asia, 1958-1975.
</P>
<P>
   To the side, a sign explaining the tomb's history has been
updated to include a last paragraph about Blassie's case. ``The
crypt is presently empty,'' it concludes, ``but it serves as a
tribute to all those who made the supreme sacrifice during the
Vietnam Conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnie E. Webb Jr., the deputy commander at the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, said the law requires any
remains that might be a candidate for the tomb be absolutely
unidentifiable. But almost all the remains from Vietnam have at
least some biographical or forensic evidence that could,
eventually, help identify them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new genetic tests, in many cases, simply put lingering
doubts to rest. Even newly recovered remains that keep arriving
from excavation sites in Southeast Asia are likely to be
identified, because a separate agency in Hawaii, the Joint Task
Force-Full Accounting, has meticulously compiled every known fact
about the 2,069 still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start with a pretty good idea of who the remains might
be,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of this, De Leon's office has been considering what to do
next. The idea of removing the crypt altogether was considered, but
then rejected, said Jack C. Metzler, the superintendent of
Arlington National Cemetery. Now the focus has shifted to some
acknowledgment at the tomb itself of the Vietnam era. ``Until we
have a full accounting, the tomb will stand for those who are still
missing,'' Metzler said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of having no remains from Vietnam has generated
mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Mills Griffiths, the executive director of the National
League of Families, said the end of the tradition of interring
unknown remains should be celebrated. ``If we're lucky, there will
never again be another unknown,'' she said. ``The nation will never
have to deal with that again. And that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, veterans' organizations had lobbied
intensively for the inclusion of a Vietnam-era serviceman,
believing that this bestowed recognition to a bitter, divisive war.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans of Foreign Wars has publicly called on the Pentagon
to ``make every effort'' to inter another set of unidentified
remains. Bruce R. Harder, the VFW's director of national security
and foreign affairs, said it was premature to conclude that all
those missing would be eventually be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed a plaque or some other inscription to mark an empty
tomb, he said, because it would not ``provide the same level of
status and sanctity as putting a set of remains there.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Budahn, a spokesman for the American Legion, said his
organization felt torn. ``It was certainly a high priority for the
Vietnam generation to have somebody there,'' he said. ``At the same
time, for every person in the tomb, there's one more American
family that doesn't have a set of remains to lay to rest. That can
be a high price to pay for symbolism.''

MUSEUM SEEKS TO RETURN PLUNDERED PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It measures just 5 by 10 inches. But the 16th-century
Flemish landscape by Herri met de Bles has been housed in two of
this century's most dissimilar art collections since it was whisked
out of the Netherlands after the Nazi occupation in May 1940.
</P>
<P>
   For the duration of World War II, it was in the notorious
private collection of Nazi Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering, a
collection of art looted or ``bought'' at gunpoint in occupied
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1946, an American dealer sold the de Bles to the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts, whose documents suggest the museum was
indifferent to its ownership history.
</P>
<P>
   Like other paintings that passed through soiled hands during and
after the war, the landscape raises embarrassing questions about
the postwar policies of museums such as the MFA, which first
learned 51 years ago that the painting might have been illicitly
traded during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Griffin, the MFA's spokeswoman, said the museum is eager to
return the landscape as soon as the evidence establishes its
rightful ownership. The MFA, she said, is continuing to search its
records to ensure that the rest of its artworks have no wartime
taint.
</P>
<P>
   No museum, Griffin noted, is immune from the possibility that it
might have inadvertently acquired art after the war that had been
looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch first alerted the MFA in 1948 that the painting had
been taken from Holland by the Nazis, according to MFA
correspondence obtained by the Globe. That year, Dutch authorities
asked for its return, but the MFA's director at the time, G. H.
Edgell, insisted that the Dutch provide ``definite'' evidence it
had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, trying to rebuild their country in the chaos of
post-war Europe, dropped the claim. And so, for 50 years, the MFA
shelved the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But last March, soon after the Globe raised questions about
other MFA post-war acquisitions and amid growing international
attention to Nazi-looted art, the museum discovered documents from
1948 and contacted the Dutch government with an offer to return the
painting if the Dutch would provide the long-overdue evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dutch officials said they are about to do so, and
they praised the MFA for coming forward to settle a case that
present-day Dutch officials say they were unaware of.
</P>
<P>
   To some art specialists, the tale of the tiny painting
underscores persistent moral issues that confront the art world,
including the eagerness of postwar collectors and curators to
acquire paintings like the de Bles even though the works crossed
the Atlantic with suspicious pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, for instance, the MFA's director unapologetically
acknowledged to the Dutch that the museum had virtually no
information about the prior ownership of the de Bles.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is even more awkward for the Netherlands. More than 90
percent of Dutch Jews perished in the Holocaust, by far the highest
rate in Western Europe. Recent public outrage has led to the
creation of a commission to examine why 90 percent of the artworks
recovered from the Nazis after the war, including major works by
Rembrandt, remain unclaimed in Dutch museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch government behaved despicably after the war and was
so intent on keeping the looted art that they dispossessed their
own citizens,'' Christine A. Koenigs, whose grandfather owned the
de Bles until 1940, said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs, who lives in Amsterdam, holds the Dutch, and not the
MFA, accountable. But others take a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch incompetence does not excuse five decades of inaction by
the MFA,'' said Willi Korte, a specialist in locating Nazi-looted
art who is not involved in the de Bles case.
</P>
<P>
   If the MFA needed evidence to support the claim, it arrived
unsolicited last July when Koenigs filed her own claim. She
included documents that leave little doubt that the artwork, like
tens of thousands of others, was a casualty of the war. The
documents, she said, were in official Dutch files in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents Koenigs has is a copy of a list of 19 of
Franz Koenigs's paintings that Goering acquired in 1940, including
receipts signed by Goering's administrative assistant at Carinhall,
his palace outside Berlin. The de Bles painting, ``Burning City,''
is on the list. Evidence that the painting was in Goering's illicit
collection has long been publicly available in the US National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   For the MFA, the case of the de Bles landscape is the latest in
a series of disclosures that raise questions about the museum's
collecting ethics. Those questions encompass both its postwar
acquisition of paintings and its recent acquisitions of antiquities
that the museum had reason to believe had been illegally taken from
grave sites in countries such as Italy and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other European paintings the MFA has acquired since
the 1940s have ownership histories that, according to art
specialists, raise suspicions they might have been looted during
the war. The MFA has refused to say whether it has subsequently
investigated the history of those artworks.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a panel of the Association of Art Museum Directors
that included the current MFA director, Malcolm Rogers, pledged
that AAMD members would look for evidence any of their art had been
looted by the Nazis, would deal ``promptly'' with any claims, and
would publicly disclose if any of their artworks had been illegally
confiscated during World War II and not restituted.
</P>
<P>
   Until asked Wednesday, the MFA had said nothing about the de
Bles. When the Globe inquired late last year whether the museum had
found any evidence of looted Nazi art in its collection, the MFA
sidestepped the question. ``We have no specific discoveries to
report to the Globe,'' the museum replied.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last March, according to Bob G.C. Lodder, the deputy
director of the Cultural Heritage Department of the Dutch Ministry
of Culture, Rogers wrote to the Dutch government about the de Bles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MFA contacted us to say they had been looking at their
records on this painting and had found some very strange things,''
Lodder said Wednesday. ``When we checked our own records, it became
clear the painting was ours.'' The Boston museum, he said, should
be praised for coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, when the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam asked that the de
Bles be returned, MFA director Edgell wrote that the MFA's trustees
``would return the painting to the Boymans Museum when definite
proof is given us that it was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Edgell admitted that the MFA knew almost nothing about the
landscape's origin. ``The dealer can tell us little beyond the fact
that the picture was bought in a small auction room in New York,
the owner of which says that the picture came to him from Chicago.
We are trying to get more information about its history but
probably shall not succeed,'' Edgell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Though the MFA was uncertain about the work's history, Edgell
told the Dutch that he thought it likely the painting ``may have
left the Koenigs collection before it was seized by the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Edgell concluded, ``We are not hedging and certainly
have no intention of being receivers of stolen goods, but equally
you will realize that our trustees cannot return a painting without
definite legal proof that it was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Korte, who has represented several victims of Nazi art looting
who have made claims against American museums, said there is a
double standard implicit in Edgell's 1948 explanation, one that
echoes through other cases in which museums have resisted claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same trustees and curators, who ask no questions, who
raise no suspicions when they acquire a painting, and who have no
records of where the painting came from, all of a sudden develop
very high standards of proof when a claimant comes along,'' Korte
said.
</P>
<P>
   How the de Bles landscape ended up in Chicago is unclear, but
Korte said it is likely that one of the American GIs who liberated
Carinhall took the miniature painting home in his duffel bag as a
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complex manner in which Franz Koenigs's massive
collection was lost, Korte said, the only issue is whether the
painting belongs to the Koenigs family or the Dutch government.
Lodder made it clear Wednesday that the government believes it owns
the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Koenigs was a wealthy German businessman who emigrated to
the Netherlands in 1931, bringing one of Europe's most
extraordinary art collections. It included numerous paintings,
among them the de Bles landscape and many works by Rubens. More
importantly, Koenigs had one of the world's best collections of Old
Master drawings, 2,144 in all.
</P>
<P>
   But Koenigs, who was not Jewish, fell on hard times, and used
the collection as collateral for a loan from a Jewish-owned bank.
With the Nazi invasion imminent, the bank was advised to liquidate
its holdings, selling most of Koenigs's collection and consigning
35 paintings to an art dealer to be sold. After the Nazi invasion,
the dealership was taken over by a Nazi art procurer, who sold 19
of the paintings, including the de Bles, to Goering.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1943 Allied declaration, adopted as law by the Dutch,
all wartime sales to Germans in Occupied Europe were deemed null
and void. Dutch policy, which has come under fire from claimants
like Koenigs, declares the state the owner of works that were sold,
even in questionable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In Koenigs's case, hundreds of his drawings were seized by
occupying Soviet forces and kept as war reparations. Those that
were returned, including many of the paintings from Carinhall, have
been kept by the Dutch government, despite Christine Koenigs's
insistence that her grandfather would have retained his collection
but for the invasion and the bank liquidation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three dogs without leashes took off in joyous pursuit
of a 47-year-old architect last week while all four were out for a
morning's run in Manhattan's Riverside Park.
</P>
<P>
   One dog bit the architect's ankle. Another urinated on a
shoulder bag he had dropped. The architect complained furiously to
city, state and federal officials about a ``tyranny of the
minority.'' But he did not want his name published, saying that he
feared a backlash from militant dog owners in his Upper West Side
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Dog wars: a chronic conflict made worse by New Yorkers who are
owning bigger, stronger, more robust dogs. As never before, tens of
thousands of big dogs who loathe the leash are lunging out of
apartments to do what dogs must do in city parks that are better
maintained, safer and more crowded than they have been in decades.
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   So to preserve Central Park and especially Riverside Park, which
the city regards as ground zero in the dog wars, Parks Commissioner
Henry J. Stern announced stiffer fines, increased enforcement and a
public-relations campaign Wednesday that attempts to equate dog
owners who violate leash laws with smokers.
</P>
<P>
   By getting tough on free-range dogs _ an echo of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's quality-of-life crackdown on everything from squeegee
men to jaywalking to chewing-gum spitters _ the city hopes to
persuade dog owners that it is unhealthful, inconsiderate and even
shameful to let dogs run free.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might call them dog terrorists,'' Stern said. ``They let
them off leash at all times, frighten other people, especially
children, and trample the public lawns.'' He added, though, that
these ``arrogant and abusive'' New Yorkers are a relatively small
percentage of dog owners.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the gussied-up parks and the people who use them,
Stern said he is proposing a doubling in fines for repeat violators
of leash and pooper-scooper laws. The $100 fine will double, he
said, for second-time offenders and double again and again for
subsequent violations to a limit of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stern also said the Parks Department would invite more police
into the parks, build a data base of habitual dog-law violators and
outfit civilians with radios and cell phones so they can report dog
owners who violate canine-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside Park dog owners have reacted angrily to efforts to
restrict dogs. When fences were put up to block dog access to a
popular play field for off-leash dogs, owners put up signs that
called the enclosure ``Treblinka.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the largest dog-owner group in Riverside Park
responded Wednesday to the proposed crackdown with a plea for space
for dogs to run free of leashes and a veiled threat of civil
disobedience if such space is not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is not sufficient space for people to play with one's
dog off leash, then people either will feel persecuted or forced
into what the commissioner considers antisocial behavior,'' said
Dr. Jeffrey Zahn, an anesthesiologist who is president of the dog
group, FLORAL.
</P>
<P>
   Stern would tend to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see in Riverside Park there is a fringe of very intense
dog owners,'' he said. ``These owners when ticketed give names such
as Eva Braun. They cast themselves as victims of authority. They
hope a gullible press will see their victimhood. In fact, it is
mothers and children who use the parks who are the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern stressed in the interview that he is not anti-dog and that
he owns and loves a golden retriever named Boomer, who the
commissioner's aides insist is never allowed off his leash. ``I
really believe that owning and relating to an animal is a
life-enriching experience,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of law, dogs have no right to run free anywhere in
New York. They lost that right 123 years ago when Frederick Law
Olmsted, who designed Central and Riverside parks, personally wrote
a set of rules that tethered them to a leash not more than 6 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the 1970s and early 1980s, when many parks were
ill-maintained and relatively empty because of crime, the Parks
Department did not much care if dogs ranged off leash. In those
years, park managers saw dogs and their owners as a civilizing
influence. Better the depredation of dogs, they reasoned, than the
marauding of muggers and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those dark days that dogs and owners wrested an
informal but crucial concession from the parks department. Dogs
have since been allowed off-leash in parks between 9 p.m. and 9
a.m. At the time, it hardly mattered. There wasn't much carefully
tended greenery for dogs to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade, at a cost of many millions of dollars,
desolate, no-go landscapes in city parks have been restored. Crime
has fallen as steeply in parks as in the rest of the city. And the
dog presence that once helped stabilize the parks has become, in
the view of Adrian Benepe, commissioner of parks in Manhattan,
``our biggest problem.'' The Parks Department estimated Wednesday
that it spends $250,000 a year in Central and Riverside parks to
repair damage done by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The informal off-leash concession, though, has evolved into what
many dog owners see as a God-given right. Some Parks administrators
say that by giving dog owners the off-leash night, they have
inadvertently encouraged them to seize the off-leash day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relaxing of the rules doesn't win us any cooperation,''
said Charles E. McKinney, administrator of Riverside Park. ``In
fact, it has encouraged more people to have dogs off leash during
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, for the moment at least, is unwilling to challenge the
informal agreement that lets dogs run free at night and in the
early morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about things that happen during the day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Park managers are convinced that the problem of dogs being off
leash, both in the permitted night and the illicit day, is
compounded by the size of the offending dogs. ``One now sees in
Central Park and Riverside Park a larger dog than one typically saw
in a New York City setting,'' Benepe said. ``A big dog running
circles on a dormant park lawn can do a lot of damage. They kick up
divots like a golf club.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dog owners regard such statements as ill-informed, unfair
and profoundly offensive. While they acknowledge that dogs can
damage park land, owners contend that ball players, frolicking
children and homeless people are also to blame. They say that the
best way for park officials to limit dog damage is to work in good
faith with responsible owners _ and refrain from saying hurtful
things about dogs.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, many dog owners say that their dogs _ particularly
their big dogs _ have an inalienable right to run off-leash. When
parks do not honor that right, they say, there is bound to be
blatant disregard for leash laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we be deprived of all nature?'' said Madeleine Dale, a
founder of FLORAL, who runs in Riverside Park with her 85-pound
Scottish deerhound _ off leash, of course. ``Should we be deprived
of all courtesy? I would hate to see Manhattan become that kind of
heartless place.''

LAWMAKERS TO SEEK PEACE AT A RETREAT ON `CONGENIALITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., Mich., N.C., Ohio, Ill., Ga., Md., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The oft-feuding, bitterly divided,
impeachment-scarred Democrats and Republicans in the House have
decided to give peace a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of the man who helped broker the Northern
Ireland peace talks, members of both parties plan to travel
off-campus next month to a retreat in Hershey, Pa., where they can
be themselves, vent their ire and learn to try to get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this opportunity,'' Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
said Wednesday, speaking at a podium decorated with silver-wrapped
Hershey's Kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are tired of seeing their politics
degenerate into rancor and personal attacks,'' said Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., making a pitch to his fellow Democrats to attend
the three-day retreat that begins March 19. ``I believe this
Congress faces no more important challenge than making democracy
work again in a manner that is civil and respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   A chartered Amtrak train is to take lawmakers from Washington to
the retreat, and while leaders of both parties are encouraging
members to go, not everyone is on board. Some members are
suspicious, believing that the retreat will make little real
difference and wary of being portrayed as part of a happy face that
the leaders want to stamp on the new Congress. (Rep. Eva Clayton,
D-N.C., said that the chocolate Kisses were ``a little too
simplistic'' a symbol for the retreat. ``It's not `kiss and make
up,' '' she cautioned.)
</P>
<P>
   The event, financed with $700,000 from the nonprofit Pew
Charitable Trust, is a reprise of a similar ``civility'' retreat
held in Hershey in 1997. With a nod to an apparent desire by both
sides for longer-lasting results, the organizers have invited John
Hume, leader of the Social and Democratic Labor Party, who won the
Nobel Peace Prize for 1998 for his efforts in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can bring peace in Ireland, perhaps he can bring peace
here in the halls of Congress,'' said a hopeful Rep. Ray LaHood,
R-Ill., who drew attention by presiding in the speaker's chair last
year during the House impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Hershey roster is Sam Waterston, the actor noted for
his stage portrayals of Abraham Lincoln. Waterston has employed a
team of historians and dramatists to gather Lincoln excerpts that
will be, in the words of Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, ``suitable to our
current circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers have also altered the moniker by which they want
the retreat to be known. Instead of ``civility,'' they are calling
it the ``congeniality'' retreat. One aide explained the distinction
this way: `` Civility is just, `Oh, hello,' but congeniality is,
`Let's grab lunch, let's grab a drink, we're all in this together.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Still, bruised feelings seem to be the order of the day in the
House, the result of both the tempestuous tenure of former Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and the searing impeachment ordeal. Democrats
are also feeling aggrieved over what they perceive as unfair
treatment at the hands of the majority Republicans. For example,
most committees have a higher ratio of Republicans to Democrats
that is out of proportion to their overall numbers in the House
(222 Republicans compared with 211 Democrats). In addition,
Democrats complain that their committee staffs are vastly
underfinanced.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Democrats are talking privately about boycotting
the event. ``A lot of our people are angry, but a lot of them are
going,'' said a Democratic leadership aide. ``There's no reason to
think that after what we just went through, with them trying to
throw out the leader of our party, that we're all suddenly going to
be buddies. That's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, like Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, are attending
the retreat but intend to air their grievances. Bonior said that
this could be useful. ``We're encouraging people to come and vent
their frustrations and their ideas,'' he said. He said the party
was meeting ``some resistance'' but expected that more than half
the Democrats would show up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that more than half of their members would
attend too, but there were signs that all was not well on that side
of the aisle either. Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., lamented that some
Republicans would not appear and they were the ones who ``need it
the most.'' Asked how many members of the House Judiciary Committee
would attend, LaHood said quickly: ``Next question!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday's news conference, with its bipartisan display and the
announcement of speakers _ who will also include Doris Kearns
Goodwin, the historian _ was intended to persuade more members to
sign up.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, LaHood suggested that even if Democratic griping
was not officially sanctioned, it would happen anyway. ``When you
get 200 freely elected politicians in a room, you're not going to
tell them what they can and cannot say,'' he said. ``People deviate
from agendas all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was also intended as a signal to Pew that
the retreat is worthy of support.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Rimel, president of the Pew trust, based in
Philadelphia, said in an interview: ``A week ago there was a little
bit of higher anxiety, but I understand they've turned the
corner.'' She said she understood that more than 140 members had
signed up so far, about 60 percent of them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that the hope was that it be a majority and
the requirement is that it be bipartisan,'' she said. ``Given all
that's transpired over the last six months, the planning committee
needs to see if it can excite people about the agenda and get
people committed to the time.''

 &HT;        DELLUMS' NEW BOOK A TRIBUTE TO PACIFISM   By Mark
Stricherz  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 -- When he was in Congress, former Oakland
Representative Ron Dellums was rarely accused of being unambitious,
as was demonstrated during the early 1970's when he held a war
crimes tribunal to protest the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is out of Congress, Dellums may be relaxing a bit
more, but he isn't exactly loafing around either. Aside from trying
to head off Africa's AIDS epidemic, Dellums is writing an
autobiography, which is scheduled to be released this fall by
Beacon Press. A former aide, Lee Halterman, is his co-author.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively entitled ``A Warrior for Peace'' or ``Journey for
Peace,'' Dellums' book will focus on the Oakland-native's main
devotion during his political life: pacifism. It's the cause that
first won him a seat in 1967 on the Berkeley City Council, when he
ran as anti-war candidate. That same activism ricocheted back at
him in Congress, when, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
he opposed using force against North Korea in 1994 during a
stand-off over nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   As a New Republic article once noted, Dellums said in 1971 his
philosophy was based on the idea that ``violence is totally
nonproductive even in revolutionary terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about peace 28 years later, Dellums sounds positively
wistful that the values he embraced during the 1950s and '60s are
now out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep the romantic ideals of the '60s alive,''
Dellums said of his current employer, the all-black Healthcare
International Management Co. ``We feel we're responsible for our
brothers and sisters -- the kind of spirit you don't see in the
late '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many in his generation, Dellums credits Martin Luther King,
Jr. for leading his embrace of non-violence. But Dellums also cites
his uncle, C.L. Dellums, who was a lesser known but leading civil
rights figure during the 1920s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   C.L. Dellums, whose name now graces a train station in Oakland's
Jack London Square, made his name by teaming up with A. Philip
Randolph to organize the Brotherhood Sleeping Car Porters. The
group, which organized the first civil rights march on Washington
in 1941, helped establish a series of victories in labor law for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on stories that stressed the danger of organizing.
During the '20s black people had to have a lot of audacity to fight
for civil rights. If you worked in states like Utah and California,
like my uncle did, and they threw you off the train, well, you got
thrown off the train. How you going to get home as a black
person?''
</P>
<P>
   While C.L. Dellums died in 1989, he was able to see his nephew
rise to prominence in the Bay Area's leftist politics during the
1960s, an ascension that began after a three-year stint in the
Marine Corps in the 1950s. He graduated from San Francisco State
College in 1960, worked as a psychiatric social worker, and won the
Berkeley-Oakland congressional seat in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   During his 27-year tenure in Congress, Dellums was renowned for
not only opposing many of the largest military spending items, such
as the B-2 bomber and the MX missile. He also was known for
objecting to some military spending in his own district -- most
notably, in 1993, the recommendation to pull the plug on the
Alameda Naval Air Station, which employed 11,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dellums' commitment to pacifism was such that the closest he
came toward advocating military involvement was during the Haiti
crisis of the mid-1990s, though he did not recommend the immediate
dispatch of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Dellums models himself after his uncle, he maintains
he has his own causes. Like Africa and the AIDS epidemic. ``To say
we should sit around while 20 million people die in the next 10
years, I say, to hell with it,'' he declares, sounding not unlike
his uncle.

BOEING PROMISES STRICT SELF-DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 18 tumultuous months during which it posted its first
annual loss in 50 years and saw its stock price take a nose dive,
Boeing Co. has decided that it is time to get serious.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Wall Street analysts in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday,
Philip Condit, the chairman and chief executive, said that Boeing,
the world's largest aerospace company and the country's
single-largest exporter, was reviewing all its operations in a
relentless effort to increase profits. Any program that did not
measure up would either be dropped or sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing escapes scrutiny here,'' he explained later during a
conference call with reporters. ``There are no sacred cows.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary assessment done by the company found that about 10
percent, or $1.3 billion, of it $13 billion in equity is invested
in money-losing operations. Another $2 billion is invested in
operations that merely break even. The good news was that 25
percent of the equity was making a better return than the most
profitable companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hopkins, Boeing's new chief financial officer, who was
hired from General Motors Corp. late last year to introduce some
long-overdue financial discipline, said the company would fix or
eliminate its ``value-destroying'' operations and maximize the
returns on those that hovered near profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a program of the month or a flavor of the month,''
she said during the same conference call. ``This is the way we are
going to run the business at Boeing. Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That tough talk could translate into some wrenching decisions
for Boeing, such as canceling the slow-selling new 100-seat 717
passenger jet that it inherited when it bought McDonnell Douglas
Corp. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It could also heighten tensions with the International
Association of Machinists, Boeing's largest union, as the two sides
approach contract negotiations later this year. Included in
Boeing's review will be a decision on whether it makes more sense
to continue producing components itself or to buy them from outside
suppliers _ a hot-button issue for the union.
</P>
<P>
   And it also raises questions whether Boeing, which was
catapulted to its current prominence in large part by daring to
build a new airplane _ the 747 _ that nearly sank the company
before becoming one of its biggest successes, will ever be able to
take the same kind of high-stakes risks that have characterized the
commercial aerospace industry since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Condit has been talking about increasing shareholder value at
Boeing for years. His credibility with Wall Street was stretched to
the breaking point last year after his assurances that things were
improving repeatedly turned into additional quarterly charges and a
steady decline in the company's profit targets.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's 1998 performance was so poor _ its stock declined 32
percent _ that Condit and Harry Stonecipher, the former chief
executive at McDonnell Douglas who is now Boeing's president, will
not receive annual bonuses, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who attended the meeting welcomed Boeing's latest
moves, though they said they were long overdue and short on
specifics. ``It is amazing that we are at this point and they are
only now figuring out how to drop the losers and keep the
winners,'' said Nicholas Heymann, an aerospace analyst with
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said, ``There
is no reason why there won't be a certain amount of cynicism by
investors partially because these changes can't happen overnight.''
Boeing stock closed Wednesday at $35.625, down $1.75.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lately, Boeing's operations seem to be improving. The company
predicts that revenue will fall to $49 billion in 2000 after
peaking at $58 billion this year due to a record number of
commercial airplane deliveries. Operating profit margins are
expected to range between 3.5 and 5 percent in 2000 compared with
an estimate of 4 to 5 percent this year. But on Wednesday Ms.
Hopkins said that operating margins would not dip in 2000 despite
the lower revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving its current operations and selling off
some businesses, like its commercial helicopter unit, Boeing has
revived the idea of expanding into aerospace services like airplane
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 10,683 Boeing jets flying around the world,'' Ms.
Hopkins said. ``The question is: What are we doing to capture our
fair share of that services market? And the answer today is: not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said that expanding into services such as overhauling
jets for airlines would create new jobs that could counter cuts in
other parts of the company.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also cause some diplomatic problems for the company
because many of its largest airline customers are also competing in
the services arena. Condit said he was aware of the problem but
thought there were enough opportunities for Boeing to steer clear
of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins said she did not believe that Boeing's new approach
would make it more risk averse. ``It is not that we are not going
to take a risk,'' she said. ``We are just going to understand it
when we do.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Boeing, which has traditionally been insular and
tight-lipped, would be sharing a lot more information with
investors and the public from now on. At the end of June, she will
disclose a variety of measures, like inventory turnover, that both
company executives and investors can use to gauge Boeing's
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to look at all businesses using the same
methodology,'' she said. ``It's called discipline. That is what
this is. This is very strong discipline.''

   WASHINGTON _ The United States has national and humanitarian
interests in resolving the conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton
said on Wednesday in justifying the planned dispatch of American
troops as part of an international peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
   And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there was no
chance that peace can be achieved in Kosovo without an
international military presence in Serbia's rebellious province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the United States have an immediate, selfish interest in
what happens on some lonely road in Kosovo to some poor farm family
driving a wagon with horses that are underfed because they haven't
been able to get food? No,'' Clinton said at a news conference on
Wednesday afternoon. ``But the United States does have a direct
interest in whether there is instability in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the United States has a humanitarian
obligation to end the conflict, which has left more than 1,000
Kosovo civilians dead and as many as 400,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at a joint news conference with Jerry Rawlings,
the president of Ghana, who is in Washington on a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, testifying on Kosovo before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Wednesday, said that 17 days of peace talks
at Rambouillet, France, had failed to produce a breakthrough, but
that the negotiations had not completely collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having returned from Rambouillet,'' Albright said, ``I can
also tell you there is zero chance that the Kosovar Albanians will
sign on to this deal if the U.S. does not participate in its
implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments on Wednesday were designed to press ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo to approve a tentative peace settlement with
Serbia, from which they are seeking autonomy and eventual
independence. The United States and its European allies hope to use
agreement by the Kosovo Albanians to bring pressure on Slobodan
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, to accept an international
military presence on Serbian soil.
</P>
<P>
   If both sides agree to the pact negotiated over the past two
weeks, 28,000 NATO peacekeepers would be interposed between Serbian
forces and the Kosovo rebels. The international force would include
4,000 Americans under current plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet talks broke up on Tuesday to allow time for the
ethnic Albanian leaders at the negotiations to return to Kosovo to
consult with their constituents. The talks are to resume on March
15.
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials fear that Milosevic will use the
intervening days to step up attacks against the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the separatist rebel group, and to prepare a larger military
offensive with the approach of warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned Milosevic against any such action, telling him
that a spring offensive would be a ``grave mistake'' and that NATO
would not hesitate to respond with force. In the current crisis,
however, it has so far been cautious about entering the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he allowed two deadlines to pass in the Kosovo
talks because the parties were making progress. Just last Friday,
the president said it would be a mistake to extend the deadline,
then set for Saturday and later moved to Tuesday, and warned
Milosevic that NATO airstrikes were inevitable and imminent if he
did not accede to Western terms for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, Clinton said he was willing to let the
deadlines slip because both sides wanted more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' Clinton said, ``what they did in the peace
talks was to reach an agreement that they had gone as far as they
could, but they did not want to give up and disintegrate into
violence. So when we agreed to extend, we were basically agreeing
to what both parties wished to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that Milosevic continues to oppose a NATO
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, on the ground that it violates
Serbian sovereignty. But Clinton said that without such a force,
there is no way to keep the warring parties from each other's
throats.

VICTIM'S FAMILY FILES SUIT AGAINST T-SHIRT SELLERS IN JASPER 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ As jurors at the Jasper County Courthouse
listened Wednesday to testimony on punishment for a white
supremacist convicted in the dragging death of a black man, the
victim's family was filing suit against T-shirt sellers outside.
</P>
<P>
   Eligah ``Ricky'' Jason, a Beaumont, Texas, singer with the duo
Colorblind, said sheriff's deputies served him with the lawsuit and
a temporary injunction Wednesday morning and closed down his
sidewalk stand across the street from the courthouse, where he had
been selling T-shirts, hats and compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the nonprofit James Byrd Jr. Foundation for
Racial Healing filed a breach of contract lawsuit in state district
court, alleging that Jason and his singing partner, Robin Zaruba,
had failed to obtain prior approval to sell the merchandise outside
the courthouse and had not turned over the foundation's portion of
the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement, a permit, a license,'' Jason said. ``We
intend to donate 10 percent of the T-shirt sales and 10 percent of
the BMI royalties from the album to the Byrd family. We were
supposed to be together on this. It was a joint deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Verrett, Byrd's nephew and executive director of the
foundation, acknowledged that he had signed an agreement with
Colorblind, allowing them to use Byrd's name, photograph and
likeness for commercial purposes. But he said he never gave the
singers permission to sell the T-shirts outside the courthouse
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says Verrett terminated the agreement Feb. 16, the
first day of testimony in the capital murder trial of John William
``Bill'' King. The lawsuit says Jason continued to sell the
T-shirts without permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really the money,'' Verrett said during a break in
the court proceedings. ``It was tacky and undignified, selling them
out there during the trial. They didn't have prior approval for
that. It's a simple breach of contract. We asked them to stop and
they wouldn't, so we had to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason, who stood outside the courthouse with a copy of his
agreement, his permits, his lawsuit and a framed ``certificate of
appreciation'' signed by Byrd's parents last September, said he
approached the Byrd family shortly after last summer's killing and
told them he wanted to dedicate his album of religious music to the
49-year-old disabled man who had suffered such a brutal death.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial began, he and two friends have been selling
T-shirts with a portrait of Byrd on the front and an ad for
Colorblind's CD, ``Love, Peace and Harmony,'' on the back, along
with the CD itself, which carries an extensive dedication to Byrd,
and hats touting ``Trial of the Century, Jasper, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason estimated they had sold $5,000 to $6,000 worth of the
merchandise to reporters and trial spectators, and intended to give
the Byrd foundation its share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really upset,'' he said. ``I've been friends with these
people. They've stayed at my house. I've eaten at their house. We
never wanted to hurt the Byrd family. We wanted to help them.''

OLIVETTI MANEUVERS TO GAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR TELECOM BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Opening a new round in the fight for control of Italy's
biggest phone company, Olivetti SpA approved some technical steps
Wednesday that are required by stock market regulators for it to
proceed with a $60 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's moves, which included raising billions of dollars in
new capital and the sale of an Olivetti communications business to
Mannesmann AG, a German partner, came after hours of meetings in
Milan of Olivetti officials with lawyers and investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were intended to overcome objections of Italian stock
market regulators, who on Monday invalidated an earlier Olivetti
bid for Telecom Italia, which is five times Olivetti's size.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti, a typewriter maker turned computer company and then
communications provider, has struggled in recent years Yet its
audacious effort to purchase Telecom Italia represents one of the
biggest hostile takeover attempts by any company.
</P>
<P>
   Resubmitting a valid bid for Telecom Italia quickly is a crucial
piece of Olivetti's strategy. Under Italian takeover law, a company
cannot take defensive steps once a valid offer has been made.
</P>
<P>
   But late Wednesday night, it was still unclear whether
Olivetti's steps were sufficient to validate its bid. In addition,
there was surprising news that the bid price of 10 euros a share,
or $11, for all of Telecom Italia's voting stock would not be
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, buoyed by hopes that Olivetti would sweeten the
offer, had pushed up Telecom Italia's share price Wednesday by 5
percent, to 10.06 euros, or $11.06, adding $2.6 billion to the
market value of the phone provider's common stock. In New York, the
American depository receipts of Telecom Italia closed up 2.5
percent, at $109.6875. Olivetti shares, which had fallen for two
days, gained half a percent, to 2.92 euros.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even without a sweetened price, officials close to Olivetti,
Italy's No. 2 phone company, remained confident that the bid would
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures approved Wednesday was an enormous bond issue
of $15 billion by Tecnost SpA, the Olivetti unit that will be used
to make the bid. Olivetti officials cited a strong rating expected
to be given the bondsby Standard &AMP; Poor's as a sign of confidence
in the bid. Standard &AMP; Poor's earlier said it would not comment on
the rating.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno, who is engineering
the bid, called the boards of Olivetti and Tecnost to meet one
after the other on Wednesday afternoon. They approved two capital
increases _ $2.8 billion for Olivetti, and a second, totaling $11.3
billion, for Tecnost, a small maker of gaming machinery controlled
by Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Telecom Italia planned to discuss measures to
defend itself Thursday. Those measures were expected to include a
merger of Telecom with its mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia
Mobile. That would increase Telecom's net worth and raise the price
Olivetti would have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Under Italian law, a company that is the target of a hostile bid
is barred from taking measures to immunize itself. It was unclear
that Olivetti could present its bid and obtain regulatory approval
before Telecom Italia's board meets Thursday. But officials close
to the regulator's office, Consob, were unable to say Wednesday how
a renewed Olivetti bid would affect Telecom Italia's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Telecom chief executive Franco Bernabe met in
Rome with labor union leaders of Telecom Italia to seek support.
The union leaders, who said that Bernabe disclosed no details of
his plans, generally support him nonetheless, driven by fear that
an Olivetti takeover would burden the combined company with debt,
forcing management to sharply cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with knowledge of Telecom Italia's plans said Bernabe
would ofer proposals to the company's board that could include
weeding out unprofitable domestic operations, selling minority
stakes in phone companies abroad and selling some phone-equipment
manufacturing assets.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal said to be under consideration was to pay
shareholders a large dividend as a means of reducing Telecom
Italia's cash.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive at an Italian multinational company who has
been in touch with Bernabe described him as ``a fierce fighter when
he is up against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Bernabe was chastised by Consob after an
article in The Wall Street Journal's European edition quoted him as
saying that Telecom would approve the merger with Telecom Italia
Mobile, an announcement that would violate Italian law unless
previously made to Consob. Bernabe was forced to backtrack, issuing
a statement that while Telecom Italia had discussed such a plan, a
formal proposal was never made. But officials close to Telecom said
nothing would be excluded from Thursday's discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia controls 60 percent of Telecom Italia Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company was also shaken by rumors that its chief
financial officer, Fulvio Conti, had resigned over differences with
Bernabe. Officials of Telecom Italia would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   government officials also said that Consob had started an
investigation into possible insider trading in both companies'
shares in the run-up to Olivetti's original bid over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had reassurances that the government, which took
Telecom Italia public in 1997 and still holds a 3.4 percent stake,
would stay out of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened by the prospect of lost jobs or a foreign takeover, a
wide range of political leaders had called for the government to
exert its rights to insure that Telecom Italia was not
``dismembered'' or bought by a foreign company. But Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, whose Treasury Ministry controls the government stake,
rebuffed the calls, saying, ``Telecom is a private company, and its
choices are made by its board.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to alter the terms of the bid signaled that
Colaninno expected to be in he battlen for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   In a $1.4 billion bid in December for an American company,
Cellular Communications International, which held a 10 percent
stake in Omnitel Pronto Italia, Olivetti's mobile phone unit,
Colaninno, made the bid in two stages. It did this at the advice of
investment bankers, raising the stakes each time. This successful
strategy, it appeared, might be what prompted Olivetti to stick
with the original price here.

 SARAH KANE, 28, BLEAK, EXPLOSIVE BRITISH PLAYWRIGHT, DIES, A
SUICIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sarah Kane, a provocative playwright whose bleak view
of the limitations of human relationships and graphic
dramatizations of violence and sex earned her a reputation as an
enfant terrible of the British theater, died on Saturday at King's
College Hospital here. She was 28.
</P>
<P>
   She was found hanged in her room at the hospital, where she was
being treated for depression, friends said. The police said they
considered the case a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kane exploded onto the London theater scene at 23 with her
nihilistic first play, ``Blasted,'' a precocious debut that shocked
critics and brought her tabloid denunciations as a promoter of
depravity. The play depicted a rampaging soldier raping another man
and then gouging out his eyes, eating his tongue and forcing him to
cannibalize a dead baby.
</P>
<P>
   No play or playwright had caused such outrage since Edward Bond
had an infant being stoned to death in a baby carriage in his play
``Saved'' 30 years earlier on the same Royal Court stage. The
theater, which has had a policy of presenting bold new playwrights
since its 1956 success with John Osborne's groundbreaking ``Look
Back in Anger,'' stuck by Ms. Kane and staged two of the three
other plays she was to write in her short, high-profile career.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, last May's ``Cleansed,'' brought forth a fresh
cascade of negative comment with scenes that included the injection
of heroin into an eyeball, a savage amputation and a rape with a
broom handle. Her other works were ``Phaedra's Love,'' an
adaptation of Seneca, produced at the Gate in 1996, and ``Crave,''
which opened at last year's Fringe Festival in Edinburgh before
moving on to the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Early performances of ``Crave'' listed a pseudonymous author, an
effort on her part to free the play from the unwanted celebrity
that ``Blasted'' had brought her. She said she had been wounded by
the bad publicity, and according to a newspaper account, confided
to a friend that ``the only good journalist is a dead journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dominant view of her work was typified by The Daily
Mail's verdict that ``Blasted'' was ``a disgusting feast of
filth,'' there were critics who found courage and honesty in her
work. One classed her tormented visions as ``the bleached language
of truth and poetry'' depicting a world in which love and violence
are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``Cleansed,'' Benedict Nightingale of The Times of
London wrote: ``She is not the gloating opportunist that some
reviewers of `Blasted' thought. She has no less integrity than
Pinter or Bond, but, God knows, I would hate to live in her head.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the ferocity of her words, in person she was a
pale, thin, soft-spoken presence, living alone in Brixton in South
London and writing feverishly in the early morning hours instead of
sleeping. She spoke of her moments of mental affliction with a grim
appreciation, saying: ``Many people feel depression is about
emptiness, but actually it's about being so full that everything
cancels itself out. You can't have faith without doubt, and what
are you left with when you can't have love without hate?''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a journalist, Ms. Kane grew up in Brentwood in
suburban Essex County, east of London, in a household that went
through an obsessive Christian redemption process during her youth.
At 17 she turned her back on religion, saying that her family's
experience was ``a spirit-filled, born-again lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics of her dramas' dependence on savagery, she said:
``The reading I did in my formative years was the incredible
violence of the Bible. It was full of rape, mutilation, war and
pestilence.''
</P>
<P>
   She was drawn to theater as a teen-ager, directing school
productions of Chekhov's ``Bear'' and Joan Littlewood's ``Oh, What
a Lovely War!'' She went on to Bristol University, where she
graduated with honors in drama, and to Birmingham University, where
she got a master's degree in playwriting.
</P>
<P>
   She was a writer in residence at the experimental company Paines
Plough, working with emerging writers at the urging of her friend
and fellow playwright Mark Ravenhill, the author of ``Shopping and
. . .,'' which played at the New York Theater Workshop last year.
She ran workshops in Bulgaria and Spain with the Royal Court
International summer school, and her plays were produced by a
number of continental companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Britain never realized the extent of her fame
throughout Europe,'' said Michael Billington, the drama critic of
The Guardian. ``Wherever I went, I found an extraordinary curiosity
about her work and what it said about contemporary Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravenhill said that Ms. Kane ``talked about suicide all the time
_ so much so that it became a joke.'' Her last play ``Crave,'' ends
with a suicide, and, interviewed about the play recently, Ms. Kane
said: ``Some people seem to find release at the end of it, but I
think it's only the release of death. In my other plays it was the
release of deciding to go on living despite the fact that it's
terrible.''

&HT;        DELLUMS' NEW DILEMMA: AVERTING AFRICAN DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark Stricherz  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 -- At a Congressional Black Caucus seminar
on AIDS recently, a bespectacled, earnest-looking African-American
man poised a question to former Oakland Congressman Ron Dellums.
</P>
<P>
   He asked about Dellums' new cause in life, his AIDS Marshall
Plan for Africa -- a campaign to raise $200 million, from both the
federal government and pharmaceutical companies, to treat AIDS
victims in the southern part of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the African Diaspora?'' the man, who identified
himself as Dr. Ware, asked. ``What about helping Africans in
countries where they're living now -- places like Haiti, the United
States, London?''
</P>
<P>
   Dellums, whose interest in Africa dates back at least to 1971,
when he called for sanctions against South Africa, did not give the
answer his conservative critics may have presumed. Though often
branded a hard-core leftist, Dellums assailed the question's
underlying ideology with a bluntness that would have made Newt
Gingrich blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about romanticism,'' Dellums, 63, said. ``This is
not about the motherland. This is real. This is about 70 percent of
all newly infected people with HIV living in southern Africa. This
is about 20 million people dying in the next ten years.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dellums sees it, Africa's problem is just as much moral and
political as it is medicinal. Of the 30 million people worldwide
affected by HIV, an estimated 21.5 million of them live in
countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana -- a pandemic on
a scale of the bubonic plague in 17th-century Europe. But, unlike
the situation in the United States, billions of dollars aren't
available in Africa for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to breach that gap is Dellums' mission. His new job,
actually, is as president of the Atlanta-based Healthcare
International Management, which he took last February after
retiring from a 27-year career in Congress. But the AIDS Marshall
plan, he says, is what sometimes gets him up at 3 a.m., wondering
what more he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Dellums concedes that the plan faces an uphill
battle, it may be steeper than even he foresees. Already, several
critics to the proposal have emerged. Clinton administration
officials contend it ought to be spent on prevention, rather than
treatment, while others say that parts of the proposal are
politically unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the possible reasons Washington could object to the plan,
personal enmity toward Dellums does not appear to be one of them.
Dellums may have compiled a record in Congress as a die-hard
pacifist -- he not only opposed the Gulf War, but economic
sanctions against Iraq -- but it has not diminished the level of
bipartisan admiration for him.
</P>
<P>
   House National Security Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who
served with then-Chairman Dellums on the committee, said he has
``never served with anyone who did as much as Ron to protect and
promote bipartisanship.'' Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, goes
further, saying that other members liken Dellums to a ``prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, congressional support for the proposal seems to be
strongest in the Congressional Black Caucus. Caucus Chairman Rep.
James Clyburn, D-S.C., said the plan has ``natural support'' within
the 38-member group, adding that he knows of no members who oppose
it.
</P>
<P>
   Dellums' lobbying of Republicans has been less extensive, he
concedes. But Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla, who worked with Dellums on
eliminating the B-2 bomber, says he likes parts of the proposal,
and says other possible Republican backers include Rep. Nancy
Johnson, R-Conn., and Mike Castle, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   Since unexpectedly retiring from Congress last February, Dellums
has sought support for his plan from world leaders and prominent
international officials such as South African President Nelson
Mandela and World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn .
</P>
<P>
   Dellums also said he plans to meet with the heads of
pharmaceutical companies to raise help $100 million, which he
thinks they will do given their reputation for one-sided concern
for the region. And now that the one-year ban on former
representatives lobbying Congress has passed, Dellums will have
unique access to members, such as visiting with them on the House
floor with the hopes of gaining wider support.
</P>
<P>
   Also, to maintain support for the plan, Dellums intends to
recruit help from outside Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His grand idea is for Mandela to lead a board of trustees to
administer the fund. This board, composed of ``distinguished
persons'' from science, religion and politics, would oversee
efforts to secure appropriate drugs, assure healthcare workers are
trained and steer the drugs to where they are needed most. Dellums
anticipates spending at lest $5,000 per person, per year on drug
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan succeeds, U.S. spending on AIDS programs in South
Africa would increase dramatically. For example, the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID), one main government agency
that oversees African AIDS activities, will spend $91 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of that money goes toward prevention, not
treatment, which is what Dellums wants. ``We focus almost entirely
on sexual transmission, rather than blood treatment,'' said Paul
Delay, chief of the HIV/AIDS division for USAID, adding that buying
condoms is one such program.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when U.S. funding for global AIDS activities has
declined in real dollar terms since 1993, it is perhaps not
surprising that some Clinton administration officials say Dellums'
Marshall plan should go toward prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Delay, the problem is that sub-Saharan Africa lacks
the necessary infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to apply this plan in a setting with none of the lab
settings, none of the roads just doesn't make sense,'' he said.
``The average expenditure on health per person in Africa is less
than $10, and you're talking about spending $3,000 to $5,000 per
person, per year? That's just not feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Congress, opposition to the thrust of Dellums' plan
appears to be equally firm. Staffers from the House Africa
subcommittee said Congress is very unlikely to appropriate $100
million for AIDS programs in Africa, on top of what it is currently
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Congress is a bunch of isolationists. They're
worried about their own constituents,'' said one aide, who spoke on
the condition of annonymity. ``The only way you're going to get
this money is if the administration pushes for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even opponents to Dellums' plan concede weaknesses with
their own arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Delay acknowledges, for example, that 20 million people will die
within the next ten years if no money is spent on treating AIDS in
southern Africa -- a situation he calls ``an extreme tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, support for the plan could blossom if the projected
budget surplus grows, said Clyburn. He notes that, while the
surplus is supposed to $79 billion for this fiscal year, it may
burgeon to $117 billion for next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dellums is also banking on contributions from
pharmaceutical companies, which he hopes may pressure Congress to
fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the opposition, Dellums is no stranger to such
resistance either. On Tuesday, when Congress designated a federal
building on 1300 Clay Street in Oakland the ``Ronald V. Dellums
Federal Building,'' his supporters made note of his support for
causes once-thought to be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Said Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia,
``Ron fought for sanctions against South Africa when it was all but
a lost cause, until finally they developed a national and an
international consensus that in fact led to the elimination, the
beginning of the end, of South African apartheid.''

U.S. ATTACKS TARGETS 30 MILES FROM DOWNTOWN BAGHDAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States carried its low-level war against
Iraq to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital, as American fighter
jets attacked two surface-to-air missile sites only 30 miles from
downtown Baghdad, the Pentagon said &UR;  &LR; Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since the four nights of air and missile
strikes in December that U.S. jets attacked targets so close to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, air-raid sirens sounded shortly after dark and soon
antiaircraft artillery began bursting in the sky, though Pentagon
officials said the U.S. jets never came close enough to the city to
be within range of Iraqi gunners.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the strikes occurred just below the 33rd
parallel, within the southern no-flight zone that the United States
and its allies created in 1992 to protect Shi'ite Muslims from
repression by President Saddam Hussein's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq denounced the latest strikes as ``a grave escalation'' and
reported that the attack had killed civilians, although it did not
immediately say how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grave escalation indicates the ill intentions against
Iraq,'' said Uday al Tai, head of the official Iraqi news agency,
according to Agence France-Presse. ``And we reaffirm once again
that Iraq does not and never will recognize the so called no-fly
zones imposed on it in an unjust and aggressive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, appearing at a news conference with President
Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, accused Saddam's forces of trying to shoot
down a U.S. or British plane. He said the United States would not
be deterred, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying, obviously, for the symbolic victory of
shooting one of these planes down and perhaps trying to intimidate
us from enforcing the no-fly zone, which we're still bound to do
under the United Nations resolution,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no U.N. resolution created the restricted zones, though
the United States cited resolutions passed after the end of the
Persian Gulf War ended in 1991 to justify creating and later
expanding the zones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the U.S. and British strikes were taking a toll on
Iraq's air-defense weapons, but he also expressed regret that the
strikes were continuing, saying he wished Saddam would allow the
United Nations to resume its inspections of Iraq's nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I regret this,'' he said. ``I wish he would stop
doing that. I wish he would make an agreement with the United
Nations to let the inspections go back. We have shown that we are
not interested in hurting the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the fourth consecutive day of strikes. Since
December's bombardment, U.S. and British jets have been steadily
chipping away at Iraq's air defenses whenever confronted by Iraqi
forces. Operating under more aggressive rules approved by Clinton
last month, the pilots have been attacking predetermined targets,
not just those that challenge them directly.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's fighting, Air Force F-15Es and Navy F/A-18s
attacked surface-to-air missile launchers near Al Iskandariyah, on
the edge of the southern no-flight zone after an Iraqi jet entered
the area and Iraqi antiaircraft artillery opened fire. Farther
south, an F-16 fired a radar-seeking missile at a missile site near
Tallil.

 &HT;    Sampling to be used for nonelectoral purposes
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reigniting the partisan controversy over the 2000
census, the Clinton administration plans to count the nation's
population in traditional fashion to allocate congressional seats,
then use scientific methods to arrive at a ``more accurate'' number
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said Wednesday that the
traditional population count, which begins April 1, 2000, will be
no better than the troubled 1990 census, which he said missed more
than 4 million people, disproportionately African-American,
Hispanic and poor.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the head count will be done to comply with a
Supreme Court ruling last month barring the use of sampling _ a
scientific estimate of the population _ in apportioning the 435
seats in the House of Representatives among the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the work will not be then finished,'' Prewitt said at a
news conference. ``Census 2000 will continue its work ... in order
to produce more complete and accurate numbers,'' which could be
used to distribute federal funds or redraw congressional and other
electoral district boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, president of the Atlanta-based Southeastern
Legal Foundation, promised to file a lawsuit to prevent the
two-tiered approach favored by the Census Bureau. The public
interest law firm initiated the suit that the Supreme Court decided
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want one set of numbers,'' Glavin said. ``The Census Bureau
is acting rather like the Mafia, one set of books for legitimate
purposes and a second set of crooked books for more sinister
motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said the court ruling forbids using sampling for
redistricting, but advocates of sampling disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had planned to use sampling for all purposes
until the court decided otherwise. The head count could add up to
$2 billion to the cost of the census, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt declined to estimate the cost of the 2000 census, noting
only that President Clinton requested less than $5 billion for it
in his latest budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the census plan was split along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), a leading critic of
sampling plans, said, ``While congressional Republicans are
committed to developing legal, community-based initiatives to count
everyone in America, I'm disappointed that the Clinton-Gore
administration apparently will not allow the professionals at the
Census Bureau to actually count everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York praised the Census
Bureau for devising ``a way to best comply with the Supreme Court
decision while still getting the most accurate count possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampling probably would add population to solidly Democratic
urban areas at the expense of the more Republican suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said Wednesday that no method would produce a
``perfectly accurate'' census. But he said, time is running out for
bickering over how to conduct the once-a-decade count.

 &HT;    Average Americans push Clinton defense fund to total of $4.5
million
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton used some of Washington's best
lawyers to fight independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and he has
people like William Crumbley, a retired mortgage lender from
McDonough, Ga., to thank for paying his seven-figure legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Crumbley was one of nearly 50,000 Americans who kicked in
donations ranging from $10 to $10,000 to Clinton's legal defense
fund last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support President Clinton and have always supported him,''
said Crumbley, who gave Clinton $25. ``Ken Starr and the
Republicans have absolutely been on a witch hunt. It's the radical
right, the extreme right, that wants to drive him out of office,
and I just don't think it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton's legal defense fund raised $4.5 million in its
first year, the fund reported Wednesday, mostly in response to more
than 600,000 pieces of direct mail sent out at the height of
Clinton's impeachment battle. From July to December, the fund
raised $2.2 million, about $390,000 in chunks of $10,000, the
highest allowable contribution.
</P>
<P>
   J.B. Fuqua, the retired chairman of Fuqua Enterprises, was among
the 39 donors who gave $10,000. Fuqua said he approached Clinton at
a fund-raiser for Georgia Democratic senatorial hopeful Michael
Coles last summer and told the president he wanted to help him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the unfunded liability that he had, I felt that those who
had supported him and had profited from his term should come
forward and put up some money,'' said Fuqua, who lives in Atlanta.
``I have been disappointed in his personal life. We all knew when
he was elected the first time that he had cheated on his wife, but
we elected him anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will need a lot more help if he is to leave the White
House without a crushing legal debt. To date, his lawyers have
submitted bills totalling $9 million. Fund trustees expect there
will be another $1 million in bills stemming from the two months
and a half months in December, January and February when Clinton's
lawyers argued his case before the House, which impeached him Dec.
19, and the Senate, which acquitted him Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The figure does not include the amount the federal government
has spent defending Clinton through the office of the White House
Counsel, which is paid for by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   About $3.8 million, or 40 percent of the bills submitted so far,
has been paid out of the trust, fund trustees said. The amount
includes $800,000 paid out of Clinton's first legal defense fund,
which was established in 1993 and disbanded in 1997 after trustees
were forced to return more than $600,000 in questionable donations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's news fund, established by former Arkansas Sen. David
Pryor, has faced no ethical or legal challenges. Fund trustees said
the fund-raising pace set last year signaled that the fund might
raise $10 million by the time Clinton leaves office _ provided that
he faces no new legal obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reachable,'' said Anthony Essaye, the fund's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of well-known names from Hollywood and the
entertainment industry were among the big donors.
</P>
<P>
   Lew Wasserman, the former chairman of Universal Studios, and a
family member each contributed $10,000, along with singer Tony
Bennett and Don Henley, a member of the Eagles band. Actor Robert
DeNiro and author Stephen King each gave $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of contributions came from people like
Crumbley and others who contributed $100 or less. About 95 percent
of the contributions came in donations of less than $100, and in
response to direct mail solicitations.

JUSTICES UPHOLD SELECTIVE DEPORTING OF ALIENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government does not violate the Constitution by
selecting aliens for deportation on the basis of their political
views and associations, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday in a
6-3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly broad constitutional ruling, in a case that had
appeared to present only narrower procedural issues, was a
significant victory for the government in its 12-year-long effort
to deport a group of supporters of the Palestinian cause who have
become known as the Los Angeles Eight.
</P>
<P>
   The group, seven Palestinians and a Kenyan, have avoided
deportation by convincing the lower federal courts in California
that their claim of having been singled out for their political
activities raised serious First Amendment issues. The 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, twice issued
injunctions to keep the deportation proceedings from moving ahead
and to require the government to show that it had not
``impermissibly targeted'' the eight, all members of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   But writing for the court on Wednesday, Justice Antonin Scalia
said that ``an alien unlawfully in this country has no
constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense
against his deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said that even in ordinary criminal cases, selective
prosecution defenses were rarely accepted and faced a very high
burden of proof because ``such claims invade a special province of
the Executive, its prosecutorial discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These concerns are greatly magnified in the deportation
context,'' he continued, adding that deportation decisions can
depend on sensitive foreign policy or intelligence considerations.
``The Executive should not have to disclose its `real' reasons for
deeming nationals of a particular country a special threat,''
Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there might be ``a rare case in which the alleged
basis of discrimination is so outrageous'' that a selective
enforcement defense should be allowed. But this is not such a case,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's opinion on this issue was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony
M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens,
concurring separately, said that while ``of course, Congress could
not authorize punishment of innocent persons because they happen to
be members of an organization that engaged in terrorism,'' for the
reasons given in Scalia's opinion, ``I have no doubt that the
Attorney General may give priority to the removal of deportable
aliens who are members of such an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The three other members of the court _ Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer _ did not so much
dissent on the selective enforcement issue as refuse to endorse the
majority's view, objecting that the court should not have taken up
the issue after indicating that it would not do so in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The government regards the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine as a terrorist organization. While the eight have spoken
and raised money for the group, none have been charged with any
acts of violence. Several were students when the case began, and
were initially charged with offenses like not taking enough college
credits to maintain their legal status as foreign students.
</P>
<P>
   While losing this phase of the case, the eight do not face
immediate deportation and have several layers of administrative
review available. The court made clear, however, in a part of the
opinion from which only Souter dissented, that judicial review
would be limited, for these and all other aliens facing
deportation, to a single appeal at the end of the process, once a
final order of deportation has been issued.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the ruling is likely to affect many more people
than the ruling on selective enforcement. Few courts have ever
accepted a selective enforcement defense in a deportation case. But
there has been widespread confusion over how to interpret the
densely worded, internally contradictory provisions of the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the
restrictive new immigration law that governed the case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Wednesday marked only the beginning of the
Supreme Court's consideration of the sweeping 1996 law, which made
major changes and has spawned hundreds of court cases. Federal
appeals courts across the country have in varying ways expressed
concern that Congress went too far in stripping the federal courts
of jurisdiction to review aliens' constitutional challenges to
deportation proceedings. The administration has appealed three of
these rulings to the Supreme Court, which is now likely to accept
at least one of them for review soon.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the court on Wednesday was whether the new
law's limitations on judicial review, which clearly apply to
deportation cases that began after its enactment, also apply to the
tens of thousands of cases that were pending when the law took
effect. The court's answer, by a vote of 8 to 1, was yes.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising about the decision, Reno vs. American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, No. 97-1252, was not so much either
part of the ruling but the fact that the court ruled at all on the
selective enforcement issue. The administration included that issue
when it appealed the 9th Circuit's latest ruling to the Supreme
Court last year, but the justices, in granting the case last June,
issued an order limiting their review to the statutory question of
the timing of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the selective enforcement issue was no longer part
of the case, as Ginsburg pointed out in her separate opinion on
Wednesday criticizing the majority for reaching an issue on which
the court had declined to seek briefs or argument. She said she
would have left the question ``an open one.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A MEMO ON UMPIRES STRIKES A FUNNY BONE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ ``Memo?'' Rickey Henderson said, waving a
bat inside the Mets' clubhouse Wednesday. ``What memo?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the official Bud Selig-stamped memo that the
commissioner's office sent recently to its 30 teams, promising
stricter enforcement of the strike zone this season, including the
strike above the belt, the kind Henderson has long been accustomed
to letting pass on his way to first base with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   He, like the umpires, hadn't been informed of any memo, and
snickered when I told him of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you say you're going to make all the umpires call the
game the same way?'' Henderson said. ``Every pitcher is different.
Every player is different. Every umpire is different.''
</P>
<P>
   So is every official in every sport. What is traveling? What is
offensive holding? What is a high strike zone?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's whatever the umpire that day says it is,'' Henderson
said. ``It's whatever he sees, or thinks he sees. As long as he's
consistent with it, it's up to you as the player to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, umpires are not very consistent on balls and strikes,
which is a problem for everyone except those making a living on
instant replay. Umpires have bad days, same as players.
</P>
<P>
   Some aren't as good as most. That is a matter of competency, not
rule enforcement. If one continually distorts the spirit of the
strike zone, by all means, make him stop.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics who howled about pitch-calling during the last
post-season _ to whom the commissioner's office seems to be
overreacting _ make the sweeping charge that the umpires won't call
the high strike and will call the wide strike.
</P>
<P>
   Why umpires would have arbitrarily decided in a secret meeting
at a terrorist camp deep inside Afghanistan to shrink one part of
the strike zone and grow another is one of the unsolved mysteries
of the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strike zone is the strike zone,'' Richie Phillips, the
umpire's union director, said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Henderson, after two decades in the majors, is
not complaining about it. From his pronounced crouch, he has walked
more than anyone in history except Ted Williams and Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say I'm in my deep crouch, like this,'' Henderson said,
bending over, halfway to the carpet. ``Then my high strike is about
right here.''
</P>
<P>
   He placed his hand on his chest, just under the breast. Then he
held the bat up again, but in somewhat less of a crouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I straighten up, even a little, my strike zone changes,''
he said. ``Then the high strike is right over the belt.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bat back at his side, serving as a cane, Henderson
added: ``The interpretation of the strike zone, man, that's been
part of baseball for years and years. That's what baseball's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   People just seem determined these days to legislate against or
eliminate the human element of judgment. The howling over the
umpiring last season carried right into pro football. Somehow,
deserving teams made the playoffs and the unquestioned best teams
managed to overcame the evil officials to win the World Series and
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   I can make no case for pro basketball's traveling travesty, but
that's not the officials as much it is part of the league's
marketing strategy (imagine what the scores would be if the players
didn't walk). The high strike, especially in the National League,
was obviously redefined years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lower strike is something that's just part of baseball
evolution,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rule book, a pitch two inches above the waist
should be called a strike. We're talking about inches, and dipping,
swerving balls thrown into the high 90s, and baseball has the nerve
to imply that the umpires have collectively been failing to enforce
the rules?
</P>
<P>
   This, from a sport that rightly revels in its variety of stadium
configurations, features games on grass and carpet and makes little
effort to resolve the designated hitter issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a knee-jerk and none-too-union brotherly statement, the Major
League Baseball Players Association said it supported the memo. But
Phillips said he wasn't about to assign a team to study its
implications, while Bobby Valentine did everything but roll on the
floor laughing in his manager's office when asked if he would read
the memo to his team.
</P>
<P>
   Figure on baseball being as blind to this act of administrative
grandstanding as an umpire can be on any given call.  &QL;

DISNEY CHANNEL GETS DOWN TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does a bear you-know-what in the woods?
</P>
<P>
   Not if it's a Disney bear. Disney bears go to the bathroom, and
even use potty seats. Disney bears are not your average bears.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday morning, cable's Disney Channel presents an
especially moving episode of its preschooler series ``Bear in the
Big Blue House.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``When You've Got to Go!'' And for once, the
exclamation point might be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it's not Bear who's got to go, or viewers of all
ages might be diving for cover.
</P>
<P>
   No, Bear is contentedly playing checkers at the kitchen table
with little Tutter the mouse, who is clasping his stomach and
extremely agitated.
</P>
<P>
   Bear catches the body language and explains _ perhaps at
discomforting length for poor Tutter _ that it's OK to go to the
potty.
</P>
<P>
   Bear even has a song for the occasion:
</P>
<P>
   (set ital)Your tush is clean
</P>
<P>
   Your tush is dry
</P>
<P>
   Flush it down and wave goodbye
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get to know your potty chair ... (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Tutter enjoys his labors and assures Bear that ``I always take
my time when I use the potty. Sometimes I even like to look at a
picture book.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon there's a commotion upstairs. Uh-oh, Ojo the little bear
had to go, too, and ``almost made it, but I didn't get here on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear is not perturbed. He patiently explains to Ojo that ``the
next time you think you have to go to the potty, it probably means
you have to go to the potty.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for the slow learners in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Shadow, the shadow, comes along. And she's got a potty
song of her own:
</P>
<P>
   (set ital)Hey hey hey potty
</P>
<P>
   Get yourself on the potty train
</P>
<P>
   You'll be living in the fast lane. ... (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   All ends salubriously with the appearance of Pip and Pop, the
gay otters _ they're purple _ with a special honor for Tutter and
Ojo.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, induction into the Mystic Order of the Toileteers.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicion is that only members of the Mystic Order of the
Toileteers know whether the tissues are supposed to come over the
top of the roll or hang from the bottom.

 By PETER MARKS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You are not the kind of a guy who would be at the
wrong theater at this time of the evening. But here you are in your
seat, the lights go down, and before your eyes, a spunky, racially
diverse group of young people appears on a metallic, multilevel
scaffold. Wearing microphones that hang from their ears like
swizzle sticks, they begin to perform a lively rock musical that's
set in the tumultuous New York of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   You hear them singing about drugs and sex. Now you're really
confused. In the dark of the New York Theater Workshop you fumble
for your ticket. Can it be? Have you accidentally stumbled back
into ``Rent''? No, the stub confirms it. You are indeed in Row F,
seat 10 for ``Bright Lights Big City,'' the new musical based on
Jay McInerney's cool 1984 tale of urban alienation, his
breakthrough novel that mythologized the hard-shelled, hedonistic
night life of Reagan-era Manhattan (and popularized the use of
second-person singular as a narrative device).
</P>
<P>
   You are comforted at being in the right place. But the feeling
doesn't last. It's replaced, in fact, by the intense desire to be
sitting once again through ``Rent.'' For though it tries in
uncountable ways to ride piggyback on that megahit rock opera, born
on the same stage and shepherded to success by the same director,
Michael Greif, ``Bright Lights Big City,'' which opened Wednesday
night, easily qualifies as the most frustrating experience of this
bottom-drawer season for the American musical.
</P>
<P>
   Chockablock with talent, expending enough energy to power up the
sound systems in a dozen discos, the show is such a confounding
marriage of good intentions and misguided ideas that your heart
breaks at the thought of what might have been, had someone provided
real guidance for the musical's composer and book writer, Paul
Scott Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed, for instance, with some of the most appealing new
theater music on a local stage, ``Bright Lights Big City'' is also
saddled with just about the most insufferable lyrics imaginable. A
rhyme-it-with-anything desperation infects virtually every song.
``Pierre Cardin/Your coq au vin/Has got a lousy stench,'' the
protagonist, called Jamie here, declares in ``I Hate the French.''
</P>
<P>
   This excruciating number forms with two others, ``I Love Drugs''
and ``I Wanna Have Sex Tonight,'' a trinity of tortures matched
only on the New York stage today by any three offerings from
``Jekyll and Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   The more fundamental problem of this musical adaptation,
however, is one of misconception. McInerney's novel, about an
unnamed, aspiring writer working as a magazine fact-checker by day
and snorting cocaine in the clubs by night, casts New York as a
soul-crushing cesspool for a young man abandoned by his wife, a
fashion model, and deep in unresolved grief for his dead mother. In
the musical Goodman, a Scottish-born songwriter, conjures the
dramatic personae of McInerney's fast, funny and poignant read,
among them: Tad Allagash (Jerry Dixon), the swinger adman; Clara
(Jacqueline Arnold), the uptight head fact-checker and Vicky
(Natascia Diaz), the cerebral love interest. (All this and the Coma
Baby sings, too!)
</P>
<P>
   But there is utter distortion in Goodman's dismissal of the
irony in the title. His bright lights are those that shine on the
wide-eyed optimist, his Manhattan a sterile Fantasy Island.
``Bright lights, big city/I fell in love with you/With all my heart
and soul,'' Goodman sings in the opening number.
</P>
<P>
   Greif pointlessly puts the composer on the stage as a scruffy,
guitar-strumming troubadour, not unlike the musicians wandering
through ``There's Something About Mary.'' He's supposed to be the
voice inside the head of Jamie (Patrick Wilson), the unnamed
writer-hero of the novel. It's a voice, though, that betrays none
of McInerney's New York-style wit or cynicism. Goodman delivers his
lines in a thick Scottish accent, which doesn't aid in the cause of
authenticity either.
</P>
<P>
   The musical refers constantly to the names, places and
activities that bring to mind the Manhattan of the period: Christie
Brinkley and the Tunnel, Ivan Boesky and Area, Steve Rubell and
Studio 54. Name dropping is all it remains. Suggesting the hipness
of an earlier age, especially one that people remember so vividly,
is very dangerous, and Greif and Goodman do not successfully clear
the minefields.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult not to giggle when the ensemble begins a tribute
to a popular downtown restaurant with ``Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Odeon!''
No matter how many of Angela Wendt's stylish outfits you dress them
in, never for a New York minute do you believe that these clean-cut
young people form the dissipated ensemble of the first
coke-snorting musical. Why, you find yourself wondering, aren't all
these nice kids doing ``Merrily We Roll Along''? And why, for that
matter, in a musical set in the clubs, is there virtually no
choreography?
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated in ``Rent,'' Greif is most adept at spotting
and harnessing the raw energy of young performers. This proves
again to be his only potent weapon: The cast brims with confidence
and spirit. As Amanda, the model who disappears from Jamie's life,
Napiera Daniele Groves is a beguiling presence.
</P>
<P>
   Others with memorable moments include Dixon, singing the
second-act opener ``It's Great to Be Back in the City''; Annmarie
Milazzo as Jamie's mother, delivering a passionate summation of
maternal love in ``Happy Birthday Darling,'' and John Link Graney,
in his professional debut as Jamie's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sings well but is aloof and inpenetrable as the elusive
Jamie, and Carla Bianco has the impossible assignment of playing a
singing figure on a ``Missing'' poster who arrives onstage in
blood-soaked panties to advise Jamie to stay close to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright Lights Big City'' tries so hard to say so many things
that it ends up tripping all over itself. It may be more fun to
watch than ``Parade'' or ``Captains Courageous,'' but that's not
really saying much. For all its attempts to capitalize on memories
of ``Rent,'' this ham-handed production only makes you pine for the
finer evening of musical theater that show represents. Oh, for the
good old days of drugs and disease on the Lower East Side.

IN COLORADO, AVALANCHE POLICY STRESSES PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (Duplication warning: also moved in `i' category; with
AUSTRIAN-AVALANCHE) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The kinds of deadly snow rivers that are crashing through Alpine
ski chalets this winter could be crashing through Rocky Mountain
ski condominiums in the future, according to avalanche experts
interviewed Wednesday in Colorado and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alps, some of the highest snowfalls in half a century
have set off vast snowslides that have killed dozens of people,
catching many of them in houses built on sites where avalanches are
most likely. Similar scenes could be repeated in the Rockies, where
the populations of some mountain counties are expected to double
over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the narrow, heavily inhabited valleys of the
Alps,'' said Knox Williams, director of the Colorado Avalanche
Information Center, a state agency. ``But if there is enough of
this condo-mania, enough of this expansion of home sites, we will
start to see this problem in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Because villages dot many Alpine valleys, avalanche control in
Europe involves mainly passive measures. In Switzerland, for
example, about 250 miles of steel and stone fences have been built
on high mountain flanks in order to hold snow in place, and near
the bases of mountains, washboards of earthen mounds have been
built to dissipate the energy of avalanches and to divert them from
houses.
</P>
<P>
   But this winter, with as much as 20 feet of snow falling in
Switzerland in the last six weeks, the barriers have not been
strong enough to hold or divert the snow. Winds have raged up to
150 miles an hour, whipping up dangerous snow packs above villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary series of weather fronts and strong
northwestern winds,'' Martin Schneebli, a researcher at the Swiss
Federal Institute for the Study of Snow and Avalanches, said from
Davos, which has been marooned by snow for several days.
</P>
<P>
   While Switzerland is one of Europe's leaders in avalanche
deaths, with an average of 20 a year, Colorado leads the United
States, averaging six a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Colorado's 20,000 avalanches a year occur on remote
federal land, typically posing no threat to people in towns. In
this setting, avalanche controllers use ``active'' methods, either
bombs or careful ski runs, to trigger smaller avalanches before the
snow masses become too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe they don't use explosives to trigger avalanches
because they don't know how big the avalanches will be when they
release them,'' said Dale Atkins, an avalanche forecaster in
Colorado. ``In Europe they have more towns, villages, highways and
rail lines'' along avalanche paths ``than we do in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on information from avalanche forecasters and snow
monitors, the Colorado Department of Transportation routinely
closes roads just before dawn and then sets off explosive charges,
either dropped by helicopter or fired from Army howitzers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole thing is prevention,'' said Chuck Loerwald, a
regional supervisor for the state DOT, as he prepared to trigger
mini-avalanches Wednesday on Berthoud Pass, a major ski-area access
route. ``We let the little ones come so we don't have the big
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   At Colorado's 20 largest ski areas, many built on historic
avalanche paths, about 300 ski patrollers check for avalanche
threats each morning. They trigger avalanches either by firing
mortar charges or by making ski-cuts _ traversing slopes on skis,
jumping up and down. Nationwide, about one ski patroller is killed
every winter while performing avalanche-control work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Rockies, this system has been successful so far. In
Colorado there has not been a skier killed by an avalanche in a ski
area since 1975. On the roads, the last travelers killed by
avalanches died in 1963. But several snowplow drivers have been
killed in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these advances, the American avalanche picture is
changing rapidly, owing to an explosion in back-country recreation
in the winter and a surge in home construction in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of a rapid increase in back-country skiers,
snowboarders and snowmobilers, the average number of Americans
killed by avalanches has more than tripled, rising from seven a
year in the 1970s to 24 a year in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 100 vacationers were caught in avalanches in
Colorado last year, the state has kept fatalities down through an
aggressive program of educating people on how to survive sliding
snow. Nine out of 10 avalanche victims in the United States set off
their own avalanches, fracturing fragile snow layers through noise
or movement.
</P>
<P>
   With February being the deadliest avalanche month in North
America, Denver television stations recently started broadcasting a
new public service announcement that shows a ``frozen'' snowboarder
hanging on a meat hook next to a pig's head. As the camera pans
around the meat locker, an avalanche beacon can be heard pinging.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the Colorado Avalanche Center held safety classes
for 3,500 vacationers, fielded 77,000 calls to its seven
avalanche-status hotlines, registered visits to its Web site, sent
out 30,000 avalanche-alert e-mail messages, and broadcast daily
messages on 11 mountain radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people's avalanche skills to catch up with their
athletic skills,'' said Knox, who trains people in the use of probe
poles, avalanche shovels and high-tech beacons.
</P>
<P>
   On the technological front, stores recently started selling
digital avalanche beacons that can cut search time in half, to
about 15 minutes. These transceivers can indicate with arrows and
distance measurements the location of a buried victim who is
carrying a beacon. Although only one-third of buried victims
survive, 90 percent are still alive 15 minutes after being buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is the enemy of the buried victim,'' said Atkins, who
teaches avalanche safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, some vacationers have started carrying a German-made
``avalanche airbag.'' With the pull of a ripcord, this backpack
device inflates into a large orange nylon balloon, carrying the
wearer to the top of the snow. It has been credited with saving 18
lives in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While training and technology may slow fatality rates, some
experts fear that the Rockies are following the residential
development of the Alps, allowing homes to be built at the bases of
old avalanche chutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avalanche run-out zones are terrific building sites,'' Atkins
said. ``They are down near the valley floor; they have great views
because of the lack of trees. Over the next 20 years, we will see a
significant increase in people building in avalanche areas.''

<P>
   In the first step to combat the cancer that is threatening her
life, Comets point guard Kim Perrot underwent surgery Wednesday to
remove a golf-ball-size tumor from her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chairman of neurosurgery at M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, said the tumor appeared to have been been
successfully removed during a five-hour procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot announced Monday that she is suffering from alveolar
adenocarcinoma, a cancer that originated in the lung but spread to
her brain. Doctors had found one large tumor and several smaller
ones on Perrot's brain during recent tests. Wednesday's craniotomy
was to remove the largest one, which was causing headaches,
dizziness and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot will later undergo radiation and chemotherapy to attack
the smaller tumors. The lung cancer will also be addressed as soon
as possible in what doctor's term a ``multipart treatment plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim is doing as well as can be expected,'' said Comets coach
Van Chancellor, who visited with Perrot in the intensive care unit
after the surgery. ``I walked in there, and her mother, Cynthia
Cooper and her sister were there and she said to me, `Coach, I want
to say this in front of Cynthia and my family. Don't be out there
looking for another point guard.' That's a quote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, that made me cry. The fight and spirit in this
woman is the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors reported that Perrot squeezed the doctor's hand, smiled
and appeared in good spirits after surgery. She'll stay in the
hospital to be monitored for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot briefly visited with a dozen family members, friends and
teammates. Cards can be sent to Perrot via the Comets at Two
Greenway Plaza, Suite 400, Houston, TX 77046, or on the WNBA Web
site at www.wnba.com.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ It wasn't as if Jeff Bagwell would sit bolt
upright in the middle of the night haunted by the memories,
trembling in fear at dreams of another Kevin Brown sinker, bathed
in cold sweat at the mere thought of one more helpless playoff
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it, sure,'' he said. ``You think about it
while the rest of the playoffs and the World Series are going on. I
couldn't help but think during the World Series that we were the
only team in baseball that could really have given the Yankees a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the best team in the National League last year. But we
didn't get the job done again in the playoffs, and you have to
accept that and move on. If you dwell on the loss, it's going to
keep you down. What you have to do is make a commitment to get
better, make a change, even if it's just a small one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's change here in the early part of spring training has
been to work on a slightly different batting stroke that he hopes
will produce big results. As usual in baseball, it's the little
things.
</P>
<P>
   He still stands up there in the batter's box with his feet
spread so wide apart that you'd think he was a bull rider at the
rodeo. He still squats low in a crouch and holds the bat straight
up in the air like an exclamation point. The difference is in the
location of his hands, which are now held higher _ around shoulder
level, rather than down around his belt _ in hope of eliminating
some of the hitch from his swing and producing more line drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I thought about as far back as the beginning of
last season when I was struggling from the start,'' Bagwell said.
``I talked about it all year long with (hitting coach) Tom McCraw.
We came to the conclusion that it was something I needed to work on
but not during the middle of the year, because that wouldn't have
been fair to the team. They needed me to be hitting, not
experimenting. I just knew there had to be a better way for me.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of his troubles last season, Bagwell still
finished with a .304 batting average, 34 home runs and 111 RBIs.
For a lot of players, that would have been a career season. But for
him, a fiercely competitive perfectionist, it was a reason to go
back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've said about Cammy (Ken Caminiti), the worst
thing that ever happened to him in terms of everybody's
expectations was his winning the MVP in '96,'' Bagwell said. ``Once
you do that, put up those kinds of numbers, it's what people think
you should do all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, of course, was the National League Most Valuable Player
in 1994, and while there may be some pressure to live up to that
level coming from the outside, it is not close to the weight of the
burden he puts on himself.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes into a slump at the plate, you can read the
frustration in his face, feel the anguish in his voice. Which is
why you know that having hit just .115 (3-for-26) in the playoffs
the past two years against Atlanta and San Diego has him ready to
do anything at all to prevent it from happening a third straight
time. Including a willingness to tamper _ even in a small way _
with the swing that has made him one of the most feared and
productive hitters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at it like it's such a big thing,'' Bagwell
said. ``Carl Yastrzemski used to change his swing every year. I
know, because I'd change every year with him when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Until finally, somewhere, Bagwell's stance evolved into the
crouching, wide-open, hands-low trademark that made you wonder how
he ever got his bat on the ball, let alone hit it out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it came from,'' he said. ``I just kind of
settled into the whole thing. You know, moving my front foot back
instead of stepping into the ball and all that other crazy stuff. I
do everything just about the opposite of what they teach you. But
no manager or coach ever tried to get me to change, because I
always hit.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Bagwell last season was the nature of his slumps.
When he'd had problems in the past, they usually revolved around
being unable to see the ball properly. Last season, however, he was
always seeing the ball but not always making solid contact. Too
many times, he said, the up-and-down path of his hands produced a
frustrating grounder to third instead of a line-drive single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd see Craig (Biggio) and Moises (Alou) with a flatter swing,
starting up high, and they'd hit the line drives. It just seems to
make sense for me to try it. Maybe I can hit .300 again and drive
in 100 runs the old way. But maybe if I do this, I'll be able to
get that one more hit this time in the playoffs. You try to do the
little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Which often have a way of making a big difference.

FEMALE ARTISTS LEAD PARADE TO PODIUM AT GRAMMY AWARDS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I am woman, hear me roar _ the famous pop refrain
from Helen Reddy _ was the overwhelming theme at Wednesday night's
Grammy awards at the Shrine Auditorium. Madonna started the parade
by winning best pop album for ``Ray of Light,'' with Lauryn Hill
and Shania Twain also taking the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Grammy bickering was at a minimum during the
afternoon, when the majority of the Grammys were awarded in
pre-telecast ceremonies. Deserving artists won to an impressive
degree _ and most of them were women.
</P>
<P>
   Hill got off to a fast start with three Grammys, dominating the
R &AMP; B field by winning best R &AMP; B album (``The Miseducation of
Lauryn Hill''), best female R &AMP; B vocal performance, and best R &AMP; B
song (a songwriter award) for ``Doo Wop (That Thing),'' a track
from her album.
</P>
<P>
   Country phenomenon Twain was right behind her with two awards
for best country vocal and best country song for ``You're Still the
One,'' which also was a huge Top 40 pop hit, signaling country's
renewed crossover potential.
</P>
<P>
   The staying power of the ``Titanic'' soundtrack was felt again,
as Canadian chanteuse Celine Dion won best pop female vocal
performance for the megahit ``My Heart Will Go On.'' It also won
for best song, the award going to composers James Horner and Will
Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who described herself last week as ``the Susan Lucci of
the Grammys'' because she's often been shunned, won the new best
dance recording award for ``Ray of Light.'' The song also was
represented in the best short form music video award for director
Jonas Akerlund.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based artists fared well, with Aerosmith winning for best
rock performance by a duo or group with vocal for the risque
``Pink,'' though the group lost in a shocking upset in the
counterpart pop category, where their No. 1 song ``I Don't Want to
Miss a Thing'' (from the ``Armaggedon'' soundtrack) was beaten by
an obscure Brian Setzer Orchestra track, ``Jump Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Burton, the jazz vibist who doubles as vice president of
Berklee College of Music, shared best jazz instrumental solo with
Chick Corea for ``Rumbata.'' Said Burton afterward: ``This is my
fourth Grammy and my third with Chick. This is especially
important, because I've had a Grammy in each of the last four
decades, so this was my last chance in the '90s!'' And longtime
Cambridge resident Pat Metheny won two Grammys, also in the jazz
field.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Pops conductor Keith Lockhart, who MC'd part of the
afternoon program, missed out on his first Grammy bid, in the new
classical crossover category. His ``The Celtic Album'' lost to
``Soul of the Tango: The Music of Astor Piazzola,'' by Lockhart's
friend cellist Yo-Yo Ma. It was Ma's 13th career Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart expressed satisfaction at the creation of the crossover
award (``It makes sense because we've always been a genre without a
country''), and he was thrilled to give the best instrumental
composition award to Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, who have played
with the Pops.
</P>
<P>
   Country artist Vince Gill set a record by winning a Grammy for
his 10th year in a row. It was for best country instrumental
performance for ``A Soldier's Joy,'' an award shared with Randy
Scruggs. Gill has also amassed awards for vocal performance,
instrumental performance, collaborations, and songwriting. ``I'm
glad to be recognized for the diversity, which is what I've tried
to do with my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chieftains won their sixth Grammy, this time in the
traditional folk category, for ``Long Journey Home.'' Leader Paddy
Moloney, who has a son at MIT, said he was headed to Boston for the
next few days and may turn up in a local Irish tavern or two.
</P>
<P>
   The best contemporary folk award went to Texas whirlwind Lucinda
Williams, for ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which has factored
into as many Top 10 lists this year as Hill's groundbreaking
hip-hop/soul CD.
</P>
<P>
   In the rock field, Alanis Morissette's ``Uninvited'' won best
rock song, while best hard-rock performance went to Page &AMP; Plant's
``Most High.''

CLINTON IS BEING REJECTED IN HIS EFFORT TO FIND A NEW AMBASSADOR TO
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has been unable to
persuade two high-profile former members of Congress to accept a
nomination as ambassador to Beijing, a sign of the daunting
challenge of managing the deteriorating relationship between the
United States and China and of the weakness of a lame-duck
president.
</P>
<P>
   At a time that Congress is investigating China's acquisition of
U.S. military secrets, questioning its exploding trade surplus with
the United States and criticizing its human rights record, the
administration's overtures have been rejected by at least half a
dozen candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who retired last
year after a 34-year congressional career in which he mastered
foreign affairs in general and Asia in particular, was asked to
take the job, according to administration officials and friends of
Hamilton. But he begged off and chose, instead, to remain as head
of the Woodrow Wilson Center, a prestigious Washington policy
institute.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, Clinton's long-time Arkansas friend
who offered his oratory in defense of the president during the
Senate impeachment trial, turned down the tentative job offer,
instead choosing to lead the relatively small Center for Defense
Information here, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other retired officials also received feelers _ David
Pryor, another former Democratic senator from Arkansas; Gen. John
Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Anthony Lake, the former national security adviser _ and all
declined to have their names put forward by the president,
according to administration officials and other former officials.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing the prospect of nomination, some of the potential
candidates expressed ambivalence about accepting such a demanding
overseas position for a tour that might be over in less than two
years, with the end of the Clinton administration. Others said the
ambassador would have great responsibility but little authority to
make policy. But some indicated they were more discouraged by the
enormous problems in Chinese-American relations _ and especially by
congressional criticism of the administration's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
   The potential candidates apparently thought a confirmation
hearing before the Committee on Foreign Relations, which is led by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., would be as unforgiving as the earlier
hearings over China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any confirmation hearing will be bruising,'' said one
administration official, referring to the inevitable committee
showdown. ``The nominee will be asked to answer for all of the ills
of China from human rights issues to the closed market. What's the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, is heading the
search for a replacement for James Sasser, who became the U.S.
ambassador to China in 1996 after losing his seat as a Democratic
senator from Tennessee. He will leave the post in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this job is critical to United States national
interests, and we're looking at people of stature,`` said David
Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ``We don't
feel we're behind the curve. It's at the top of our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said that only two people had been approached seriously
about the job, but he declined to name them.
</P>
<P>
   But other administration officials, who demanded anonymity, said
Hamilton, Lake and Bumpers had all been asked to consider the
position. Friends of Pryor said he had been approached as well but
had immediately turned it down without even speaking to his wife
about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The other official approached was Stephen Bosworth, the current
ambassador to South Korea, former senior Clinton administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials agree that this is a pivotal moment for
one of the country's most important foreign relationships and that
Clinton is searching for a prominent envoy whose name alone would
convey to the Chinese how highly Washington values its dealings
with them. At the same time, the officials said, an
ambassador-designate must be perceived as tough on Beijing to win
confirmation from Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But a confirmation hearing of even the most popular candidate is
expected to become a platform for every senator with a problem with
China, said a senior Clinton administration official. ``The
confirmation would go on and on, and it will be a bruising
battle,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of these congressional questions are serious
disagreements with China's military, economic and social policies.
China has doubled the number of missiles pointed at Taiwan since
the early 1990s and is arguing with its Southeast Asian neighbors
over the Spratley Islands. Congress also wants China to open its
markets further. And human rights groups on the left and the right
continue raising questions about basic freedoms in that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very rough time for dealing with China,''
said Edward Friedman, a political science professor and China
specialist at the University of Wisconsin. ``In this period of
global economic turmoil, these political and economic difficulties
aren't going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to the challenge of having to confront China on these
issues, a new ambassador would face the prospect of being replaced
after the presidential election in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder to get people to take jobs in the last years of
an administration,'' said Michael Beschloss, a scholar on the
presidency who saw similarities with the predicament President
Nixon faced in appointing ambassadors to South Vietnam toward the
end of the American war there. ``When a country is going very
wrong, that's not a time you have people jumping through hoops to
become the next ambassador.''

MUSEUM SEEKS TO RETURN PLUNDERED PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It measures just 5 by 10 inches. But the 16th-century
Flemish landscape by Herri met de Bles has been housed in two of
this century's most dissimilar art collections since it was whisked
out of the Netherlands after the Nazi occupation in May 1940.
</P>
<P>
   For the duration of World War II, it was in the notorious
private collection of Nazi Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering, a
collection of art looted or ``bought'' at gunpoint in occupied
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1946, an American dealer sold the de Bles to the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts, whose documents suggest the museum was
indifferent to its ownership history.
</P>
<P>
   Like other paintings that passed through soiled hands during and
after the war, the landscape raises embarrassing questions about
the postwar policies of museums such as the MFA, which first
learned 51 years ago that the painting might have been illicitly
traded during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Griffin, the MFA's spokeswoman, said the museum is eager to
return the landscape as soon as the evidence establishes its
rightful ownership. The MFA, she said, is continuing to search its
records to ensure that the rest of its artworks have no wartime
taint.
</P>
<P>
   No museum, Griffin noted, is immune from the possibility that it
might have inadvertently acquired art after the war that had been
looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch first alerted the MFA in 1948 that the painting had
been taken from Holland by the Nazis, according to MFA
correspondence obtained by the Globe. That year, Dutch authorities
asked for its return, but the MFA's director at the time, G. H.
Edgell, insisted that the Dutch provide ``definite'' evidence it
had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch, trying to rebuild their country in the chaos of
post-war Europe, dropped the claim. And so, for 50 years, the MFA
shelved the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But last March, soon after the Globe raised questions about
other MFA post-war acquisitions and amid growing international
attention to Nazi-looted art, the museum discovered documents from
1948 and contacted the Dutch government with an offer to return the
painting if the Dutch would provide the long-overdue evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dutch officials said they are about to do so, and
they praised the MFA for coming forward to settle a case that
present-day Dutch officials say they were unaware of.
</P>
<P>
   To some art specialists, the tale of the tiny painting
underscores persistent moral issues that confront the art world,
including the eagerness of postwar collectors and curators to
acquire paintings like the de Bles even though the works crossed
the Atlantic with suspicious pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, for instance, the MFA's director unapologetically
acknowledged to the Dutch that the museum had virtually no
information about the prior ownership of the de Bles.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is even more awkward for the Netherlands. More than 90
percent of Dutch Jews perished in the Holocaust, by far the highest
rate in Western Europe. Recent public outrage has led to the
creation of a commission to examine why 90 percent of the artworks
recovered from the Nazis after the war, including major works by
Rembrandt, remain unclaimed in Dutch museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch government behaved despicably after the war and was
so intent on keeping the looted art that they dispossessed their
own citizens,'' Christine A. Koenigs, whose grandfather owned the
de Bles until 1940, said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs, who lives in Amsterdam, holds the Dutch, and not the
MFA, accountable. But others take a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch incompetence does not excuse five decades of inaction by
the MFA,'' said Willi Korte, a specialist in locating Nazi-looted
art who is not involved in the de Bles case.
</P>
<P>
   If the MFA needed evidence to support the claim, it arrived
unsolicited last July when Koenigs filed her own claim. She
included documents that leave little doubt that the artwork, like
tens of thousands of others, was a casualty of the war. The
documents, she said, were in official Dutch files in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents Koenigs has is a copy of a list of 19 of
Franz Koenigs's paintings that Goering acquired in 1940, including
receipts signed by Goering's administrative assistant at Carinhall,
his palace outside Berlin. The de Bles painting, ``Burning City,''
is on the list. Evidence that the painting was in Goering's illicit
collection has long been publicly available in the US National
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   For the MFA, the case of the de Bles landscape is the latest in
a series of disclosures that raise questions about the museum's
collecting ethics. Those questions encompass both its postwar
acquisition of paintings and its recent acquisitions of antiquities
that the museum had reason to believe had been illegally taken from
grave sites in countries such as Italy and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other European paintings the MFA has acquired since
the 1940s have ownership histories that, according to art
specialists, raise suspicions they might have been looted during
the war. The MFA has refused to say whether it has subsequently
investigated the history of those artworks.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a panel of the Association of Art Museum Directors
that included the current MFA director, Malcolm Rogers, pledged
that AAMD members would look for evidence any of their art had been
looted by the Nazis, would deal ``promptly'' with any claims, and
would publicly disclose if any of their artworks had been illegally
confiscated during World War II and not restituted.
</P>
<P>
   Until asked Wednesday, the MFA had said nothing about the de
Bles. When the Globe inquired late last year whether the museum had
found any evidence of looted Nazi art in its collection, the MFA
sidestepped the question. ``We have no specific discoveries to
report to the Globe,'' the museum replied.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last March, according to Bob G.C. Lodder, the deputy
director of the Cultural Heritage Department of the Dutch Ministry
of Culture, Rogers wrote to the Dutch government about the de Bles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MFA contacted us to say they had been looking at their
records on this painting and had found some very strange things,''
Lodder said Wednesday. ``When we checked our own records, it became
clear the painting was ours.'' The Boston museum, he said, should
be praised for coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, when the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam asked that the de
Bles be returned, MFA director Edgell wrote that the MFA's trustees
``would return the painting to the Boymans Museum when definite
proof is given us that it was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Edgell admitted that the MFA knew almost nothing about the
landscape's origin. ``The dealer can tell us little beyond the fact
that the picture was bought in a small auction room in New York,
the owner of which says that the picture came to him from Chicago.
We are trying to get more information about its history but
probably shall not succeed,'' Edgell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Though the MFA was uncertain about the work's history, Edgell
told the Dutch that he thought it likely the painting ``may have
left the Koenigs collection before it was seized by the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Edgell concluded, ``We are not hedging and certainly
have no intention of being receivers of stolen goods, but equally
you will realize that our trustees cannot return a painting without
definite legal proof that it was stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Korte, who has represented several victims of Nazi art looting
who have made claims against American museums, said there is a
double standard implicit in Edgell's 1948 explanation, one that
echoes through other cases in which museums have resisted claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same trustees and curators, who ask no questions, who
raise no suspicions when they acquire a painting, and who have no
records of where the painting came from, all of a sudden develop
very high standards of proof when a claimant comes along,'' Korte
said.
</P>
<P>
   How the de Bles landscape ended up in Chicago is unclear, but
Korte said it is likely that one of the American GIs who liberated
Carinhall took the miniature painting home in his duffel bag as a
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the complex manner in which Franz Koenigs's massive
collection was lost, Korte said, the only issue is whether the
painting belongs to the Koenigs family or the Dutch government.
Lodder made it clear Wednesday that the government believes it owns
the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Koenigs was a wealthy German businessman who emigrated to
the Netherlands in 1931, bringing one of Europe's most
extraordinary art collections. It included numerous paintings,
among them the de Bles landscape and many works by Rubens. More
importantly, Koenigs had one of the world's best collections of Old
Master drawings, 2,144 in all.
</P>
<P>
   But Koenigs, who was not Jewish, fell on hard times, and used
the collection as collateral for a loan from a Jewish-owned bank.
With the Nazi invasion imminent, the bank was advised to liquidate
its holdings, selling most of Koenigs's collection and consigning
35 paintings to an art dealer to be sold. After the Nazi invasion,
the dealership was taken over by a Nazi art procurer, who sold 19
of the paintings, including the de Bles, to Goering.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1943 Allied declaration, adopted as law by the Dutch,
all wartime sales to Germans in Occupied Europe were deemed null
and void. Dutch policy, which has come under fire from claimants
like Koenigs, declares the state the owner of works that were sold,
even in questionable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In Koenigs's case, hundreds of his drawings were seized by
occupying Soviet forces and kept as war reparations. Those that
were returned, including many of the paintings from Carinhall, have
been kept by the Dutch government, despite Christine Koenigs's
insistence that her grandfather would have retained his collection
but for the invasion and the bank liquidation.

KAMAPLA MAYOR   TO SERVE 15 MONTHS IN US FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In halting English, the man dubbed ``the George
Washington of Kampala `` invoked the names he'd pulled from the
history books: Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasser Ntge Sebaggala lingered longest on one name in
particular, the one whose crimes and causes he thought most closely
tracked his own: James Michael Curley.
</P>
<P>
   If the legendary Boston mayor could be pardoned after serving
time in federal prison for mail fraud -- and return triumphantly to
the mayor's seat -- perhaps US District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay
could do the same for Sebaggala, the first democratically-elected
mayor of Uganda's capital city, Kampala, who was convicted in
December of eight charges, including bank fraud and lying to US
Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if an outright pardon wasn't possible, maybe a just a short
prison sentence, like the six months Sebaggala's lawyer, Paul V.
Kelly, had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``His case is similar to mine,'' Sebaggala, speaking alternately
in English and his native Lugandan, said of Boston's popular
political rogue. ``I seek forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, cautioning that Curley wasn't a ``real good example''
of a role model, nonetheless did cut in half the 30-month sentence
recommended by the prosecution, ordering Sebaggala, 51, to prison
for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so, not because Sebaggala's continued absence from
the mayor's office could destabilize a fledgling democracy -- as
Kelly had argued - but because Sebaggala was the sole support of
his elderly blind mother and two young sons, circumstances he
termed ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden to safequard Ugandan democracy, ``should not fall on
me,'' said Lindsay, pointing out that it was Sebaggala's foray into
criminality and subsequent conviction that threatened the stability
of his hometown. Besides the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala must
repay $44,000 to the bank he defrauded and pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sebaggala's political advisor Matthias Nsubuga called
the sentence ``a political disaster.'' Under a deal worked out at
home, Sebaggala could hold on to his office as long as he was
sentenced to no more than 9 months in prison. He has been in
custody -- either under house arrest or in prison -- since he was
arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York last June, one
month after he took office. In his absence, the deputy mayor has
been in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala might be out in time,
but it will be ``close to the line,'' Kelly said. He will get
credit for the time he's been in prison since December awaiting
sentencing, as well as time off for good behavior, perhaps reducing
his actual sentence to about 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nsubuga was among a contigent of more than a dozen supporters,
both from Uganda and the Boston area, who attended Wednesday's
two-hour sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which ended with Sebaggala's conviction Dec. 4, drew
the attention of Ugandans here and abroad. Last fall, 40,000 of
Sebaggala's political supporters signed a petition urging that he
be freed pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan politics even seeped into what was a straightforward
fraud case. There were references to Sebaggala's beatings and
harassment at the hands of former Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, and
to the fact that his children had been granted political asylum in
the United States because of their father's political activities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, jurors were unswayed by suggestions of an
international political conspiracy. Rather, they were convinced by
a paper trial, including deposit slips, letters and doctored checks
with erasure marks.
</P>
<P>
   Sebaggala's trouble began on June 13, 1998 at Kennedy Airport,
where he was charged with lying to customs officials in Boston when
he entered the country on an earlier trip the previous January. He
was also charged with misstating the amount of traveler's checks --
$108,000 in all -- bundled in packages in his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a federal grand jury in Boston charged
Sebaggala, who owned a foreign currency exchange in Uganda, with
depositing four stolen and altered checks into an account at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   One check, originally made out to another party for $400, was
changed to $44,000 and made payable to Sebaggalla, according to
evidence presented at trial. Another check, originally for 99
cents, was changed to $39,000 and made payable to Sebaggala.

 &HT;    Bush forms exploratory committee
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has decided to form an
exploratory committee that will allow him to begin raising money
for a possible presidential candidacy, according to several people
close to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to announce the formation of the committee
within two weeks. If he decides to run for president, he has said
that he wouldn't formally announce his candidacy until after the
legislative session ends on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Bush continues to be noncommittal about his
intentions. ``I will have an announcement here later on that will
begin to clarify whether or not the answer is yes, no or maybe,''
Bush said Wednesday, after another round of private talks at the
Governor's Mansion about his potential presidential race. Despite
the reports about an exploratory committee, he insisted that
``maybe'' is still a possible answer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said last week that he was ``warming to the task'' of
seeking the presidency. During a four-day Washington weekend, Bush
held several private political sessions in conjunction with the
National Governors Association meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the governor has said his decision would be based on
family considerations as well as whether he thought he could make a
difference for America. And, also for months, he has been calling
in a variety of political, policy and fund-raising experts to offer
input.
</P>
<P>
   Already in place is a team of policy experts that Bush said
could wind up as part of a campaign team. ``I would characterize
them as conservative thinkers,'' said Bush. He said the top
advisers helping him gear up for a potential presidential race are
Harvard professor and former Federal Reserve Board governor Larry
Lindsey for economic issues, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith
for domestic issues and former Stanford University Provost
Condoleeza Rice for international issues. Rice is a Bush family
friend and helped former President Bush compile his recently
published book, ``A World Transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush said Paul Wolfowitz, dean of Johns Hopkins
University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies
in Washington, D.C., is also advising him on international affairs.
Wolfowitz served in the Reagan and the Bush White House and has
been an outspoken critic of President Clinton's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain deeply skeptical that President Clinton has learned
about foreign policy,'' he said when Clinton named Madeleine
Albright as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Another foreign policy expert, Dick Cheney, who served as
secretary of defense for President Bush, met with the younger Bush
here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we discuss?'' said Bush. ``Guess. Dick Cheney is a
friend of mine. It's not the first time he has been down here. It
won't be the last time he is down here. He is a person whose
judgment I rely upon a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In Independence, Mo., on Tuesday for a display on President
Franklin Roosevelt at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum,
former President Gerald Ford said Bush is the GOP's best shot at
recapturing the White House because he is not straying too far to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to win if you retain the policies of the hard
right,'' said Ford. ``The Democrats lost with hard-left policies. I
think we can win if we're wise enough to go down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is talking a lot more moderately than his
father,'' he added. ``(Republicans) aren't going to win on one
issue. They've got to have a broader view.'' The younger Bush has
met with a number of Republican fund-raisers in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people from all over the country in today, just like we
do most every day,'' he said after the lunch meeting at the
Governor's Mansion. ``This was not a specific meeting with a
specific group. This was people who were interested in my
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the lunch were Colorado Republicans Gov. Bill
Owen and U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis, both of whom said they urged Bush
to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' said McInnis, ``if he makes the decision (to
run), he'll be the next president and this state will have a lot to
be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Bush received letters from Republican state
lawmakers in Massachusetts who want him to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge you to step forward and then run forward as a
Republican candidate for president who has clearly mastered the art
of governing and winning,'' the state senators said in their
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci has been a leading booster of a
Bush candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said no decision had been made whether to seek federal
funds if he runs. Candidates who take matching money must abide by
spending limits, limit personal money used on their campaigns and
submit to federal audits.
</P>
<P>
   FEC spokeswoman Kelly Huff said Wednesday that the decision
whether to accept federal money does not have to be made before
forming an exploratory committee.

 &HT;    S. Carolinians oppose sale of drivers' pictures
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWOOD, S.C. _ Is Big Brother lurking in the lingerie
department at Wal-Mart, or in frozen foods over at the Winn-Dixie?
Not yet, and state Rep. Jim Klauber wants to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   So do thousands of other South Carolinians, judging by the
state's controversial _ and confusing _ sale of driver's license
photos, a dispute to be aired today during a legislative hearing in
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public in South Carolina is irate,'' said Klauber, a
32-year-old Republican from Greenwood who is chairman of the House
special laws subcomittee.
</P>
<P>
   In what's expected to be a long and contentious public forum,
the panel plans to question officials of Image Data, a fraud
prevention company ensnarled in South Carolina's intensifying
debate over privacy in this era of free-flowing information.
</P>
<P>
   Klauber is among legislators who are suspicious of Image Data
because it failed to disclose it had received nearly $1.5 million
in start-up funds from the Secret Service, the federal agency
responsible for combating wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``When has the government ever used information just for what
they said they would use it for?'' Klauber said. ``Conceivably,
they could track you buying shoes at J.C. Penney and a shirt at
Wal-Mart. ... People are fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   Image Data officials said such a scenario is preposterous, and
it blamed public officials for stirring confusion among South
Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the controversy's wake, state legislators are considering
bills that would ban the sale of driver's license information. This
week, the company sued South Carolina Attorney General Charles
Condon, who has sought to void the state Department of Public
Safety's sale of driver's license photos to Image Data.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Condon is waging a ``personal vendetta''
against Image Data and its president, Bob Houevener. In a recent
appearance on a national TV news program, Condon referred to
Houvener as ``Big Brother Bob.'' The attorney general is seeking
federal documents related to the Secret Service grant in hopes of
making a perjury case against Houvener.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions have been taken to the point of damaging the
reputation of our president and our company,'' Image Data vice
president Lorna Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Nashua, N.H., three years ago, the small, privately
owned company recently paid $5,000 for 3.5 million South Carolina
driver's license photos. It also bought drivers' images from
Florida and Colorado in its effort to build a national data base to
help retailers and other businesses prevent check and credit card
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Florida and Colorado are trying to stop the
sale of driver's license information.
</P>
<P>
   Image Data hasn't sought a deal with the Georgia Department of
Public Safety, agency spokesman Gordy Wright said. The state's
privacy act prevents the agency from releasing driver's license
photos or driving records to third parties, such as Image Data,
without the individual's written permission, Wright said. The
company is testing its fraud-prevention system in several stores in
South Carolina. When a customer writes a check, the clerk processes
it through Image Data's ``True ID'' terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The device matches information on the check with the company's
data base, and it sends back a photographic image of the customer
authorized to write the check. If the photograph doesn't match the
customer's appearance, the cashier can stop the transaction, or
seek to verify the customer's identity in another way. Christie
said the system is safe from computer hackers, and the company will
not sell its information to marketing companies or provide it to
government agencies. The South Carolina Merchants Association has
endorsed Image Data's system to curb the damage of check fraud,
estimated at $200 million a year in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Greenwood, a city of 21,000 people where traditional
values are intertwined with textiles, some people resent the idea
that their driver's license photos might someday appear on a screen
in the check-out line at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had rather take my wallet out of my pocket and show my
picture rather than have it come up on a computer,'' said Blake
Barfield, a Greenwood retiree. ``Nobody needs to have my
photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered 48-year-old Gene Pinson, director of the Greenwood
County Office of Veterans Affairs, ``It is a lot of hullabaloo over
nothing. In this high-tech age, they can find out anything about
you they want.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Houvener explained his company's business in
meetings with South Carolina officials and in a Feb. 3 appearance
before the House subcommittee that was reviewing the deal. Condon
sued last month to void the sale of driver's licence information,
but a circuit judge denied the request. Condon then appealed to the
South Carolina Supreme Court, hoping the case will be sent back to
a lower court with orders to force Houvener to answer questions
about the Secret Service funding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, congressional leaders, including Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.), who helped arrange the federal grant, said they
envisioned Image Data's technology being used to combat terrorism
and immigration abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Such heavy-duty crime fighting goes far beyond Image Data's
claim that its system would only be used to prevent check and
credit card fraud. Houvener said he did not try to slip the Secret
Service grant past South Carolina officials. None asked him about
it, he said.

RACIST KILLER DESERVES DEATH PENALTY, SAY BLACK JASPER RESIDENTS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ As jurors heard testimony Wednesday that could
send white supremacist John William ``Bill'' King to the Texas
death chamber, some local black residents advocated ``eye for an
eye'' vengeance for the man convicted in the racially motivated
murder of James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Such pro-death penalty views are atypical of African-Americans,
who traditionally have felt that the ultimate punishment falls
unfairly on blacks.
</P>
<P>
   While many expressed ambivalence about capital punishment, some
felt that justice cried out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors are expected to begin deliberating King's punishment
Thursday. Because he was convicted of capital murder in the slaying
of Byrd, the 24-year-old ex-con can be sentenced to life in prison
or death.
</P>
<P>
   If sentenced to die, King would be the only white inmate in
Texas facing execution for the murder of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, black residents of Jasper said King's sentencing
is taking place in a racially charged atmosphere. One man, Billy
Floyd Larkin, warned that violence might erupt if the killer's life
is spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to burn Jasper down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that prediction was quickly discounted by others who argued
that violence could have resulted only if King had been acquitted
of murder. Once in prison, they suggested, King likely will be
targeted by hostile black inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way he's probably going to die,'' one woman observed.
</P>
<P>
   To Butch Adams, a quick, painless death isn't cruel enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needle is too easy,'' Adams insisted. ``Give him 99 years
and a dog day. Let him think about what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   And some were opposed to capital punishment, even in this most
brutal of cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two wrongs don't make a right,'' said one woman who didn't
want her name used. ``You shouldn't take what you can't give, and
you can't give life.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Spikes said she had just ``turned it over to the hands
of God and prayed for him to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Most questioned, though, favored execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be eye for eye,'' said Cloria Young, who
immediately was shushed by friends shocked at the violence of her
opinion. ``He killed the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Adams, another Jasper resident, asserted, ``Normally, I
don't believe in execution, but he needs to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is too easy. He sort of needs to be tortured some
first. He needs to be confronted with the crime scene every day he
is alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He done made history,'' added Johnny Bronson, alluding to
King's written contention that, regardless of the trial's outcome,
he had struck a historic blow for white supremacy. ``Now kill him.
Hang him to a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Way I feel about it,'' scoffed Glenn Bronson, ``is why don't
they just let him move in with us? Let him live here. We'll feed
him and everything. If he's guilty, why do we have to feed him,
doctor him, fix his teeth? It'll cost the state $2 million or $3
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said it was the brutality of the crime that
prompted them to support capital punishment for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey released last May found that black support of
capital punishment may be growing. From 1974 to 1996, the poll by
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Center indicated that
the number of blacks favoring the death penalty rose from 40
percent to 57 percent. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case in Texas, however. A Scripps-Howard
Texas Poll earlier this year showed that only 46 percent of blacks
endorse the death penalty, compared with 81 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of the justice system in Texas may feed the
misgivings blacks have about capital punishment. Texas' death row
has 59 African-Americans convicted of murdering whites.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Texas prison observers know of no white man
ever executed for the murder of a black.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Houston State University criminal justice professor James
Marquart, who co-authored a recent book examining capital
punishment, suggested cross-race murders are rare. The larger
number of blacks convicted of killing whites, he said, results in
part, from the type of crimes blacks commit _ armed robberies, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Jasper blacks questioned about King's pending
sentencing were Ronnie and Deann Armstrong. It was their fourth
wedding anniversary party that Byrd had attended the night he was
offered a ride home and wound up being chained to a pickup and
dragged to his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I am opposed to the death penalty,'' Deann
Armstrong said. ``The reason is that many innocent people, innocent
black people, have been convicted of murders ... But when a crime
is this brutal _ and there is no doubt of King's guilt _ I say the
punishment should match the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that even if the suspect were black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Armstrong, who said he had driven two intoxicated guests
home from the party but had not seen Byrd leave on foot, said he
was in favor of execution because of the crime's brutality and
King's lack of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do a dog the way they did him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Armstrongs _ as did other Jasper blacks _ suggested the
crime occurred in an atmosphere of racial injustice. And, Deann
Armstrong said, violence in the community might have been a
possibility had King not been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But justice has been served,'' she said. ``If he gets life, he
may hope for death. Either way, he's probably going to die.''

KAMAPLA MAYOR   TO SERVE 15 MONTHS IN US FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In halting English, the man dubbed ``the George
Washington of Kampala `` invoked the names he'd pulled from the
history books: Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasser Ntge Sebaggala lingered longest on one name in
particular, the one whose crimes and causes he thought most closely
tracked his own: James Michael Curley.
</P>
<P>
   If the legendary Boston mayor could be pardoned after serving
time in federal prison for mail fraud -- and return triumphantly to
the mayor's seat -- perhaps US District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay
could do the same for Sebaggala, the first democratically-elected
mayor of Uganda's capital city, Kampala, who was convicted in
December of eight charges, including bank fraud and lying to US
Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if an outright pardon wasn't possible, maybe a just a short
prison sentence, like the six months Sebaggala's lawyer, Paul V.
Kelly, had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``His case is similar to mine,'' Sebaggala, speaking alternately
in English and his native Lugandan, said of Boston's popular
political rogue. ``I seek forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, cautioning that Curley wasn't a ``real good example''
of a role model, nonetheless did cut in half the 30-month sentence
recommended by the prosecution, ordering Sebaggala, 51, to prison
for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so, not because Sebaggala's continued absence from
the mayor's office could destabilize a fledgling democracy -- as
Kelly had argued - but because Sebaggala was the sole support of
his elderly blind mother and two young sons, circumstances he
termed ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden to safequard Ugandan democracy, ``should not fall on
me,'' said Lindsay, pointing out that it was Sebaggala's foray into
criminality and subsequent conviction that threatened the stability
of his hometown. Besides the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala must
repay $44,000 to the bank he defrauded and pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sebaggala's political advisor Matthias Nsubuga called
the sentence ``a political disaster.'' Under a deal worked out at
home, Sebaggala could hold on to his office as long as he was
sentenced to no more than 9 months in prison. He has been in
custody -- either under house arrest or in prison -- since he was
arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York last June, one
month after he took office. In his absence, the deputy mayor has
been in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the 15-month sentence, Sebaggala might be out in time,
but it will be ``close to the line,'' Kelly said. He will get
credit for the time he's been in prison since December awaiting
sentencing, as well as time off for good behavior, perhaps reducing
his actual sentence to about 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nsubuga was among a contigent of more than a dozen supporters,
both from Uganda and the Boston area, who attended Wednesday's
two-hour sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which ended with Sebaggala's conviction Dec. 4, drew
the attention of Ugandans here and abroad. Last fall, 40,000 of
Sebaggala's political supporters signed a petition urging that he
be freed pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan politics even seeped into what was a straightforward
fraud case. There were references to Sebaggala's beatings and
harassment at the hands of former Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, and
to the fact that his children had been granted political asylum in
the United States because of their father's political activities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, jurors were unswayed by suggestions of an
international political conspiracy. Rather, they were convinced by
a paper trial, including deposit slips, letters and doctored checks
with erasure marks.
</P>
<P>
   Sebaggala's trouble began on June 13, 1998 at Kennedy Airport,
where he was charged with lying to customs officials in Boston when
he entered the country on an earlier trip the previous January. He
was also charged with misstating the amount of traveler's checks --
$108,000 in all -- bundled in packages in his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a federal grand jury in Boston charged
Sebaggala, who owned a foreign currency exchange in Uganda, with
depositing four stolen and altered checks into an account at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   One check, originally made out to another party for $400, was
changed to $44,000 and made payable to Sebaggalla, according to
evidence presented at trial. Another check, originally for 99
cents, was changed to $39,000 and made payable to Sebaggala.

NASSAU COUNTY JOINS NEW YORK CITY IN CONFISCATING DRUNKEN DRIVERS'

<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Following the lead of New York City, Nassau
County began confiscating the vehicles of drunken-driving suspects
on Wednesday, and Suffolk County officials said they were just days
away from starting a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau County executive, Thomas Gulotta, announced his
intention to seize cars from drunken drivers in his State of the
County address on Monday, and he wasted no time in putting the plan
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference at police headquarters here,
Gulotta said that five men were arrested early on Wednesday morning
for driving under the influence of alcohol and that their
automobiles were being held in police impound yards until they have
had their day in court _ though the police said later that one of
the five cars had been returned to its owner because he was not
legally intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't take the drunk off the road, we will take the
vehicle off the road,'' Gulotta said. ``Let's understand one thing:
driving is a privilege, not a right.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther out on Long Island, Peter A. Scully, a spokesman for the
Suffolk County executive, Robert Gaffney, said in a telephone
interview on Wednesday that his office expected to start a similar
program sometime next week. ``We will begin confiscating cars when
the logistics can be worked out with the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by the Long Island county executives further
expanded support for the forfeitures, which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
began in New York City over the weekend. Some municipal officials
in other parts of the metropolitan area also expressed support on
Wednesday, including Mayor Anthony Russo of Hoboken, N.J., who
said, ``I think the idea has legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatality rates have been climbing through the roof and we need
to do something,'' Russo said. ``I'm instructing my corporate
counsel to look into it, and if there is legally a way, we will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they did with Giuliani's program in New York, civil
libertarians were quick to jump on Gulotta's initiative as
politically motivated and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a `me too' situation going on here,'' said
Patricia Perry, president of the Nassau County chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``Drunk drivers are a problem,
everybody knows that. However, we do not believe it is legal to
take people's cars before they are ever convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau County program differs from the New York City one in
that those acquitted of charges in Nassau County will have their
vehicles immediately returned. Also, an automobile seized from a
drunken driver who does not own it will be returned to its owner if
it can be proven that the arrested driver does not have primary use
of the car.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Giuliani has said that he will seek to have
cars forfeited in civil court even if a person has been cleared of
criminal charges, regardless of who owns the car. The standard of
proof in a civil forfeiture hearing is less than that in a criminal
case.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County had about 6,000 drunken-driving arrests last year
and 23 alcohol-related fatalities, compared with 6,368 arrests and
31 fatalities in New York City.

SONY TO PROPOSE PROTECTION PLAN FOR DIGITAL MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to the growing threat of digital music piracy via the
Internet, Sony Corp. plans to propose a new copy protection scheme
Thursday designed to enable the recording industry to sell music
safely, both online and on digital formats like CDs and audio DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the first such scheme to be submitted to an
industry standards group, the Secure Digital Music Initiative,
which was established in January by the Recording Industry
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The new scheme consists of two separate copy protection systems,
Magicgate and OpenMG, both of which require special hardware
systems for scrambling music files before they are sold and
unscrambling them for listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Magicgate will embed a special chip in each recorder and
playback device. OpenMG, which is intended for personal computers
and related devices, will require that consumers purchase a
hardware device known as a dongle, which will attach to a personal
computer's serial port. The dongle will ensure that an encrypted
music file be copied by an approved digital recording device before
it can be played.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said it had also developed a third copy-protection system
known as Super Magicgate, which is intended to be a long-term
solution to the business problems presented by copy-protection
schemes. Such an approach might permit a consumer to listen to an
unlimited amount of music for a single subscription fee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswomen for the recording institute said Wednesday that
the standards group planned to meet Friday in Hollywood and that 90
companies had expressed an interest in joining the initiative. She
said the group expected other proposals besides the Sony plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The recording industry has been reeling in recent months as
consumers have begun routinely using a technology known as MP3 to
share digital, compressed music files that can be played on a
personal computer or recorded as CD's.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the institute unsuccessfully sued Diamond Multimedia
after it introduced a tiny portable player known as the Rio that
permits a computer user to get an MP3 file from the Internet and
then listen to it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And many consumer electronics industry analysts believe that the
emergence of the Internet and inexpensive digital copying systems
presents a profound threat to the existing system of music
distribution on compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a number of musicians have begun to break ranks with
the studios and are distributing their music directly via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tsunami headed toward the recording industry,''
said Rick Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a consulting
firm for the industry in Seaford, N.Y. He said the danger facing
the industry is that it was attempting to make it more complicated
for consumers to listen to music at the very time that the Internet
was dramatically lowering the barriers to digital music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marvelous reflection of everything that is good
about the Internet, and the world is voting with its keyboards,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the industry may succeed in erecting technical
copyright barriers around music recorded in studios, Doherty said
that it would face a growing challenge from musicians who retain
control over their live performances.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the standards group, five record companies
announced Feb. 8 that they were joining IBM to conduct a market
trial of a system that permits distribution of full-length,
CD-quality recordings to consumers in an encrypted format. The
music companies included BMG, EMI, Sony Music, Universal Music and
Warner Music.

NEW WEB SITE TO BE AN ONLINE PHARMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Internet surfing give you a headache? Now a new site,
backed by Amazon.com, wants to sell you aspirin along with
prescription drugs and other over-the-counter health and beauty
products.
</P>
<P>
   After establishing itself as the most successful bookstore on
the World Wide Web, Amazon has been moving quickly to become a
full-service electronic mall. It offers music and videos itself,
and its new ``shop the Web'' service offers links to dozens of
other online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which owns 46 percent of Drugstore.com, will promote the
new site with links throughout its service and through e-mail to
its customers. But the two stores will be otherwise separate. Thus,
a flu sufferer will not be able, in one transaction, to order
decongestant and a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com, which is to start business Thursday, is hardly
counting on Amazon for its customers and has bought promotional
space on popular Internet services, including America Online, Yahoo
and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's involvement was orchestrated by John Doerr, the
influential venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
who had been an early backer of both companies. Last summer, Doerr
persuaded Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, to invest in
Drugstore and to serve on its board.
</P>
<P>
   The companies declined to say the amount of Amazon's investment.
But they did say that Drugstore.com has raised $60 million, and
that Amazon owns 46 percent of the shares outstanding, though
employee stock options will dilute that holding to 40 percent.
Bezos declined to say if Amazon has investments in other
electronic-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few sites have sold drugs and beauty products online,
though many smaller sites sell vitamins and nutritional
supplements. But the stakes are huge. Drugs and cosmetics are a
$150 billion-a-year market in the United States, more than seven
times the market for books.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, an electronic-commerce analyst at Jupiter
Communications, estimated that $66 million of health and beauty
products would be sold online this year. By 2002, she estimated
that online sales in the category would be $1.2 billion _ 3 percent
of the overall market. By contrast in that year, she estimated that
11 percent of books would be sold on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Building an online pharmacy is difficult because of the
complexity of making it fast and easy to use for buying a large
number of small items. So far sites offering groceries over the
Internet have had disappointing results, though they face the
additional challenge of handling perishable goods. And Wal-Mart,
which originally had emphasized staples on its large Internet site,
has changed to focus on bigger-ticket items like electronics.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the Internet cannot help people who need
prescriptions immediately for an acute condition. There is a
thriving mail-order pharmacy business, now accounting for 13
percent of the market, for drugs that people take on a regular
basis. But the Internet sites may not be able to tap into all of
that market because many managed care plans have exclusive
relationships with mail-order pharmacies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite these challenges, a number of other companies are vying
to serve as the pharmacist to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Soma.com began in January and is emphasizing the prescription
drug market. Planet Rx, backed by two other top Silicon Valley
venture funds _ Benchmark Capital and Sequoia Capital _ is to open
in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   William Razzouk, chief executive of Planet Rx, said it would
emphasize information and communities of users built around a
series of specific Web sites like Cancer.com.
</P>
<P>
   The major drugstore chains have been slow to enter the market.
Drug Emporium, a regional chain based in Powell, Ohio, does sell
some products on its Web site. And Rite Aid and General Nutrition
have announced plans to open a site in the fall to sell drugs and
vitamins. Rite Aid is already selling $1 million a month in
prescription refills that its customers order online and pick up in
their local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Griffin, editor in chief of Drug Store News, said Internet
sales were unlikely to be a threat to the big chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of categories, people go to the Web because it is
more convenient,'' Ms. Griffin added. ``But there is no more
convenient retail outlet than a drugstore.'' Drugstores also
disproportionally serve older people, who are the most reluctant to
shop online, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com hopes to compensate for this by exploiting the
benefits of the Internet. The site will carry 15,000 items, three
times the stock of the average chain drugstore. And it will store a
record of its customers' purchasers, making regular shopping
faster.
</P>
<P>
   It will also have articles written by its staff, giving advice
on which products to buy. Unlike Planet RX, it will not feature
comments by users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want teen-agers writing about which condoms they
liked,'' said Peter Neupert, the company's chief executive.

`8MM' WALLOWS IN THE SLEAZE 
</HEADLINE>
 -REVIEW -LADN  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients  on Friday, Feb. 26 or
thereafter ) 
OUR RATING: 2 STAR S 
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the thoroughly unpleasant ``8mm,'' Nicolas
Cage does a 180 from his performance in his last intolerable
thriller, ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous film boasted an eye-popping, over-the-top attempt
to distract us from its nonsensical cluelessness; in this one, Cage
plays it so grave and depressive that our attention repeatedly
drifts away from him. We end up wallowing in ``8mm's'' deviant,
clammy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It's not anything you want to be exposed to for extended lengths
of time.
</P>
<P>
   Cage plays Tom Welles, a working-class guy whose impressive
self-control and discretion has lifted him up to the status of
Pennsylvania high society's favorite private eye. Married to a
well-bred writer (Catherine Keener) and the father of a baby
daughter, Welles lives in a picturesque little house beside a
pleasant, woodsy creek.
</P>
<P>
   That he doesn't seem to mind spending much of his time away on
business and gets a kind of perverse pleasure out of lying to his
wife about quitting smoking would perhaps indicate some dark
resentment roiling beneath Welles' buttoned-down veneer.
</P>
<P>
   But nah, the script does take Welles on a nightmare journey in
which his assumptions about himself are confronted and tested, but
what's revealed is a pretty simple, standard bent for
self-righteous vigilantism. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker doesn't
bring out the complexities of motivation he got at in his superior
script for ``Seven,'' let alone the kind of character
contradictions initially hinted at here.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Welles is hired by a super-wealthy widow to quietly
investigate a reel of film depicting a teen-age girl apparently
being murdered _ the proverbial snuff film _ that was found in her
late husband's private safe. She wants reassurance that the sick
production was staged, that the unknown girl is still alive. Money,
of course, is no obstacle, so the case becomes Welles' quest.
</P>
<P>
   An extended stretch of detective grunt work leads Welles to a
tentative identification of the victim, then to the film's best
scenes: meetings with the long-missing girl's sad, lonely mother,
magnificently played by Amy Morton as a woman whose hopelessness
gives her a strange kind of sustenance. The trail then meanders to
Hollywood's porno underworld, where Welles descends deeper and
deeper into the purgatory of extra-legal fetish stuff: hard-core
domination, kiddie porn, fake snuff.
</P>
<P>
   His guide through these circles of desire is Max Hollywood
(Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring musician and adult-bookstore clerk
who proves a resourceful, goofy font of hidden knowledge. Welles
eventually locates a sleazy, X-video producer (James Gandolfini,
overdoing the ooze) and a New York director of bizarre
``specialty'' films (Peter Stormare, overdoing everything). From
there, things get bloody, obsessive, demented ... but not
necessarily any better than the low-key passages that dragged on
before.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Joel Schumacher, best-known for his ``Batman''
sequels and John Grisham potboilers. He is obviously reaching for
something deeper and more stirring with ``8mm,'' but the execution
is too often superficial and confused. A film with this kind of
degraded subject matter has to be sharply insightful and resonate
deeply, like a ``Boogie Nights'' did, to justify itself. Otherwise,
it just comes off as exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   You can see Schumacher trying to get at something serious
throughout ``8mm,'' but he's overwhelmed by the film's tawdry
elements. When you roll around in this stuff, it's hard to not look
dirty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a moment early in the terrible new
ensemble comedy ``200 Cigarettes'' when a woman, preparing to host
a New Year's Eve party, turns to a friend and says, ``It's going to
be the worst, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend doesn't answer, but she doesn't need to. It's
unspoken. And it's the same feeling that crept over me while
watching this horrendously bad movie, the feeling that you'd rather
be (BEGIN ITALICS)anywhere(END ITALICS) else but in the middle of
this train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is Exhibit A (and B, C and D) as to why there
are movie directors and why there are casting directors and why the
two professions should remain distinct and separate. Risa Bramon
Garcia has cast successful movies such as ``The Joy Luck Club,''
``Wall Street'' and ``Desperately Seeking Susan.'' Here, she has
assembled a veritable who's who of young performers, including Ben
and Casey Affleck, Courtney Love, Christina Ricci and Paul Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious from moment one, that, as a director, Garcia
hasn't a clue what to do once she steps behind the camera. ``200
Cigarettes'' is an exercise in inertia with slapped-together,
lifeless scenes that drag on and on and on. Kind of like emphysema
_ only less fun.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in New York's East Village on New Year's Eve
1981. The story offers no real reason for the setting; it solely
exists to serve the soundtrack. (This is an MTV Films production.)
Everyone is headed to a bash thrown by Monica (Martha Plimpton) and
her friend Hillary (Catherine Keller). The thing is, nobody wants
to be the first to arrive, and so the clock keeps ticking, and
Monica starts to fret over the crab dip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lucy (Love) and the morose Kevin (Rudd), both
dateless, argue and flirt with the possibility of consummating
their friendship with a little bathroom stall sex. Jack (Jay Mohr)
and Cindy (Kate Hudson) already have done the deed _ the night
before _ and now are awkwardly dealing with the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Val (Ricci), who would love to find a sexual
partner, but her killjoy friend, Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann), keeps
raining on her parade. Tom (Casey Affleck) is a poetic street punk;
Ben Affleck plays a doofus bartender, and David Chappelle is the
funky disco cabbie who dispenses advice and oversees all the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't one moment or character in this movie that feels
real, with the exception of Hudson's turn as the vulnerable Cindy.
Director Garcia moves from one static scene to another, seeming to
think that if she keeps playing cool '80s songs in the background
(lots of Elvis Costello) nobody will notice how boring the movie
is. The fact that Shana Larsen populated her screenplay with
nothing but ciphers certainly doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The pacing is awful. Most scenes play several beats too long; at
one point, you can almost hear somebody (the gaffer?) yell,
``Cut!'' in the background. Of course, that could well have been my
imagination. My mind certainly had plenty of time to wander.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Myles Berkowitz wanted to make movies, but no one
in Hollywood would return his phone calls. He had the same problem
with women _ messages would go unanswered, potential girlfriends
suddenly would be transferred to jobs in places like Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Berkowitz decided to combine the failures of his
personal and professional lives and turn them into a career move.
The result, ``20 Dates,'' is an amusing, unflinching look at one
man's quest for fulfillment that plays at times like a documentary
and, at other moments, an old-fashioned romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is Berkowitz, a headstrong, annoying, opinionated
guy in his mid-30s trying to sort through the mysteries of life and
love. His agent says he needs to learn to compromise; his friends
say he pushes too hard. No one wants to set him up on a date
because past experiences have proved embarrassing, and ``20 Dates''
contains plenty of documentary evidence to support their position.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz aims to go out on 20 dates, film them and come away
with a movie _ and maybe, just maybe, true love. Initially, he
tries to shoot his encounters secretly to give the footage a raw,
natural feel. A lawsuit from a disillusioned date puts an end to
that. Another date ends badly when she orders a three-pound lobster
at Gladstone's 4 Fish, a meal that taxes Myles' already
overburdened credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz also comes under fire from his financial backer, a
foul-mouthed producer, Elie Samaha, who wants the movie to have
more skin and less gab. Berkowitz surreptitiously tape records
Samaha in his office, and his tirades (so crude as to be almost
surreal) provide some of the film's funniest moments.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his quest, something unexpected happens.
Berkowitz meets a beautiful, seemingly intelligent woman named
Elisabeth and falls in love. What's more surprising is that she
actually seems to like him and enjoy his company. What she doesn't
appreciate is the fact that Myles still has to go out on several
dates to complete the project. This provides the film's major
conflict: love or career? Berkowitz provides a deft resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' could have been too cute by half, but Berkowitz's
abrasiveness (not to mention his willingness to look foolish) keeps
things lively. Still, the movie often feels rather slight, like an
extended David Letterman stunt. And if Berkowitz had not actually
met his dream date, ``20 Dates'' would have been an exercise in
tedium. Interestingly enough, Berkowitz found his movie at the
precise moment he found love. It's that serendipity that makes this
a moviegoing courtship worth pursuing.

`JUST THE TICKET' MORE CLOYING THAN CUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients  on Friday, Feb. 26 or
thereafter ) 
OUR RATING: 2 STARS  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the sluggish new romance ``Just the Ticket,''
level-headed Linda (Andie MacDowell) tries to explain why she can't
stay away from her no-account boyfriend, a noble ticket scalper
named Gary (Andy Garcia).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's those puppy-dog eyes!'' Linda sweetly murmurs. ``Those
puppy-dog eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the Ticket'' is a puppy-dog-eyes kind of movie. As such,
it's hard to resist at times. It might even be kind of sweet if it
didn't try so hard. But what writer-director Richard Wenk really
needed here was a swat on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.
Because too often, he crosses the line between cute and cloying,
resulting in a movie that's more heartburn than heartwarming.
</P>
<P>
   Gary is a likable, salt-of-the-earth ticket scalper _ in other
words the kind of guy who exists only in the movies. When the pope
comes to Yankee Stadium to deliver a state-of-the-world address,
Gary sees the chance of a lifetime. He hopes to lay his hands on as
many tickets as he can find and then turn around and sell them for
as much money as the faithful will fork out. Then, maybe Linda will
regard him as something more than a lovable schmoe.
</P>
<P>
   Linda, though, already has seemed to have moved on. She has a
dependable (read: boring) boyfriend and is hoping to turn her
culinary training into a trip to the Cordon Bleu in Paris. But
then, Gary shows up, and she looks into those puppy dog eyes and
(cue romantic soundtrack) her resolve begins to melt.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things wrong with ``Just the Ticket,''
starting with the character of Gary himself. When you think of
ticket scalpers, several thoughts come to mind, but none of them
are sympathetic or even remotely likable. Most of them, in fact,
can't be printed in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that Gary dreams of sticking it to devoted
people who simply want to see a revered religious leader, and you
have a guy, when you look beyond those dewy eyes, who is pretty
much scum of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you can get beyond that because it's Andy Garcia
acting here and he's so darn nice. Unfortunately, writer-director
Richard Wenk doesn't trust his actors enough to let them do the
heavy work. Thus, you have countless shots of a cute little dog
preciously reacting to the action. (Even then, the dog by itself
isn't adorable enough. Wenk has to add one of those veterinary cone
collars for maximum cuteness.) Kisses are filmed in slow-motion.
Garcia wears a funny hat.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this some clumsy transitions, a plot that takes much too
long to resolve and a poorly sketched female lead and you have a
movie that's hard to like even when it's practically forcing you to
do so.  &UR; !ital! &LR; (Those eyes!) &UR; !off! &LR;  The final straw comes in the
home stretch when Gary employs a gambit straight out of ``Sister
Act'' to elude police and fulfill his dream of gouging New York's
Catholics. Bad sign: You root for the cops. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

 &HT;    Upsets reveal not much difference in Nos. 1-64
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlsbad, Calif. _ Welcome to Black Wednesday at the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship. All the title sponsor needed
after such a brutal first round was to combine it with a stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the danger of match-play tournaments. Top seeds fall and
TV ratings suffer. And while Tiger Woods avoided The Unthinkable by
beating Nick Faldo in his first-round match, the debris was
everywhere else at the La Costa Resort.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 3 Mark O'Meara lost to No. 62 Michael Bradley, 4 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 4 Davis Love III of Sea Island lost to No. 61 Steve Pate,
1 up.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 6 Colin Montgomerie lost to No. 59 Craig Stadler, 5 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 7 Ernie Els lost to No. 58 Paul Azinger, 1 up.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11 Jim Furyk lost to No. 50 Patrick Sjoland, 5 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an enviable position,'' said Azinger, who handled Els, a
three-time England World Match Play champion. ``I think even though
I was playing this great player, I really had everything to gain
and nothing to lose. I really wasn't nervous today or anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day when 18 lower seeds beat higher ones. Players
ranked 41-50 were 7-3. But, then again, we're talking about
rankings that constantly draw criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players all know the rankings are pretty silly,'' Azinger
said. ``This isn't tennis, where if a sixth seed gets beaten by the
60th seed, it's a big shock.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the No. 2 seed but generally regarded as the
world's best player for the last year and a half, beat Australia's
Stephen Leaney 2 and 1 and said, ``There's so little difference
between No. 64 and No. 1. It may be one or two putts through the
course of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who won England's Cisco World Match Play over Woods,
said of Bradley, ``He made no mistakes today, and that's the key in
match play. Any one of these guys can beat the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, who won the Andersen event in its previous form two
years ago, was peeved at Stadler for a few short putts not
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy North (of ESPN) told me that (Monty) gave me a good
little glare on 13,'' Stadler said. ``But, you know, when it's to
stay in the match and he's got four feet, I'm not going to give it
to him. He can glare all he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   CINK ADVANCES
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Stewart Cink could be headed for a third-round meeting
against Woods. Cink, seeded 48th, ousted No. 19 Payne Stewart 3 and
2 by birdieing four of six holes on the back nine. To force a match
with Woods, whom he handled capably in college, Cink needs to
handle Australia's Craig Parry while Woods moves past Bob Tway.
``Payne didn't play like his normal self,'' Cink said. ``He wasn't
comfortable. I just played my game. I didn't give myself a chance
to mess up.'' ... The 16 second-round matches begin today at 12:15
p.m. ... Duval meets Bill Glasson, who defeated Stuart Appleby 2
and 1.

FATHER PLEADS FOR SON'S LIFE DURING PUNISHMENT PHASE OF TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Sitting in a wheelchair and breathing oxygen,
Ronald King begged a jury to spare his son's life Wednesday. ``I
love him,'' he gasped. ``You don't love everything they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which a day earlier convicted avowed white supremacist
John William ``Bill'' King, 24, of the brutal dragging death of
James Byrd Jr., a black man, will begin deliberating Thursday on
whether King will be sentenced to life in prison or death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday two experts differed on whether King poses a
continuing threat to society should he be given a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested a lot of love in that boy,'' the elder King,
who suffers from emphysema, said on the stand, ``and I'd hate to
think we're going to lose him.'' When a defense attorney asked if
he wanted the jury to sentence his son to life in prison, King
gasped, ``Anything is better than losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, who was adopted when he was 3 months old, began to get
into trouble after his mother died when he was 16, the elder King
said. He never showed racist tendencies before going to prison in
1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other testimony showed that King was assaulted on his first day
in the Beto I prison unit at Tennessee Colony. He later became part
of a tiny Ku Klux Klan group called the Confederate Knights of
America.
</P>
<P>
   His son asked to be excused from the courtroom and watched the
testimony on a television monitor from a side room. He had sat
emotionless during the trial, seeming even to fall asleep as a
psychologist testified in his favor earlier Wednesday. But King
appeared to have been crying when he returned to the courtroom
after his father's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After the elder King's testimony Wednesday, three members of
Byrd's family approached him outside the courtroom. Byrd's
28-year-old daughter, Renee Mullins, hugged Ronald King and said,
``God bless you.'' He answered, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sisters, Clara Taylor and Betty Boatner, also introduced
themselves to Ronald King and his daughter, Carol King Spadaccini.
Boatner told him: ``He's in God's hands. Put it in God's hands. God
loves everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Ronald King talked to her family by telephone
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   King's father was the second of two witnesses called by his
attorneys during the punishment phase of the trial. The other,
former Texas prison system psychologist Dr. Walter Quijano, said
there would be little likelihood that King would perform violent
acts if kept in prison until he is at least 64 _ when he would
first be eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano said King had a history of burglary, not violence. ``A
burglar need not become a murderer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one became one in this case?'' asked John Stevens, one of
the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the psychologist said.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano predicted that if sentenced to life in prison, King
would be kept in a small, single cell for 22 hours a day, being let
out only to spend time in a small recreation room by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Smithey, a state investigator who specializes in crimes in
Texas prisons, said that if he gets a life sentence King could
possibly earn good conduct credit to be put into the general prison
population.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano also said King has shown no sorrow about the death of
Byrd, who was dragged behind a pickup for 3 miles along back
country roads June 7. Along the way his head, right shoulder and
arm were ripped from his body.
</P>
<P>
   A person who shows no remorse for a crime remains more dangerous
than those who do show sorrow, Quijano said.
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont psychiatrist Dr. Edward Gripon testified that King's
writings and his racist and satanic tattoos show that he will
present a continuing threat of violence. ``It's plain common sense
that that's not going to go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the letters King wrote from jail and prison show that he
has no regret for what happened to Byrd and that he is a racist.
``If they are heavily invested in that kind of ideology, it's not
going to just go away,'' he said of people like King.
</P>
<P>
   He said some crimes are so extreme and so dramatic, ``they
remove all doubt what the person is capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the courtroom Gripon said King reminded him of a
Bosnian soldier accused of terrible war crimes whom he once
interviewed. ``I asked him how he could do the terrible things he
did to other human beings,'' Gripon said. ``He said they weren't
human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gripon said he thinks King's racist beliefs are based on
feelings of inadequacy. At the time he first went to prison he was
only 5-foot-7 and weighed only about 165 pounds, Gripon said. The
tattoos that cover much of his body are an attempt to make himself
appear more fierce, Gripon said.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony Wednesday, Jasper County Deputy Sheriff Joe
Sterling said King threatened him with violence in January when he
refused to leave his cell for a court appearance. ``He said he had
nothing to lose,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Jailer Kenneth Primrose said that same day King smashed a
television and radio in his cell. King was removed from his cell
while jailers cleaned up the mess, Primrose said. While cleaning
the cell they also searched it and found a noose made of electrical
cords and an eight-inch, home-made knife, called a ``shank'' made
of parts torn from the radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   King was apparently upset because he had learned that his former
girlfriend and the mother of his 6-month-old son was living with
another man and was pregnant by her new lover, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys will make final arguments Thursday before the jury is
asked three questions _ if King intended for Byrd to die, if King
will pose a future threat of violence and if there are any
mitigating circumstances that should keep him from being given the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   If each of the jurors answers ``yes'' to the first two questions
and ``no'' to the third, King will be sentenced to death by lethal
injection. If any juror answers the other way to any of the three
questions, he will be sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real simple: Did he intend for Mr. Byrd to die. Is he a
future threat? Are there any mitigating circumstances?'' said
Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray. ``If they answer
one way, he'll get life. If they answer the other way, he'll get
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real big on the death penalty,'' Gray said, ``but I
don't want this guy out when he's 65 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs said
the trial has been a difficult one for him. ``What I say might make
the difference in whether he lives or dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an awful long night till tomorrow,'' Cribbs
said. ``It gets harder each time (he handles a death penalty case.)
I don't believe in the death penalty. I just plain do not believe
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is all horrible,'' he said. ``No matter what the world
sees, this man is loved, he loves and he is a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other men, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, and Lawrence Russell
Brewer Jr., 31, also are awaiting trials on capital murder charges
in Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he has no idea when those trials will take place. ``I
like to take one trial at a time,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Attempts to forge the world's first global treaty to regulate
trade in genetically modified products failed when the United
States and five other big agricultural exporters rejected a
proposal that had the support of the rest of the roughly 130
nations at the talks. The treaty's supporters said it would reduce
the risk of harmful effects from introducing genes of different
species into plants, animals or microorganisms. But Washington and
its allies argued that it would entangle the world's food trade in
red tape.

BOEING VOWS TO GET RID OF MONEY-LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Top Boeing executives Wednesday promised a review of
every company program, with an ``immediate full court press'' on
the three or four losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Phil Condit and the company's new chief financial
officer Debby Hopkins wouldn't say what programs those are or
specify their plans, although they said the moves could range from
canceling ailing commercial jetliner programs to closing
machine-parts plants.
</P>
<P>
   But they said $1.3 billion of the company's capital, about 10
percent of the total, is invested in money-losing,
``value-destroying'' ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have zero tolerance for value destruction at The Boeing
Co.,'' Hopkins declared. Except for the Boeing Learning Center
(which handles worker training and education), she said, all
programs will either make money or be sold. She noted that the
company sold its civilian helicopter division last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just airplane programs. It is every single program
we've got,'' Condit said. ``There are no sacred cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Boeing would consider dropping the 717 or other
civilian jets, Condit said: ``Of course. There's nothing that
escapes scrutiny here.'' He said Boeing also will consider
consolidating machining and composite-parts building into just a
few locations, which could result in plant closures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do high-speed machining in 15 different
places,'' he said. ``We're going to focus that activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the commercial-jet unit is likely to get the most
attention, where Boeing could cancel the slow-selling 717 model or
scale back expensive plans to develop longer-range versions of
other jets. People close to the company have said it plans to sell
an information-services unit based in Vienna, Va., that has about
$300 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The military-aircraft division isn't likely to see major
changes. Boeing executives said they're pleased with progress in
the highly profitable unit, which generated 85 percent of Boeing's
profit while accounting for just 23 percent of last year's sales.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was explained Tuesday to stock analysts gathered in
Orlando, Fla., and Wednesday in a phone conference with the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco money manager Bill Whitlow said the most notable aspect
of the announcement was that Boeing had not known until now what
its money-losing programs were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they've got the new chief financial officer, and they find
they've got these problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the company's ongoing problems, Condit and
Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president, asked the board of directors
Tuesday not to grant them bonuses for 1998. They also asked for no
bonuses for ``several Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group
executives.'' They didn't identify them, but the group may include
former executives, such as one-time divisional boss Ron Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Condit was paid $884,675 and received a bonus of
$446,000, plus stock options. Stonecipher received $895,345 in
salary and a $489,300 bonus. He also received $14.7 million in
other compensation, nearly all from before the merger with
McDonnell Douglas, where he was chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to Boeing employees, Condit and Stonecipher said
their action ``is fitting and proper if we are truly to move
forward with a performance-based culture.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be part of the pre-negotiation positioning with the
Aerospace Machinists. In the last negotiation cycle, big bonuses to
top bosses were an irritant to union workers being asked for
concessions on their medical plan. The same union is negotiating a
contract this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, union president, didn't comment on the bonuses,
but released a statement on the threat of program sell-offs.
``Simply raising the possibility of eliminating programs does
nothing to boost the already low morale on the shop floor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Condit declined to comment on the recent rumor that General
Electric is about to buy Boeing. A GE acquisition would raise major
antitrust concerns, because GE is one of three producers of jet
engines used on Boeing's commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stock, which declined $1.75 a share to close at $35.38 a
share in trading Wednesday, has fallen 32 percent in the past two
years, the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Rising costs and steep discounts on civilian planes have eroded
Boeing's earnings. Led by Hopkins, named to her post late last
year, Boeing is trying to show it's serious about boosting returns.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning his recent statement about Boeing being a potential
takeover target because of its low stock price, Condit said,
``There is real value to be created in this company. Our choice is,
do we do it? Or do we let somebody else do it? I like the idea of
us doing it a heck of a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit and Hopkins also discussed Boeing's opportunities. Among
Boeing's three divisions, commercial aircraft, missiles and
defense, and space and communications, the company sees the biggest
opportunities in the latter group, Condit said. In commercial
aircraft, its opportunity is in maintenance and overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 10,683 Boeing jets flying around the world,'' Condit
said. ``What are we doing to capture our fair share of that
services market? The answer is, not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing does not plan any big new commercial airplane programs.
``I don't think the market requirement is there, and you can't
create something out of nothing,'' Condit said.
</P>

Associated Press.

RENO AND STARR AGREE TO NEGOTIATE FRAMEWORK FOR INQUIRY

   WASHINGTON _ In a private meeting at the Justice Department,
Attorney General Janet Reno and Kenneth Starr agreed amicably to
negotiate a framework for an investigation of his tactics in the
Lewinsky case, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual meeting, which took place on Sunday after Reno's
return from South Africa, was an effort to repair the breach
between the two officials. Their once-cordial relationship had
soured as a bitter dispute broke out over the Justice Department's
decision to open an internal ethics inquiry into whether Starr's
prosecutors abused their authority.

<P>
   The officials' efforts to move forward, however, have suddenly
been thrown into question, now that an authoritative third party
has decided to intervene. The three-judge panel that appointed
Starr as independent counsel issued an order, announced on Tuesday,
directing Reno and Starr to file legal briefs staking out their
positions on whether the department has jurisdiction to investigate
an independent counsel's practices.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's order was in response to a petition filed on Feb. 11
by the Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative law group in
Virginia, which asked the three federal appellate judges to stop
Reno's new inquiry. Landmark contends that the attorney general
does not have the authority to investigate an independent counsel
about his official duties. The department and the independent
counsel have until early next month to reply.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, several government lawyers said they were mystified
by the panel's ruling, maintaining that the independent counsel law
did not appear to give private groups like Landmark any legal
standing to intercede in a Justice Department investigation. Nor,
they said, did the law grant the judicial panel the authority to
discipline independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The department has told Starr that the investigation will focus
on whether Starr's prosecutors improperly coerced witnesses like
Monica Lewinsky or withheld information from department lawyers
about possible conflicts of interest at the outset of the Lewinsky
inquiry in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law gives the attorney general sole
responsibility for dismissing an independent counsel. Department
officials have told Starr that inherent in that removal power is
the authority to conduct a fact-finding investigation that they
believe is necessary to determine whether Starr should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, stepping squarely into the dispute creates the
impression that the judges are trying to protect Starr, government
officials said. The judicial panel is headed by Judge David B.
Sentelle of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, who pushed
for Starr's appointment as the independent counsel. Starr, who was
appointed in August 1994 by Sentelle and two other appellate
judges, replaced Robert B. Fiske Jr., who had been appointed by
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Mark R. Levin, Landmark's president, said in an interview
Wednesday that the attorney general was trying to exercise
authority that the statute reserves as a function of Congress. ``I
think the Justice Department is going to have to explain what
exactly it seeks to investigate and why, and what its legal
authority is,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, the attorney general bristled at reports that
Starr's prosecutors had complained that the department was
operating at the behest of White House officials, the government
officials said. In turn, Starr complained to her that the
department was behind news articles about the internal inquiry, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno and Starr were conciliatory, the officials said. Reno
indicated to Starr that she did not want the department's inquiry
to be perceived as a prelude to another Saturday night massacre,
like President Richard Nixon's dismissal of special prosecutor
Archibald Cox on Oct. 20, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Starr appeared willing to accept the investigation as long as it
its fairness could be assured, and Reno appeared willing to accept
a negotiated plan as long as she retained authority over the
inquiry, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming as the Independent Counsel Act is about to expire and
when lawmakers appear unlikely to re-authorize it, the attorney
general's dispute with the independent counsel seems like the final
battle waged after the combatants have decided to give up the war.
But the stakes are high for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For Reno, the inquiry culminates a year in which she has grown
frustrated by Starr's practices, some of which she believed were
overreaching, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, the inquiry poses a much more direct threat. If Reno
found that he had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct, she could
remove him from his office or issue a reprimand that would taint
Starr's inquiry. Her findings could serve as an official
endorsement of the view of President Clinton's lawyers that Starr
had abused his prosecutorial powers in a relentless pursuit of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Starr's office, some prosecutors remain highly suspicious
of Reno's motives. One of Starr's associates recently called the
Justice Department inquiry ``politically motivated,'' and wondered
whether an aggressive investigation, coming less than two weeks
after the Senate's acquittal of the president, had been quietly
encouraged by a vengeful White House.

FATHER PLEADS FOR LIFE OF RACIST KILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ In an emotion-choked voice, the father of the
white supremacist convicted of capital murder in the dragging death
of an African-American man begged jurors Wednesday to sentence his
son to life imprisonment, not lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested a lot of love in that boy,'' Ronald King,
seated in a wheelchair, said of John William ``Bill'' King, 24,
whom he and his late wife adopted when the boy was 3 months old.
``I hate to think we're going to lose him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs if he
thought the jury should give his son life imprisonment, the retired
timber worker fought back sobs. ``Anything is better than ... '' he
said before he was too overcome to finish his reply.
</P>
<P>
   The younger King was found guilty of capital murder Tuesday in
the torture slaying of James Byrd Jr., 49. Two other ex-convicts,
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 24, will be tried in
the same crime later.
</P>
<P>
   After final arguments Thursday morning, the jury of 11 whites
and one black, who is the foreman, will be sequestered to decide
King's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King, 67, said his son had black friends while he was
growing up in Jasper, including one whom the father considered a
role model for his son. But the younger King changed after going to
prison in 1995 for violating probation on a burglary conviction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   William King's attorneys contended that his transformation into
a racist _ after six black inmates beat him on his arrival at the
Beto I Unit _ is a mitigating factor that the jury should consider.
</P>
<P>
   In considering punishment, the jury must determine whether King
intended to kill Byrd and whether he would be a continuing threat
to society, either in prison or after his possible release 40 years
into a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   A forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Edward Gripon of Beaumont,
testified for the prosecution Wednesday that King would remain a
``continued threat for future acts of violence.'' He said that
crimes such as the kidnap-slaying of Byrd are ``so extreme and so
dramatic, they remove all doubt what the person is capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Quijano, a former chief psychologist of Texas prisons
who practices in Conroe, testified for the defense. He maintained
that, with proper prison classification and safeguards, King would
not be a risk.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination, Quijano conceded that black and
Jewish inmates could risk bodily harm in a chance encounter with
King.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Quijano said that King, based on his
racist writings, ``would accomplish his goal if he is executed:
becoming a martyr'' in the white supremacist movement.
</P>
<P>
   After the day's session, District Attorney Guy James Gray said
Quijano ``may have been a better witness for us than our witness.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who sat impassively Tuesday when the jury found him
guilty, asked to leave the courtroom Wednesday before his father
testified.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney later said that King cried while watching his
father on closed circuit television from an adjoining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as strong as you think he is,'' Cribbs said. Later,
the Beaumont attorney said, ``He loves. He is a human being. He's a
proud man _ Billy. Sometimes it becomes unmanly (for him) to show
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   After testifying, Ronald King was wheeled to an elevator, where
he was breathing heavily through a plastic tube connected to an
oxygen tank because of his emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   There he encountered three of Byrd's relatives for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you,'' said Byrd's eldest daughter, Renee Mullins,
28. She leaned down and gently hugged the man who frequently wept
in court while his son sat expressionless, even snoozing at one
point during Wednesday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Ronald King replied. ``This happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in God's hands,'' said one of Byrd's sisters, Betty
Boatner as tears ran down the cheeks of all present. ``He loves
everybody,'' said Boatner, a Sunday school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a Jasper County jailer testified that a homemade knife,
called a ``shank'' in prison jargon, and a small noose were found
under King's mattress after the defendant smashed his TV set and
boombox in his cell. The weapons were fashioned from TV and radio
parts, jailer Kenneth Primrose said. The testimony was apparently
aimed at depicting King's violent nature.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Primrose said King was then placed
under suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
   But the jailer said he was unaware that King's outburst was
prompted by Kylie Greeney, his girlfriend and the mother of his
child, who had just informed him that she was pregnant and living
with another man.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sterling, an investigator with the Jasper County Sheriff's
Department, testified that King issued a threat after refusing to
be taken to the courthouse on Jan. 6. He paraphrased the defendant
as saying, ``It's nothing personal, but assaulting a peace
officer'' didn't mean anything because he had nothing to live for.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, witnesses detailed King's criminal record, which had
previously been kept from the jury. He stole a shotgun and tools
from a small metal storage shed at 16, then helped break into a
video rental store a few months later. He was charged with
assaulting a sister but was not prosecuted. After violating
probation after a stint in boot camp, King spent two years in
prison.

JURY WILL DECIDE IF PREACHER CHOSE PROFIT OVER HIS PULPIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Nev.) (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ A day of reckoning is drawing near for the
embattled preacher who heads the largest black religious
organization in the nation, a man who used his pulpit for profit
and once even pocketed money that had been donated to rebuild
churches destroyed by arson, prosecutors said Wednesday in closing
arguments in the monthlong trial of the Rev. Henry J. Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   A jury was expected to begin deliberations here on Thursday in
the racketeering trial of Lyons and his former aide, Bernice
Edwards, a convicted embezzler who, prosecutors say, helped the St.
Petersburg preacher swindle more than $4 million from corporations
eager to do business with the National Baptist Convention USA.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Wednesday and on Tuesday, prosecutors
described the relationship between the defendants as a ``Bonnie and
Clyde'' partnership in which they used the pulpit and the good name
of a 100-year-old religious organization to finance a lifestyle of
posh real estate, luxury cars and shopping sprees for clothes and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Lyons and Ms. Edwards peddled a nonexistent
membership list to large companies that wanted to market cemetery
plots, life insurance policies and even credit cards, and then
devised elaborate schemes to hide the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their creed was greed,'' Assistant State Attorney Jim
Hellickson said in the prosecution's closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is accused of stealing some $250,000 from the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money that had been donated
to rebuild some black churches in the South that had been destroyed
by arson.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lyons and Ms. Edwards, who before moving to Florida
was convicted in Wisconsin of embezzling from a school for at-risk
children, were living richly. They had a $700,000 waterfront house;
a time-share condominium in Lake Tahoe, Nev.; two Mercedeses; a
Rolls-Royce; a diamond that one witness described as being as big
as a dime; and other expensive items, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using a gun to rob their victims, they used a pen
and they used their word,'' said Hellickson. Lyons is also charged
with grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   But in their own closing arguments Wednesday, lawyers for the
defendants argued that the state was trying them in a criminal
court for issues that could be resolved in civil court _ failed
business dealings are not criminal, they said _ and that the morals
of neither Ms. Edwards nor Lyons were on trial.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyons left the courtroom at one point, a small group of
parishioners and friends gathered around him, hugging him,
squeezing his arm and telling him, as one man said, that he was
sure to walk free. Both Lyons and Ms. Edwards face as much as 30
years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the prosecution has piled more and more evidence around
the minister and his aide, both the National Baptist Convention USA
and a loyal congregation have refused to desert him. Lyons remains
pastor at Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church, a large, influential
church, and is still president of the National Baptist Convention
USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accepted his apology, and they said let's move on,'' said
Denis deVlaming, a lawyer representing the minister. Lyons has
admitted that he has sinned but has denied criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said Wednesday that the money the defendants
spent on themselves was money they earned _ he as president and she
as head of public relations for the convention _ and that it
belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   In a long closing argument, deVlaming said that the money the
state claimed was stolen by the defendants was never stolen at all,
and merely floated from account to account. It was never really
missing, he said, stressing to the all-white jury that it was just
how the convention did business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case about race, but about cultural
differences,'' said another of Lyons' lawyers, Grady Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money intended for the burned churches, it was never
taken, defense lawyers said. But prosecutors told jurors that the
minister had to scramble to return it when the Anti-Defamation
League demanded an accounting. Prosecutors said Lyons had already
spent the money on himself, his wife and alleged mistresses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a trial that has stretched over 27 days, prosecutors have
painted a picture of a man who seemed to serve money more than God.
</P>
<P>
   They said that even the convention membership of 8.5 million is
inflated, and that the defendants used that number to entice
corporations, who thought they were paying the minister and his
aide to have their cemetery plots and supplies and life insurance
policies promoted by a respected minister to large numbers of
members.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have countered that the convention claimed such
a large membership before Lyons became president.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who are to rebut the defense arguments on Thursday
before the case goes to the jury, said the profitable scheme began
to come apart in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Lyons' wife, Deborah, found a deed in his
briefcase that showed he owned a lavish waterfront home with Ms.
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lyons, who would later be charged with arson, set several
fires at their house. That prompted prosecutors to follow a paper
trail of the minister's money, leading to records of his lavish
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lyons, who received five years' probation, would later say
that she never believed her husband was having an affair, and that
personal problems, not jealousy, prompted her to set the fires. She
has stood beside her husband in his legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have displayed human weaknesses and frailties,'' Lyons said
when the investigation into his fiances began. ``I am not the
devil,'' he later said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is still in the pulpit and in the presidency, some
black residents of St. Petersburg said that Lyons' power was
diminished and that even old friends had started to distance
themselves from him. He still faces a federal trial later this year
on charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion and money
laundering.

LAURYN HILL AND MADONNA EACH WIN 3 GRAMMYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Early story. It will be updated by 12 a.m. ET)  
(sw) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though Grammy voters are well-known for their
erratic, unpredictable and often outlandish choices, it was no
surprise at this year's awards ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium
here when Lauryn Hill gathered three awards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill, the member of the rap group the Fugees who released
her first solo album to popular and critical acclaim last year,
even beat herself. In the best R&AMP;B song and the best female R&AMP;B
vocal performance categories, her own song warning women about what
men really want, ``Doo Wop (That Thing),'' won Grammys at the
expense of Aretha Franklin's ``A Rose Is A Rose,'' which was
written by Ms. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about Lauryn Hill the day I heard that record,''
said Michael Greene, the president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammys, in an
interview before the show. ``I sweated bullets because I wondered
if the Academy membership would get it. But they got it. They got
it big time.'' Ms. Hill received 10 Grammy nominations, more than
any other artist this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have called this year's Grammy celebration the year
of the woman (a phrase used just about every year in music) because
of the large number of female performers nominated in top
categories, the awards show could also be called Madonna's revenge.
Despite 15 years of recording, she had only previously received one
award, for best longform video in 1991. Now, in her latest guise as
a raven-haired spiritualist, Madonna, who opened the show with an
Asian-themed performance of ``Nothing Really Matters,'' has three
more Grammys to her name: best pop album, best short-form video and
best dance recording.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper Jay-Z learned on Wednesday night that snubbing the
Grammys doesn't lose a musician any points. The gangsta rapper
announced that he was boycotting the Grammys for overlooking
rappers and asked that his name be withdrawn from the running. He
was specifically upset with Grammy voters for not nominating his
fellow rapper DMX for best new artist and at the music industry in
general for paying more attention to violence in rap than his
upcoming tour. Nonetheless, his ``Vol. 2...Hard Knock Live,'' won
the award for best rap album. Jay-Z was not there to accept the
award.
</P>
<P>
   In a year of major changes for the music business, particularly
the sale of Polygram to The Seagram Co. and the industry's
resistance to the rise of music sales via the internet, Sheryl Crow
was the first award-winner to acknowledge the upheaval. During her
speech for best rock album (for ``The Globe Sessions'') she
delivered a eulogy for her record label, A&AMP;M, which was shut down
by Seagram, and the executives who lost their jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners of top awards remained favorites this year,
particularly Celine Dion, who won the album of the year award in
1996. Her ``My Heart Will Go On,'' from the seemingly unsinkable
``Titanic'' soundtrack, won one of the top awards, ``Song of the
Year,'' which was presented to the songwriters James Horner and
Will Jennings. ``You all need to write me something, man,'' the
rapper and actor Will Smith told them when presenting the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Heart Will Go On'' also won an award for best pop vocal
performance. Eric Clapton, the big winner in 1993, won best male
pop vocal performance for ``My Father's Eyes'' and Alanis
Morissette, who swept up in 1996, won best rock song for
``Uninvited.'' However, one Grammy favorite, Tony Bennett, lost
this year to Elmo of Sesame Street for best children's musical
album.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, previously neglected artists received long
overdue Grammys. In her acceptance speech for best traditional pop
vocal performance for her live at Carnegie Hall album, Patti Page
said that when her grandchildren asked what name to call her, ``I
said Grammy because I'll never get one. Now they have to call me
granny.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this ceremony, Ms. Page, whose career predates the
Grammys by ten years, had never been nominated before. And Shirley
Horn, after receiving six nominations previously, won her first
Grammy for best jazz vocal performance for ``I Remember Miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammy critics who've complained after watching Elvis Costello
get snubbed year after year were temporarily quelled. Costello
finally won a Grammy by collaborating with a four-time winner, Burt
Bacharach, on an album, a song from which (''I Still Have That
Other Girl'') won best pop vocal collaboration. Backstage, Costello
said that he hadn't given much creedence to the Grammy Awards in
the past, but maybe now he will. And Lou Reed, another Grammy
oversight, won his first one for Best Longform Music Video for
``American Masters: Rock and Roll Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Over half a decade since its heyday, swing is officially pop
music again. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, led by the former member
of the rockabilly revivalists the Stray Cats, won best pop
instrumental performance for ``Sleepwalk'' and best pop vocal
performance by a duo or group for ``Jump Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   In the classical field, the conductor Pierre Boulez won, adding
to his 20 awards, for best opera recording (''Bluebeard's
Castle''), and best orchestral performance (''Mahler: Symphony No.
9''). And in a new category added this year, best classical
crossover album, an old Grammy hand, 12-time winner Yo Yo Ma, won
with the conductor Jorge Calandrelli for their album of Astor
Piazzolla compositions, ``Soul of the Tango.''
</P>
<P>
   Recordings released between Oct. 1, 1997, and Sept. 30, 1998,
were eligible for an award. The winners were selected by the 10,000
voting members _from musicians to producers to industry executives
to liner note writers _ of the Recording Academy.

GOVERNMENT: LATEST MICROSOFT VIDEOTAPE IS TRUE BUT MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government lawyer questioned another videotape
demonstration at the Microsoft &UR;  &LR; trial Wednesday, but this time the
challenge dealt not with the reliability or honesty of Microsoft's
tape but with its message.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, has
successfully attacked several videotape demonstrations Microsoft
has played in court over the last few weeks, arguing that they were
deceptively edited or did not show what the narrators' claimed they
did.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as a new witness took the stand, Microsoft played a
new tape showing that the company is allowing computer
manufacturers to customize the Windows desktop, the computer screen
that users see when turning on the computer. With these
customizations, the first screen shows the manufacturers'
promotions and advertisements ahead of Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and 19 states say Microsoft's contracts
prohibiting computer makers from shipping machines with the Windows
desktop altered in any way as evidence of antitrust activities.
This requirement, which Microsoft abandoned before the trial even
started, is important to the case because the opening screen serves
as a gateway to the Internet and to the tremendous profit potential
in steering consumers to specific Internet service providers and
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's demonstration Wednesday showed that the company was
already granting manufacturers the flexibility to change the
desktop. Computers being sold by Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and
Acer, among others, were shown with their desktops modified so that
they showed Internet sign-up offers and other options, either
alongside Microsoft's offers or ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these computers also offered Netscape Navigator
prominently. The Netscape Communications &UR;  &LR; Corp. is Microsoft's
chief rival in the browser market, and the government charges that
Microsoft has used the monopoly it enjoys with the Windows
operating system to prevent computer manufacturers from offering
Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Boies did not challenge the authenticity of the videotape, but
he did challenge Microsoft's motivation for allowing the companies
to alter the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically shows how fast the industry is changing as this
case goes on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joachim Kempin, a Microsoft vice president responsible for
contracts with computer makers, responded: ``I don't think it has
anything to do with this case. I don't think the industry is
changing because of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies did show, however, that all the Windows customization in
Microsoft's videotape demonstration is still in clear violation of
the Windows licensing agreements the companies must sign. But
Microsoft gave permission to a dozen companies that asked to make
the changes, and Kempin insisted the same permission would be given
to any others that came forward.
</P>
<P>
   Boies suggested that he did not think it was a coincidence that
these exceptions had been granted last spring, weeks before the
government filed suit against Microsoft. And as a senior government
official noted, ``What they give, they can take away if this suit
goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempin returns to the stand Thursday morning for continued
cross-examination by Boies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday morning the trial had focused on another issue in the
suit as a government lawyer, Phil Malone, cross-examined Eric
Engstrom, a Microsoft executive, about whether Microsoft had tried
to force Apple Computer &UR;  &LR; out of the market for multimedia software
that runs on Windows and had sabotaged Apple's software as part of
that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia software is used to play audio and video clips from
the Internet. An Apple executive, Avadis Tevanian, testified last
year that Microsoft had designed Windows so that Quicktime, Apple's
audio-video software, would not run properly.
</P>
<P>
   Engstrom said the problem was caused by Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to me that Dr. Tevanian could come in here and
make the claim that we sabotaged Quicktime,'' he said. ``At
Microsoft, our company would never do anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the other charge, that Microsoft had tried to push Apple
out of the market for multimedia software for Windows, Engstrom
acknowledged that it was true. He had little choice, faced with
several e-mail messages from within Microsoft showing that as the
company's intent.
</P>
<P>
   But Engstrom said that multimedia software was a low-level
product, a commodity in essence, and it did not make sense for the
two companies to spend time and money competing over it.
``Audio-video software is so perfectly well understood,'' he said,
``that I don't think this is the place for product
differentiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Boies said, ``This is just another
example of Microsoft going to a company and saying, `If you'll stop
doing this, we'll help you in some other area.'''
</P>
<P>
   A key charge in the government suit is that Microsoft tried to
persuade Netscape not to sell a version of its Web browser for
Windows 95. In exchange, Microsoft would offer Netscape numerous
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape refused, and the government says Microsoft then began a
campaign of predatory and illegal behavior that led to the
lawsuit. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: MATCH PLAY IS GOLF'S DAYTONA 500  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Calif., Spain, South Africa, U.K.)   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It's different. That's how everybody
described the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship even
before Wednesday's first round. Now it's so different, it's already
more like the Daytona 500 than a golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecked and smoking cars are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, last year's player of the year for winning the
Masters and the British Open, crashed into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, last Sunday's winner of the Nissan Open in Los
Angeles, blew an engine.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III collided on the far turn with two European Rider
Cup players, Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the top 10 ranked golfers remain.
</P>
<P>
   The world's No. 3 (O'Meara), No. 4 (Love), No. 5 (Westwood), No.
6 (Montgomerie) and No. 7 (Els) are out of the race. In a poker
game, the 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of clubs would be considered a winning
hand.
</P>
<P>
   But in this first World Golf Championship match play tournament,
it's a winner only for their respective conquerors: Michael
Bradley, Steve Pate, Eduardo Romero, Craig Stadler and Paul
Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the marquee was wrecked. Tiger Woods and David Duval,
golf's No. 1 and No. 2, cruised into Thursday's second round of
this tournament at the La Costa Resort and Spa in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Only the winners were hitting balls. All the first-round losers
were on their way to the San Diego airport.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 64 starters in golf's Daytona 500, only 32 cars were
still running. By Thursday night, only 16 will be. After Friday's
two rounds, only four; by Saturday night, only two; by Sunday
night, only the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the nature and the appeal of match play, as oppposed
to the usual weekly medal play, alias each golfer's aggregate
score.
</P>
<P>
   It's not new. When the PGA Championship was a match play event
before 1958, there were days like this. In 1931, Walter Hagen, Leo
Diegel, Johnny Farrell, Ed Dudley and Al Espinosa all were knocked
out in the first round. Sam Snead lost four second-round matches.
Ben Hogan lost a first-round match.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those upsets, a relatively obscure pro occasionally
won the PGA in those match play years, but the big names won, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen won five titles, Snead three, Gene Sarazen three, Ben
Hogan two, Byron Nelson two.
</P>
<P>
   So there's still hope for Sunday's dream final: Woods against
Duval over 36 holes. But in match play, there's no guarantee it
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the odds are that it won't happen. That's why match
play is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love match play,'' said Greg Norman, who eliminated John
Cook, 3 and 2, and now will oppose Argentina's Romero. ``I think
it's the best competitive golf you can play, especially at this
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a level: the top 64 players according to the World Golf
Ranking playing for $5 million in prize money, with $1 million to
the winner (and a consolation $25,000 to each of Wednesday's
first-round losers).
</P>
<P>
   Two more World Golf Championship tournaments will be played this
year: the NEC Invitational with as many as 48 Ryder Cup and
Presidents Cup golfers at Firestone in Akron, Ohio. Aug. 26-29 and
the American Express Championship with some 70 golfers at
Valderrama in Spain, Nov. 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   But with those two events at medal play, they won't be that
different.

   LOS ANGELES _ There's a moment early in the terrible new
ensemble comedy ``200 Cigarettes'' when a woman, preparing to host
a New Year's Eve party, turns to a friend and says, ``It's going to
be the worst, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend doesn't answer, but she doesn't need to. It's
unspoken. And it's the same feeling that crept over me while
watching this horrendously bad movie, the feeling that you'd rather
be (BEGIN ITALICS)anywhere(END ITALICS) else but in the middle of
this train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is Exhibit A (and B, C and D) as to why there
are movie directors and why there are casting directors and why the
two professions should remain distinct and separate. Risa Bramon
Garcia has cast successful movies such as ``The Joy Luck Club,''
``Wall Street'' and ``Desperately Seeking Susan.'' Here, she has
assembled a veritable who's who of young performers, including Ben
and Casey Affleck, Courtney Love, Christina Ricci and Paul Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious from moment one, that, as a director, Garcia
hasn't a clue what to do once she steps behind the camera. ``200
Cigarettes'' is an exercise in inertia with slapped-together,
lifeless scenes that drag on and on and on. Kind of like emphysema
_ only less fun.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in New York's East Village on New Year's Eve
1981. The story offers no real reason for the setting; it solely
exists to serve the soundtrack. (This is an MTV Films production.)
Everyone is headed to a bash thrown by Monica (Martha Plimpton) and
her friend Hillary (Catherine Keller). The thing is, nobody wants
to be the first to arrive, and so the clock keeps ticking, and
Monica starts to fret over the crab dip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lucy (Love) and the morose Kevin (Rudd), both
dateless, argue and flirt with the possibility of consummating
their friendship with a little bathroom stall sex. Jack (Jay Mohr)
and Cindy (Kate Hudson) already have done the deed _ the night
before _ and now are awkwardly dealing with the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Val (Ricci), who would love to find a sexual
partner, but her killjoy friend, Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann), keeps
raining on her parade. Tom (Casey Affleck) is a poetic street punk;
Ben Affleck plays a doofus bartender, and David Chappelle is the
funky disco cabbie who dispenses advice and oversees all the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't one moment or character in this movie that feels
real, with the exception of Hudson's turn as the vulnerable Cindy.
Director Garcia moves from one static scene to another, seeming to
think that if she keeps playing cool '80s songs in the background
(lots of Elvis Costello) nobody will notice how boring the movie
is. The fact that Shana Larsen populated her screenplay with
nothing but ciphers certainly doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The pacing is awful. Most scenes play several beats too long; at
one point, you can almost hear somebody (the gaffer?) yell,
``Cut!'' in the background. Of course, that could well have been my
imagination. My mind certainly had plenty of time to wander.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Myles Berkowitz wanted to make movies, but no one
in Hollywood would return his phone calls. He had the same problem
with women _ messages would go unanswered, potential girlfriends
suddenly would be transferred to jobs in places like Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Berkowitz decided to combine the failures of his
personal and professional lives and turn them into a career move.
The result, ``20 Dates,'' is an amusing, unflinching look at one
man's quest for fulfillment that plays at times like a documentary
and, at other moments, an old-fashioned romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is Berkowitz, a headstrong, annoying, opinionated
guy in his mid-30s trying to sort through the mysteries of life and
love. His agent says he needs to learn to compromise; his friends
say he pushes too hard. No one wants to set him up on a date
because past experiences have proved embarrassing, and ``20 Dates''
contains plenty of documentary evidence to support their position.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz aims to go out on 20 dates, film them and come away
with a movie _ and maybe, just maybe, true love. Initially, he
tries to shoot his encounters secretly to give the footage a raw,
natural feel. A lawsuit from a disillusioned date puts an end to
that. Another date ends badly when she orders a three-pound lobster
at Gladstone's 4 Fish, a meal that taxes Myles' already
overburdened credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz also comes under fire from his financial backer, a
foul-mouthed producer, Elie Samaha, who wants the movie to have
more skin and less gab. Berkowitz surreptitiously tape records
Samaha in his office, and his tirades (so crude as to be almost
surreal) provide some of the film's funniest moments.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his quest, something unexpected happens.
Berkowitz meets a beautiful, seemingly intelligent woman named
Elisabeth and falls in love. What's more surprising is that she
actually seems to like him and enjoy his company. What she doesn't
appreciate is the fact that Myles still has to go out on several
dates to complete the project. This provides the film's major
conflict: love or career? Berkowitz provides a deft resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' could have been too cute by half, but Berkowitz's
abrasiveness (not to mention his willingness to look foolish) keeps
things lively. Still, the movie often feels rather slight, like an
extended David Letterman stunt. And if Berkowitz had not actually
met his dream date, ``20 Dates'' would have been an exercise in
tedium. Interestingly enough, Berkowitz found his movie at the
precise moment he found love. It's that serendipity that makes this
a moviegoing courtship worth pursuing.

INITIATIVE TARGETS FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ., FORESTS FOR MILLIONS OF CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ During Arizona's driest months, the late spring and
early summer before the monsoon rains, Paul Delaney lives in fear
of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney's five-acre residence is covered with conifers, trees
that could explode into flames if touched by a spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live on the edge of town where there's a lot of transients
who come though. They camp in the woods and make fires. There
hasn't been a summer where a fire hasn't started within a couple of
miles of here,'' the 47-year-old geologist said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney supports an initiative that could result in the logging
of millions of trees during the next decade across a 100,000-acre
doughnut of the Coconino National Forest. In some areas, as many as
90 percent of the trees that ring Flagstaff would be cut down.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is backed by the Grand Canyon Forests
Partnership, a coalition of 18 organizations, government agencies,
business and environmental groups that have joined the U.S. Forest
Service in a use-'em-or-lose-'em policy of cutting the trees before
they burn. The Forest Service holds final approval for the
initiative. &QL; 
PROTECTING THE PEAKS
</P>
<P>
   Many here fear conditions are ripe for more and bigger fires _
firestorms that could sweep from the forest into the city, or up
onto the gorgeous San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountains in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peaks are the signature of Flagstaff,'' said Brad Ack,
program director of the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group
that is helping spearhead the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if that was all just one big blackened place,'' Ack said,
``this town's economy would really suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of partnership members is reminiscent of the timber
industry, with a significant difference. While the timber barons
fought to cut down the largest, most valuable trees, the
partnership aims to cut down the smallest trees, leaving the bigger
ones to provide recreational opportunities and wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   It's the smaller trees that make up the vast majority of
fire-prone trees in the forest. But some environmentalists are
concerned that many mid-size and some large trees would come down
in the process. And they are concerned that cutting so many trees
could devastate the forests for people and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting mostly small trees also presents the partnership with a
problem: how to pay for forest restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to get (the trees) out of the woods,'' Ack
said, ``we've got to find a way to use (the lumber). Otherwise, you
just can't come up with enough money to pay people to pull it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Markets for the smaller trees are limited, but they include
firewood, posts, poles, furniture, building materials and pulp for
paper mills.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Maurer, president of the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce, is
hopeful the project will produce several new small businesses that
could rely on a steady supply of small trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps there's a chance _ not to go back to the old logging
days Flagstaff is known for _ but perhaps to bring back an industry
of sorts,'' Maurer said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bennett, regional manager of Stone Forest Industry, said
the days of large-scale commercial logging are gone in Arizona.
Logging now is limited by environmental policies aimed at saving
the forests' remaining old-growth trees and endangered wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's inclusion in the partnership is a red flag to many
environmentalists. But Bennett said Stone has no intention of
turning the partnership into a way for his company to resurrect
large-scale commercial logging, at least not in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``What experience is gained here may be applicable to other
parts of the country where Stone operates,'' Bennett said.

<P>
   ECONOMY OR ECOLOGY?
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Southwest Forest Alliance, a coalition of more
than 50 environmental groups in Arizona and New Mexico, worry that
methods adopted by the partnership are being driven more by the
timber markets than by ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance members agree that there are too many small trees and
that a fire-prevention perimeter around Flagstaff is needed. But
they say the partnership's plans go beyond the city's borders and
deep into threatened wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   To prove a more moderate approach, the alliance is working with
the U.S. Forest Service on experimental plots near Williams, about
25 miles west of Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to guess how to re-create the forest before
it was altered by logging, livestock grazing and fire suppression,
the alliance is using the existing trees to guide them in crafting
a natural-looking forest that also is less likely to burn.
</P>
<P>
   Half the trees were cut down on the alliance's plot near
Williams. In contrast, between 83 percent and 91 percent of the
trees were logged on the partnership's six experimental plots near
Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Covington, a professor of forest ecology at Northern
Arizona University, is the guiding force behind forest restoration
plans for the perimeter of Flagstaff and at experimental plots at
Grand Canyon National Park. He said the alliance isn't removing
enough trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving that many trees (50 percent) leaves the forest in a
condition where it will still support crown fires,'' the
devastating fires that can wipe out sections of the forest for
decades, Covington said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center
for Biological Diversity, said Covington's plans can't guarantee
against fires.
</P>
<P>
   Covington admits that fire killed big trees on some of his
initial experimental stands on Mount Trumbull, northwest of the
Grand Canyon. But he blames that on excessive dryness in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Suckling believes the public won't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To mess around with a few acres on Mount Trumbull is one
thing,'' he said. ``But now, they're talking about doing 100,000
acres around Flagstaff. It would have just an enormous impact on
the ecosystem. The citizens of Flagstaff are going to go berserk
when they find out that (up to 90 percent) of all the trees around
them are going to be logged.'' &QL;

MARGINAL WELL TAX RELIEF APPEARS TO LACK SUPPORT IN TEXAS HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After zooming through the Senate like greased
lightning, a measure offering up to $45 million in severance tax
relief for owners of marginal oil and gas wells has bogged down in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is the only ``emergency'' measure declared by
Gov. George W. Bush for this session, got stuck Wednesday in the
Republican-dominated House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee set a vote for March 3.
</P>
<P>
   But Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, said he is
``absolutely convinced'' that the measure, Senate Bill 290, lacks
the 100 House votes necessary for immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fervent backing of the bill has not instilled a sense of
urgency in Democrats on the committee. But even Republicans were
moving cautiously, citing questions about the wisdom of this
particular tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The debate that largely focused on the need for relief for the
struggling oil and gas industry, veered into big-picture questions
about taxation of oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sharp contrast to the Senate, which quickly and
overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   This measure calls for an immediate severance tax exemption
designed to keep producers from shutting oil and gas wells
producing only a little oil each day. Backers say this will
encourage owners to keep these wells in production while oil prices
are depressed. Otherwise they are likely to permanently shut in
these money-losing wells, which would cost the industry jobs and
reduce school tax collections from mineral-producing land.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure, approved 25-1, would exempt from the 4.6
percent severance tax those wells that produce less than 15 barrels
a day if the monthly average closing price of West Texas
Intermediate crude is below $15 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members said they wanted to take a conservative
approach to any relief, especially considering projections by state
revenue estimators that oil prices could rebound by as much as 25
percent by later this year. The April futures benchmark crude
contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 13 cents
to $12.61 a barrel in trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to save an industry. It's not going to save
your schools. Those are nice arguments to make, and they sell
newspapers,'' but the districts that rely on oil taxes would still
see their taxes fall from larger wells that would not benefit from
the tax break, said Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And looking at the overall tax burden of that particular
industry, is it fair to reduce it compared to what we do to other
industries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, authored by Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown, R-Lake
Jackson, is being carried in the House by Rep. Tom Craddick, a
Republican from Midland, which is at the heart of Texas oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   Craddick said legislative leaders decided early on to cap the
relief at $45 million; to pursue only a temporary abatement running
from Feb. 1 though Aug. 31, and to hope for other state and federal
relief later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the question, is this too little and too late?
I think when you're looking at marginal wells, generally (operated)
by small independent producers, not the large companies ... this
could make a substantial difference on whether they keep these
wells in production or not,'' Craddick said.

FORMER UKRAINIAN PRIME MINISTER ASKS FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ukraine's former prime minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, who
was detained by federal officials last Friday as he tried to enter
the United States, has requested political asylum, his American
lawyer said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, James Mayock, said Lazarenko, who faces corruption
charges in Ukraine, fears persecution by the government of
President Leonid Kuchma should he return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials interviewed Lazarenko on Wednesday, the
first step in a potentially lengthy process to establish whether
his fear is credible or merely an excuse to remain here. The
officials had taken him into custody shortly after he arrived at
New York's Kennedy International Airport traveling on a tourist
visa.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko was Kuchma's deputy prime minister and then prime
minister until mid-1997, when the president removed him amid news
reports accusing him of using his political positions to amass
hundreds of millions of dollars. He has denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko said that he was prepared to expose political
corruption in Kuchma's government. Kuchma has called such
accusations the acts of a desperate man.
</P>
<P>
   The two are not only bitter political opponents now, but
Lazarenko is also on the ballot as an opposing candidate in the
presidential election this October. Lazarenko has repeatedly
accused Kuchma's government of misusing its power to trump up
corruption charges to destroy his political career.
</P>
<P>
   However, in December, the Swiss arrested Lazarenko after he
sought to enter that country, and charged him with laundering
millions of dollars through numbered bank accounts. He was freed on
bond; the case has yet to come to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko has said that he left Ukraine for Greece Feb. 17 for
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ukrainian prosecutors issued a warrant for his
arrest for embezzlement and misuse of state property.

BAKER ADVISES CAUTION ON INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., N.J., Ill., N.M., Conn.)  (Eds: See also RENO-STARR) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate apparently poised either to scrap
or strip back the independent counsel law, Howard Baker, the former
Senate majority leader, counseled senators at a hearing Wednesday
to take a post-impeachment cooling-off period and delay the
decision until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend to the Senate and this committee that we cool it,
think about it for a while, let the temper of these times soften,''
Baker told the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which had
its first day of hearings on the law on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who has been sharply critical of the law and once called
it a ``fourth branch of government,'' suggested that Congress
permit the law to expire on June 30 and take up the issue next
session. The former senator, who voted in the 1970s to create the
law, pointed out that it had lapsed for two years, from 1992 to
1994, with no dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake'' to rush headlong into a decision, with
the passions over impeachment still fresh, said Baker, who was
President Reagan's chief of staff while then independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh was investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the other panelists, including a former independent
counsel, did not hesitate to advise the senators to abandon the
law, calling it fundamentally ``flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin Bell, President Carter's first attorney general,
suggested to the senators that the country return to the system
that existed before the Watergate-era law, when the attorney
general had sole power to appoint outside prosecutors to handle
cases involving high-level wrongdoing. That system was changed in
1978, in the wake of Watergate and President Nixon's decision to
order the firing of Archibald Cox, at the time the special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Baker are co-chairmen of the National Commission on the
Separation of Powers, an organization that issued a report in
December concluding that the current independent counsel law should
not be reauthorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I long ago concluded that this statute is unworkable for a
number of reasons and represents very poor governmental policy,''
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a view shared by all the experts. The first special
prosecutor ever appointed, Arthur Christie, recommended renewing
the law, but with restrictions. ``Personal mistakes and
limitations,'' he said, should be off limits. Christie was
appointed in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Governmental Affairs committee, chaired by Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., began the first of several hearings Wednesday on
whether Congress should revise, scrap or replace the contentious
independent counsel law. If Congress does not act, the law, which
was created in 1978 and has been reauthorized and tinkered with
three times in the past 20 years, will simply expire June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The committee could hear from Attorney General Janet Reno and,
perhaps, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in March.
</P>
<P>
   The statute was harpooned by both Republicans and Democrats on
Wednesday. Under the law, the attorney general must seek the
appointment of an independent counsel when there is substantial and
credible evidence that a crime has been committed by the president
or other government officials. A panel of three judges selects the
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties agree that something needs to be done to
rein in prosecutors who spend millions of dollars and take years to
complete their investigations with little accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Just as disturbing, Thompson and Baker said, the law has altered
the dynamic of impeachment by ordering a prosecutor to refer to
Congress evidence of ``possible impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The law has drawn bipartisan animus in the wake of the
impeachment proceedings and public disapproval of Starr's
wide-ranging, 4 1/2-year, $50 million investigation of President
Clinton. Senators from both parties are threatening to filibuster
any attempt at reauthorizing the law.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two Democrats on the committee, Robert Torricelli
of New Jersey and Richard Durbin of Illinois, said they had been
mistaken to vote for the law in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also criticized Walsh's conduct during the
Iran-Contra investigation, saying it was ``wrong and inexcusable''
that the inquiry lasted seven years and cost $40 million. The
investigations of other counsels, including Donald Smaltz, who
looked into former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's conduct, also
were criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wrong,'' Torricelli said, adding that he would not
vote to reauthorize the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., asked, ``What are we going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   On that question, there is not much consensus, and Thompson
warned that simple ``tinkering'' would not pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they were open to hearing about revisions,
perhaps placing restrictions on prosecutors. But most Democrats
said they would like to get rid of the statute. Some, like Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said an alternative must be created to
insure public confidence in cases involving conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A different sort of danger may surface when no statutory
system exists to provide for the independent investigation of our
top officials,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: FIX THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL ACT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 25:
</P>
<P>
   One reality of the post-impeachment era in Washington is that
the Independent Counsel Act will not be renewed in its present
form. The only options are for forces of reform in Congress to
revise the act or see it vanish forever on its June expiration
date. Right now, a handicapper would have to bet that the law will
disappear, so great is public and congressional disenchantment over
the investigation conducted by Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who believe in status-quo politics, led by Mitch
McConnell on the Republican side and Robert Torricelli on the
Democratic side, are stoking that resentment to make sure the act
dies.
</P>
<P>
   That would not serve the public interest. The act should be
reformed to prevent sprawling, protracted inquiries like that
conducted by Starr and by Lawrence Walsh during the Reagan
administration. But it should not be junked, for an easily
documented reason.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Watergate and extending through the dismal tenure
of Janet Reno at a politicized Justice Department, the public
record shows that attorneys general cannot conduct independent
inquiries into allegations against sitting presidents or their
close associates.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who want to bury the act have a lot going for them.
Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, has adopted the old
canard of the Reagan Republicans that the independent counsel law
has criminalized politics. Also, as the Democratic Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut says, if the renewal debate becomes a
referendum on Starr, the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, along with Sens. Carl Levin, a Democrat, and Susan
Collins, a Republican, are shopping for alterations that will fix
some of the law's defects. These changes include having the
attorney general and a panel of federal judges share authority for
picking a counsel without partisan baggage. Other possibilities
include reducing the number of covered offices, putting time limits
on inquiries and excluding matters that occurred before an
individual's term of office.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems with each of these remedies. A time limit,
for example, would encourage stonewalling by people under
investigation. Campaign tactics and fund-raising should not be
covered in any exclusion of pre-election events.
</P>
<P>
   But some kind of ``surgery,'' to use Lieberman's word, is
necessary to save this flawed but important law. Senators who want
to kill it belong to a bipartisan coalition against public
accountability. The experience of the past 30 years has shown that
such accountability is needed to keep Washington honest.

EDITORIAL: RESTRICTING SATELLITE SALES TO CHINA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Washington's past carelessness in licensing satellite sales to
China may have damaged America's security. This week the Clinton
administration drew the right lessons from its mistakes. It denied
Hughes Space and Communications approval to sell a mobile
communications satellite to a company closely tied to the Chinese
military.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon reasonably feared, the satellite sale could have
improved the reach of Chinese military communications in Asia and
helped China refine its rocket technology. Washington should
encourage American civilian commerce with China. But it must
tightly control advanced military technology.
</P>
<P>
   China is not a global military rival like the Soviet Union was
during the Cold War. But Beijing has its own military agenda that
sometimes conflicts with that of the United States. Military
cooperation with China should not extend to satellites or the
rocket boosters used to lift them into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes wanted to sell its satellite to a private business
consortium in Singapore. But the Pentagon learned that top
officials of that consortium were Chinese military officers working
for China's own satellite agency. The State Department also was
uneasy about the sale, because Hughes engineers had tutored Chinese
scientists in improved rocket launching methods in 1995 in an
episode that is now the subject of a criminal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The White House invited trouble when it put the Commerce
Department in charge of Chinese satellite licenses in 1996. Next
month a new law passed over administration opposition will restore
licensing authority to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   But problems with technology transfers to China go back much
further. Last year a Congressional inquiry found that in the past
two decades, China acquired some of America's most sensitive
military secrets, including nuclear weapons designs.
</P>
<P>
   European companies may now step in to sell China what Hughes
cannot. But their technology is less advanced. The United States is
the world leader in satellite telephone communications and rocket
technology. This expertise should not be made available to China's
armed forces.  &QL;

GRAND CANYON PARK CONSIDERS LOGGING EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON _ Flying over the forests near the Grand Canyon,
especially now when there is snow, it's easy to see the line
between Grand Canyon National Park and the Kaibab National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The forest on National Forest lands _ after a century of logging
the largest old-growth trees _ is thin, the snow on the ground
clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   The forest on National Park lands _ after decades without
logging and without natural wildfires _ is thick, the snow covered
by interlocking branches of the forest canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Both are unnatural, the result of two radically different
land-management philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists now say both styles have left millions of small,
fire-prone trees throughout the forests, providing the fuel that
could erupt in catastrophic infernos across this northern tip of
the world's largest Ponderosa pine ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Near Flagstaff and Williams, the Forest Service is experimenting
with logging these small trees to reduce the threat of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon officials, who on Friday will celebrate the 80th
anniversary of the park, want to try their own experiments this
year by logging small trees north and south of the Canyon. If
applied throughout the park, hundreds of thousands of trees could
be cut down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's a proposal as politically hot as the firestorms that swept
through Yellowstone National Park in the summer of 1988, burning
800,000 acres of forest. It's exactly those kind of hot-burning
crown fires _ where the flames rapidly jump from one treetop to the
next _ that Grand Canyon officials desperately &UR; want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of much rain or snow so far this year has park
officials and some scientists worried that huge fires could ignite
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists are worried that cutting so many trees at
the Grand Canyon could set a precedent for the nation's other
national parks. &QL; 
An experiment, not logging
</P>
<P>
   Don't mention ``logging'' to park officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a science experiment. It is not an effort by the
National Park Service to start logging practices in national
parks,'' said Superintendent Rob Arnberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a research experiment designed to test mechanical
thinning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical thinning'' means a $900,000 experiment using chain
saws to cut 16,000 trees _ mostly small ones _ across 80 acres:
half on the south rim near Grandview Point, and half on the north
rim along Swamp Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   If, as could happen, the experiment is applied across the park's
120,000 acres of forest lands _ 10 percent of the 1.2 million-acre
Canyon park _ the plan eventually could result in hundreds of
thousands of trees being cut down. The cost of such an operation is
unknown, and environmentalists are worried that Congress may order
park officials to recoup the costs by selling the logs to
commercial timber operations.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a market for these trees may prove difficult, since the
overwhelming majority of them would be less than 5 inches in
diameter. Removing them, park officials say, would allow the
survival of the remaining large trees _ the ones critical for
maintaining wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   No trees older than 120 years or greater than 16 inches in
diameter will be touched, unless they are in a meadow or grassland,
said park scientist Bob Winfree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do everything we can to save the oldest trees,''
many of which are 300 to 400 years old, Winfree said.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of logging
</P>
<P>
   Still, cutting so many trees is a prospect that seems radical to
environmentalists like Martos Hoffman, executive director of the
Southwest Forest Alliance, a group of more than 50 environmental
and wildlife groups from across Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   During public hearings this month, Hoffman urged park officials
to delay their experiment for at least three years, until more
scientists could review the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceive the national parks as an environment where,
for once, they can walk around and not have their perception of the
natural landscape encumbered by a field of . . . stumps.''
</P>
<P>
   The park was created in 1919, Hoffman said, for the very purpose
of preventing logging, mining, livestock grazing and other
activities that would detract from the Canyon's natural splendor.
Even cutting small trees, on a large scale, would leave hundreds of
thousands of stumps in the forests.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the park is proposed as wilderness, he said, a
designation that precludes the roads and mechanized transportation
required in most large-scale logging operations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said that while the nation's
parks are supposed to be natural, a century of putting out every
wildfire has left the forests in a dangerous condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without meaning to, (we) created artificial, unhealthy and
dangerous forest,'' said Babbitt, a former Arizona governor who
grew up in nearby Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This experiment (in cutting trees) is an attempt to learn how
to return the forests to their natural, healthy state and eliminate
the danger of catastrophic forest fires. And that's all it is,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon Galbreath of the Sierra Club is concerned that the
planned experiment will not only set a precedent for the rest of
the Grand Canyon, but for forests in other national parks.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the question of how to pay for forest restoration.
Many environmentalists are concerned that pressures to market the
timber will overshadow efforts to improve the ecosystem, and that
pressure from industry and Congress will dictate excessive logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to have a commercial-scale logging operation,''
to take out as many trees throughout the park as are called for in
the initial experiments, Galbreath said.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials do not anticipate developing more roads, but they
might try to use horses to remove logs from roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   The natural state of the forest
</P>
<P>
   Using thousands of tree-ring samples, anecdotal accounts of
military expeditions and the letters and diaries of early pioneers,
scientists at Northern Arizona University have reconstructed a
vision of what Southwest forests were like prior to Anglo-European
settlement more than 120 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Covington, a professor of forest ecology, believes the
natural Ponderosa pine forests were open and parklike. Large trees
stood far enough apart that wagons easily moved between them.
Grasses reached the bellies of horses. Lightning would occasionally
ignite the grasses. Cool, quick-burning fires kept small trees in
check, moving past the fire-resistant bark of older trees.
</P>
<P>
   White civilization brought livestock that ate those grasses,
grasses that kept tree seeds from taking hold. Logging of the
largest trees opened spaces for still more small trees. In
Smokey-Bear fashion, putting out all fires let the small trees grow
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, which Covington said was the driest summer in the
Southwest forests since 1730, some of the region's largest recorded
fires burned out of control for days across the Canyon's north rim,
and along the western slopes of the San Francisco Peak north of
Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictions that many of us have been making about a
crown-fire holocaust are coming sooner than we thought they
would,'' said Covington, a guru of forest restoration who has
attracted scientists from around the world to his experimental
plots near Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Park and forest officials for decades have intentionally set
small fires in the forests, intending to mimic the natural fires
that once removed the undergrowth and excess small trees.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't keep up, and the park's forests are so thick,
setting ``prescribed burns'' is dangerous. They easily can burn out
of control, fed first by dead pine needles and thickets of tiny
trees, then racing through ladders of smaller trees and into the
crowns of the giants.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled fires just don't do the job of re moving many
juvenile ponderosa pines, which quickly grow a thick bark resistant
to cool-burning ground fires. They remain, however, susceptible to
hot-burning crown fires.
</P>
<P>
   Covington believes time is running out to restore the forests to
a more natural state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the 50,000-acre fires. I think the 150,000-acre,
200,000-acre fires are within the next five years,'' said
Covington, who through Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Babbitt helped
secure more than $1.7 million for forest experiments.
</P>
<P>
   For wildlife, less isn't more
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists warn that if what happens at the national
park is anything like Covington's previous experiments near
Flagstaff and at Mount Trumbull, northwest of the``'' Grand Canyon,
it would be a disaster, especially for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   New experimental efforts, which could affect 100,000 acres
surrounding Flagstaff, are especially worrisome to Kieran Suckling,
executive director of the Southwest Center for Biological
Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   He is concerned that Covington's ``Wally World'' forest-thinning
procedures are a cure worse than the disease, and he fears they
could be adopted in national forests throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of this as the catastrophic restoration model,''
Suckling said. ``If they go forward with this, it will result in
millions of acres being nuked.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are beginning to raise questions, too.
</P>
<P>
   A new wildlife study by the Arizona Game and Fish Department
warned in September: ``Forest management practices that focus on
intensive, widespread thinning will adversely impact tassel-eared
squirrels,'' a key prey species for raptors like the rare northern
goshawk.
</P>
<P>
   Biology professor Peter Stacey, who teaches restoration ecology
at the University of New Mexico, also is concerned about removing
too many trees.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour this month of northern Arizona restoration
projects, Stacey described some of them as ``radical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have profound effects on wildlife,'' Stacey said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnberger, the Grand Canyon superintendent, said critics have
``righteous'' concerns about the thinning proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love their parks. And the Grand Canyon is an icon. When
you open the parks to some kind of manipulative type of use, then
lots of people become concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another segment of the population that might say,
`It's about time.' '' &QL;

LONELY GUY FINDS LOVE, LUCKILY

OUR RATING:  3 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Myles Berkowitz wanted to make movies, but no one
in Hollywood would return his phone calls. He had the same problem
with women _ messages would go unanswered, potential girlfriends
suddenly would be transferred to jobs in places like Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Berkowitz decided to combine the failures of his
personal and professional lives and turn them into a career move.
The result, ``20 Dates,'' is an amusing, unflinching look at one
man's quest for fulfillment that plays at times like a documentary
and, at other moments, an old-fashioned romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is Berkowitz, a headstrong, annoying, opinionated
guy in his mid-30s trying to sort through the mysteries of life and
love. His agent says he needs to learn to compromise; his friends
say he pushes too hard. No one wants to set him up on a date
because past experiences have proved embarrassing, and ``20 Dates''
contains plenty of documentary evidence to support their position.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz aims to go out on 20 dates, film them and come away
with a movie _ and maybe, just maybe, true love. Initially, he
tries to shoot his encounters secretly to give the footage a raw,
natural feel. A lawsuit from a disillusioned date puts an end to
that. Another date ends badly when she orders a three-pound lobster
at Gladstone's 4 Fish, a meal that taxes Myles' already
overburdened credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz also comes under fire from his financial backer, a
foul-mouthed producer, Elie Samaha, who wants the movie to have
more skin and less gab. Berkowitz surreptitiously tape records
Samaha in his office, and his tirades (so crude as to be almost
surreal) provide some of the film's funniest moments.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his quest, something unexpected happens.
Berkowitz meets a beautiful, seemingly intelligent woman named
Elisabeth and falls in love. What's more surprising is that she
actually seems to like him and enjoy his company. What she doesn't
appreciate is the fact that Myles still has to go out on several
dates to complete the project. This provides the film's major
conflict: love or career? Berkowitz provides a deft resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' could have been too cute by half, but Berkowitz's
abrasiveness (not to mention his willingness to look foolish) keeps
things lively. Still, the movie often feels rather slight, like an
extended David Letterman stunt. And if Berkowitz had not actually
met his dream date, ``20 Dates'' would have been an exercise in
tedium. Interestingly enough, Berkowitz found his movie at the
precise moment he found love. It's that serendipity that makes this
a moviegoing courtship worth pursuing.

POSTSEASON FATES WILL BE DECIDED IN UPCOMING DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teams and games to watch as Selection Sunday approaches. Ten
days and counting. . .
</P>
<P>
   __ The postseason fate of several mediocre teams in major
conferences hinges on the outcome of mid-level conference
tournaments that begin this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If Miami-Ohio (Mid-American), Detroit (Midwestern Collegiate),
Evansville (Missouri Valley), Murray State (Ohio Valley), Gonzaga
(West Coast) and College of Charleston (Southern) don't earn
automatic berths, they might scoop up precious at-large bids
usually reserved for, say, the sixth-place team in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the Mid-American gets three bids, with
Toledo and Kent joining Miami-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   __ Teams from power conferences that are in tenuous positions
include Minnesota (6-8 in Big Ten play), Nebraska, Oklahoma State
and Missouri from the Big 12, UNC-Charlotte and Alabama-Birmingham
from Conference USA, Mississippi (7-7 in SEC play), and everyone in
the Western Athletic Conference except Utah.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico played a lousy schedule and has no road wins of
substance. Fresno State has 10 losses. UNLV has just 15 wins. Of
all the WAC contenders, Texas Christian (18-8, 6-6) might have the
best chance for an at-large bid. The NCAA selection committee
probably will dismiss the Horned Frogs' two losses without star
center Lee Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   __ From the Pac-10, Stanford, Arizona, UCLA and Washington are
in. Cal is out. Arizona State is out. Oregon (14-10, 6-9) has
decent power ratings but needs to win its final games (Oregon
State, Cal, Stanford) to squeeze in.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaching changes: The best job available is San Diego State,
which has a new arena and a new conference (the Mountain West) to
offer. The Aztecs would love Utah's Rick Majerus _ he's arguably
the best coach in the game _ but Majerus has no reason to leave his
kingdom in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrick, weary of Rhode Island and longing for the West
Coast, wants the San Diego State job and might get it. The Aztecs
want an established head coach to turn the program around.
</P>
<P>
   If not Majerus or Harrick, perhaps Gonzaga's Dan Monson. San
Diego State athletic director Rick Bey hired Monson's father, Don,
at Oregon years ago. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State probably needs to finish strongly for Wayne
Morgan to save his job. He was a questionable choice in 1996 _ a
Syracuse assistant with no roots in Southern California _ and he
has done nothing to reverse that perception.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Morgan experience, the 49ers might pursue a
proven head coach. If they don't, UCLA assistant Michael Holton
seems a logical candidate. A Pasadena native and former UCLA
player, Holton knows the area, has relationships with high school
coaches and would bring players to the Pyramid. What Holton lacks _
head-coaching experience _ can be overcome with time and a veteran
assistant. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Four names to watch for the Nevada-Reno job: Northern Arizona
coach Ben Howland, one of best young coaches in the game; Monson,
ditto; Utah assistant Donny Daniels; Stanford assistant Trent
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Schea stuff: Former UCLA recruit and current Long Beach City
College player Schea Cotton attended the UCLA-Syracuse game. Cotton
recently won his appeal to the NCAA and is eligible at a four-year
school next season.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has a working list of six schools, with a tie to
each: Rhode Island (Harrick); Alabama (ex-UCLA assistant Mark
Gottfried); USC (it's local); Oregon State (he's buddies with guard
Dino Tanner); Connecticut (he attended prep school there), and
South Florida (ex-Long Beach State coach Seth Greenberg).
</P>
<P>
   One place you absolutely, positively will not see Cotton next
year: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Duke sophomore and Orange County native Chris
Burgess is unhappy with his playing time and might transfer. UCLA,
Utah and Brigham Young are possible destinations. Burgess' plans
might change if sophomore center Elton Brand turns pro, as
expected. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The most important result of the NBA collective bargaining
agreement _ as it relates to the college game _ is the rigid
slotting of salaries for free agents and rookies, which might
reduce the need for agents. For instance, Arizona guard Jason Terry
is expected to hire an hourly attorney, not a full-time agent, to
examine his contract. . . .
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's manchild Russ Millard played last weekend _ against
his coach's advice _ for the first time in almost 18 months. In 14
minutes against Santa Clara, Millard was 0 for 6 from the field but
changed the game defensively with his 7-3, 350-pound frame. Watch
for Millard, a fourth-year junior plagued by foot problems, to
enter the NBA. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Washington State senior Steve Slotemaker disclosed last week
that he has suffered from clinical depression since high school.
During a trip through the Columbia River Gorge several years ago,
Slotemaker said he considered driving into the water. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious to anyone who watched Paul Pierce play at Kansas
that nine NBA teams blundered when they passed on him in last
year's draft. Now it's apparent to THEM. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In next year's Wooden Classic, Stanford will play Auburn and
Duke will meet USC. By the way, the event is scheduled for Nov. 27,
the same day USC plays Louisiana Tech in football and UCLA faces
Iona in basketball. Nice timing. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And finally: College basketball says goodbye to one of its great
arenas this weekend when North Carolina State plays its final game
in storied Reynolds Coliseum _ former home of Jim Valvano, Chris
Washburn, Lorenzo Charles, Monty Towe and the greatest non-center
in NCAA history, David Thompson.

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients  Friday, Feb. 26 or
thereafter ) (Eds: Note use of italics in 2nd graf) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a moment early in the terrible new
ensemble comedy ``200 Cigarettes'' when a woman, preparing to host
a New Year's Eve party, turns to a friend and says, ``It's going to
be the worst, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend doesn't answer, but she doesn't need to. It's
unspoken. And it's the same feeling that crept over me while
watching this horrendously bad movie, the feeling that you'd rather
be (BEGIN ITALICS)anywhere(END ITALICS) else but in the middle of
this train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is Exhibit A (and B, C and D) as to why there
are movie directors and why there are casting directors and why the
two professions should remain distinct and separate. Risa Bramon
Garcia has cast successful movies such as ``The Joy Luck Club,''
``Wall Street'' and ``Desperately Seeking Susan.'' Here, she has
assembled a veritable who's who of young performers, including Ben
and Casey Affleck, Courtney Love, Christina Ricci and Paul Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious from moment one, that, as a director, Garcia
hasn't a clue what to do once she steps behind the camera. ``200
Cigarettes'' is an exercise in inertia with slapped-together,
lifeless scenes that drag on and on and on. Kind of like emphysema
_ only less fun.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in New York's East Village on New Year's Eve
1981. The story offers no real reason for the setting; it solely
exists to serve the soundtrack. (This is an MTV Films production.)
Everyone is headed to a bash thrown by Monica (Martha Plimpton) and
her friend Hillary (Catherine Keller). The thing is, nobody wants
to be the first to arrive, and so the clock keeps ticking, and
Monica starts to fret over the crab dip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lucy (Love) and the morose Kevin (Rudd), both
dateless, argue and flirt with the possibility of consummating
their friendship with a little bathroom stall sex. Jack (Jay Mohr)
and Cindy (Kate Hudson) already have done the deed _ the night
before _ and now are awkwardly dealing with the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Val (Ricci), who would love to find a sexual
partner, but her killjoy friend, Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann), keeps
raining on her parade. Tom (Casey Affleck) is a poetic street punk;
Ben Affleck plays a doofus bartender, and David Chappelle is the
funky disco cabbie who dispenses advice and oversees all the
action.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't one moment or character in this movie that feels
real, with the exception of Hudson's turn as the vulnerable Cindy.
Director Garcia moves from one static scene to another, seeming to
think that if she keeps playing cool '80s songs in the background
(lots of Elvis Costello) nobody will notice how boring the movie
is. The fact that Shana Larsen populated her screenplay with
nothing but ciphers certainly doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The pacing is awful. Most scenes play several beats too long; at
one point, you can almost hear somebody (the gaffer?) yell,
``Cut!'' in the background. Of course, that could well have been my
imagination. My mind certainly had plenty of time to wander.

   The family of James Byrd Jr. got a measure of justice this week
when one of the white supremacists who dragged Byrd to death behind
a pickup truck was found guilty of first-degree murder in Jasper,
Texas &UR; . &LR;  Byrd had been beaten. But the prosecution showed that he
was alive when John William King and two other men chained him to
the bumper and raced three miles along a logging trail and a
blacktop road.
</P>
<P>
   During the dragging, Byrd turned over and over to relieve the
pain as his flesh was torn away and his skeleton was ground up on
the blacktop. He finally died a mile and a half out, when the truck
took a sudden turn and his head and arm were severed by a metal
culvert.
</P>
<P>
   These facts are beyond bearing for anyone with an ounce of human
feeling. But the salutary lesson of this case is that what
Americans deem acceptable can change dramatically from one period
to the next. What virtually everyone views as barbaric today was
regarded as commonplace and even as acceptable entertainment a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lynching, for example, began during Reconstruction as a method
for intimidating former slaves who were attempting to vote and
exercise their human rights. Nearly 4,000 Americans were lynched
between 1880 and 1930, according to the records center at the
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama _ many of them burned, tortured,
mutilated or dragged, like Byrd. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The victims were often affluent men and women who had competed
with and angered the white establishment. The main actors were
usually people like King, aimless young men in their teens and 20s,
marginal to society, with anger to burn. The bloody work they
performed was often attended by crowds who came for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The lynchings peaked in 1892, when 161 of them took place, or
nearly one every other day. Among the victims that year were three
young Memphis businessmen who had apparently generated enmity among
their white competitors. At that time the editor of the Memphis
Negro paper, called Free Speech, was Ida B. Wells. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Ms. Wells, then 23, protested the killings, attributing them
to white competitors of the black businessmen. After she spoke out,
a white mob destroyed the paper's offices, forcing her to flee.
Later, in New York, she published her pamphlet ``Southern
Horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wells described the lynchings in a documentary style, using
the words of participants. Of an 1899 lynching in Maysville, Ky.,
she wrote: ``William Coleman was burned to death . . . slowly
roasted, first one foot and then the other, and dragged out . . .
so that the torture might be prolonged.''  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As the lynching crowds grew, she wrote: ``Not only has life
been taken by mobs in the last twenty years but the ordinary
procedure of hanging and shooting have been improved upon during
the last ten years. Fifteen human beings have been burned to death
in different parts of the country by mobs. Men, women and children
have all gone to see the sight, and all have approved the barbarous
deeds done in the high light of Christianity.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Through work like this, Ms. Wells rallied anti-lynching
sentiment both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Of tens of thousands of lynchers and watchers, only 49 were
indicted and only 4 sentenced to jail up to 1930. The courts,
police and even the local clergy adopted an attitude of silent
acquiescence. The only solace in the Jasper affair is that a town
and a country that would once have viewed this death as
unremarkable have been repelled by it.

AN `ENCOUNTER' OF THE 3-D KIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients on Friday, Feb. 26 or
thereafter) 
OUR RATING:  3 STAR S  
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly half a century after its cheese-drenched
heyday, 3-D film may be ready to make a comeback of sorts,
especially in the large-format theaters created by companies such
as IMAX and Burbank's Iwerks Corp.
</P>
<P>
   If that's to happen, of course, it'll take more fun, eye-popping
titles such as ``Encounter in the Third Dimension,'' which is
opening today at the IMAX theater at the California ScienCenter
museum in Exposition Park. It also plays at Edwards IMAX theaters,
Irvine Spectrum and Ontario Mills Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-minute piece features Stuart Pankin as a bumbling
professor who enlists Elvira, a saucy flying-saucer assistant,
clips of top 3-D theme-park attractions and vivid,
computer-generated virtual sets to explain the science and history
of stereoscopic photography and film.
</P>
<P>
   The film does a nice job briskly tracing forward from Sir
Charles Wheatstone's 1838 discovery of stereoscopic still
photography, through the early 1950s 3-D movie craze up to recent
3-D theme-park attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the film also gently explains the simple science
behind tricking the eyes into believing a two-dimensional picture
has depth and volume, just as in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, however, the film is a treat to look at,
which of course is the whole point of 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The large-format screen is partly responsible for that, as is
the use of mostly computer-generated sets. Both factors allow the
film to sidestep the limits of 3-D live-action films, paradoxically
making the virtual sets look more ``real'' than ones made out of
atoms instead of digital bits.
</P>
<P>
   The film also benefits from clips excerpted from some of the
most stirring 3-D film attractions around, including the
``Terminator 2 3-D'' ride now being installed in Universal Studios
Hollywood, ``Journey to the Center of the Earth'' and ``Return to
Dino Island.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Journey'' clip is particularly long and wonderful,
providing a great visual ride without going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you'll still have to wear glasses to enjoy this ride, in
this case clown-sized if lightweight polarized lenses. But you
quickly forget them (as long as you don't tilt your head and
misalign the polarization) in the onslaught of
close-enough-to-touch eye candy.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Encounter'' still suffers from its own occasional
outbreaks of cheesy jokes and one overly long cheesecake shot.
</P>
<P>
   But there's little enough of that, and the film moves along
briskly, providing an entertaining science lesson as it goes.
Overall, this is a multi-dimensional ``Encounter'' of the best
kind.

 &HT;    Mamey products pose potential health risk for nation, officials
say
 &HT;    By Peter Donald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While imported frozen mamey products
were pulled from Florida's stores and restaurants because of a
typhoid fever outbreak, they are readily available in cities with
large Hispanic populations such as New York and Los Angeles, posing
a potential national health risk, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen mamey, a tropical fruit grown in South Florida and the
Caribbean, is used to make ice cream, sherbert and the popular
shakes known as ``batidos'' in the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the imported product is not safe in Florida, why would it
be safe anywhere else?'' said Terry McElroy, a spokesman for the
Florida Department of Agriculture, which halted sales of frozen
mamey products in the state last week. The federal government
``will have to make a decision on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not
to eat frozen mamey because of its preliminary epidemiological
links to typhoid fever, but it has not blocked imports of frozen
mamey products.
</P>
<P>
   So far, officials said, there are no signs that the outbreak of
the bacterial disease has spread beyond Florida.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman said the agency's policy would not change
because of a single outbreak, but that surveillance of frozen mamey
products had increased.
</P>
<P>
   She said communicating the dangers of frozen mamey was
complicated by language barriers, as well as a large undocumented
population fearful of authorities: `It's hard to get the word out
in the underground.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA investigators are focusing their inquiry on frozen mamey and
where it comes from, specifically Guatemala, Honduras and the
Dominican Republic, Miami-Dade health officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are warning health departments across the nation about
the Florida outbreak and its possible connection to frozen mamey.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever, a bacterial disease characterized by sustained
fever, headache, fatigue, constipation, appetite loss and a rash,
can be treated with antibiotics. In more than 99 percent of cases
treated, the patients survive.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspected case was identified in the Miami area Monday.
That brings the total number of Florida cases to 15, including
three in Palm Beach County. The outbreak is considered unusual
because none of the patients had traveled to foreign countries
where typhoid fever is more common.
</P>
<P>
   Health investigators have reached the preliminary conclusion
that frozen mamey products were contaminated with the bacteria that
causes typhoid fever; they found that the sick people were far more
likely than healthy people to have eaten frozen mamey.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever germs are excreted in the stool of an infected
person and can be spread if they contaminate food or water.
</P>
<P>
   FDA investigators are focusing on a processing plant in
Guatemala where more than one frozen mamey brand is manufactured,
an agriculture official said Wednesday. The FDA has issued a
consumer warning about El Sembrador, a frozen mamey product from
Guatemala that the agency said was found in the freezers of all the
patients as well as in restaurants where some of the sick people
drank it in shakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That appears to be the common link,'' said McElroy. ``And it
appears that more than one product is handled by the same processor
in Guatemala. We're not sure, but we have our suspicions of one
plant.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they're investigating where frozen mamey is
processed and distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working on it nonstop,'' said Dr. Mary Jo Trepka,
Miami-Dade's director of epidemiology and disease control. ``I'm
sure they're going to be doing more things. It's their call.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tests on samples of confiscated frozen mamey products
have been inconclusive, but all the results aren't in, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tests done so far have not found any salmonella typhi, the
bacteria that causes typhoid fever, said Dr. Jean Malecki, Palm
Beach County's health director.
</P>
<P>
   Due to sanitation and health concerns, the federal government
has banned imports of fresh mamey from the very Caribbean countries
that ship the frozen product into the United States _ even though
officials have said Salmonella typhi can survive freezing
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that unprocessed fruits from Guatemala have harbored
toxins and bacteria,'' one state official said. ``They can't be
imported into this country. Why would we let the frozen product
in?''

<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Attempts to forge the world's first global
treaty to regulate trade in genetically modified products failed
Wednesday morning when the United States and five other big
agricultural exporters rejected a proposal that had the support of
the rest of the roughly 130 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty would have required that exporters of genetically
altered plants, seeds or other organisms obtain approval in advance
from the importing nation. The talks broke down over the question
of whether this requirement would also apply to agricultural
commodities like wheat and corn.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the treaty, especially European nations, have
resisted genetically modified products, worried that not enough is
known about the possible effects on human health and the
environment. But Washington and its allies have argued that such
regulations would entangle the world's food trade in red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 percent to 45 percent of major crops grown in the United
States are genetically modified, and American negotiators feared
the proposal could block or stall more than $50 billion in annual
farm exports.
</P>
<P>
   Bleary-eyed delegates from many nations, who have been
negotiating day and night for more than a week, expressed fury at
the United States, accusing it of intransigence and of putting the
interests of its world-leading farming and biotechnology industries
above the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's five nations against the world,'' said Joseph M. Goto,
the delegate from Zimbabwe, although Washington and its allies
actually total six. Those in agreement with the United States are
Canada, Australia, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. ``There could be
no greater injustice than that,'' he said. The United States, he
added, ``is holding the world at ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates agreed to suspend the talks and resume them no
later than May 2000. The United States had urged this, saying there
were still too many unresolved issues to allow a consensus to be
achieved by the deadline, which was Tuesday. In the meantime,
individual countries, particularly in Europe, will continue to
limit the introduction of genetically engineered agricultural
products, including food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be much better to get a sound instrument a year hence
than to get a flawed instrument today,'' said Rafe Pomerance,
deputy assistant secretary of state for environment and
development. But delegates from some other nations feared the
process would now lose momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a treaty, countries can limit the import of
genetically engineered seeds or foods under their own law, subject
to challenge under world trading rules. Some countries,
particularly in Europe, are doing this. The treaty was mainly meant
to help developing countries, which now lack the expertise and the
legislation to regulate biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has often taken a stance different from much
of the rest of the world on trade and environmental matters. It has
not ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity reached at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 because some senators fear
that American interests would be jeopardized. The current talks on
the so-called Biosafety Protocol are an outgrowth of the
biodiversity treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Biosafety Protocol would require exporters of genetically
modified organisms, such as seeds into which new traits had been
added by gene-splicing, to obtain prior approval from the importing
country. Such regulations are intended to allow countries to reduce
the ecological risks from introducing genetically altered plants,
animals and microorganisms into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists worry, for instance, that a gene conferring
insect resistance or drought tolerance on a crop could spread to
weedy relatives of that crop through cross-pollination, creating
superweeds.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point in the biosafety negotiations was
whether the requirement for advance approval by the importing
nation should apply to genetically altered agricultural commodities
meant for eating or processing, as opposed to planting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its allies argued that such a requirement would
not protect biodiversity because commodities like corn and soy
beans do not enter the environment. Developing nations and the
European Union argued that commodities should be included because
they have seeds that can be planted.
</P>
<P>
   Some developing nations even wanted the treaty to cover products
made from genetic engineering, such as cornflakes made from
modified corn, or blue jeans made from altered cotton, but this was
dropped from the final draft.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another unresolved point of dispute was Washington's position
that World Trade Organization rules should take precedence over the
Biosafety Protocol, to prevent other nations from using biosafety
as an excuse to erect trade barriers. The developing nations and
Europe wanted the biosafety protocol to be equal to WTO rules or
take precedence over them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williams, a spokesman for the United Nations Environment
Program, said this was the first environmental treaty he could
remember in at least 20 years in which an agreement was not reached
by the self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But officials here said the big stakes involved for industry
made this matter particularly difficult. ``It's the first time that
you have really possibly a legally binding instrument dealing with
trade and the environment at the same time,'' said Veit Koester, a
Danish environmental official who chaired the working group that
drew up the draft of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   It perhaps complicated things that the industry involved was
biotechnology, in which the United States holds a firm lead. There
have been a rising number of disputes in recent years between
developing and developed nations over the control of genetic
resources, the raw material for biotechnology, which some analysts
predict will be to the next century what oil and metal were to this
one.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in one sense was in a strong negotiating
position because it did not want a treaty as badly as the
developing nations and therefore had less reason to compromise.
Indeed, three years ago Washington opposed starting the biosafety
negotiations, and many people at this meeting thought its real
intention was to torpedo the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years of negotiation have been a constant attempt
to delay, not negotiate, block,'' said Chee Yoke Ling of the Third
World Network, a Malaysia-based group working on environmental and
development issues. ``They've always said, `No, No, No,' and they
delayed and they diluted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States could have been isolated. But it
strengthened its hand by aligning with Canada, Australia and three
agricultural exporters from the developing world: Argentina, Chile
and Uruguay. Without the support of such major exporters, any
protocol would have been meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just too important, too big and maybe too thoughtful
to be ignored,'' Pomerance, the American negotiator, said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Washington did make compromises. But he added: ``There
were two compromises we were not prepared to make. One is to tie up
trade in the world's food supply. The second is to allow this
regime, without a lot of deliberation, to undermine the WTO trading
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. government and the biotechnology industry would
have something to gain from a treaty, were it not too onerous. A
treaty could have helped assuage public fears about biotechnology,
which are much greater elsewhere in the world than in the United
States. And having a unified global regulatory scheme would be
easier for companies than having each nation adopt its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has extensive regulations restricting the
planting of seeds as well as the importing of food that has been
genetically altered. Individual countries have enacted their own
patchwork of rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see a little more international harmonization
of the regulatory framework,'' said Willy De Greef, head of
regulatory and government affairs for Novartis Seeds AG, a division
of the big Swiss pharmaceutical company. ``It creates a level
playing field and clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the food and biotechnology industries and the U.S.
government argued that genetic engineering has not been shown to be
a big threat to biodiversity, especially compared with the
destruction of tropical forests to create farmland. They also said
that environmental groups and developing nations were trying to
expand the treaty to deal with human health and the social and
economic effects of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to get this protocol to develop issues that
are really important but not part of the protocol,'' said Joyce
Groote, a spokeswoman for Canada's biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have complained in the last few days that
the protocol had been watered down to the point of near
insignificance. But in the end, some said that even the weakened
treaty would have been better than none.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment's the loser, always,'' said Beth Burrows,
president of the Edmonds Institute, a nonprofit organization in
Edmonds, Wash., which deals with biosafety issues. ``There was no
moral high ground here,'' she added. ``There was no scientific high
ground here. It was just cheap power politics.''

 &HT;    Ailing father defends son convicted of dragging death
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A parent's anguish filled a Jasper County
courtroom Wednesday as the weeping father of a convicted racist
killer pleaded for his son's life.
</P>
<P>
   But John William ``Bill'' King refused to be in the courtroom as
his ailing father, sitting in a wheelchair and breathing through an
oxygen tube, spoke to jurors who must decide if King should go to
death row for dragging a black man to death last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King's emotional testimony came after his son appeared to
nap while a psychologist for his defense acknowledged that he never
showed a hint of remorse for the harrowing murder of James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will begin deliberating today whether to give the white
supremacist a life sentence or death. The jury found him guilty
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, sat in a holding room adjacent to the courtroom while
his father told the jury, ``Anything is better than losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested a lot of love in that boy. I'd hate to think
we're going to lose him,'' said Ronald King, a retired lumber
worker. ``I guess, as a daddy, I'll never be able to resign myself
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that boy. You don't have to love what (children) do,''
said the father _ the only character witness for a son whose
bigotry and anger are so intense a psychiatrist testified that he
should die to keep society from future harm.
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors looked at their laps when the elder King became
distraught and put both hands to his face to hide his sobs. One
juror never looked at the murderer's father, choosing instead to
train his gaze on a courtroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's family watched from the front two rows of the courtroom,
and one of the murder victim's sisters wiped her eye.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Mullins, the eldest of Byrd's three children, approached
Ronald King outside the courtroom after his testimony and gave him
a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you,'' Mullins said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Boatner, one of Byrd's six sisters, also hugged him, and
said: ``He's in God's hands. Put it in God's hands. God loves
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   King was convicted Tuesday of kidnapping and dragging Byrd down
a country road outside Jasper until he was beheaded. Evidence
showed that King wanted to kill a black person to gain credibility
for a new white supremacy gang he was organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Two of King's white friends _ Shawn Allen Berry, 24, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 _ also await trial for allegedly
participating in the gruesome death that stunned people around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the jury heard testimony about Bill King's inability
to control his anger, including an incident in January when he
smashed a television in his Jasper County jail cell in front of a
jailer who had inquired about noise he had been making.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'If you think that's a noise, that's nothing,''
jailer Kenneth Primrose said. ``He picked up the TV and threw it at
the stool.''
</P>
<P>
   Primrose showed the jurors an 8-inch homemade knife and a noose
fashioned from a radio cord that were found hidden in Bill King's
cell after he broke the television.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also put on the witness stand Dr. Edward Gripon, a
forensic psychiatrist from Beaumont. He testified that Bill King
poses a threat to society because of his intense racist beliefs and
the torturous nature of Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he would pose a continued threat for future acts of
violence,'' Gripon said.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes like Byrd's murder are ``so extreme and so dramatic, they
remove all doubt what the person is capable of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Quijano, a former chief psychologist for the Texas prison
system who testified for the defense, said Bill King likely would
continue to commit crimes in the free world but not in prison. He
said a life sentence _ which would imprison Bill King for at least
40 years _ would protect society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be about 64 if released, and the probability of people
at age 64 committing acts of violence is very low,'' Quijano said.
</P>
<P>
   But, under cross-examination by assistant U.S. Attorney John
Stevens, Quijano acknowledged that Bill King has a law-breaking
history, intensely bitter feelings toward society and no remorse
for killing Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one certain way we can have a say in control, in ensuring
innocent people are never harmed again by (such) a defendant _ who
has proven clearly that he is a danger _ is for him to be
executed,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is true,'' Quijano said.
</P>
<P>
   As Quijano testified about Bill King's lack of remorse, the
convicted killer slumped in his chair and appeared to be dozing.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, defense lawyer C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs
Jr. said that Bill King had not wanted his father to testify and
chose to leave the courtroom because he feared he would be overcome
with emotion if he watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a proud man, Bill is,'' Cribbs said. ``Sometimes it
becomes unmanly to show emotions, and I think maybe that's possibly
was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   An audiovisual feed allowed Bill King to see and hear what
occurred in the courtroom while he sat in the holding room.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Bill King's
decision to leave the courtroom may have hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be the opposite of what you ought to do,'' Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, peddlers of James Byrd Jr. memorial T-shirts
and hats were ordered by state District Judge Joe Bob Golden to
stop selling the items outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Byrd family requested the order after alleging that the
vendors had breached a contract to give some of the proceeds to the
James Byrd Jr. Foundation for Racial Healing. The family created
the foundation with donations that poured in after Byrd's June 7
murder.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's food stamp rolls have dropped by one-third in four
years, leading to a growing concern that the decline is partly
caused by needy people's hesitance to apply for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A vibrant economy is clearly a major reason that the number of
people using food stamps fell to fewer than 19 million last
November, from nearly 28 million people four years earlier. But
some in Congress; at the Agriculture Department, which administers
the food stamp program, and at some private poverty groups believe
that a significant number of people are not seeking help even
though they still lack food and are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials think that stringent rules intended to put
welfare recipients to work and reduce the welfare rolls may have
also discouraged people from seeking food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Some states and cities seeking to cut welfare rolls
aggressively, for example, require a month of job searching or more
before an applicant can get benefits of any kind. Often, officials
say, people in need of emergency food aid simply walk out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to get people off welfare programs, but people
may have failed to understand that the food stamp program is not a
welfare program,'' said Shirley R. Watkins, the undersecretary of
agriculture for food, nutrition and consumer service. ``It's
nutritional assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, Ms. Watkins and other officials say, it may
simply be the worsening stigma attached to public aid of all sorts
that is keeping people from applying for food aid, the officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining food stamps requires a simple showing of financial
need, unlike other federal benefits with more stringent regulations
and requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid has similar broad eligibility, and it too has recorded
a similar unexplained drop in its rolls. Some officials have said
that while some of this is attributable to the economy, some may
also be the result of recipients believing that once they are off
welfare, they are also ineligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins said there are indications from states like
Wisconsin, which is in the forefront of efforts to require welfare
recipients to seek employment, that people leaving welfare for
low-wage work are not continuing to seek food stamps that could
help them make it through the month.
</P>
<P>
   Her misgivings are shared by some members of Congress from both
sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming apparent that the welfare reforms of 1996 did not
appreciate how tightly access to food stamps was linked to access
to welfare, said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chairwoman of the
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think there's a problem here,'' she said. ``We need to
see why state systems don't seem to capture the food-stamp eligible
population very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a big change in one system, it's going to have
ramifications for other systems,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``Some are
positive. If people aren't getting food stamps because they're
making more money, that's a good thing.'' She said her committee
was planning to hold hearings later this year on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only rough estimates have been made of how many people
have left the food stamp program for reasons other than rising
prosperity or stricter rules. Last year, for example, the
Congressional Budget Office calculated that 2.9 million people who
left the food stamp rolls between 1994 and 1997 did so for some
other reason. The budget office report, a projection of economic
conditions through 2008, proposed that the stigma and barriers
surrounding welfare offices could be driving eligible people away.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, no one disputes that the program has
shrunk drastically, both in the number of people enrolled and in
the cost of providing the aid. Since 1994, the annual cost of the
food stamp program has fallen from $24.5 billion to $18.9 billion,
according to the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservative poverty analysts say the drop in food
stamp rolls does not indicate a problem. Robert Rector, who studies
welfare for the Heritage Foundation, a private group in Washington,
said the drop is simply a recovery from a period through the early
1990s when access to food stamps and other assistance became too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s and early '90s, you had this notion of
one-stop shopping, getting people on as many benefits as you
could,'' he said. ``A lot of the decline now is hyped.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress would do well to make food stamps less readily
available, by instituting work requirements and other rules similar
to those already imposed on other forms of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Department of Agriculture, however, the notion that too
many people have abandoned food stamps has caused a flurry of
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The department recently commissioned a study to understand a
simultaneous rise in the demand on private food charities like
church-sponsored food pantries and soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to determine if some of these charity seekers are
seeking handouts at private charities because they have lost access
to public food aid, agriculture officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And department officials are pushing the states to be sure their
welfare offices are in line with federal rules, which require
prompt processing of food stamp applications.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, the administrator of the food stamp program, Samuel
Chambers Jr., sent a letter to the heads of commissioners of every
state welfare and food stamp program urging them to review their
policies to make sure they do not violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The letter pointed out how changes in efforts to trim rolls of
people receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families could be
deterring people from receiving food stamps, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage you to review your procedures and to make sure
that individuals denied, diverted from or terminated from TANF are
fully considered for food stamps and receive benefits if they are
entitled,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had been particularly worried about the
situation in New York City, where newly reorganized welfare
offices, now called job centers, were delaying food stamp
applications and often directing applicants to private food
pantries instead.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge last month ruled that the city food stamp
process violated federal law, the city promised to change its
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the city made another unrelated policy change
that city officials say will trim several thousand people from food
stamp rolls. Under the 1996 package of federal welfare changes,
single able-bodied adults can be cut off from food stamps after
three months if they do not work at least 20 hours a week or
participate in a workfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Counties can seek waivers to the work requirement if they have
high unemployment rates, and for two years the counties in New York
City had all sought the waivers, preserving the food aid.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the city has chosen not to seek the waivers,
so that city residents who are single and able to work must find
work or lose their food stamps, said Deborah Sproles, a spokeswoman
for the city Human Resources Administration.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, private groups focused on poverty issues decried
the city's decision, saying it could put as many as 25,000 people
at risk of hunger. But Ms. Sproles said, ``This is part of the
city's overall effort to start helping people gain self-reliance.''

IBM SAYS NEW FEATURE INCREASES PENTIUM'S SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to a growing controversy over a security feature in
Intel Corp.'s new Pentium III microprocessor, IBM said Wednesday
that it would ship Pentium III computers with the feature hidden by
the computer's hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has responded to protests about the feature, a built-in
serial number, by offering a specific software program, known as a
utility program, to prevent the number's being read by other
software. IBM's remedy goes further and hides the number at the
hardware level, which is harder to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   IBM made the announcement yesterday in a letter to the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based privacy group that
has asked the nation's major computer makers to provide computer
users more security than is offered by Intel's software remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel announced the processor serial number in January as a tool
for authenticating documents, electronic messages and copyrighted
material. Privacy groups, however, asserted that the number could
be used to track people surfing the Internet. Privacy advocates
have traditionally opposed universal numbers, including Social
Security and driver's license numbers, arguing that they can
simplify tracking an individual across many computer sources by
companies or agencies that create digital dossiers on people.
</P>
<P>
   In response to critics, Intel agreed to give computer makers the
software to switch the feature off in computers sold to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy activists have raised questions about the security
of the software used to control the number. In recent days, editors
at the German magazine C't said they had developed a program that
could read the number without a computer user's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said it would give consumers more security by moving the
control of the feature into the computer's basic input-output
system, a group of instructions permanently stored in a set of
silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are constructive ways to use the processor ID
feature to validate user identification, there are also legitimate
privacy concerns raised by the potential misuses of this feature,''
Christopher Caine, IBM's vice president for government affairs,
wrote in a letter responding to Center for Democracy and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has stood by its decision to offer the serial number as a
security and copyright protection feature. A company spokesman said
it had been recommending that computer makers place a switch in the
basic input-output system of each machine and that it be set to off
when the computer was shipped from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   With the switch shipped in the off position, consumers have to
go intentionally to the computer's basic input-output system setup
screen when the computer is booted and switch the feature on if
they choose to permit the number to be seen by a software
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective it provides another layer of choice and
control from the consumer's perspective,'' said Tom Waldrop, an
Intel spokesman.

CADBURY'S EARNINGS UP, BUT COMPANY STILL FACES QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cadbury Schweppes PLC reported a 6 percent gain in
1998 earnings Wednesday despite slower sales, and it tried to
portray the results as a success. But the British confections and
beverage company found itself facing questions from analysts and
shareholders about its plans.
</P>
<P>
   The questions came following the release of the company's 1998
financial results in London, which showed earnings rose to 609
million pounds, or $980.3 million, from 575 million pounds the year
before. Overall sales fell 2.7 percent, to 4.1 billion pounds, or
$6.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the profit came from the confectionery business, which
rose 6 percent, even with the turmoil in Russia, one of Cadbury's
major markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seemed unimpressed. Shares in the company, traded as
American depository receipts, fell $4.625, or 7.3 percent, to close
at $63.50.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reaction may have been the lack of strategic detail
offered by company executives, who startled the beverage industry
in December by agreeing to sell nearly all of Cadbury's non-U.S.
beverage businesses to the Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.85 billion deal has led to speculation that the company
may be planning an eventual exit from all its soft-drink
operations. The company reiterated Wednesday that it plans to focus
on the U.S. soft-drink business and on its international
confectionery brands.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Cadbury owns Dr Pepper, 7-Up, Crush,
Canada Dry and several other brands, which have contributed strong
profits in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury has also been under pressure to describe how it plans to
invest the proceeds from the Coca-Cola deal. Another $798 million
is expected to be raised from the sale of bottlers the company owns
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has listed acquisitions in the confectionery
business, which will become the largest part of its operations once
the sale is completed later this year, as a priority. Additional
bottler consolidation in the United States has also been mentioned,
as has a stock repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury executives said next to nothing about their strategy
going forward, except that they would have one. ``As we complete
the value-based restructuring of our businesses, strategic growth
will clearly become the new focus for us,'' said John Sunderland,
the company's chief executive. ``A share buyback remains one of
those options.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is widely believed to be examining several possible
acquisitions, but gave no details.

KERRY EXPECTED TO DECIDE AGAINST ENTERING 2000 RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Key advisers to Senator John F. Kerry say they expect
the senator to tell supporters in Boston this weekend that he will
not enter the 2000 race for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is of the view that he's going to say he's going to run
for president,'' said one longtime adviser who asked to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   After months of hand-wringing and intense conversations with
potential financial backers, Kerry has not relayed a final decision
to anyone in his large inner circle. And the senator could not be
reached for comment Wednesday. But key advisers in Boston and
Washington have grown increasingly doubtful that Kerry will move
ahead with a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Kerry backers have said he waited too long to
investigate the possibility of a presidential run and that he does
not have enough time to mount a credible challenge against Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While many politicians spent much of the last year or two
meeting with activists in New Hampshire and Iowa, Kerry did not.
When Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, both Democrats, said they would not run at the end of
last year and the beginning of this year, Kerry was only just
beginning to investigate the possibility of a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the last two months, Kerry never visited
Iowa, the preeminent caucus state. And his two visits to New
Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state, were cursory at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic activists who would have allied themselves with
Kerrey of Nebraska, or with Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority
leader, who never received so much as a phone call from Kerry.
Gore, on the other hand, scooped up major players, while former New
Jersey Senator Bill Bradley has attracted attention from Democrats
who are less prominent in their party.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry and his aides have argued vehemently that lining up
activists was the least pressing need. At the top of the list,
Kerry was trying to come up with a rationale for his candidacy
against Gore, and he was trying to line up financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kerry traveled across the country to fund-raising
events, working to pay off his remaining 1996 Senate debt. At the
same time, he spoke to Democratic money-raisers about whether they
would help him pull together the approximately $20 million
necessary to run for president. In Boston, however, many of his
most ardent financial supporters, such as Alan Solomont, Elaine
Schuster and Steve Grossman, had told him that they were already
committed to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   William Verge, the Rockingham County Democratic chairman, has
been talking up Kerry's candidacy in New Hampshire. Wednesday he
said he is not sure what Kerry will do, though he said he knows
that ``the word on the street is h's not going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Following an afternoon conversation with Kerry, Verge said, ``He
doesn't want to get in unless he thinks he can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Vallelly, a longtime friend, recently put the odds against a
Kerry bid at 75-25.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser later concurred with Vallelly's odds, but said
the 25 percent chance of running was very real.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent appearance on CNN's ``Inside Politics,'' Kerry
appeared to be talking himself out of a presidential bid as he
talked up Gore's financial and political advantages.
</P>
<P>
   He also reacted defensively to the notion that he was taking too
long to make a decision. In fact, Kerry had said all along that he
would wait until President Clinton's impeachment trial had ended,
and then he would take a couple of weeks to make his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not agonizing about this, incidentally, and I don't have
any great _ there's no Hamlet routine going on,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosenblith, a former Kerry staffer who has talked
extensively with Kerry this week, described the presidential
decision as a highly personal one. He said it is premature to count
Kerry in or out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying mightily hard to come to grips with this,''
Rosenblith said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is expected to attend a meeting of the Democratic Policy
Committee in Washington Friday. He is supposed to fly from Boston
to Colorado on Saturday to give a speech, returning to Boston on
Sunday. Kerry is expected to announce his decision in Boston, and
it could come as early as Friday evening, or perhaps on Sunday or
Monday, sources said.

SPECULATION SENDS XYLAN SHARES SOARING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Shares of computer-networking specialist
Xylan Corp. jumped 16 percent Wednesday amid takeover speculation
that has seen shares of the company climb 39 percent over the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously something going on here,'' said Andy
Schopick, an analyst with Nutmeg Securities. ``There could be a
buyout materializing.''
</P>
<P>
   Xylan rose $3.5625 to $25.5625 a share Wednesday with 6.2
million shares changing hands, more than six times its three-month
daily average. It was the highest close since last July and marks a
clear rebound from a September slump that saw shares fall under $10
on worries of slow sales to Alcatel SA and International Business
Machines, Xylan's largest customers.
</P>
<P>
   Shares have climbed nearly 40 percent over the past week with
several analysts saying Xylan should be trading above $30. The
company is worth $1.08 billion based on Wednesday's price.
</P>
<P>
   The latest surge may have been fueled by Xylan Chief Executive
Steve Kim, who said Tuesday at a conference that he was
``frustrated'' by the stock price and asserted Xylan is ``very
focused on increasing shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Paris-based Alcatel, which recently bought
Oregon-based Packet Engines for $315 million to enlarge its network
offerings, is a possible buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Calabasas-based Xylan posted a 63 percent gain in 1998 profits
to $39.4 million, or 83 cents a share, on a 65 percent rise in
sales to $347.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schopick, who has a price target of $30 a share, said investors
had been focused mostly on major data-networking players until the
recent increases. ``This stock had kind of been left behind,'' he
said. ``It's a quality company, one of the few with established
presence that remains independent. The financial performance over
the past couple of years has been exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of remaining independent is the key long-term issue
for Xylan, Schopick said, adding, ``They're playing in a world of
giants with intense competition from people like Cisco and
Lucent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's market capitalization, based on Wednesday's close, is
approximately $157.9 billion; Lucent's is $136.1 billion.

VIACOM EXPECTED TO SPIN OFF LACKLUSTER BLOCKBUSTER CHAIN

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Breaking up may be hard to do, but media
conglomerate Viacom Inc. will soon make Wall Street happy by
fulfilling its promise to spin off its Blockbuster chain.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom, expected to report fourth-quarter and year-end earnings
today, is entering the final stages of its divorce from the video
retail specialist following a rocky five-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone may disclose exact details of
the breakup during an analysts meeting at Nickelodeon Studios in
Burbank today. He promised last year that up to 20 percent of
Blockbuster would be sold in the first half of 1999 with the rest
spun off to shareholders during this year's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, which never liked the original $8.4 billion buyout
of Blockbuster, has embraced the spin-off. That enthusiasm, plus
continued strong performance in cable, film and TV operations, has
led to a sharp run-up in the company's stock to more than triple
its two-year low. It closed Wednesday at $85.0625, down $1.9375
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom investor Narvin Roffman, principal of Roffman Miller
Associates, said Wall Street is also giving Redstone credit for
strong management of MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon and Paramount Studios.
Its movie business has posted solid results by co-financing
projects such as ``Titanic,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few companies that do what Viacom does and
they're clearly one of the best managed,'' Roffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has a love-hate relationship with Blockbuster. The
chain has received high marks for recovering from its 1995-96
collapse by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction and
revenue-sharing deals with studios. Trackers remain wary because of
home video's long-term uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viacom is not trading at the same kind of multiple as rivals
because of the low valuation of Blockbuster,'' said entertainment
industry analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``The issue becomes a problem
because you can have a terrific year and still not sell at the same
multiple as Time Warner and Walt Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   So to many investors, it's always been a question of not whether
to ditch Blockbuster but when. ``The real issue has been to get
Blockbuster in the position to be sold off and spun off,'' Rockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have differed significantly as to how much Blockbuster,
which has more than 4,000 U.S. stores, is worth with estimates
ranging from $5 billion to $9 billion. So an offering of 20 percent
could raise $1.8 billion, which Roffman believes will be used to
cut debt and buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   Roffman also said the funds could also be used to buy other
cable networks. Viacom announced a plan Tuesday to expand its
Internet presence with music and children's sites to capitalize on
the popularity of MTV and Nickelodeon. Viacom will use $250 million
in advertising time to promote the sites and may eventually spin
off 20 percent of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   First Call's survey of 18 brokers calls for Viacom to report
earnings of 14 cents a share, compared with $573 million, or $1.54
a share in the 1997 quarter when earnings were boosted by a
one-time $1.2 billion gain from its sale of USA Networks. Without
the gain, Viacom would have reported a loss of 29 cents a share in
the 1997 quarter.

PATAKI SHUNS ALBANY'S MENTALITY AND ITS GEOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki returned to Albany on Tuesday
afternoon after two weeks away, a hiatus born not of a fact-finding
trip or bout of political wanderlust or even a vacation. The
governor had been governing, but, as usual, not from the seat of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his recent predecessors, Pataki has not made Albany the
center of his life. His regular absences from here provide insight
into not only his work style but also his seeming ambivalence
toward a place that often feels like an insular bureaucratic
kingdom _ the embodiment, in other words, of the kind of expansive
government that Republicans like Pataki continually assail.
</P>
<P>
   The governor does not live full time in the lavish Executive
Mansion, choosing to remain with his family in his own 24-room
Victorian home in Garrison, 50 miles north of New York City and 100
miles south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislature is in session _ typically two or three days
a week in the winter and spring _ Pataki will usually journey to
the capital by car or helicopter and stay overnight at the
Executive Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   On other days, more often than not, he is driven or takes a
helicopter from Garrison to his New York City office near Grand
Central Terminal, which is where he has worked for most of the last
two weeks. (He also delivered a speech in Missouri and attended a
National Governors' Association meeting in Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a routine that has left some Albany denizens feeling
slighted, and exposed the governor to sniping that he is disengaged
and aloof from the daily labors of state government. The president,
this line of thinking goes, would never regularly shun the White
House for a faraway home and auxiliary office.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's tendency to be out of Albany has attracted attention in
part because of his management approach, which is to focus so
intently on certain matters _ such as cutting taxes, improving the
state's fiscal condition and protecting the environment _ that he
sometimes leaves the impression that he finds other policy areas
uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
   His habits differ starkly from those of his immediate
predecessor, Mario Cuomo, who was famously obsessive about
hunkering down in Albany, often taking late-night, long-distance
flights in order to avoid spending another day away. For much of
his tenure, Cuomo, who once went on a 48-hour trip to Argentina,
had no other residence but the Executive Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Such contrasts raise an obvious question: Does it matter where a
governor works in the state, particularly in an age of the
Internet, fax machines and other gadgetry that have turned so many
people into telecommuters? If Pataki is not in Albany, does that
mean that the $70 billion state government is rudderless?
</P>
<P>
   Pataki says emphatically no, and some of Cuomo's former aides
agree, saying that they were often frustrated by how wedded Cuomo
was to the Capitol. And even though Cuomo was around a lot, he
often had fractious relations with the Legislature. Some lawmakers
still remember when he referred to them in a speech as monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki goes out of his way to say nice things about Albany as a
place to live, but when he discusses the city, there is a hint of
the conservative, big-government-is-the-enemy oratory that he has
been honing as he tries to broaden his national reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely essential to get out of the Capitol and out of
Albany to be able to govern effectively,'' he said in an interview.
``Ultimately, it's constricting to talk with the same people and
read the same papers and meet with the same interests as you do on
a regular basis in the capital. There is no question that just as
you have a Beltway mentality in Washington, you have a capital
mentality in Albany. It's extremely important to realize that it's
a big state with diverse interests and real people who live outside
the capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk irritates some local officials, who say residents are
put off by the governor's absence _ though it should be noted that
the city is a Democratic bastion. ``A great number of people in the
Albany area are offended by the fact that he doesn't use the
governor's mansion as his home,'' said state Sen. Neil Breslin, an
Albany Democrat. ``Having said that, he has been very helpful to
the Albany area in terms of promoting legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki does not apologize for not moving into the Executive
Mansion, saying that he promised his wife and four children when he
ran for governor in 1994 that he would do his best to avoid
disrupting their lives. And while his many trips between Albany,
Garrison and New York City cost the state money, his decision to
stay in Garrison costs him money. If he had wanted, he could have
sold his home, as Cuomo did, and lived for free in the Executive
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the mansion, and we have wonderful people there,''
Pataki said. ``But for an 11-year-old kid, it's far better to have
your own room, where you have to pick up your own socks.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox, of course, is that Pataki is less popular in New
York City than Cuomo was, though Pataki spends more time there than
did his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cuomo declined to criticize Pataki for spurning
the mansion. Cuomo pointed out that he was often concerned about
the impact of Mansion living on his son Christopher. He recalled
how he once castigated Christopher for requesting that his dinner
be delivered to his room.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cuomo, echoing criticism sometimes heard around the Capitol,
suggested that Pataki's unwillingness to spend more time in Albany
might hurt his ability to lead. Cuomo said that by immersing
himself in the social and day-to-day life of the city, he got a
better sense of state government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot that happens on the streets of Albany,'' said
Cuomo, who was defeated by Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki essentially responds that there is also a lot that
happens elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out of the political setting is a positive thing,'' he
said. ``It's one of the reasons that I have been so effective.''
</P>
<P>
   After alighting here on Tuesday afternoon, Pataki attended a
crime conference Wednesday morning. By mid-afternoon, he had
already traveled by helicopter to New York City, where he plans to
work the rest of the week. He had spent less than 24 hours in the
state capital.

MCGWIRE KNOWS HE HAS A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ First he sent batting &UR;  &LR; practice baseballs
soaring majestically over the left &UR;  &LR; field fence on Field 1 of the
St. Louis Cardinals' spring training complex. Nothing new there.
His batting &UR;  &LR; practice shows alone are worth the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   Then he patiently signed a plethora of autographs for eager,
polite fans. Nothing different about that either. He is one of the
more accommodating players for signing his name on balls, pictures,
magazine covers, hats and assorted other surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But then, once inside the complex, Mark McGwire revealed an
aspect of his phenomenal performance of 1998 that he had not
previously articulated: holding onto the home run record, McGwire
said Wednesday, was achieved in the face of greater pressure than
breaking the record initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say they're very, very close, but I think the
pressure of holding onto the record was greater than getting 62,''
McGwire said referring to Sammy Sosa's also reaching the mark after
the Cardinals' first full-squad workout of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, speaking in a wide-ranging hourlong news conference
before reporters and television cameras, was five months removed
from his September to remember. It was five months in which he
traveled to Australia once and Mexico twice for vacations, met the
Pope and kissed his ring in St. Louis, took a celebrity turn on the
television show ``Mad About You,'' winding up in bed with Helen
Hunt, and heard hundreds of unsolicited stories from fawning fans
about where they were and what they were doing when he hit No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire broke the 37-year-old record of Roger Maris the night of
Sept. 8. Five days later, Sammy Sosa, having his own awesome
season, tied him. On Sept. 23, Sosa caught McGwire again at 65 and
actually passed him for 45 minutes with No. 66 on Sept. 25. But
that would be Sosa's last home run, and McGwire would hit two each
in the final two games of the season. Pressure-filled mission
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Sosa had a pretty damn good year,'' McGwire said. ``He
was right there with me. When I broke the record that night, I knew
there was a lot of time left in the season and I knew what he was
doing. Trying to hold on to keep it and own the record, there was a
lot of pressure for that because he was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the record and a variety of other related
subjects, McGwire was as amiable as he was during the final stages
of last season, which, in retrospect, he handled remarkably well
considering the attention focused on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be any worse than what I went through the last
two months of last season,'' he said. ``I don't think there's ever
been another athlete to be singled out in one sport like I was
singled out the last two months of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   His use of a controversial supplement, androstenedione, brought
unwanted attention, but Wednesday he continued to defend his use of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was still taking the testosterone-producing substance,
McGwire said: ``It's legal. Major League Baseball is not the IOC.
It has absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Why use it then? ``It has something to do with me getting
through the workouts during the season when you're worn down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has commissioned a study by two Harvard medical
researchers to determine what androstenedione does when a player
takes it. The results of the study will help baseball officials
determine whether to ban it as the International Olympic Committee
does.
</P>
<P>
   If it is banned, will McGwire's use of it taint the record?
``No,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with hitting a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball that McGwire hit for No. 70, on the other hand, has
become tainted, he said, because it was bought at auction for $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty ridiculous,'' McGwire said of the auction price.
``There's one place and one place only where that ball belongs, and
that's the Hall of Fame. I said if there's going to be any money
exchanged, I will have nothing to do with the ball. I will never
touch it. I don't care to ever see it, because it's not in the
right place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Will there be a No. 71 ball in the future to be sold or placed
in the Hall of Fame? McGwire was skeptical about his or anyone
else's chances of breaking the record, but he said: ``Anything is
possible. But in order to break 70 home runs, I would have to think
you'd have to be at the 40 plateau in home runs by the All-Star
break.'' McGwire had 37 at the break last season.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate about how many home runs he might hit
this coming season, but he has hit more than 50 each of the last
three years, a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've set a standard of hitting 50,'' he said. ``Even
with what I did last year, a standard of hitting 50 is still a very
good number. I'm sure no matter what I do this year, if I don't
reach 70 again, someone will say I had an off year.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hits ``only'' 50?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll feel pretty good,'' he said. ``If I hit 50, it means I've
reached the 50 plateau and that's pretty important.'' He has 457
career home runs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire injected one ominous note into his comments. Talking
about the major comeback baseball made last year, three years after
the end of its disastrous strike, he said it would be awful if
players and owners had another labor dispute when the current
agreement expires, either after the 2000 or 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared to death to see what happens after 2001,'' he said.
``I sure hope what happened in '94 doesn't happen. The salaries are
getting up there. You can see it now. The small markets are going
to a place where they can't compete right away. I hope we can get
something done before that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If we had a work stoppage in 2001, I'd be so
disgusted I'd walk away from the game.''  &QL;

MATCH PLAY SENDS SOME OF THE BEST TO THE EXITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ One by one, a stunning number of the world's
best golfers were rudely dismissed from the premises Wednesday.
Ernie Els stood near the clubhouse wearing a wry smile that failed
to hide his disappointment. Lee Westwood stalked out of La Costa
Resort &AMP; Spa in a huff. Colin Montgomerie cleaned out his locker
with his head down and spoke in hushed tones about his demise.
</P>
<P>
   And in a poignant scene late Wednesday afternoon, three members
of last year's U.S. Ryder Cup team were sitting in the locker room
packing their bags: Mark O'Meara, Davis Love III, and Tom Lehman _
all first-round losers.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Andersen Consulting Match Play championship,
which began, and ended Wednesday, for many of the game's marquee
attractions. Five of the top-10 seeds were eliminated, and 12 of
the top 20, including O'Meara (No. 3), Love (No. 4), Westwood (No.
5), Montgomerie (No. 6) and Els (No. 7). Everyone expected upsets.
But hardly anyone expected this many, this quickly.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, 18 of the 36 first-round matches had been won by
lower-seeded players, leaving the top-seeded survivors in stronger
position. Tiger Woods (No. 1), David Duval (No. 2), Vijay Singh
(No. 8), Nick Price (No. 9), and Justin Leonard (No. 10) all
managed to advance. And considering the day's unexpected events,
all of the winners were relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie, I'm happy to have progressed past the
first day,'' said Duval, who won a difficult match over Stephen
Leaney, 2 and 1. ``You are facing a week where you could be beat
very easily. When you put the number 64 next to a player, and No. 1
next to another, it visually creates a wider gap than there
actually is. In this type of format, you can easily get ousted.''
</P>
<P>
   It was lonely and dangerous at the top, as everyone saw the
beauty and the beast of match play. The first event in the new
World Golf Championship series sent many of the pre-tournament
favorites scrambling to make unexpected plane reservations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara was beaten by Michael Bradley, 4 and 2. Love was
defeated by Steve Pate, 1 up. Westwood suffered a stunning 3-and-2
loss to Eduardo Romero of Argentina, a player who was without a
victory on the European tour last year. Montgomerie suffered
another disappointment in a premier event when he was whipped by
Craig Stadler, 5 and 3. And Els, the two-time U.S. Open champion
who won the Nissan Open on Sunday, bogeyed No. 18 and lost to Paul
Azinger, 1 up.
</P>
<P>
   For Els, it was a difficult change of fortune. Three days
earlier, he was celebrating an impressive victory, holding off
Woods and Love down the stretch. Wednesday, he tried to explain his
loss, and prepared to check out of his hotel. ``I don't want to
take anything away from Paul, because he did what he had to do,''
said Els. ``But I had opportunities, and I didn't take them. I
didn't play near to the level that I wanted to. I came off such a
high last week, but I just wasn't sharp. Mentally, I was awful. I
wanted to do well here, and it's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the match even, Els missed a 12-foot putt for birdie at No.
17 that could have put him 1 up. Then at the par 4 No. 18, Els hit
a poor tee shot into the rough, followed by a short approach shot
and a mediocre wedge shot that landed 15 feet past the pin just off
the green. After Azinger lagged his 35-foot putt for birdie to
within two feet, Els conceded par to Azinger, leaving Els with his
15-foot putt to keep the match alive. But Els barely missed the
putt, and Azinger breathed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was in,'' Azinger said of Els' final putt.
``Neither one of us really played that great. He wasn't on his
game, and I was able to slip in there.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Els took his match to the last hole. Montgomerie was
dominated by Stadler, the 1982 Masters champion, who took obvious
pleasure in winning. The Stadler-Montgomerie match became tense on
No. 13, when Stadler refused to concede Montgomerie's 3-and-a-half
foot putt for par. Montgomerie made the putt, but he was not happy,
and Stadler didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no love lost in match play,'' said Stadler, who will
face John Huston on Thursday. ``You've got to make that putt to
stay in the match. I'm not going to give it to him. He can glare
all he wants, I wouldn't give it to anybody else. Doesn't bother
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadler also said that Montgomerie was heckled by a few fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before his second shot at No. 15, some guy yelled, `You got
one shot left,''' Stadler said. ``Not exactly sporting-like,
whoever it was. I think I gave him a longer glare than Monty did.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Montgomerie had little to say, as the Scottish golfer
contemplated a long trip home with little to show for it. ``He
played better than me,'' said Montgomerie, as he made a hasty exit
from the locker room. ``Give him all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated opening-round match was not that close, as
Woods defeated Nick Faldo, 4 and 3. The most bizarre moment of that
match occurred on No. 14, when a cellular phone rang as Faldo was
in his downswing on his tee shot. Faldo flinched, and his pop-up
shot hit a tree, and landed only about 80 yards in front of the
tee. But Faldo was already 3 down at that point, and he simply did
not play well enough to threaten Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get a win under your belt, especially when you
beat a true champion such as Nick Faldo,'' Woods said. ``I hit a
lot of good shots at crucial times.''
</P>
<P>
   That was something that O'Meara and Love failed to do. Bradley,
who won the Doral-Ryder Open last year, never trailed in his match
against O'Meara, and when he went 3 up after 15 holes, Bradley knew
he was in control. ``Mark O'Meara was not Mark O'Meara today,''
Bradley said, ``but any time you beat the No. 3 player in the
world, it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, on his way to Utah for a ski vacation with his family,
said: ``You can call it an upset, but Michael Bradley is a fine
player, and I didn't play well today, so I'm headed home. That's
match play.''
</P>
<P>
   So 32 went down, and 32 remained, leaving some interesting
matchups for Thursday, including Woods vs. Bob Tway, Singh vs.
Bernhard Langer, Greg Norman vs. Romero, Price vs. Jeff Maggert,
Fred Couples vs. Scott Hoch and Phil Mickelson vs. Lee Janzen.
After Wednesday, nobody was breathing easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was fun,'' said Leonard, who won 4 and 3 over Miguel
Angel Jiminez. ``I'm glad to get out of the first round.''

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which grew from the seed of a
local Atlanta television station, Wednesday announced a return to
those roots with plans for a 24-hour regional cable network called
Turner South.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next fall, Turner South will be available in Alabama,
Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina and parts of North
Carolina, said Bill Burke, president of TBS Superstation, who also
will head the new network. TBS is a division of Time Warner &UR;  &LR; Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South will feature movies and television series from
Turner Broadcasting's library, regional news from CNN, games from
Turner's three Atlanta sports franchises (the baseball Braves,
basketball Hawks and hockey Thrashers), supplemented by some
original programs made especially for Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Among the original shows are a series based on the magazine
Southern Living (owned by Time Inc., a sister company), a weekly
country-music show from the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville and another
featuring the Atlanta comedy improvisation troupe Whole World
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Among the repeat programs, Burke said shows that would have
strong appeal in the South include ``The Andy Griffith Show'' and a
series called ``WCW Classics,'' with popular pro wrestling matches
from the past _ including bouts featuring ``Jesse (The Governor)
Ventura,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said many Southerners identify with Turner Broadcasting,
which began as a local station, WTBS, that Ted Turner turned into a
satellite-distributed ``superstation'' in 1976. Later the company
developed cable networks like CNN, TBS and TNT. Burke said Turner
South would inevitably compete with those channels in that region,
but he hoped it would draw viewers away from USA and other general
entertainment networks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has begun talks with advertisers, and with cable
operators to gain distribution, Burke said, estimating that the
region has more than six million cable subscribers. Florida is not
part of the new network, he said, because Turner does not own the
rights in Florida to all its programming, especially in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The new network will enable the parent company to make further
use of its programming assets, at a minimal start-up cost. ``We
have a lot of appealing programming that's not being utilized,''
Burke said, on Turner's other networks.

PHILIP MORRIS CLOSING FACTORY, LAYING OFF 1,400 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ky.   N.C., Va.)  (rk) 
 By   CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reflecting the growing decline in domestic demand for
its cigarettes, Philip Morris Inc. Wednesday announced it was
laying off 1,400 workers and closing a factory in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the plant, which makes Marlboro, Virginia Slims,
Benson &AMP; Hedges and other brands, will cost Philip Morris an
estimated $200 million before taxes, mostly to cover the costs of
severance pay, a company spokesman said. That translates to a
decrease in earnings of about 5 cents per share in the first and
second quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition that U.S. industry volumes will fall off
sharply in the next few years, and this is an attempt by the
company to maximize its margins,'' said Martin Feldman, an analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which Philip Morris acquired in 1944, is operating at
only about half its capacity, said the company spokesman, Mike
Pfeil. ``Over time, a number of factors contributed to the decision
to close this plant,'' he said. ``One is that we have increased
productivity at our other facilities. Another is technological
advances. And finally, there are marketplace changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of cigarettes has been declining at a rate of 1
percent to 2 percent a year, Pfeil said. ``We expect that the
historic rate of decline will continue,'' he said, ``and we believe
the industry's rate of decline based on external factors could
decline additionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers at the Louisville plant will be offered jobs at
Philip Morris plants in Richmond, Va., and Cabarrus, N.C. All the
manufacturing that took place in Louisville will be consolidated at
the other two plants.
</P>
<P>
   Price increases, combined with anti-smoking drives that are
either planned or in progress, have contributed to a drop in demand
for cigarettes, Feldman said.  &QL;

NYC COLUMN: THE BIG CITY AFTER VICTORY IN THE WAR ON CRIME
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ &UR;  &LR; The police are not yet confiscating the shoes of
jaywalkers, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is taking up just about
every other righteous suggestion that has come along. Now that
patrol officers have started seizing the cars of people arrested
for drunken driving, and tactical units are expanding the offensive
against drug dealers, the war on crime is escalating once again.
</P>
<P>
   But why now? Might this not be a better time to savor past
victories? Aggressive tactics eventually yield diminishing returns.
At the moment, besides offending people on the street and appalling
civil libertarians, the tactics may not even be doing much good
against crime. They might even be increasing people's propensity to
break the law.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics that guide Giuliani and the department do not
include a vital bit of data: how aggressive tactics affect people's
attitudes. The researchers who have measured this find that it can
be the most important consequence of police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's attitude toward the police is shaped less by the
crime rate than by how they're treated by officers,'' said Tom
Tyler, a professor of psychology at New York University who has
tracked attitudes toward the police in Chicago, Los Angeles and
Oakland, Calif. ``In our surveys, being treated properly _ with
respect and dignity and fairness _ is two to three times more
important to people than what happens to the crime rate in their
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's findings help explain why so many black and Hispanic New
Yorkers are angry at the police even though their neighborhoods
have enjoyed some of the most dramatic drops in crime. They're more
concerned about the disproportionate number of black and Hispanic
men being stopped by the police, which seems especially galling now
that relatively few criminals are on the street. And when something
goes wrong, as in the recent fatal shooting in the Bronx, they're
ready to assume the worst about police motives.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many New Yorkers may end up resenting the crackdown
on drunken driving, no matter what good it does. If people think
it's unfair for the police to summarily seize a car without a trial
_ and perhaps try to keep it even if the driver isn't convicted _
that inequity could matter much more to them than a decline in the
accident rate.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just a public relations problem. Tyler's work shows
that people angered by an encounter with a high-handed police
officer are more likely to later commit a crime. ``One encounter
raises the likelihood by about 5 percent,'' he said. ``That's not
an overwhelming effect, but if you and your neighbors keep having
these encounters, it adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers, who tracked men in Milwaukee accused of
domestic violence, found that a police officer's demeanor in
dealing with the men was more important than whether or not an
arrest was made. The men who felt they'd been treated respectfully
went on to commit 40 percent fewer offenses than the other men,
according to one researcher, Lawrence Sherman, the chairman of the
department of criminology at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers need to realize that their best weapon for reducing
crime is the mouth, not the pistol,'' said Sherman. ``In training
police, the big challenge is get officers who are oriented toward
action to take the salesman approach.'' It's especially challenging
to get an action-oriented mayor to take this approach. Giuliani's
former Police Commissioner, William Bratton, faults the mayor for
not being more flexible in adjusting to changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that crime has fallen so much,'' Bratton said, ``we're in
a position to make the transition from a crisis mode to a peacetime
mode. We can begin giving cops more training and putting more of
them in precincts instead of in tactical units. As things get
quiet, we can have more officers walking beats and focusing on
improving community relations, so that people are having more
positive encounters with officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, of course, is hardly a disinterested observer. There is
no love lost between him and Giuliani, and he has been mentioned as
a potential candidate for mayor himself. But his criticism can't be
dismissed as easily as that of the mayor's other political rivals.
The pacifist notions of Bratton are not coming from someone with a
reputation for being soft on crime. He's the one who started this
war.

POLICE CRITICS RENEW CALL FOR CHANGE IN ATTITUDES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of task force members appointed in 1997 to
examine police-community relations only to have most of their
recommendations rejected by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reconvened
Wednesday to reiterate their call for new police policies in the
aftermath of the shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 10 task force members called on the mayor to review
the task force's final reports and update the public on how its
recommendations have been followed. The recommendations included a
greater push for affirmative action, a requirement that all new
police officers live in the city, and better sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the group criticized the mayor's response to
the Feb. 4 shooting of Diallo, an unarmed West African street
peddler, by four white police officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public distrust of the police appears to be increasing,'' the
group said in a memo to Giuliani released at the Central Baptist
Church on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ``We believe there may be
serious consequences for all New Yorkers if public trust and
confidence in our police is not restored,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor appointed a 28-member task force in 1997 after four
police officers were charged with torturing a Haitian immigrant,
Abner Louima. When the task force released its recommendations last
year, Giuliani said some of the proposals were ``unrealistic and
make very little sense,'' and sarcastically derided the task
force's work.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, where he had traveled to
testify Wednesday before the House Subcommittee on Criminal
Justice, Giuliani said he did not specifically know what the task
force members were now suggesting, but maintained that Police
Commission Howard Safir has made a big different in the
department's community relations over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Safir said the department had already adopted
``62 percent'' of the task force's recommendations. He did not
provide a list, but mentioned plans to establish an advisory board
for the Police Academy as an example, and said that the proposal
for a residency requirement was a ``pie in the sky'' idea because
it would require action in the state Legislature and is vigorously
opposed by the police officers' union. On Tuesday, Safir announced
a recruiting program to attract more city residents to the force.
</P>
<P>
   The task force members at the church included several frequent
critics of the mayor, including Norman Siegel of the New York Civil
Liberties Union and Michael Meyers of the New York Civil Rights
Coalition, but also supporters of the mayor, like Irwin Rochman and
Richard Davis, both lawyers. They expressed various levels of
frustration with the administration, but were unanimous in
expressing concern that the reaction to the Diallo shooting, and
the task force report, had been insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost unimportant as to whether or not the police turn
out to be justified in a particular shooting,'' said Davis, who is
the chairman of the mayor's Commission on Combat Police Corruption.
``Distrust is growing. That has to be dealt with.''

NEW PLAN INCLUDES STATISTICAL SAMPLING AFTER 2000 CENSUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, guaranteeing a
continued legal wrangle over the 2000 census, announced Wednesday
that the actual count of population would be followed quickly by a
second tally using statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said the first count, due
Jan. 1, 2001, would be the traditional national enumeration called
for in the Constitution and insisted on by the Supreme Court in a
January decision. Slapping down a Clinton administration plan, the
high court, split 5-4, ruled that only an actual count of residents
nationwide can be used in reapportioning the 435 seats in the U.S.
House among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Then on April 1, 2001, Prewitt said, the Census Bureau will
provide a more detailed, sampling-adjusted count that will be
available to legislatures and other governing bodies for actually
drawing of political districts within a state. The administration
is, in effect, betting that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the swing
vote in the January ruling, will uphold use of sampling-enhanced
census counts for anything but the apportionment of House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may describe this as a `two-number census,' but it in
fact is a census that is progressively more complete, more
accurate,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a red flag to Republicans and conservative
groups who had criticized the Clinton administration's initial plan
to use sampling in the reapportionment count and mounted the legal
challenges against the process.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling involves taking a sample of the population and
extrapolating those figures to cover a larger area.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew J. Galvin, president of the Atlanta-based Southeastern
Legal Foundation, stood at the back of Prewitt's news conference,
promising a court test of the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will again take swift legal action against this
administration to prevent the unconstitutional use of statistics in
the upcoming census,'' said Galvin, whose group mounted the first
legal challenge to census sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, chairman of the House census subcommittee,
denounced the new plan and suggested that the Census Bureau put it
forward only under pressure from the political realms of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To provide a legal, Supreme Court-mandated number to the
Congress and then concoct another number for the states is a recipe
for disaster,'' said Miller, R-Fla. ``This irresponsible approach
will only serve to confuse and confound the American people while
hiding under a thinly veiled shield of so-called accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said any state that uses Census' ``second, manipulated
number'' as the basis for drawing political boundaries ``will have
their redistricting plans ties up in courts for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for census sampling was one result of complaints from
minorities _ primarily blacks and Hispanics, two reliable
Democratic constituencies _ that their ethnic groups were
undercounted in recent decennial enumerations, especially in 1990.
Census tallies figure not only in political apportionment but also
in federal funding formulas and also have commercial importance.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans oppose census sampling because they believe it is an
unreliable tool.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt sought to remove his agency from the long-running
political dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the task of the Census Bureau to produce the best
numbers possible, not to decide how they will be used,'' said
Prewitt, an advocate of census sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The initial, unadjusted count is ``not likely to be an
improvement'' on 1990, Prewitt said. In the last census, he said,
almost all Anglos were counted but only 95 percent of blacks and
Hispanics and an even lower percentage of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt refused to estimate how much the sampling-adjusted count
would add to the current $4 billion tab for conducting the census.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress could attempt to deny any
funds to the Census Bureau for a sampling-enhanced count.

BOOM EXPECTED TO KEEP GOING IN L.A. SUBURB
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Prepare for even more.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Wednesday night from one of the state's top
economists to Santa Clarita, the former bedroom community that has
quickly become the tiger of economic development for Los Angeles
County.
</P>
<P>
   Already one of the fastest-growing cities in Southern
California, Santa Clarita will continue its breakneck pace even as
the economic growth of the county, state and nation slows in 1999,
predicted Jack Kyser, chief economist with the nonprofit Economic
Development Corp. of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to re-create the type of growth we're seeing
there in the rest of the county,'' said Kyser, keynote speaker at
Santa Clarita's Fourth Annual Economic Forum, held at the Hyatt
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban city, approximately 26 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, saw a 4.36 percent increase in jobs in 1998, far more than
the roughly 2.38 percent increase countywide, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Santa Clarita-area employment will grow at about the
same pace while job creation countywide slows to an estimated 1.55
percent growth rate, Kyser said. That means Santa Clarita's
employee base will grow three times faster than the rest of the
county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically Santa Clarita has all the right elements,'' Kyser
said. ``Of all the areas in Los Angeles County right now, it has
the best combination of all the factors that point to continued
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Those elements include housing construction, a ready supply of
quality industrial space, good schools and a pleasant environment,
Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   The city also may be benefiting from a San Fernando Valley land
shortage that is pushing expanding businesses north, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Explosive growth is nothing new to Santa Clarita's 150,000
residents. Tractors and tract homes have been common sights this
decade as developers carved new communities between the valley's
foothills.
</P>
<P>
   But boosters say the continuing strength of the area job market
and its thriving industrial parks are testament to a new, sustained
boom that is changing the face of both Santa Clarita and its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job growth is always good news,'' said Santa Clarita Mayor Jo
Anne Darcy. ``It balances the community. If people can make a
living here and live here, they have more time for their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials are not resting on their successes, though.
</P>
<P>
   The city surveys residents every year on quality-of-life issues,
and last year it held its first retail survey to identify new
businesses sought for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the city as a marketing product that we're trying to
compete with other cities,'' said Michael Haviland, city economic
development manager. ``In some ways, you could compare us to a tube
of toothpaste that we're in the business of selling.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boom in Santa Clarita has brought problems, and critics,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all rosy,'' said Santa Clarita Councilwoman Jill
Klajic.
</P>
<P>
   While she said she supports continued growth, especially
industrial growth, Klajic said the city needs to address
overcrowding in schools, hospitals and on the city's winding roads.
</P>
<P>
   If current growth patterns hold up, Klajic said, ``eventually
the quality of life in Santa Clarita will not be any different or
any better than that in central Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems or not, economist Kyser said the region will continue
to be a poster child for economic development for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Clarita has been riding that crest since about 1993.
Because of the control on the use of land, and because Santa
Clarita is choosing wisely, it will probably continue to ride that
crest.''

$60 MILLION IN UNCASHED CHECKS POSE PUZZLE, TREASURER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Investigators combing through state financial records
amid a growing scandal at the treasurer's office have found that as
much as $60 million in uncashed state checks, dating back to 1986,
have never been advertised as abandoned property as required by
law.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, according to new Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, the
state may never be able to match the rightful owners to the checks
because of poor or incomplete computer data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stated repeatedly that there are problems with the
quality of data and it's a problem we're committed to fixing if we
can,'' said O'Brien spokesman Dwight Robson.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's investigation into the procedures at the state's
Unpaid Check Fund was spurred by the arrests last week of two men
involved in the alleged theft of $6.5 million from the account.
Investigators say they don't know if the sloppy bookkeeping at the
fund is directly linked to the alleged fraud or whether the lack of
controls and oversight allowed the fraud to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire man, Martin Robbins, is being held on bail,
charged with larceny, after moving the $6.5 million to a BankBoston
escrow account and trying to withdraw the money this month.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins is charged along with 47 year-old John Trischitta, a
20-year treasury employee who controlled the Unpaid Check Fund.
Trischitta has been released from jail on $10,000 cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say it appears Trischitta, of Stoneham, was not
transferring unpaid checks to the Abandoned Property Division.
After a year, unpaid state checks are supposed to be transferred to
abandoned property and be advertised in newspapers and on the
state's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   But records show that since 1990 only three large-sum payments
have been transferred between the two accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, $25.2 million in unpaid checks _ dating to 1990 _ was
transferred from the Unpaid Check Fund to the Abandoned Property
Division. Further, none of that unclaimed money was ever
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, only other types of abandoned property, such as real
estate or dormant passbook savings accounts, were published in
newspapers and on the state's Web site, records show.
</P>
<P>
   It took three years before any more unpaid checks were
transferred into abandoned property. On June 25, 1998, more than
$17 million was sent to abandoned property. And on Jan. 29, $15.7
million in unpaid checks were transferred to that account.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of who that money belonged to were never
published and treasury officials say it would be exceedingly
difficult to match people with their funds now, especially for the
older claims.
</P>
<P>
   After remaining for three years in the Abandoned Property Fund,
assets are transferred into the state's general fund, the main
account from which everything from local aid to highway repairs are
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a computer company known as ICAL Systems pitched
its services to the state, offering to update the data processing
so that when an unpaid check was transferred to abandoned property,
an owner record would automatically be generated.
</P>
<P>
   But that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the increasingly political investigation say
former treasurer Joseph D. Malone, obsessed with cutting the office

   Malone regularly touted his ability to generate money for the
state by turning over abandoned property to the general fund. Those
who worked under Malone defended the system and his repeated
transfers of money to the general fund, saying unpaid checks, like
abandoned property, often don't really belong to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the state takes land by eminent domain, a check
may be made out to the address, rather than a person. And nearly 40
percent of abandoned property has no name attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's abandoned,'' quipped one former Malone aide.
``Under Joe, not only did the amount of abandoned property
collections soar but so did the amount of money returned to owners.
. . And we did it spending less money on operating costs than had
ever been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide could not explain why the transfers between the Unpaid
Check Fund and the Abandoned Property Division rarely happened and
never on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess, let's face it,'' Attorney General Thomas F.
Reilly said Wednesday. ``We're trying to get to the bottom of this.
. . . Every day we learn more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not say whether other individuals associated with the
Unpaid Check Fund are under investigation.

INSIDE TIPS ALLEGEDLY LED ACCUSED TO LARGEST CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The man charged with stealing $6.5 million from a state
unpaid checks fund received a list of individuals and companies
owed more than $5,000 from the state last year so he could sell his
services as an ``heir finder,'' according to officials and
individuals familiar with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said that Martin Robbins of Peabody and Lincoln,
N.H., received far more extensive lists than were provided to
competing firms from John P. Trischitta, the head of the
treasurer's Unpaid Check Fund, who has also been charged in the
theft.
</P>
<P>
   While Robbins' lists included those owed as much as $100,000,
other competing heir finders were only given lists that showed the
names of companies and individuals owed less than $5,000 from the
state, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of one heir finder firm, who asked not to be
identified, confronted Trischitta last summer about his having
allegedly given Robbins the more complete list. The executive said
Trischitta confirmed he had done so and said that Robbins was a
``good guy.'' In a separate conversation, Robbins told the rival
executive that he had ``political'' friends who had helped his
business.
</P>
<P>
   After years of pressing Trischitta and higher-ups in former
state treasurer Joseph D. Malone's office for all the names, the
executive last summer suddenly received a list of people owed more
than $50,000. The executive began soliciting the larger targets.
But with call after call, the company was told that Robbins or
someone else from his firm, Robbins Associates, had already made
contact and they had either retained him or were considering doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbins had gotten the only advantage that exists in this
business _ time,'' said another heir finder, who also was told of
Robbins' earlier calls. ``I don't know whether it was weeks or
months, but he had a leg up on the rest of us the entire time he
had the list alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Trischitta and Robbins declined comment on the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly are trying
to pin down the dimensions of the relationship between Robbins, 51,
whose checkered career includes a personal and business bankruptcy,
and Trischitta, 47, of Stoneham, a 20-year employee of the
treasurer's office and the sole manager of the multi-million dollar
Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, a state prosecutor alleged in Boston Municipal
Court that Trischitta had received a $50,000 bribe from Robbins in
exchange for what was only referred to as ``services and
information.'' At a later press conference, Reilly and state
Treasurer Shannon O'Brien described Trischitta as ``Mr. Inside'' in
the criminal scheme, helping ``Mr. Outside,'' Robbins, to secure
through fraudulent means several checks totaling $6.5 million that
were untouched in the Unpaid Check Fund for several years.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to sources, investigators are also pursuing
the allegation that Trischitta provided Robbins a far more complete
list of names of people owed money from the Unpaid Check Fund than
routinely provided to other heir finders.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen companies in Massachusetts compete as heir
finders, offering their services to the thousands of individuals
and companies who have never picked up the checks they were owed by
the state _ and which ultimately wound up in the Unpaid Check Fund
of the state treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   Heir finders interviewed recently said the only way they were
able to secure the names was by filing Freedom of Information Act
requests, and once they arrived, they invariably showed no names of
individuals or companies owed more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   One heir finder, who asked not to be identified, questioned
Trischitta on the cutoff and was told that the fund never received
checks of more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The heir finder learned differently last summer when Trischitta,
responding to a Freedom of Information request, sent her a list
that consisted, as usual, of hundreds of pages of firms and
individuals owed $5,000 or less. But also on the list, for the
first time, were the names of firms and individuals that were owed
far more than $5,000, including about 50 that were owed between
$50,000 and $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The heir finder's company immediately started calling those who
were due the larger checks to determine if they were willing to
contract for the firm's services. The pitch was the same: the
finder knew that a company was due a sizable amount of money and if
it was willing to pay a percentage _ from between 10 to 30 percent
_ the finder could secure the money.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, the heir finder says, she was told that the firms
had already been contacted by Robbins Associates and were dealing
directly with them. A second heir finder, who secured a similar
list, said he also was told the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robbins incorporated his firm in 1994, other heir
finders said they had not heard of his competing in the business
until early 1998. By last summer, however, he had contracted with
at least two people to help him scour the lists for potential
clients.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who worked for Robbins for several weeks in the late
summer and fall, and asked not to be identified, said that he gave
her lists of companies and individuals owed about $1,000. The names
of those owed much larger amounts Robbins kept to himself, the
person said. Although she was successful in her work, signing about
30 of the companies and individuals to contracts with Robbins, the
woman said she quit the job because of frustration about Robbins'
work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally disorganized and was unable to keep track of
anything or anyone that he was trying to solicit as clients,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such disparate work habits may have been the cause of Robbins'
prior failings in business. In 1993, he was operating Associated
Cash &AMP; Carry, Inc. in Malden, which he described as being in the
surplus food brokerage business. He reported no income from the
company, however, and filed for personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he reported assets of $867,555, but a debt of $2.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a company owned by Robbins filed for bankruptcy. The
company, Associated Salvage Inc., bought and sold salvaged and
distressed goods. The company listed debts of $1.814 million and
assets of $904,000. Among the debts listed was $50,000 owed on a
lease for a high-end Mercedes sedan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Robbins was sued by a business partner alleging Robbins
artificially created debt in a company they owned, Bay State Job
Lot Inc., by charging increased rent, utility charges, and
warehouse fees. Robbins then transferred all of the company's
inventory to satisfy the debt he created, the lawsuit charges.
Robbins denied the charge.

EYE OF THE HURRICANE: IOC'S MAN IS BUFFETED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Canada)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Late last year, when scandal forced the International
Olympic Committee to investigate improper payments and gifts to
some of its members by Salt Lake City's Olympic organizers, the
organization turned to one of its own, Richard Pound, to run the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, a Montreal lawyer and former Canadian Olympic athlete,
had for years been the Olympic committee's chief negotiator of
television and sponsorship deals, and over two decades he had
earned the trust of committee members as well as that of many of
the corporate sponsors who finance the Olympic Games. Indeed,
Pound, whose efforts in the mid-1980s to reform the
television-rights bidding process had won him respect, has in
recent years been among a handful of people considered to be
possible successors to the IOC's president, Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Pound conceded that his role of investigating
his colleagues was an awkward one. But within five weeks, Pound's
investigation, conducted against a tight, self-imposed deadline,
produced a report that led to the resignation of three Olympic
committee members and called for the expulsion of six more. At a
news conference late last month, Samaranch cited the investigation
as evidence of the IOC's determination to examine and reform
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which accused the implicated IOC members of having
stained the good name of the Olympics, put Pound center stage in
what has become a global scandal. And, numerous committee members
have said, it enhanced the 56-year-old Canadian's stature as a
potential successor to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after its release, the report, as well as Pound's
attempts to investigate similar wrongdoing in other cities, was
criticized as inadequate. Some corporate sponsors, concerned about
the value of their investments, called for fuller investigations
and more stringent reforms. And certain officials in Salt Lake City
cited Pound's efforts as evidence that the IOC was incapable of
vigorously investigating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Pound spent only two days in Salt Lake City, hired no
independent investigators and conducted just a handful of
interviews, explaining that he had worked quickly in order to be
able to take some action at a January general meeting of the
committee in Switzerland. His investigation of possible misconduct
in previous Olympic site selections involved sending letters to
officials of bidding cities and asking them to turn over any
incriminating information. Only 11 of 28 cities even responded, and
two said they had uncovered minor infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pound has a great amount of integrity, but the IOC cannot
investigate itself,'' said Ken Bullock, a member of the board of
trustees of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter
Games. ``They are Pound's peers. You can't help but be attached to
these folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound strongly defends the quality of his investigation, saying
he was working with limited time and with the confidence that other
investigations of the Salt Lake scandal, including an internal
ethics investigation by the city's organizing committee, would be
more thorough. Earlier this month, a report by that ethics panel
uncovered financial abuses by another 10 IOC members, and Pound has
pledged to hold them accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the legal profession disciplines itself, the medical
profession. CPAs discipline themselves,'' Pound said in a recent
interview in Montreal. ``We are capable of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he never asked for the job of investigator, but had
done it out of a sense of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no fun,'' he said. ``In my case, 30-odd years of
pretty decent and capable sports administration is being turned
into pond scum because of the action of a small percentage of our
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   However Pound's report and the additional federal and state
investigations wind up being regarded, and however much his work
affects his chances of succeeding Samaranch, it is clear that for
nearly 16 years, Pound, as a member of the IOC executive board, was
at the center of an organization that functioned like an elite and
insular club.
</P>
<P>
   It was a club dealing with billions of dollars, but subject to
little accountability from inside or out. It was an organization,
Pound acknowledges, that for years had hints that its members might
be abusing their positions and endangering the public image of the
Olympics, but that never vigorously policed itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC failed in that regard, and there are plenty of
critics and supporters alike who say it did, Pound does not appear
to deserve more blame than any of the organization's other senior
members. But others insist he deserves no less, either.
</P>
<P>
   Pound swam for Canada during the 1960 Rome Olympics. In addition
to serving as chancellor of McGill University in Montreal, he has
long been regarded as a candid, accessible member of the often
secretive Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no diplomatic spin with Dick,'' said Dick Ebersol, the
chairman of NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Pound was elected to the IOC in 1978, and moved onto the IOC's
11-member executive board five years later. Soon after, Samaranch
put him in charge of the major TV deals and the lucrative corporate
sponsorships the committee regularly negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Pound said he became aware of the sometimes
tangled world of money and loyalties and problems of appearances.
In 1984 or 1985, Pound said, he was approached by Horst Dassler,
then the chairman of Adidas, the international sporting goods
giant, which owned the marketing firm under contract with the IOC
to broker corporate sponsorship deals.
</P>
<P>
   Dassler, Pound said, wanted him to represent Adidas in its
corporate negotiations with American distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I didn't mind doing it, but said he'd have to
understand that in light of the relationship he had with the
Olympic movement, this is not going to look good in hindsight,''
Pound said. ``So, I said, `If I do this, you have to understand
you'll pay my firm, but I won't participate financially.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pound did work for Adidas, but he said that as a partner in his
firm, he made sure he did not share directly in the revenue from
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, Pound said, he was offered a $1
million bribe from someone representing the Seoul Olympics to fix a
deal for European TV rights. Pound said he rebuffed the offer and
reported the bribe to Samaranch, but that neither he nor Samaranch
pursued the matter further.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who bore no specific responsibility for investigating
wrongdoing, said he felt there was little more he could do, and
that he merely wrote a note for his files to keep as an official
record.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, my first bribe offer,'' Pound said he wrote to himself.
To Samaranch, he said, ``You'll never guess, but ... '' Pound,
however, did soon reform the way television networks were awarded
the rights to the Games, opting to enforce a sealed bid process to
insure the appearance of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, with the Olympic organizing committees making their
own deals with the networks, nine of 14 Olympics from 1960 to 1984
went to ABC. ``It was unfair,'' said Neal Pilson, a former CBS
Sports president. ``We felt ABC had inside information.''
</P>
<P>
   To help with its Olympic negotiations at the time, ABC employed
a French executive in Europe, Georges Croses, who was close to
Monique Berlioux, a former IOC executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spence, a former ABC Sports senior vice president, said the
frequent choice of ABC was due to its quality production and the
fees it paid.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, starting in 1984, required networks to negotiate directly
with the IOC and submit sealed bids. As a result, NBC carried three
straight Summer Games (Seoul, South Korea; Barcelona, Spain; and
Atlanta) and CBS got three Winter Games (Albertville, France;
Lillehammer, Norway; and Nagano, Japan).
</P>
<P>
   But Pound's commitment to the sealed bid process and the sense
of fairer play it fostered was abandoned in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That summer NBC made a bold, $1.27 billion, pre-emptive bid to
secure the rights to the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia,
and the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, Pound decided to shut out ABC, Fox Sports and CBS.
There is no questioning, television executives say, that Pound got
a great deal for the IOC. But they also say there is no way of
saying whether he could have done better had he brought the other
networks into the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was done to CBS was unconscionable,'' said Barry Frank,
senior corporate vice president of the International Management
Group, who served as a consultant to the Sydney committee.
</P>
<P>
   NBC ultimately also got the rights to the 2004, 2006 and 2008
Olympics for a total price tag of $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pound acknowledged that he upended the even playing field he
nurtured, but said the NBC deals brought future financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Pound, along with three other members of the IOC's
executive committee, was given a 32-page report by organizers of
Toronto's failed bid for the 1996 Games. The report detailed
financial abuses by several IOC members that may have cost the
organizers $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   No formal IOC inquiry, however, was ever launched, and Pound
said he did not demand one himself. Pound said the Toronto report
did not contain names of the accused members, and that the
organizers never provided them when asked. Pound said the executive
committee decided to turn the information over to one of its senior
members, Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who was in charge of dealing
with bid cities. Three years later, the IOC, at least in part
because of the Toronto allegations, did amend its gift-giving
policy to limit the value of gifts members could accept to $150.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for names and they didn't give them,'' said Pound.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto officials insist that while their report did not contain
names, they were ready to provide them, but that no one at the IOC
pursued their charges aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Dick directly,'' said Norm Seagram, a Toronto
organizer. ``We raised the warning flag to the entire executive
board. The guy in charge was Samaranch.'' Seagram added: ``You
didn't need names to institute rules and enforcement measures. You
had the actions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Salt Lake City misconduct became public last fall,
Pound said, there was no hesitation to investigate. He said he
never gave serious thought to hiring outside investigators and did
not consider his decision to impose his own tight deadline to be
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1991 was faced
with investigating whether its executive director, Robert Helmick,
had violated conflict of interest policies, it hired an outside
investigator who spent 10 weeks conducting an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   For his investigation, Pound relied primarily on bid committee
summaries of the program of financial payments and gift-giving
carried out by the Salt Lake committee's former chairman and
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dealing ASAP with IOC members in the first flush of
information,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people interviewed by Pound said his focus was
narrow. Max Wheeler, a lawyer for David Johnson, the executive vice
president who resigned in January, said: ``Pound seemed
disinterested in gifts given to Samaranch, because he's not a
voting member on Olympic bidding. But that's a distinction without
a difference, because if you want to influence anyone, it would be
Samaranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound dismissed Wheeler's observations, saying Samaranch
regularly received ``protocol'' gifts. ``As IOC president, you have
to encourage candidate cities to think about putting out the best
possible bids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he was always sure the Salt Lake committee's ethics
inquiry would yield more evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have access to everything the ethics panel had,''
Pound said. ``I don't know how they would have reacted if I said,
`Hi, we're from Switzerland, give us access to everything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who was once behind an effort to force Samaranch to
retire at 75, now says the 78-year-old Samaranch must stay through
next month's voting on the proposed reforms and expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether he still desires the presidency after wading
through the alleged corruption of his colleagues, he said, ``It's a
position you consider and you think if I were president for a day,
what would I do?''

GIULIANI PLANS EASIER ACCESS TO CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration said Wednesday that it
would ease the security crackdown that has blocked public access to
City Hall since August, allowing demonstrators to gather in front
of the building starting this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said he had
proposed new rules that would allow groups of 50 people or fewer to
demonstrate, protest or hold news conferences in the parking area
in front of City Hall. The groups could also gather on the
building's steps under the proposed rules, Hess said, but only if
they were accompanied by members of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given this very careful consideration, and we think
it's fair and constitutional and proper,'' Hess said in an
interview Wednesday night. ``Hopefully, this will end all of the
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, which Hess said would become law after a public
hearing in April, came six months after the Giuliani administration
began Operation Bravo, a plan to tighten security in lower
Manhattan to thwart possible terrorist attacks after the bombings
of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. Police cruisers have blocked
access to the building ever since, and only people who can prove
they have business inside are allowed past the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Operation Bravo, Giuliani banned news conferences and
demonstrations from the steps of City Hall, which had long been a
popular spot for such gatherings. But the policy drew heavy
criticism, and it ran into trouble last fall, when a federal
appeals court ordered the mayor to allow an AIDS service
organization called Housing Works to hold a rally in the parking
area in front of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Judge Harold Baer of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan urged the administration to develop rules allowing more
gatherings on the building's steps. Giuliani loosened the security
policy shortly thereafter, but only to allow members of the City
Council to hold news conferences on the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which challenged the policy in court on behalf of
Housing Works, said Wednesday that he was encouraged by the new
proposals but that they did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant first step, but it is not a complete
victory,'' Siegel said. ``We still want more access. Anyone should
be allowed onto those steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said that his organization filed papers with Baer last
week asking him to declare the city's policy unconstitutional, a
move that he said prompted the Giuliani administration to propose
the new rules. The Civil Liberties Union will probably challenge
the new rules in court unless they are modified to allow gatherings
of more than 50 people, and to allow groups to demonstrate on the
steps without Council members.

GIULIANI DRAWS SUPPORTERS AND CRITICS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a day that underscored both his potential
strengths and vulnerabilities as a candidate for Senate, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani showcased the city's revival in appearances across
Capitol Hill Wednesday. But he also came under sharp attack from
black members of Congress over the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the mayor received strong encouragement from
Republican congressional leaders to run for the Senate seat that
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, plans to vacate at the end of
next year. Giuliani has said he is seriously considering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Just before meeting with Giuliani Wednesday afternoon, Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, said the committee was preparing
to test a national telemarketing campaign that would use the
possibility of a Hillary Rodham Clinton candidacy to raise money
from Republican donors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the committee, said McConnell wanted
to take advantage of the wave of news coverage about Mrs. Clinton's
possible New York run to energize the Republican base. If the test
campaign is successful, he said, it would be greatly expanded and
used to raise funds for Senate candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an easily recognizable national figure and a good
reminder of what the real Democrat agenda is, in terms of higher
taxes and a government takeover of health care,'' Roy said. ``We
think she will be a great fund-raiser for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own bit of shadow boxing with the first lady, the mayor
said he received offers from six Republican members of Congress
Wednesday to help him raise money for a race against Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Giuliani's day in Washington, which was organized with
the help of the Republican National Committee and Republican
congressional leaders, seemed intended to promote the mayor and his
policies to a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with Hispanic Republicans, in testimony before
the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and at a news conference
with Republican members of Congress, Giuliani described his
policies on crime, education, immigration and welfare as models for
big cities everywhere, asserting that they had made New York safer
and more economically vibrant than at any time since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the generally upbeat tone of the mayor's day was marred
during his testimony before the House subcommittee, when Rep.
Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., accused Giuliani of exaggerating the
successes in reducing crime and said the mayor had failed to speak
out forcefully against police brutality, particularly involving
black and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   During the exchange, which grew heated at times, Meeks said many
black men ``fear police as much as the common criminals on the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In a testy, lecturing voice, Giuliani responded that there were
fewer cases of police brutality and police shootings during his
administration than under the previous mayor, David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor called the Police Department ``a model of restraint''
and contended that anti-police prejudice was fueling complaints
about the department.

LAKERS' COACH HARRIS GONE BEFORE RODMAN CAN ARRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The signing of Dennis Rodman has become only the start of the
remaking of the disappointing Los Angeles Lakers. Wednesday, less
than 24 hours after the Lakers signed the eccentric rebounding
star, they dismissed Del Harris in his fifth season as their head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching change was not surprising, especially because
Harris had a reputation for being too easy on his players. Last
season, the Lakers reached the Western Conference finals, where
they were swept by the Utah Jazz. With the demise of the Chicago
Bulls, the Lakers were expected to be championship contenders in
this lockout-shortened season, but they are floundering.
</P>
<P>
   Their record is 6-6. In their last three games, all on the road,
they lost to the Seattle Supersonics Sunday, the Denver Nuggets
Monday night and the Vancouver Grizzlies Tuesday night. Before
Denver played the Lakers, the Nuggets had a 1-8 record. Vancouver
had not beaten the Lakers in 12 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jerry West, the Lakers' vice president for basketball
operations, said ``I wouldn't exactly say we were floundering.''
</P>
<P>
   West said he was not sure who would replace Harris. He said that
Bill Bertka, a longtime assistant, would take over for Thursday
night's game against the Los Angeles Clippers in Anaheim, Calif.
West said that he would then choose Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew to be
the coach for the rest of the season. Both are Laker assistant
coaches and former players.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was in his 14th season as a head coach in the NBA,
following four seasons with the Houston Rockets and five with the
Milwaukee Bucks. At age 61, he has a 556-461 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly for me,'' West said, ``the thing that makes it so
awkward is that Del has been a friend for many years. The direction
of a team is very important. We do feel like we have the talent
here. I just feel the last two games we've played have not been
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Tuesday night, Shaquille O'Neal said that Harris
was not at fault for the team's poor play. Predictably, guard Nick
Van Exel, traded after last season from the Lakers to Denver,
disagreed. Van Exel, who never got along with Harris, called the
coach ``a cancer on the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' new coach may face other kinds of problems from
Rodman. His ability is unquestioned because he has been the NBA's
leading rebounder in each of the past seven seasons. But nightly
changes of his hair color aside, the 37-year-old Rodman has a
well-publicized history of challenging team rules.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown up late for practices. He has head-butted a
referee. He has kicked a photographer in the groin. He has worn a
dress at a book signing. He sat out the start of this season while
tending to personal chores, such as finishing work on a movie.
Wednesday's schedule was typical Rodman _ a Laker practice in the
afternoon and the Grammy Awards at night.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a one-year contract with the Lakers. Because they are
over the salary cap, they could pay him only the veterans' minimum
of $1 million, and because the season was shortened and he has
missed so many games he will earn less than $500,000. His debut is
scheduled for Friday night against the Clippers in Los Angeles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rodman played the last three seasons with the Chicago Bulls. But
when the Bulls, after three consecutive NBA championships, let
Michael Jordan and coach Phil Jackson depart and traded Scottie
Pippen to Houston, they also did nothing to keep Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   He became a free agent. Finally, he decided he wanted to play
again.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Harris said that he had been looking
forward to coaching Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dennis I was sorry that I wouldn't get the opportunity
to be here,'' Harris said. ``I don't know what kind of ride it was
going to be, but I wanted to take it.'' &QL;

AGENCY PLANS TO PAY STORAGE COSTS OF NUCLEAR WASTE UNTIL REPOSITORY
IS READY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev. )   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department, which says it will be unable
to begin accepting utilities' nuclear waste until at least 2010,
will announce on Thursday that it is now willing to take ownership
of the waste and pay temporary storage costs with money the
utilities have paid to develop a permanent repository.
</P>
<P>
   The department has been collecting money from the utilities
since 1982 on the promise that it would take their nuclear waste by
January 1998. But it is unable to do so until it opens a permanent
repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., near Las Vegas. The anticipated
date for that opening is 2010, but so far the department has not
determined what standards such a storage site must have.
</P>
<P>
   Some reactors already are running out of space in their spent
fuel storage pools, and others no longer sell power but cannot be
decommissioned because there is no place for the spent fuel. The
department is being sued for breach of contract by more than 20
utilities, which are seeking tens of billions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said Wednesday in a
telephone interview that he would propose in testimony before a
Senate committee on Thursday that the department ``take title'' to
the wastes it was scheduled to have received under the 1998
deadline. The wastes would stay where they currently reside, in
scores of spent fuel pools and hundreds of storage casks, and the
department would pay the storage costs, in exchange for the
utilities' dropping their suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to address an immediate crisis,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson described his proposal as a starting point for
negotiations with the utilities, members of Congress who want the
federal government to establish a centralized temporary repository
and environmentalists, many of whom want the wastes to stay where
they are.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong sentiment in Congress for construction of an
above-ground, interim storage site, probably near Yucca Mountain,
but the Clinton administration has held off legislation by
threatening a veto. The administration's argument is that there is
no point in shipping thousands of tons of highly radioactive
material around the country before anyone knows for certain where
it will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's proposal seems unlikely to satisfy the utilities.
``The industry foremost is looking for movement of fuel,'' said
Scott Peterson, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a
trade association here. He said that several retired reactors could
have been converted to ``green fields'' for redevelopment if a
permanent storage site was in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event that there is not movement of fuel, the industry
is looking for compensation for continued storage on site, but
movement of fuel is the priority,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry previously has resisted any effort by the Energy
Department to use the waste fund to pay damages. The fund was
collected from utilities at the rate of one-tenth of a cent per
kilowatt-hour made in reactors under contracts signed under the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. About $15 billion has been
raised, including interest on deposits, with about $6 billion
having been spent.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the fund is for development of a permanent
repository, or at least a centralized repository, not for expenses
at reactors around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement would offer immediate relief to the
utilities, in contrast to construction of an interim, above-ground
repository, which could not be licensed and put in service until
2004, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers the utilities the advantage of being end their
ownership of the wastes, perhaps enabling them to sell small plots
of land to the federal government for waste storage casks.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially important to utilities in Minnesota and
Wisconsin, which have limited the construction of casks, in effect
saying that if the waste problem is not solved, the reactors must
close. If the casks were federally owned the states could not limit
them.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide on a committee with jurisdiction over the
Energy Department, speaking on the condition that he not be further
identified, said Wednesday night that if there was no settlement,
the Court of Claims might award vast sums to utilities whose wastes
the department already was scheduled to have accepted, which could
drain the trust fund before Yucca could be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little more rational approach to the problem than a
random walk through the courts,'' he said. ``The Energy Department
can exercize some cost control over it, as opposed to people
getting checks from the court.''
</P>
<P>
   By contract, the Energy Department was supposed to accept 400
metric tons of fuel in 1998, 600 tons this year, and 900 tons a
year beginning in 2000.

SHEPPARD ADJUSTS TO THE WAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Pepperdine's Nick Sheppard is supposed to be
one of the tallest players on a basketball court, but 6-foot-11
centers are not supposed to be expert handlers at dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sight spectators at competitions in Louisiana witnessed
regularly, when Sheppard would bring one of his trained rottweilers
across the stage. A judge might have more trouble keeping his eyes
off Sheppard and on the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at me pretty funny,'' Sheppard said. ``But I was
pretty good at it. I did dog shows, obedience training, stuff like
that. I really like animals. I had my own rottweiler.''
</P>
<P>
   If he could only develop some of a rottweiler's personality, he
might become a dominating player. Sheppard transferred to
Pepperdine from Louisiana State last year and has been a promising
if sometimes mellow performer during his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was slowed by a stress fracture in his left foot and
considers himself only 80 percent recovered, Sheppard has given the
Waves a valuable inside presence.
</P>
<P>
   His play will be crucial for the Waves this weekend when they
play San Francisco on Saturday in the first round of the West Coast
Conference Tournament in Santa Clara. Pepperdine (18-11, 9-5) needs
to win the tournament to make the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Among Sheppard's personal highlights was Pepperdine's 62-55 loss
to Kansas, when he helped hold highly regarded 7-foot center Eric
Chenowith to 10 points and four rebounds. Sheppard had a game-high
eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a chance to go out there and show what I had,''
Sheppard said. ``I showed I can play with people of any caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   Performances like that might become more regular with a little
more anger, at least according to coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still needs to be more enthused. He's very laid-back,''
said former USC coach Bob Boyd, who was an assistant at LSU during
Sheppard's sophomore year. ``I wanted Nick to take more of the air
of (ex-Chicago Bears linebacker) Mike Singletary. He's the kind of
guy that needs to be prodded with a stick. He can deal with it,
though, if he knows you can help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said he eagerly watches Pepperdine games on TV because he
worked so hard to turn Sheppard into a solid player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been labeled as an underachiever and unenthusiastic at
LSU,'' Boyd said. ``He made great progress. I think it's been a
good move for Nick. He needs coaching. He's responsive. He's
receptive to coaching. He's not lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard would still be at LSU if longtime coach Dale Brown
hadn't left under strained circumstances two years ago. But when
Brown was replaced by John Brady, Sheppard felt uncomfortable in
Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart wasn't there anymore,'' Sheppard said. ``After coach
Brown left, I wasn't comfortable with (Brady). I felt loyal to
coach Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard knew he wanted to transfer and knew he wanted to live
in Southern California. Remembering that Waves coach Lorenzo Romar
had recruited him in high school, Sheppard contacted Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sheppard attended high school in Lake Charles, La., he
had lived in Los Angeles until he was 13. But his mother sought a
quieter lifestyle for the family and moved to Louisiana. It seemed
natural that Sheppard should attend LSU, until the tumultuous
sophomore season that saw star player Lester Earl transfer to
Kansas and Brown depart. The Tigers eventually received NCAA
penalties over the recruitment of Earl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really a circus. We were still focused on making the
most our season,'' Sheppard said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard's positive nature was one reason Romar decided to take
another transfer on his team, which at the time included former
UCLA center omm'A Givens, former Cal guard Jelani Gardner and
former Arizona State guard Tommie Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Bob Boyd and he said Nick was a great guy and
talented,'' Romar said. ``He's just a really genuinely nice guy.
Kind of fun loving.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment from the Southeastern Conference to West Coast
Conference hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been up and down. It's tough for me to come back from
that year off,'' Sheppard said, ``especially coming to this league.
Down there it's a rough game. Here, they're not as physical. I have
to change my game around for the refs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also been difficult getting used to playing in front of
1,500 fans after going to places like Rupp Arena in Kentucky and
playing before 23,000. And Pepperdine is a much smaller campus than
LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard at times. But it's good for athletes. There's
no other distractions,'' Sheppard said. ``It can be frustrating.
Last year, during El Nino, it shut down the whole campus. I didn't
leave campus for nearly a month. Sometimes I would sit there
thinking, `How could I get stuck here with nowhere to go?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Things have improved since Sheppard became eligible this season.
He's moved to the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles, so he
isn't confined to just the campus and feels like he's finally
starting to reach his basketball potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here expecting big things to happen. We have a good
nucleus,'' Sheppard said. ``It's been tough to adjust but that
makes me stronger. As the games have progressed this season, my
confidence has really grown.''

SENATE BID UNLIKELY FOR PROSECUTOR AFTER SPOUSE'S INDICTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ In the wake of her husband's indictment on
tax fraud charges, Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County district
attorney, is unlikely to run for the U.S. Senate, a top aide and
two leading county Republicans said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is far less likely now that she would look to that
as a serious possibility than it was last week,'' said the aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Instead of tangling with the
issues, she's going to be asked questions about her husband. That
has changed the complexion of the race and the message.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide said Ms. Pirro had been mulling a run ever since Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced in November that he would not
seek re-election. Her thinking, the aide said, began to solidify in
the ensuing weeks as top state Republicans, including many close to
Gov. George Pataki, encouraged her to make such a run and several
newspaper articles fed what the aide called `` a wave'' of
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., was indicted
by a federal grand jury in White Plains on charges that he evaded
taxes on more than $1 million in income by deducting such personal
items as a $123,000 Ferrari sports car, a leased Mercedes for his
mother-in-law, domestic servants and artwork as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Pirro has not been charged, the indictment was
regarded by some politicians as a political setback for her because
many of the deductions taken by her husband benefited Ms. Pirro _
one involved a second leased Mercedes, which Ms. Pirro drove _ and
some of the charges stemmed from their joint tax returns from 1992
to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Several top county Republicans, speaking on condition that they
not be named, agreed that Ms. Pirro would most likely skip the
Senate race and perhaps bide her time waiting for the race for
governor in 2002, should Pataki not seek re-election to a third
term. They also suggested that she could run for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Pirro, her husband has always been part benefactor and
part burden. As the county's most successful and well-connected
land use lawyer, he has been able to raise money for her campaigns
as judge and district attorney, and he has introduced her to the
politicians who helped smooth her path to victory. But at many
points, his presence at her side has also been a hindrance and a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she withdrew as the Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor rather than provide information about her husband's
business interests, which included a Connecticut garbage carting
company that Republicans worried was part of an industry tainted by
organized crime. In 1993, when she ran for district attorney, her
opponent, Michael Cherkasky, questioned whether Ms. Pirro could
impartially investigate contracts for garages at the county airport
and hospital, which were built by developers represented by Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   While she has been the county's chief law-enforcement officer,
she has seen her husband withstand one state and two federal
criminal investigations as well as a paternity suit brought by an
Indiana woman who eventually proved through DNA tests that Pirro
had fathered her daughter.

UDALL FAMILY, SOUTHERN ARIZONA DEMOCRATS LURE CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is coming to Arizona Thursday for a
blend of reasons both political and personal, including a desire to
mark in private the passing of Arizona congressional legend Mor ris
K. Udall.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrives in Tucson Thursday aboard Air Force One, is
hoping to regain momentum for his beleaguered Social Security
rescue plan by addressing Arizona senior citizens, who gave him sur
prising support in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also presents an opportu nity to thank Pima County
voters, who campaign officials considered the key to Clinton's
becoming the first Democrat to win Arizona since Harry Truman in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed that Arizona seniors responded favorably to
Clinton's 1996 message of protecting Social Security, and that many
feared that plans by the GOP Congress would shrink the growth of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors' support, White House officials said this week, is a
big reason why Clinton chose Ari zona as a site to pump up his
recently announced Social Security preservation plan, which has
come under attack in Congress. What better place, White House
officials asked, to resurrect the plan than the scene of one of his
most unexpected electoral victories?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will share a stage at the Tucson Convention Center with
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who has said that Clinton's Social
Security plan ``does nothing to save Social Security'' and is
merely ``a cynical shell game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe, who will travel with Clinton to Tucson, said in an
interview that he will not emphasize his criticisms but rather will
stress the need ``to find a compromise that works for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit also has a personal dimension not appearing on
his official schedule, which includes the Tucson speech and a visit
to the Arizona Diamondbacks spring train ing baseball facility.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``felt badly that he was unable to speak at the Udall
serv ices in Tucson'' last month, a senior White House official
told The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's passing has been very much on peoples' minds, and it gave
us another reason (for the trip) that seemed to make sense,'' said
the official, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to meet privately during the day with
family members of the late Democratic congressman, who was beloved
for his environmental stewardship, his grace and his wit.
</P>
<P>
   Udall died in December at a hospital in Washington, D.C. Mem
bers of Congress are holding their own memorial service for Udall
at a House office building next week.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding Udall's 30-year tenure in office, Arizona was
long considered a solidly Republican state until Clinton captured
its eight electoral votes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   National Democrats, who ignored Arizona for years during
presiden tial campaigns, are eager not to let it slip back into the
Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traveled to Arizona three times during the presidential
cam paign, including two visits to the Valley and one to the Grand
Canyon. Clinton could afford to spend so much time in a relatively
small state because he had virtually wrapped up his election
against Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   For this visit, Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., lobbied for Clinton to
come to Tucson instead of the Valley. The White House was eager to
send Clinton to Arizona, and to accommodate Pastor, who has been a
staunch supporter of Clinton and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president took a great interest in what happened in Ari
zona,'' said Doug Wilson, coor dinator of Clinton's '96 Arizona
campaign. Wilson said Pima County had been one of the keys to the
state victory, along with a successful speech Clinton made earlier
to senior citizens in Sun City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of margins that would be necessary to overturn almost
50 years of history, we knew were not going to be huge. So every
vote counted. The voter turnout and the breadth of support in Pima
County was not only a critical factor, it may have been the
critical factor,'' Wil son said.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe disputed the notion, ad vanced by Democrats, that Clinton
had captured the hearts of senior citizens on Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a larger proportion (of seniors) than Democrats have
gotten in past elections, but that's because Clinton got a larger
proportion of all the voters last time, and he carried the state,''
Kolbe said.

   Clinton's Social Security plan would devote most of the future
budget surpluses to shoring up Social Security's trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe has questioned Clinton's accounting methods, saying the
trust fund would ``be stuffed with IOU's'' instead of dollars.
Kolbe has proposed his own rescue plan. It would permit workers to
redirect 2 percentage points of their Social Security taxes into a
personal ac count, which could then be invested.

   Later Thursday, Clinton will deliver a foreign-policy speech in
San Fran cisco and attend a Democratic reception in Los Angeles.

BELTRE STARTS WITH A (PINKY) BANG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Adrian Beltre's first big-league camp as the
Dodgers starting third baseman had an inauspicious beginning.
Before he even got to the clubhouse for Wednesday's first
full-squad workout, he was injured. Beltre slammed his right pinky
finger in his car door. He needed two stitches near his fingernail
to close the wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better it happens now than at the beginning of the
season,'' said Beltre, who worked on conditioning on Wednesday.
``They took X-rays and told me to take a couple of days off.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Charlie Strasser said X-rays were negative. Beltre,
wearing a gauze bandage, was listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, was bummed. He wants to get training camp underway
so he can begin working toward this season and dismiss the memories
of a year ago. The highly touted prospect was promoted to the
Dodgers on June 4 but hit .215 and made 13 errors in 77 games after
making the jump from Double-A San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nerves . . . when they called me up last year, I
was not ready for it,'' Beltre said. ``They told me I was going to
be up two or three weeks. When I started to play, I wanted to do
better so I could stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Beltre's hitting nor fielding overwhelmed anyone, but
his talent is enough for manager Dave Johnson to downplay any talk
of Beltre not being at third base on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I don't expect great things out of him,'' Johnson
said. ``I didn't want him to put to much pressure on himself. I
said it would be OK if he hit .250, and he said no. With the
surrounding (players), there shouldn't be any pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rough time after his jump to the Dodgers, Beltre said
he feels better about his position after playing winter ball in his
native Dominican Republic. Beltre was the Most Valuable Player in
the Dominican winter league, batting .301 with 10 homers, 37 RBI
and 17 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can play here and that helped me because (other
major-leaguers) and I played good (in the Dominican),'' said
Beltre, a lifetime .305 hitter in the minors. ``I feel I can do the
job. I feel confident and I feel relaxed. I'm positive. I think
I'll be the third baseman all year.''
</P>
<P>
   __ 'Nuff seen, 'nuff said: The first full-squad workout brought
an opportunity for a few of the pitchers to throw against hitters,
and the first one to take the mound was right-hander Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown looked sharp during his 10-minute session, and upon
throwing his first pitch _ a strike on the outside corner _ Johnson
quipped, ``I've seen enough. He's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Turning over the reigns: Prior to the workout, general
manager Kevin Malone addressed the Dodgers in the outfield of one
of the practice fields. To Malone and Johnson, it served as a
symbolic passing of the torch from general manager to manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just to say things about the team concept,'' Malone
said. ``I told them it's amazing what you can accomplish as a team
when you don't care about who gets the credit. They know where I'm
coming from. When you do something like that, you hope they see the
energy level and recognize the commitment and dedication.''

POLICE RELEASE SKETCH OF SUSPECT IN FATAL KIDNAPPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Two days after Chris Rawlings' kidnappers crashed
his Bentley with him in the trunk, one returned to the scene to
search for the victim's wallet, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That same man is believed to have waved $1,000 at motorists in
hopes of buying his escape, and when that didn't work, carjacked a
Mazda sports car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A motorist saw him rooting around some bushes two days after the
Feb. 8 attack and has helped police confirm a composite sketch,
which was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said these new details bolster their suspicion that
the attack was a robbery gone awry and was not tied to an FBI
investigation into Rawlings' multimillion-dollar telemarketing
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would tend to take us away from the direction of
kidnapping for ransom or murder,'' said Los Angeles police
Detective Rick Swanston of the West Valley Division. ``There is no
evidence to connect it. But we haven't discounted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities that police are considering is that
Rawlings' business associates might have told someone else about
Rawlings' wealth, leading to the robbery, Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also theorize that the attackers stuffed Rawlings in
the Bentley's trunk not to kidnap him but rather to hold him while
they searched his house. However, when they heard on a radio
scanner that the police were en route, they may have panicked and
fled with him in the trunk, crashing the car several miles away,
Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on witness descriptions, police said one suspect is an
African-American man in his 20s, between 5 feet 10 inches and 6
feet tall and weighing about 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for the wallet near the crash scene in the
suburban Los Angeles community of Tarzana, the suspect was seen in
a 1994 to 1998 tan over emerald green convertible Ford Mustang,
police said. He failed to find the wallet, but police later located
it.
</P>
<P>
   The man may limp because of injuries suffered in the fiery crash
that ejected Rawlings from the trunk, fatally injuring him.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspect fled on foot and is described as an
African-American man in his 20s, between 5 feet 10 inches and 6
feet tall, weighing about 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Both men wore dark clothing, gloves and a mask and were carrying
handguns, police said. They may also be in possession of two Rolex
watches stolen from Rawlings, including one with diamonds on the
face, bevel and band.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe a third man might have driven the two
gunmen to Rawlings' house that night, Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, the Los Angeles City Council will
consider next week offering a $25,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Swanston said the pair may be connected to other crimes in the
West San Fernando Valley. They fit the descriptions of two home
invasion robbers who brutally attacked film producer Daniel Blatt
on Jan. 31 at his suburban Sherman Oaks home before fleeing with
his belongings.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles police search for Rawlings' attackers, the FBI
continued its investigation into allegations that he ran a
fraudulent telemarketing scheme, said Laura Bosley, an FBI
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   One of two men arrested on suspicion of being involved in the
scam, Timothy Carlnell Griffieth, has been released on his own
recognizance. The other suspect, John Darris Dickens, had bail set
at $15,000. His arraignment is scheduled for March 8.

NEW YORK CITY'S FIRST LADY SPEAKS FOR HERSELF, BUT WON'T TALK ABOUT
HUSBAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Donna Hanover is the first to say that her life as
first lady of New York City didn't turn out as she had planned, and
that she hasn't been involved in politics the way she expected. She
also says that she has changed since moving into Gracie Mansion in
1994 with Mayor Rudolph. Giuliani, the husband rarely seen with her
in public the last two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've become stronger,'' Ms. Hanover said. ``As you
grow through life, you figure out what you're capable of, maybe
things that you didn't imagine before. And you do them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent hourlong interview that ranged from her
professional ambitions to her children to her role as first lady,
Ms. Hanover refused to talk about Giuliani. When asked if she was
committed to her marriage, Ms. Hanover replied, swiftly and
pointedly, ``I'm committed to my family.''
</P>
<P>
   As Giuliani considers a possible run for the U.S. Senate after
his term as mayor is up in 2001, Ms. Hanover is beginning to plan
for her own future post-Gracie Mansion. Since 1996, when the
Giulianis began leading separate public lives, the state of their
marriage has been a subject of discussion in New York's political
circles, and could become an issue in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanover, who said she planned to stay in New York after her
husband left office, did not make it clear in the interview that
her future necessarily included Giuliani. Even now, she has come to
define her role as first lady as a community service position
wholly separate from the mayor, whom she did not mention in a
recent week of public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But she reacted to speculation in the city about her living
arrangements with a bright, ``Oh, I never moved out of Gracie
Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   She would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate,
whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would
campaign for him if he did. But she did say in the interview, which
was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary
Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that
Mrs. Clinton is a ``very interesting'' person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's dynamic, and I think she's very smart, and she's
an amazing speaker,'' Ms. Hanover said. Ms. Hanover's press
secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this week that Ms. Hanover had
no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanover, 49, spoke over morning coffee at Bouterin, a
favorite French restaurant on East 59th Street. She was warm when
the subject was her career and her children, icy when the questions
turned to her husband. She wore a magenta blazer, and looked
younger than she did when she became first lady. In the last two
and a half years, she has grown out her pixie haircut and lost 20
pounds _ the result of 4 a.m. exercise sessions on her treadmill at
Gracie Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   `And like many women,'' she said, laughing, ``that battle is
never won.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of women's magazines, Ms. Hanover has
repeatedly declined requests for interviews in New York. She spoke
to The New York Times soon after becoming first lady in 1994,
describing herself as a ``sounding board'' who is ``always there''
for her husband. She spoke to The Times again for 10 minutes on the
telephone in 1996 about her decision to move away from attending
political events with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But she recently decided that the time was right for a longer
session in person, apparently to direct attention to a career as a
television reporter and occasional film actress that in two years
will no longer be helped, or hampered, by her role as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that I've been able to have my own career,'' she
said. ``And it would never have happened any other way. That's the
kind of person that I am. Work is extremely important to my
self-image and my sense that I've contributed to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanover said she was looking for a job as a broadcast
financial reporter, after taking a finance and accounting course
last year at New York University. ``People are much more interested
in business across the board nowadays,'' she said. ``And New York
is the center of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanover appears as a correspondent up to four mornings a
week on WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York,'' the 7 to 9 a.m. local news
program on Channel 5, and is co-host of a program on ``In Food
Today'' on the national cable Television Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   She also goes to a weekly acting class, and spent two days last
week in California taping a guest appearance as a psychiatrist on
the ABC series ``The Practice,'' to be broadcast March 14. In 1996,
she had a sizable part as Ruth Carter Stapleton in ``The People vs.
Larry Flynt.'' Last year she earned $304,613; the Mayor's salary is
$165,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanover's ``first lady service,'' as she calls it, includes
the Cool School program, which recognizes outstanding New York City
public schools. She is on the board of St. Mary's Hospital for
Children in Queens and is active with groups raising money for
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the fatal illness known as Lou
Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   She also gives what she calls ``professional women's dinners''
at Gracie Mansion, with guests like Cynthia Rowley, the designer,
and Jane Alexander, the actress who headed the National Endowment
for the Arts. Ms. Hanover said she has ``a wonderful group of
friends'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very lucky to find support,'' she said.

NON-TELEVISED WINNERS PICK UP THE PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 12 awards presented during the televised
broadcast of the 41st Grammy Awards last night were but the tip of
the musical iceberg. Some 80-plus trophies were handed out before
the main ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium in categories ranging
from rap and r&AMP;b to album notes and something called ``tropical
Latin performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammy officials managed to accomplish this in a brisk 100
minutes, which translated into roughly an award per minute.
Needless to say, any acceptance speech that went beyond the words
``thank you'' put a burden on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Winners, however, did have an opportunity to elaborate on their
feelings backstage. Some like Vince Gill, who won for his country
instrumental performance with Randy Scruggs, were veterans at this
type of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blast for me. I don't think that the whole world knows
that I play, and that's OK,'' Gill said. (He later picked up his 13
Grammy.)
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the Irish Celtic group Clannad who won for new age
album, didn't know quite what to make of all the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we won for the wrong category,'' said Noel Duggan,
talking of the group's win for new age album. ``I think we're more
old age. But we'll take it nevertheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were people like Elvis Costello, a critical favorite
for two decades, taking home his first Grammy for his pop
collaboration with Burt Bacharach on the album ``Painted From
Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out, I didn't have much respect for these
things,'' Costello said, looking at his award. ``But now ... well,
it's great. Maybe more people will listen to the album because of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Costello and Bacharach had come to the ceremony straight from
the studio, where they were recording a remake of Dionne Warwick's
``I Know I'll Never Fall in Love Again'' for the ``Austin Powers''
sequel, ``The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis does a wonderful job,'' said Bacharach, winner of five
Grammys. ``Who knows? Maybe we'll be back here again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacharach received his first in 1967, two in 1969 and another in
1986 before winning this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran, Patti Page, took home her first Grammy, winning
for best traditional pop vocal performance for ``Live at Carnegie
Hall, the 50th Anniversary Concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Swing is officially back. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, led by the
former leader of the rockabilly Stray Cats, took home two awards _
best pop instrumental performance for ``Sleepwalk'' and best pop
vocal performance by a duo or group for ``Jump Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   Those winning multiple awards in the early ceremonies included
jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, who won for instrumental arrangement
and jazz instrumental and guitarist Pat Metheny, winner for
contemporary jazz performance and rock instrumental, both from his
acclaimed ``Imaginary Day'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes me want to swing for the fences every time,'' said
Hancock, recognized for his Gershwin tribute album ``Gershwin's
World.'' Hancock's record also won a Grammy for Stevie Wonder, best
male r&AMP;b performance for the song ``St. Louis Blues.'' It was
Wonder's 20th Grammy, tying him with Henry Mancini for fifth most
in the award's history.
</P>
<P>
   Composer John Williams will also have to make more room on his
mantle. Williams won his 17th Grammy for his work on the ``Saving
Private Ryan'' soundtrack. (He was also nominated for ``Amistad'').
``The Lion King'' was named best musical show album, while the
ubiquitous ``My Heart Will Go On'' won for best movie song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly a surprise, is it?'' lyricist Will Jennings said
backstage.
</P>
<P>
   By extension, neither was Celine Dion's win for best female pop
performance for the same song. (``She was the only one who could
have sung it,'' said composer James Horner, winner of two Grammys
himself). Eric Clapton won the Grammy for male pop vocal for ``My
Father's Eyes.'' It was the 13th Grammy Clapton, 12 of which have
come this decade, in his three-plus decades of recording.
</P>
<P>
   In the country music categories, Shania Twain won two Grammys
for her pop song, ``You're Still the One.'' Country's hottest
group, the Dixie Chicks, won for group vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Williams won for best contemporary folk album (``Car
Wheels on a Gravel Road), icing on the cake after just being named
artist of the year in the annual Village Voice poll of the nation's
music critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real surprise and a thrill,'' said Williams of her
second Grammy win. ``You never think you're going to win one of
these.'' &QL;

TAKE A BEGINNER ALONG AND IT GET A FREE TICKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LOIS FRIEDLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The skiing industry has developed several ``bring a friend and
ski free'' and ``recruit a rookie'' snowboarding programs, which
offer a free lift ticket, valid on the same day that a friend is
signed up for a learn-to-ski/ride program.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the beginner package varies with the ski area, but
it will include a lesson, rental equipment and a lift ticket.
Reservations are suggested at many of the areas, so call ahead to
verify details.
</P>
<P>
   The programs vary, but here are a few of the choices:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleven eastern areas have adopted a program that rewards
skiers with a free lift ticket for signing up a new friend through
the ``Now It's Your Turn'' guaranteed learn-to-ski program,
available during nonholiday midweeks all season long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mountain Creek, 47 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel in Sussex
County, N.J., offers this deal, plus others for New York-area
skiers. Mountain Creek has placed coupons for a beginner package at
half price, with the purchase of another lesson at full price,
inside copies of the magazine, Fresh Tracks: The Newcomer's Ski &AMP;
Ride Guide. The resort is distributing the guide around the New
York City metropolitan area in health clubs, ski shops and other
places where potential skiers may congregate. This new magazine is
a lively bible for never-evers, full of tips for easing one's way
into these winter sports. For details about the programs or a copy
of the magazine, call (917-827-2000) or go on line
(www.mountaincreek.com).
</P>
<P>
   _ Ten other resorts have adopted the basic premise of bringing a
non-skiing friend to the slopes for a guaranteed first-time-on-skis
program in return for a free lift ticket. These include Okemo and
Stratton in Vermont, Wachusett and Jiminy Peak in Massachusetts,
Ski Windham and Holiday Valley in New York, Ski Liberty and Ski
Roundtop in Pennsylvania, Snowshoe in West Virginia, and Tremblant
and Mt. Ste. Marie in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York's Hunter Mountain ``Bring a Beginner'' program is a
bit different. Skiers and snowboarders who bring a friend who
purchases a $45 learn-to-ski/ride package will receive a half-price
lift ticket valid Monday through Friday, nonholidays. (A beginner
lesson and lift package is $28 without equipment rental.) For more
details, call Hunter at (518) 263-4223 or go on line
(www.HunterMtn.com).
</P>
<P>
   _ Ski New Hampshire will reward skiers and snowboarders who
introduce a friend to snow sports with a free lift ticket for
downhill skiing, or a free trail pass for cross-country skiing from
Feb. 22 to the end of the season. Reservations are advised for this
``Take a Friend'' program, which has been adopted by most of New
Hampshire's ski areas. Never-evers must be at least 13 years old.
For details on Ski New Hampshire's program, call (800) 88S-KINH, or
the member areas directly. On-line surfers should visit
www.skinh.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Skiing Co.'s nine resorts _ which stretch from
Maine to California and include Killington and Mount Snow in
Vermont _ offer a free day on the slopes to anyone who brings a
friend who enrolls in the Learn to Ski or Learn to Ride program.
For details, call (800) 245-SNOW for Mount Snow, (800) 621-MTNS for
Killington or go to www.peaks.com for a complete list of resorts.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Recruit a Rookie'' is a program designed to introduce
teen-agers and young adults to skiing and riding, but to use
www.snowblast.com for the details and voucher. The web site, which
targets this age group both in design and content, also lists the
Levi's Sno-Core concerts which stop at many resorts around the
country.

   NEW YORK _ A Nassau County, N.Y., jail guard accused of beating
a retarded inmate with a frying pan or a pot in 1993 testified
Wednesday in the former prisoner's civil lawsuit that he had no
memory of either the man or the night of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor who investigated the case at the time
testified that the inmate's identification of the guard, Salvatore
Gemelli, as the man who savagely assaulted him, was ``as strong an
ID as you get in a criminal case.''
</P>
<P>
   The former inmate, Thomas Donovan Jr., 39, is suing Gemelli,
Nassau County and its jail in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on
civil rights charges, and is seeking $100 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is proceeding amid a widening federal investigation
into possible civil rights violations at the Long Island jail,
where, many current and former inmates say, beatings are an
everyday occurrence. The inquiry began after the Jan. 13 death of
Thomas Pizzuto, 38, whose family says he was beaten by guards and
then left untreated for days. His death, which was ruled a
homicide, is being investigated by the U.S. attorney's office in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Gemelli, a vice president of the correction officers' union,
remained calm through several hours of questioning Wednesday, even
when peppered with accusations by Donovan's lawyer, Stephen
Civardi. After Civardi established from jail records that Gemelli,
who handled Donovan's admission into the jail, had taken an
unusually long time to do so, Gemelli said the length of time
necessary depends on a number of factors. ``It also depends on
whether you're busy beating somebody between bookings, doesn't
it?'' Civardi asked. Judge Allyne Ross ruled that Gemelli did not
have to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   Gemelli testified that he interviewed arriving inmates in his
own way, deviating from approved scripts used to screen possible
suicides, for example. When he was supposed to ask if an inmate was
in treatment with a psychologist or psychiatrist, he said, ``I'd
ask, `Do you think you're nuts?'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Civardi closed his interrogation by asking Gemelli: ``Is
there anything Donovan could have done to justify the beating he
received at the Nassau County jail?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Gemelli responded. `` Donovan should never have gotten
beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   The other key witness Wednesday was Paul Delle, a former
prosecutor in the Nassau County district attorney's office who
initially handled the investigation of Donovan's allegation against
Gemelli. He told jurors that Donovan's ``horrific'' injuries
``appeared to be inflicted with tremendous force.'' He added: ``I'd
never seen injuries like this in my history as a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross-examined by Gemelli's lawyer, Chris Termini, Delle
conceded that the district attorney's office had declined to
prosecute Gemelli. ``So far,'' Delle added.
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for Donovan, Delle, who is now in private practice,
said Donovan had originally been arrested on sex-crime charges.
Jurors up to that time had not been told why he was in jail.
Donovan eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.

WILLIAM M. BRONK, 81, A POET OF DEPTH AND HAUNTING VISION, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William M. Bronk, a poet known for the philosophical
depth of his work, died on Monday at his home in Hudson Falls, N.Y.
He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He had emphysema and died of respiratory failure, said his
editor, Edward Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Bronk, who was descended from Jonas Bronck, for whom the Bronx
is named, won the American Book Award in 1982 for his collected
poems, ``Life Supports,'' and was considered one of the most
prominent poets of his generation. The Nation once referred to him
as ``our most significant poet,'' and critics hailed his intellect,
precise use of language and what reviewers praised as his intimate,
haunting and unfrivolous vision.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Hudson Falls in the spacious Victorian house where
he lived the rest of his life. He entered Dartmouth College in
1934, where he studied under the critic and poet Sidney Cox and met
Robert Frost. After graduation he studied at Harvard briefly and
then left to write a study of Thoreau, Melville and Whitman that
was published 30 years later as ``The Brother in Elysium: Ideas of
Friendship and Society in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   After Army service in World War II, he taught at Union College,
then took charge of his family's business, the William M. Bronk
Coal and Lumber Co. in Hudson Falls, which he ran until his
retirement in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But he never lost his love for poetry. His first major
publications was in 1951 in the journal Origin, edited by the poet
Cid Corman. Origin also published Bronk's first book of poems,
``Light and Dark,'' in 1956. His second book ``The World, the
Worldless'' was published in 1964 by New Directions.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to publish at least 28 books, 10 of them since 1990.
They include ``My Father Photographed With Friends'' (1976), ``Life
Supports'' (1981), ``Death Is the Place'' (1989), ``The Cage of
Age'' (1996) and ``All of What We Loved'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Bronk often wrote in abstract language about metaphysical
topics. ``My poems come to me in their own language,'' he once
said, ``and if they were not in that language, they would not have
any force.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Light and Dark,'' he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   World, world, I am scared
</P>
<P>
   and waver in awe before the wilderness
</P>
<P>
   of raw consciousness, because it is all
</P>
<P>
   dark and formlessness; and it is real
</P>
<P>
   this passion that we feel for forms. But the forms
</P>
<P>
   are never real. Are not really there. Are not.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 his publisher has been Talisman House, which has
reissued all but one of his earlier works and will publish his
final collection of poems, ``Metaphor of Trees,'' in October. Bronk
did not drive and rarely traveled or gave readings. Instead, his
house became a mecca for poets and artists.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

EDITORIAL: THE PIRRO QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of an influential Republican lobbyist,
fund-raiser and friend of Gov. George Pataki would by itself be
news. But because the man indicted, Albert Pirro, is married to
Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney and a
rising star in New York politics, it delivers a doubly significant
jolt. Ms. Pirro will probably have to forgo whatever plans she had
to run for the Senate or other higher office until her husband's
legal problems are resolved. Since the indictment alleges fraud on
tax returns, some of which were signed by Ms. Pirro, she may have
to provide a fuller explanation of her own claims of ignorance of
any improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pirro is a talented and telegenic prosecutor. In this era of
working couples, moreover, voters are often ready to distinguish
between the performance of someone in public life and that of a
spouse. Ms. Pirro's office says she was not involved in, or
knowledgeable about, her husband's business activities. But the
66-count federal indictment alleges many improper deductions for
home furnishings, baby sitters, vehicles, vacations and other items
shared by and Ms. Pirro. Her apparent lack of curiosity about the
family's finances is a legitimate subject that she needs to address
further.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro is, of course, entitled to a presumption of innocence. But
it was offensive and inappropriate for Ms. Pirro to attack the U.S.
attorney's office for conducting an ``invasive and hostile''
prosecution of her husband. As a prosecutor, she should not have
criticized the integrity of another prosecutorial office that she
is supposed to cooperate with in criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ms. Pirro has a bright future in politics, as many
experts felt until this week, will be determined by the outcome of
the case against her husband and her role in his activities. Her
supporters had been promoting her as a possible candidate for
Senate, and some of allies of New York City's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, believe Pataki was pushing her to run for Senate to block
the mayor's own ambitions. Any such plans are probably stalled, at
least for now.

FLORIO FORMS COMMITTEE TO EXPLORE HIS PROSPECTS FOR A SENATE RACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Seeking to resurrect his political career,
former Gov. Jim Florio said Wednesday that he was forming an
exploratory committee to begin raising money and building support
for a possible run for the U.S. Senate seat that will be vacated by
Frank Lautenberg next year.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who served one term before losing his re-election bid in
1993 to Christie Whitman, could end up in a rematch with Whitman,
who is also considering running for the Senate seat next year.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he had been encouraged to seek the Democratic
nomination to the Senate by some of his old supporters. He also
said that after spending the last five years working as a college
professor and as a lawyer, he was ready to use his experience for a
new challenge. ``The time is right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters and political experts say that Florio could win a
Democratic primary with his statewide name recognition, and run a
competitive general election campaign, although not all of the
state's Democratic Party leaders are enamored with the prospect of
his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   After Florio, as governor, pushed the state Legislature to
accept a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, voters punished
Democrats at the polls the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the state Democratic Party are concerned that
Florio's candidacy would remind voters about the tax increase that
so enraged them at the time. They are also concerned that his bid
could deny the next generation of Democrats a chance to run for
statewide office. The list of Democrats considering a run include
Susan Bass Levin, the mayor of Cherry Hill, and Reps. Bob Menendez
of Union City and Frank Pallone Jr. of Long Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Wednesday that she had not yet decided whether she
would seek the Republican nomination for the Senate.

YANKS AND NETS TO MERGE BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets are
expected to announce a joint ownership agreement Thursday that
would merge their business operations _ including television
rights, marketing, sponsorships and advertising _ and unite two
disparate ownership groups, four persons with knowledge of the
talks, including a league executive, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are expected to establish a 50-50 ownership
arrangement, in which they will exchange some stock and the Nets
will pay some cash. What is still unclear is whether the current
Yankees and Nets executives would maintain separate day-to-day
control of the two teams' on-the-field moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees-Nets merger will bring together tough, blustery
George Steinbrenner, the majority owner of the Yankees since 1973,
and the Nets' owners, whose lead investors, Raymond Chambers and
Lewis Katz, have pledged 38 percent of the team's profits to help
revitalize New Jersey's inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   While the storied Yankee franchise has won two World Series in
the past three years, the Nets have been something of a hapless,
even cursed, team. They have not won a league championship since
1976, when they belonged to the American Basketball Association. In
fact, before being merged into the National Basketball Association,
the Nets sold Julius Erving, their nonpareil star, to the
Philadelphia 76ers, in order to afford to join the league. As such,
the Nets will benefit enormously by being connected to the Yankees,
especially in the area of joint TV and sponsorship negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest potential in combining the Yankees and Nets
is the impact on upcoming cable TV negotiations. The Yankees are
entering the 11th year of a 12-year, $486 million contract with
MSG, while the Nets' contract with another Cablevision Systems
entity, Fox Sports New York, concludes after the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees already present a formidable presence in TV
negotiations, but having the Nets as their partner could create
unprecedented leverage in renewal talks with Cablevision. On one
level, both teams are important to Cablevision's local sports
strategy, which features carrying the Yankees, Knicks, Rangers,
Nets, Mets, Islanders, and Devils on MSG and FSNY.
</P>
<P>
   But by forging a united front, the Yankees-Nets entity would
hold out the possibility that it could launch its own local sports
channel to compete with Cablevision's. A new local cable sports
channel requires at least two teams as anchor programming whose
respective seasons span a 12-month calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees alone were responsible for huge subscriber and
advertiser growth for MSG when they moved there in 1989 from
SportsChannel New York. A two-team combination could create its own
channel by negotiating directly with cable systems, or it could
make a deal with such companies as Time Warner or ESPN, a unit of
the Walt Disney Co., which has sought opportunities to add local
sports channels to its national sports services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV play is where the upside is,'' said Marc Ganis,
president of SportsCorp. Ltd., a sports consulting firm in Chicago.
``And maybe there could be some more at some point with a public
offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganis noted that Steinbrenner's skills as a hard-nosed
negotiator for sponsorships for the Yankees _ including one for $95
million with Adidas that provoked a federal lawsuit from Major
League Baseball _ can only help the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   The merging of the Nets and Yankees also ends speculation that
the Yankees would be acquired by Cablevision. The two sides had
negotiated for more than a year to conclude a deal that might have
cost Cablevision at least $500 million, but talks collapsed late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the business factors, one reason that the Nets have
apparently decided to merge with the Yankees is to broaden their
charitable platform to New York City, including the South Bronx
neighborhood where Yankee Stadium is located. The Nets' focus is
now on the New Jersey cities of Newark, Paterson, Jersey City,
Trenton and Camden.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen as to whether the Yankees-Nets combination
will affect where the two teams will play. The Nets want to move
from the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, N.J., and
build their own arena in Newark as part of their emphasis on
community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees continue to wait to decide about staying at Yankee
Stadium in a new or renovated stadium, move to a proposed ballpark
over railyards on the West Side of Manhattan, or jump the Hudson
River for New Jersey. Gov. Christie Whitman has said the state will
not use public money to lure the Yankees.

SENATE APPROVES MILITARY PAY INCREASE THAT IS BIGGER THAN CLINTON
SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: ADDS 1 graf at end to list senators who voted no.) 
 (fe) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly approved a sweeping
military pay and pension increase on Wednesday that is bigger than
a plan President Clinton proposed two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a Republican priority, was approved 91-8, with most
Democrats joining to support the politically popular measure that
the Joint Chiefs of Staff say is essential to help recruit and
retain the highest-caliber armed forces. Three Republicans and five
Democrats opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Pay raises and sweetened pensions are traditional Republican
issues that Clinton seemed to co-opt with his proposal in December
to increase military salaries by 4.4 percent for all 1.4 million
members of the armed forces on active duty, starting in January
2000. The administration also sought to give larger bonuses to
selected mid-career personnel and to improve the pensions of
veterans who joined after 1986. Although the administration has
said it was not happy with the bill in its current form, officials
said it was unlikely that the president would veto such popular
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, eager to show that Clinton's impeachment
trial had not derailed their legislative agenda, split off the pay
and pension provisions from the annual Pentagon budget bill to make
it the first major legislation the Senate considered this year.
</P>
<P>
   Senators then made the measure _ called the Soldiers', Sailors',
Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights _ more generous than the
president's version. The Senate bill authorizes a 4.8 percent pay
raise next year; allots bonuses of up to 10.3 percent, compared
with the administration's 9.9 percent, and provides for slightly
better pensions.
</P>
<P>
   It also adds more educational aid under the Montgomery GI Bill,
creates 401(k)-style savings accounts for service members and
provides $180 a month to as many as 10,000 low-ranking troops who
are eligible for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something of a bidding war going on between the
administration and the Congress,'' said Steven Kosiak, an analyst
with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a policy
research institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate plan
would cost $55 billion over 10 years, $18 billion more than the
administration's plan. Either proposal marks the largest pay raises
since 1982, when a newly elected President Ronald Reagan approved
increases of 14.3 percent for officers and 10 percent to 17 percent
for enlisted personnel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Senate action puts the White House in a bind. A policy
statement from the White House's Office of Management and Budget
said the administration ``does not support'' the bill in its
``current form.'' But the president cannot risk blocking a pay
raise for troops at a time that the Air Force is begging for
pilots, the Navy is short on sailors and recruiters are scraping to
meet their monthly quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The House, while undecided whether it will break out the pay
provisions as the Senate has, is likely to follow the Senate's lead
closely. At a hearing on Wednesday of the House Armed Services
Committee, lawmakers pressed the military service chiefs on their
personnel problems. ``Recruiting in the Army today is a very tough
challenge,'' said Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, the Army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen favors extra pay increases
but only if Congress increases the Pentagon's overall budget to pay
for them. Otherwise, Cohen, a former Republican Senator from Maine,
has said the Republicans' one-upsmanship could force the Defense
Department to cut training, spare parts or other areas that
Congress insists are vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be counterproductive and completely contrary to our
mutual desire not to undercut our modernization effort and other
readiness priorities,'' Cohen said in a letter last week to Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An influential conservative, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the
majority whip, expressed a similar concern on Wednesday about the
bill's cost. Nickles said the proposal to increase the pensions of
20-year veterans to 50 percent of their basic pay, from 40 percent,
was ``a mistake'' that would cost $14 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, who put the
bill on a fast track and helped rush it to the floor with no
committee hearings, dismissed any hand-wringing over budget
constraints. ``There is one thing that takes higher priority than
budgets, and that's the defense of our country,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner added, ``We simply cannot allow the best military force
in the world to wither and atrophy.''
</P>
<P>
   But some independent military analysts say Congress may be
overreacting to a problem that has yet to be fully analyzed. Some
specialists say, for example, that the frequency of overseas
missions has more sway over whether troops decide to remain in the
military than a sweetened pension.
</P>
<P>
   Major studies on pay and pension by the Congressional Budget
Office, General Accounting Office and the Pentagon are nearing
completion, and some lawmakers advised waiting until the study
results are known and the budget picture becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the ranking
minority member of the Armed Services Committee, ``represents a
promise to the troops that may or may not be possible to redeem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Nickles, the Republicans who voted no were Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire and George Voinovich of Ohio. The Democrats
who opposed the measure were Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman,
both of Connecticut, Richard Durbin of Illinois, Russell Feingold
of Wisconsin and Bob Graham of Florida. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., did not vote.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In a disturbing yet familiar sight, the
Nets collapsed in the fourth quarter of Wednesday night's game
against Portland, enabling the Trail Blazers to leave Continental
Arena with a 94-85 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After leading for most of the first three quarters, New Jersey
was outscored by 30-18 in the final period. After Eric Murdock
scored the opening basket of the quarter, Portland went on a 26-8
run to win its fifth straight game and improve to 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Williams led the charge, scoring 9 of his season-high 22
points during the critical spurt. Rasheed Wallace scored 7 of his 9
points during the late run.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Nets' fifth straight, dropped them to 2-9 and
spoiled a bright performance by Murdock, who started in place of
the injured Sam Cassell. In his best game of the season by far,
Murdock had 23 points and 6 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams rebounded from a horrible performance against
the Knicks' Patrick Ewing on Tuesday, recording 15 points and 15
rebounds. And Kendall Gill (16 points), Keith Van Horn (15) and
Kerry Kittles (12) scored in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the crushing loss in New York, the Nets defended well and
shot 29 percent from the floor; Wednesday, they played a nice
offensive game but crumbled down the stretch defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell was not in uniform after playing 33 minutes against the
Knicks. It was the second time the Nets' starting point guard had
exhausted his sprained right ankle in one game, only to sit out the
next. If the pattern continues, Cassell's injury will hamper him
throughout the season. Coach John Calipari admitted that it might
be time to rest him for a while so his ankle heals completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make that decision right now,'' Calipari said.
``The only problem is that if we sit him out a couple of weeks,
you're talking 10 games. Then you wonder if you're just better off
trying to play him 20 minutes a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdock got the club going immediately. In an about-face from
Tuesday's debacle, the Nets' shooters caught fire in the first
half. New Jersey made 64 percent of its shots to take a 32-22 lead
after the first quarter.

PIRRO'S INDICTMENT BRINGS ATTENTION TO PATAKI ASSOCIATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The bright spotlight created by the federal
indictment handed up Tuesday against Albert J. Pirro Jr., the
powerful real estate developer and lobbyist, also turned attention
to Robert E. Boyle, the executive director of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey and a longtime friend of Gov. George E.
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle rose to prominence in a tight network of Westchester
County political and business figures with connections to the
Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill, which he served as
chairman. That circle includes Pirro, the husband of District
Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro, and the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that in 1991, the chairman of the hospital _
it was Boyle, though he is not named in the document _ ``brought to
Albert J. Pirro Jr.'s attention the availability of a commercial
office building for sale in Croton, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, days after the hospital corporation
agreed to lease space in the Croton building, a corporation owned
largely by Pirro entered a contract to buy the building. Two months
later, the indictment says, about the same time as the building's
purchase was closed, Boyle acquired 45 percent of the corporation
that had bought the building.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that Boyle failed to tell the hospital's
board of his personal financial interest in the complex real estate
deal, ``in violation of his fiduciary duties.'' It also says that
Pirro's companies paid Boyle or companies owned by him $292,299,
and did not disclose those payments to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is not charged in the indictment. He would not talk with
reporters about the allegations, but he released a statement saying
that, contrary to the indictment, he ``had no equity interest'' in
the real estate deal between the hospital and Pirro. ``I believe my
conduct has been appropriate at all times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Levander, Boyle's lawyer, said some of the payments
made by Pirro's companies to Boyle were for a separate real estate
transaction, but he would not say what piece of property was
involved. He also would not say what the rest of the money was for,
or whether the hospital board was aware of Boyle's business
relationship with Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's board at the time included Pataki, then a state
assemblyman, and others, like Boyle, who would later serve in the
Pataki administration. Calls to several people who were members of
the hospital board at that time were not returned Wednesday. Aides
to Pataki said the real estate deal involving Boyle that the
indictment describes never went before the hospital board for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, a former concrete company owner and real estate
developer, has been close to Pataki since the early 1980s. Boyle
was his campaign treasurer in his races for State Senate in 1992
and for governor in 1994. He was also treasurer of the governor's
1994-95 inaugural and transition committees, which have been
criticized for concealing information about their finances. Boyle
and his companies have donated at least $5,850 to Pataki's
campaigns since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki served with Boyle on the hospital board from 1986 to
1992. In 1991, Boyle made a personal loan of $10,000 to Pataki. The
same year, Pataki borrowed $60,000 from Paul Guillaro, a real
estate developer who was a sometime partner of Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, refused to
discuss Boyle or his relationship with the governor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley hospital was, apparently, a tangle of
relationships. On one development project, hospital contracts went
to building companies, an architecture firm and a law firm that
were owned or partly owned by board members. When Pataki and his
future counsel as governor, Michael Finnegan, were lawyers in
private practice in Peekskill, both their firms represented Boyle
in real estate deals, and Finnegan later served on the hospital
board.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is widely credited with greatly improving the financial
condition of the Hudson Valley hospital. He still sits on its
board, but is no longer chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Pataki entrusted Boyle with the job of cleaning up the
Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, making him chief
executive of the center, which had been plagued by high costs and
mob ties. By most accounts, Boyle did very well there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the governor appointed him executive director of the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The same year, Pataki
named Boyle to the board of the Westchester County Medical Center,
which has had business ties to Pirro.

LIKE THE SUPERBOWL FOR HIGH SOCIETY 
CHEFS TO MAKE A P.S. PROUD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 BY CHARLES STRUM with NINA SIEGAL and C.J. SATTERWHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ``I haven't heard of people getting together to watch television
since `Brideshead Revisited,''' Anthony J. Drexel Biddle III said
the other day. He was referring to the two-part CBS movie ``Too
Rich: the Secret Life of Doris Duke,'' about the tobacco heiress.
</P>
<P>
   Biddle, whose father was once married to Miss Duke's first
cousin, said the only inaccuracy he had spotted in the first
episode, on Sunday, was that ``the real Duke Kahanamoku'' _ a
swimming champion and one of Miss Duke's lovers _ ``is about twice
as big as the actor. The guy is huge. You know, he became the
Sheriff of Honolulu.'' In Miss Duke's circle, at least, it was a
must-see.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Hallingby and her daughter Cornelia Ercklentz, a sales
associate at Bloomberg, saw the first segment at Mrs. Hallingby's
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed home especially to watch,'' Mrs. Hallingby said. ``I
would have taped it if I'd gone out.'' She said she especially
liked the actor Michael Nouri, who played Porfirio Rubirosa, Miss
Duke's second husband.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Meehan, long a presence on the New York social scene,
admitted: ``Actually I was on the phone, and got off to see the
last half. I didn't know Doris well, but I remember seeing her at
parties in New York, and she seemed perfectly normal. I think there
was a lot more to her life than what was portrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Duke died at age 80 in 1993, naming her butler as executor
as well as leaving him a small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had different stages, and granted the last part of her
life wasn't particularly happy,'' Mrs. Meehan said. ``Of course the
show was soap opera. But we're all suckers for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs to Make a P.S. Proud
</P>
<P>
   The paintings on the walls were by Jean Dubuffet and Milton
Avery, the five-course dinner, with a different wine complementing
each entree, was by Rocco Dispirito, the chef of Union Pacific, and
the table conversation lingered between the Hamptons and private
summer camp. But the theme of the $600- to $10,000-a-plate dinner
at the Central Park West home of Laurie Tisch Sussman was the
revitalization of the city's low-performing schools through arts
education.
</P>
<P>
   Over beef short rib with truffled taro root, Martha Rodriguez
Torrez, the principal of Public School 156 in the Brownsville
section of Brooklyn, described how the percentage of her students
reading at or above grade level was boosted to 40.9 percent from 17
percent with the help of arts programming financed by the Center
for Arts Education. Maxwell L. Anderson, the new director of the
Whitney Museum, looked on as Judith Rizzo, the Board of Education's
deputy chancellor for curriculum, said the $36 million provided by
the center over five years (jump-started by a $12 million donation
by the New York City Annenberg Challenge for Arts Education) has
been responsible for restoring arts to 800 of the city's 1,100
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nine benefit dinners for the center, taking place over three
nights this week, were prepared by some of the city's noted chefs,
like Jean-Michel Bergougnox of L'Absinthe and Bill Telepan of
Judson Grill, and held at the homes of such arts benefactors as
Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairwoman emeritus of the New York State
Council on the Arts, and Schuyler G. Chapin, commissioner of the
New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. The dinners raised
$170,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hart confessed that she learned everything she knows about
the arts by visiting museums and opera houses in Europe as a child,
because her mother ``wanted her to make a brilliant marriage.'' She
said she offered her home because, ``the arts have been so good to
me, they've made my life,'' adding, ``I've been so happy and I'd
like every child in the state of New York to have that same
experience.''

POND WILL BE FILLED FOR L.A. `SHOWDOWN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like two ships that crash in the night, the Los
Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers will meet at the Pond in
Anaheim tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who have gone from first place last season to
``Melrose Place'' this season, have lost three road games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have not recorded a victory in 331 days; their last
triumph was an 83-77 decision over Sacramento on April 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For tonight's, ahem, showdown _ which is to rivalries as Hyundai
is to Rolls-Royce _ a capacity crowd is expected in Anaheim, where
fans will take their last look at the Lakers before they come down
with a case of Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers simply would like to take one last look before
terminating their losing streak at nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go out and try to improve,'' said first-year
Clippers coach Chris Ford, the day after Tuesday's frustrating
94-89 loss to Golden State. ``We can't miss foul shots at the end
of games. We can't keep making the same defensive mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing to the Warriors, the Clippers managed to commit the
same unwitting acts of treason Ford mentioned while giving up a
four-point lead with less than three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Lamond Murray scored a season-high 30 points and
collected eight rebounds in loss No. 9, and sidekick Maurice Taylor
added 23 and 11, respectively. But Ford would like to see Taylor's
board performance become more the standard than the exception. The
second-year power forward pulled down 20 rebounds in a
double-overtime loss to Vancouver last week in Anaheim, then
grabbed only four in each of the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo has to continue to rebound,'' Ford said. ``He should be a
double-figure rebounder every game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More power to them: Rookie Brian Skinner, who had the lateral
meniscus ligament in his left knee repaired three weeks ago,
scrimmaged with the team during Wednesday's workout at the Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, a power forward from Baylor selected with the 22nd pick
in the 1998 NBA draft, is eligible to come off the injury list as
soon as his aerobic fitness matches his weight-room success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still needs conditioning,'' Ford said. ``And, judging from
the scrimmage, he forgot most of the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Talking a good game: Veteran guard Scott Brooks, who was
waived by the Clippers last Friday, will join rising play-by-play
star Michael Smith on tonight's and Friday's radio broadcasts on
1150-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks played for six NBA teams in his 10-year career. He became
available for radio thanks, in part, to a knee injury suffered
during an exhibition game against the Lakers last month.

LAURYN HILL WALKS AWAY AS BIG WINNER AT GRAMMYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Updates, rewrites throughout)  (rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though Grammy voters are well-known for their
erratic, unpredictable and often outlandish choices, there were no
surprises at this year's awards ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium.
The top popular music categories were overwhelmed by female
winners, including Celine Dion, Shania Twain, the Dixie Chicks,
Alanis Morissette, Madonna, Sheryl Crow and especially Lauryn Hill,
who gathered five Grammys, including best new artist and the
prestigious album of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill, the member of the rap group the Fugees, who released
her first solo album to rave reviews and millions of sales last
year, even beat herself. In the best rhythm-and-blues song and the
best female rhythm-and-blues vocal performance categories, her own
song telling women to respect themselves, ``Doo Wop (That Thing),''
won Grammys at the expense of Aretha Franklin's ``A Rose Is a
Rose,'' which was written by Ms. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about Lauryn Hill the day I heard that record,''
said Michael Greene, the president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammys, in an
interview before the show. ``I sweated bullets because I wondered
if the academy membership would get it. But they got it. They got
it big time.'' Ms. Hill received 10 Grammy nominations, more than
any other artist this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have called this year's Grammy celebration the year
of the woman, the awards show could also be called Madonna's
revenge. Despite a decade and a half of recording, she had only
previously received one award, for best long-form video in 1991.
Now, in her latest guise as a raven-haired spiritualist, Madonna,
who opened the show with a Japanese-flavored performance of
``Nothing Really Matters,'' has three more Grammys to her name:
best pop album, best short-form video and best dance recording.
</P>
<P>
   Among other women dominating this year's Grammys were the Dixie
Chicks, a new trio who pulled an upset by winning the best country
album award over Shania Twain as well as best country vocal
performance by a duo or group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what to expect with these things,'' Ms. Twain,
who has won two other awards so far, responded with wounded pride
backstage when asked about losing to the Dixie Chicks. ``I'm the
biggest seller.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapper Jay-Z learned Wednesday night that snubbing the
Grammys doesn't lose a musician any points. The gangsta rapper had
announced that he was boycotting the Grammys for overlooking
rappers and asked that his name be withdrawn from the running. He
was specifically upset with Grammy voters for not nominating his
fellow rapper DMX for best new artist and at the music industry in
general for paying more attention to violence in rap than his
forthcoming tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his ``Vol. II ... Hard Knock Life,'' won the award
for best rap album. True to his word, Jay-Z was not here to accept
the award.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a year of major changes for the music business, particularly
the sale of Polygram to Seagram and the industry's resistance the
distribution of music via the Internet, Sheryl Crow was the first
award-winner to acknowledge the upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   During her speech for best rock album (for ``The Globe
Sessions'') she delivered a eulogy for her record label, A&AMP;M, which
was shut down by Seagram, and the executives who lost their jobs
there.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners of top awards remained favorites this year,
particularly Celine Dion, who won the album of the year award in
1996. Her ``My Heart Will Go On,'' from the seemingly unsinkable
``Titanic'' soundtrack, won one of the top awards, Song of the
Year, which was presented to the songwriters James Horner and Will
Jennings. ``You all need to write me something, man,'' rapper and
actor Will Smith told them when presenting the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Heart Will Go On'' also won an award for best female pop
vocal performance. Eric Clapton, the big winner in 1993, won best
male pop vocal performance for ``My Father's Eyes'' and Alanis
Morissette, who swept up in 1996, won best rock song for
``Uninvited.'' However, one Grammy favorite, Tony Bennett, lost
this year: to Elmo of Sesame Street for best children's musical
album.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, previously neglected artists received long
overdue Grammys. In her acceptance speech for best traditional pop
vocal performance for her live at Carnegie Hall album, Patti Page
said that when her grandchildren asked what name to call her, ``I
said Grammy because I'll never get one. Now they have to call me
granny.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this ceremony, Ms. Page, whose career predates the
Grammys by 10 years, had never been nominated before. And Shirley
Horn, after six previous nominations, won her first Grammy for best
jazz vocal performance for ``I Remember Miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammy critics who've complained after watching Elvis Costello
get snubbed year after year were temporarily quelled. Costello
finally won a Grammy by collaborating with a four-time winner, Burt
Bacharach, on an album, a song from which (``I Still Have That
Other Girl'') won best pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Costello said that he hadn't given much credence to
the Grammy Award in the past, but maybe now he will. And Lou Reed,
another Grammy oversight, won his first one for best long-form
music video for ``American Masters: Rock-and-Roll Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Over half a century since its heyday, swing is officially pop
music again. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, led by the former member
of the rockabilly revivalists the Stray Cats, won best pop
instrumental performance for ``Sleepwalk'' and best pop vocal
performance by a duo or group for ``Jump Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   On and off stage, the Grammys provided further evidence of the
invasion of pocket electronics into the theater and concert world.
Not only did cell phones ring intermittently during the
performance, but in order to keep from forgetting anyone in his
list of thank yous, Herbie Hancock pulled out an electronic
organizer during his acceptance speech for best jazz instrumental
performance for ``Gershwin's World,'' an album that actually has
vocals.
</P>
<P>
   In the classical field, the conductor Pierre Boulez won, adding
to his 20 awards, for best opera recording (``Bluebeard's
Castle''), and best orchestral performance (``Mahler: Symphony No.
9''). And in a new category added this year, best classical
crossover album, an old Grammy hand, 12-time winner Yo-Yo Ma, won
with the conductor Jorge Calandrelli for their album of Astor
Piazzolla compositions, ``Soul of the Tango.''
</P>
<P>
   Recordings released between Oct. 1, 1997, and Sept. 30, 1998,
were eligible for an award. The winners were selected by the 10,000
voting members _ from musicians to producers to industry executives
to liner note writers _ of the recording academy.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department says that because it cannot
dispose of utilities' nuclear waste as it had promised, it will
take ownership of it and pay for temporary storage at the reactors.
The money would come from fees the utilities have been assessed for
a permanent repository, which will not be ready until at least
2010.
</P>
<P>
   The department has been collecting money from the utilities
since 1982 on the promise that it would take their nuclear waste by
January 1998. But it is unable to do so until it opens a permanent
repository at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, Nev. The anticipated
date for that opening is 2010, but so far the department has not
determined what standards such a storage site would have to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Some reactors already are running out of space in their spent
fuel storage pools, and others no longer sell power but cannot be
decommissioned because there is no place for the spent fuel. The
department is being sued for breach of contract by more than 20
utilities, which are seeking tens of billions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said Wednesday in a
telephone interview that he would propose in testimony before a
Senate committee on Thursday that the department ``take title'' to
the wastes it was scheduled to have received under the 1998
deadline. The wastes would stay where they now reside, in scores of
spent fuel pools and hundreds of storage casks, and the department
would pay the storage costs, in exchange for the utilities'
dropping their suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to address an immediate crisis,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary described his proposal as a starting point for
negotiations with the utilities, members of Congress who want the
federal government to establish a centralized temporary repository
and environmentalists, many of whom want the wastes to stay where
they are.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong sentiment in Congress for construction of an
above-ground, interim storage site, probably near Yucca Mountain,
but the Clinton administration has held off legislation by
threatening a veto. The administration's argument is that there is
no point in shipping thousands of tons of highly radioactive
material around the country before anyone knows for certain where
it will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's proposal seems unlikely to satisfy the utilities.
``The industry foremost is looking for movement of fuel,'' said
Scott Peterson, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a
trade association here. He said that several retired reactors could
have been converted to ``green fields'' for redevelopment if a
permanent storage site was in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event that there is not movement of fuel, the industry
is looking for compensation for continued storage on site, but
movement of fuel is the priority,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry previously has resisted any effort by the Energy
Department to use the waste fund to pay damages. The fund was
collected from utilities at the rate of a 10th of a cent per
kilowatt-hour made in reactors under contracts signed under the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. About $15 billion has been
raised, including interest on deposits, with about $6 billion
having been spent.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the fund is for development of a permanent
repository, or at least a centralized repository, not for expenses
at reactors around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement would offer immediate relief to the
utilities, in contrast to construction of an interim, above-ground
repository, which could not be licensed and put in service until
2004, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers the utilities the advantage of being an end to
their ownership of the wastes, perhaps enabling them to sell small
plots of land to the federal government for waste storage casks.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially important to utilities in Minnesota and
Wisconsin, which have limited the construction of casks, in effect
saying that if the waste problem is not solved, the reactors must
close. If the casks were federally owned the states could not limit
them.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide on a committee with jurisdiction over the
Energy Department, speaking on the condition that he not be further
identified, said Wednesday night that if there was no settlement,
the Court of Claims might award vast sums to utilities whose wastes
the department already was scheduled to have accepted, which could
drain the trust fund before the Yucca Mountain repository could be
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little more rational approach to the problem than a
random walk through the courts,'' he said. ``The Energy Department
can exercise some cost control over it, as opposed to people
getting checks from the court.''
</P>
<P>
   By contract, the department was supposed to accept 440 tons of
fuel in 1998, 661 tons this year, and 992 tons a year beginning in
2000.

<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ There were a few surprises in Southern
California on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several marquee golfers _ five of the top seven in the world, to
be exact _ won't be playing in today's second round of the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship at the La Costa Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, Ernie Els, Davis Love III, Colin Montgomerie and
Lee Westwood lost on the opening day, but they did walk away with
$25,000 for their one day of work.
</P>
<P>
   The winners, from Tiger Woods and David Duval to Fred Couples
and Nick Price, came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But there were upsets. And if nothing else, first-round results
in the $5 million match-play event proved that this really isn't
tennis and that the gap between Nos. 1 and 64 is perhaps even
narrower than the players thought. And they were convinced it was
no more than a sliver even before Wednesday's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you put the No. 64 next to a player and compare
it to a No. 1 next to another player, it kind of visually creates a
wider gap than there actually is,'' said Duval, who is No. 2 but
nudged No. 63 Stephen Leaney 2 and 1 to advance. ``A perfect
illustration is my match. I was 5 or 6 under par. And I still had a
tough match.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this type of format, you only have to beat six people to
win the golf tournament. But at the same time, you can very easily
get ousted.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Els, who was only three days removed from winning the
Nissan Open in Los Angeles. His match with Paul Azinger was one of
the few on the first day that made it to No. 18. Els responded with
a bogey when his drive missed the fairway, and he never recovered,
missing a 15-foot par putt from the back fringe and losing 1-down
to Azinger, who admitted he didn't exactly play a terrific round of
golf but caught Els on a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us played that great,'' Azinger said. ``Ernie's
probably suffering from some post-victory letdown. He wasn't that
sharp. Both of us were pretty sloppy. And even though I might not
have performed that great, it feels good to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, as the No. 1-ranked Woods said, is the beauty of match
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ebb and flow,'' he said. ``When a guy looks like he
has momentum, you have to take it away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a lot of ebbing and flowing at La Costa on the
first day of the first event in the World Golf Championship series.
</P>
<P>
   First, fans had to get used to hearing those five traditionally
unsaid words on the PGA Tour _ ``Pick it up; it's good.'' But it
wasn't long before they realized they weren't at a Ryder Cup,
because there actually were some Americans winning matches.
</P>
<P>
   Woods led the charge as he cruised to a 4-and-3 win over Nick
Faldo, never trailing in the match. Woods was asked whether he had
any compassion for Faldo, who has been struggling with every aspect
of his game for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No'' was Woods' short answer. He had no intention of letting a
beleaguered opponent off the mat.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive upset of the day probably belonged to Craig
Stadler, who knocked out Montgomerie 5 and 3, building a 4-up lead
after seven holes and never looking back. But Montgomerie, who
admitted he simply wasn't playing his best golf or anything close
to it, was fighting more than just Stadler, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie is one of golf's best players but also comes across
as a stern, gruff individual on the course. The smallish gallery
did not take to Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty didn't play that well,'' Stadler said. ``But there were
a couple times when the fans played a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``On No. 13, he missed a short putt, about six feet. And some
guy started clapping up in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, on the 15th, a guy yelled something like, `You got one
shot left,' which was not real sporting. In fact, I probably gave
him a longer, deeper glare than Monty did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Stadler did his part to keep Montgomerie in a
grouchy mood, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a little perturbed on No. 13 when I didn't give him a
putt,'' Stadler said. ``I was 5-up with six holes to play. I had
about an eight-footer, and he had a six-footer. I missed mine high,
about six inches. He gave it to me. He rolled his by about 3{,
almost four feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do is give it to him and then he
birdies the last five holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no love lost in match play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Montgomerie: ``He deserved to win. And he would have beaten
most people the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadler's romp helped give the foreign players a losing record
on day one of the match play. Non-Americans were 11-13 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans weren't immune to problems. O'Meara fell three
holes behind after just six holes. He ended up losing 4 and 2 to
Michael Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I countered every time he did something,'' Bradley said.
``Mark O'Meara was not Mark O'Meara today. He wasn't the Mark
O'Meara everyone knows.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of higher-seeded players who weren't
themselves. Of the 32 matches, 18 were won by the lower-seeded
player. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh seeds all were
losers.
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Meara, at No. 3 the highest-ranked player to lose: ``He
(Bradley) made no mistakes, and that's the key to match play.
Anyone _ any one of these guys _ can beat the other guy. That's
just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the losers headed home feeling roughly the same way
as Rocco Mediate, who was pummeled 5 and 3 by Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my butt kicked,'' Mediate said. ``That's about the size
of it.''

MURDER SUSPECT NAMED IN ATTACK ON HUSBAND'S LOVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DON HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. -- A month before the grisly murder of her
husband, Gladis Barreras Soto assaulted his mistress and threatened
that ``something bad'' would happen if their affair continued,
court documents showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of five crashed her car into the van of Maria C.
Ortega after seeing her husband's truck outside the woman's Oxnard
home in suburban Ventura County west of the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega sought a restraining order against Soto after the
incident and, as previously scheduled, was in court Wednesday, the
day after Soto was arrested on suspicion of shooting her husband,
Pedro Alba Barragan, in the head, then dismembering his body and
setting fire to his remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear for my safety,'' Ortega said in getting the restraining
order. ``She is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Court documents paint a disturbing portrait of Barragan and
Soto's 15-year marriage. He was an abusive womanizer, who
frequently used alcohol and cocaine. She was a victim of domestic
violence who, prosecutors say, retaliated during a Jan. 10 attack
on Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   Soto, 37, was charged with murder Wednesday in the slaying of
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   She had been charged with assault with a deadly weapon in
connection with the attack on Ortega and is scheduled to be
arraigned today on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   She remains jailed in lieu of $250,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ortega's request for a restraining order, Barragan
was at her home when he heard the alarm on his truck go off. When
he went outside, he saw his wife, who then got in her car and sped
past him. Moments later, Ortega returned home from an errand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gladis saw my van pull up, she took her car and crashed
it into mine,'' Ortega said in court records. ``She then backed up
and left.''
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, ``she cussed me out and called me a bunch
of horrible names,'' Ortega said in documents. ``She told me that I
had better stop seeing Pedro or something bad was going to happen
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortega did not return a phone call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday that Soto has told them Barragan had many
girlfriends and that he had physically and verbally abused Soto for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   Barragan, 35, pleaded no contest in 1996 to battering Soto and
was given three years' probation. In 1997, he was again arrested
for shoving his wife and yelling at her after a night of drinking.
He was sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating probation.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Barragan left his Ventura home around 7 p.m. Friday
and returned at 2 a.m. Saturday. After he fell asleep, Soto got a
small-caliber pistol and shot him in the head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   She then stuffed his body in a closet, where it remained
throughout the day. The couple's five children -- ages 6 to 11 --
were home at the time, but were unaware their father was dead,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 p.m. Saturday, Soto pulled the 5-foot-7-inch body from
the closet to the garage, where she used an electric saw to remove
his head and limbs, police said. Soto placed the head and limbs in
plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, she loaded the bags into her car, drove them
to a remote area near the Ventura River and the Ventura County
Fairgrounds, poured gasoline on them and set them ablaze, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A transient spotted the fire and called for help.
</P>
<P>
   Using fingerprint records, authorities identified the body and
contacted Soto, who was arrested Tuesday morning. The couple's
children were placed in protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   While serving a search warrant, detectives found Barragan's
torso, along with a handgun and an electric table saw they believe
was used to dismember the body.
