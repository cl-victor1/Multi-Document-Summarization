TURNER TAKING BEST SHOT FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ You look at the numbers and you say, ``What's
the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   You look at his form and you say, ``Now I get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Turner's name was not called in June's draft, mainly for
one reason: Teams worried about his ability to make outside shots.
Turner did shoot 49 percent over four years (and an NCAA-record 151
games) at Kentucky, but most of that was because of shots within 15
feet.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, that form. Bill Walton and Jamaal Wilkes both had nasty
looking shots, but John Wooden never did a thing with them because
the ball went in more often than not. Turner is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to look at,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are working with Turner to improve his form and his
range. Assistant coach Andy Enfield, whose specialty is shooting,
is basically starting from scratch with Turner, who in college
actually shot the ball from the left side of his head. (He's a
righthander.) That won't do here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's form was probably the most unusual I've seen,'' said
the ever-diplomatic Enfield. ``With a guy like Wayne, you take what
he has. He'll never have perfect form, but you've got to adjust it
to where he can make shots. It is starting over in that he'll have
a completely new shooting form when he's done. But there are small
adjustments every week he can make to get closer to that form.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner has heard this before. ``I know. It's my form,'' he said
with a shrug. ``I had a manager work with me at Kentucky. I'm going
to shoot in my range while I work on my form. As the year goes on,
I'll move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In college, Turner was, according to Pitino, a lock from 15 feet
and in, especially off the dribble. Turner also knew where not to
shoot from, which is why he maintained a high percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had players whose forte is not long-range shooting and
all they tried to do was prove people wrong and take long-range
shots,'' Pitino said. ``This young man, he knows his range is 15
feet. So he gets to 15 feet. It's almost like Oscar Robertson.
Oscar Robertson would never shoot 3s. He'd get to where he wanted
to have his shot. That's what Wayne Turner does. In the interim,
what we're trying to do is get him to 17 feet. And if he gets to
17, 18 feet, he keeps everyone else honest. And with everything
else he does, he's a wonderful point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the ultimate payoff. Good-shooting point guards are rare
in the NBA and Turner does all the other point-guard stuff quite
well. He is a good penetrator, he gets the ball to the right
people, and, above all, he is a relentless defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main reason I'm here,'' Turner said. ``My fire is
still on defense. I believe in getting in your face. And defense
like that, most of the time, wears guys down and brings out the
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a gamer and a winner at Kentucky. He has two NCAA
title rings and appeared in three straight championship games. He
played in 21 NCAA tournament games, third most in history. He left
Kentucky as the school's all-time leader in steals. None of that,
however, made him appealing to the NBA, which kept seeing that form
and wondering how he ever could survive.
</P>
<P>
   No one's surprised he ended up in Boston. He's a native
(although that's not always a good thing). He knows Pitino and vice
versa. He even knows some of his teammates _ he played a year at
Kentucky with Antoine Walker and was in the same high school class
(read: AAU camp buddy) as Paul Pierce. He knows all about Boston
roads and Boston drivers.
</P>
<P>
   So there wasn't any trouble adjusting to the city. The big
adjustment is in the gym, daily. It's a monumental makeover, but
one everyone believes is worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you change like that, as big a change as he has made, it
will take some time,'' Enfield said. ``It's really up to him how
long that will take, whether it's a few months or a year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell's anticipated arrival Sunday did not materialize.
Pitino said Russell's red-eye flight was late and everything was
moved back to Monday, when Russell will work with the big men.
Pitino said he didn't know how many times Russell would stop by to
work with the team. ``It's up to him. Anytime we can get him, we'd
love to have him,'' Pitino said. ``It's not like the players don't
know what Bill Russell has done.'' However, the coach said Russell
primarily would be involved in the marketing end and he added he
hoped others, like Dave Cowens, would be interested in doing the
same . . . Dana Barros and Pervis Ellison both were back at
practice. Pitino has decided to end the two-a-days because everyone
is in shape. ``Normally in two-a-days, one of those is for
conditioning,'' he said. ``But we're in great shape.'' . . . Pitino
on new bruiser Danny Fortson: ``I think he'll be in foul trouble
(with the new rules). I think Vitaly Potapenko will be, too. But we
have five legitimate frontcourt players this year so we can
withstand foul trouble.'' Those five would be Fortson, Potapenko,
Walker, Tony Battie, and Ellison.

WIN WAS AS EASY AS 1-2-3 FOR CHIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ They knew what they wanted to do. It just
took them 30 minutes to get around to doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game against the Patriots, Kansas City coach
Gunther Cunningham demanded three things from his team.
</P>
<P>
   1) Run the ball successfully.
</P>
<P>
   2) Control the clock.
</P>
<P>
   3) Knock Drew Bledsoe down consistently.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over, the Patriots left Arrowhead Stadium no
longer undefeated. The Chiefs had used their formula _ and a large
dose of luck when Adam Vinatieri's winning field goal attempt
bounced off the right upright with four seconds to play _ to claim
a 16-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe took a beating, climbing off the deck at least 16 times,
to rally his team to the verge of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   From the 29th minute of the game until the 55th, Bledsoe went
back to pass 14 times and had two completions for 28 yards. The
beating he took in that time took its toll. It was only when the
Chiefs' defense backed off in the final five minutes that he was
able to get it going.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Chiefs had put themselves in position to win by
controlling the clock for most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played our game in the second half,'' said Chiefs general
manager Carl Peterson. ``We did what we do well. We ran the ball.
We put Bledsoe on the ground. In the first half we were fancy, and
we are not fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   This should have been a great win for the Patriots. Somehow,
after being pushed around for most of the second half, they nearly
won it, against large odds.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs are a tough team at Arrowhead. They orchestrate the
crowd of 78,000 well in the league's noisiest outdoor stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Patriots had six penalties and three
turnovers, yet they led, 7-3, at intermission. It should have been
more because Bledsoe missed Shawn Jefferson, who was wide open, on
a pass in the second period that would have put the Patriots ahead,
14-3, and made the Chiefs throw the ball to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   However, after gaining only 32 yards rushing in the first half,
the Chiefs pounded away on the ground in the third period. Their
big adjustment was to line up in a double tight end formation that
allowed them to overpower the Patriots along the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, they rushed for 108 yards in the final 30
minutes. This also enabled them to control the clock for 12:26 in
the third. Overall, Kansas City had the ball for 35:37, the most
for a Patriots' opponent this season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Patriots defensive line coach Ray Hamilton
challenged his players to stop the run. They couldn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs appeared to be putting the game away until they
started to back off of Bledsoe in the final four minutes. Then he
torched them for a touchdown and had New England set up for a
relatively easy field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   He had taken a beating, but kept on competing.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to stop the Chiefs from getting a good pass rush in
Arrowhead. The noise makes it difficult for visiting offensive
linemen to hear the snap count. Patriots guard Heath Irwin jumped
two times in the first three plays. The Patriots were called five
times in the game for false starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs brought the heat all day. But Bledsoe held the ball
until the last instant on many pass plays, waiting for receivers to
come open, and paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the game, the Patriots outschemed the Chiefs, once
using a no-huddle offense, and Bledsoe still didn't have time to
get the pass away to an uncovered receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern for the Patriots after the game was their
run defense. Kansas City has a good offensive line and power backs,
but not much speed. The Patriots tackled poorly in the second half,
as bruising backs Bam Morris and Donnell Bennett broke tackles with
regularity.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots couldn't get the ball. And when they did, they made
more mistakes on offense (two fumbles, two interceptions) than they
did in the four previous games put together.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City started beating up the Patriots on both sides of the
ball in the second half. As the Chiefs rallied, the crowd got back
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they couldn't shake Bledsoe. Trailing by 9 points with 4:52
to play, he connected on 6 of 8 passes for 77 yards and an 8-yard
touchdown pass to Jefferson. Bledsoe got the ball back again with
30 seconds to play and moved his team 53 yards in 26 seconds
against one of the league's best defensive teams. But it wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   After the game Cunningham told Bledsoe, ``You're as tough as
everybody said you were.'' Later, Cunningham said, ``That was one
hell of a performance. We beat the hell out of him today and he
kept getting up and making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots lost, but they proved they could compete in one of
the most hostile environments in the league and still win. Even if
they lost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is Anne Stephenson's ``New &AMP; Notable'' column forthe week
of Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   ``PHYSIOGNOMY: THE MARK SELIGER PHOTOGRAPHS'' &QL; 
(Bulfinch, $75) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have not lived until you've seen Brad Pitt in an evening
gown and goggles. Better yet, look at Drew Barrymore dancing nearly
naked with a sumo wrestler. Or Aerosmith's Steven Tyler with his
lips spread just as wide as they will go (that is to say shockingly
wide _ Tyler can look like a contortionist just by opening his
mouth). Or Keith Richards playing dominoes. Or Howard Stern wearing
a crown of thorns (think about it). On the cover _ the stunned
look, we assume, is from the makeup session _ is Jerry Seinfeld as
the Tin Man. Just inside is a perplexed-looking Tom Hanks
scratching his brow with ape hands. Trust us _ you will look at
this picture for a long, long time. In fact, if you pull this book
out in public, a crowd will gather _ it's that big a draw. Maybe
it's the celebrity factor. Maybe it's Seliger's unpredictable way
with his subjects, who seem willing to do the oddest things at his
request. As chief photographer for ``Rolling Stone,'' he has put
famous faces in the most surreal and unusual circumstances. The
photos go largely unexplained, and we found that to be irritating.
Also, the subjects remain unidentified until the very back of the
book, which makes for some confusion because it's really hard to
tell who some of them are. But those are quibbles. The book is
pricey but fun. With an introduction by Eric Bogosian. &QL; 
``SHE SAID YES'' &QL; 
By Misty Bernall (Plough, $17) &QL; 
It's at issue whether 17-year-old Cassie Bernall said anything at
all before she was shot to death in April at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo. Did Dylan Klebold ask her whether she believed
in God and did she say yes before he pulled the trigger? Her
parents choose to believe she did despite reports to the contrary,
and her mother has now written this book _ proof that grieving
people need to impart some meaning to the death of a child and that
the attention of strangers is oddly comforting. Beyond religious
fervor and parental sorrow, however, Misty Bernall tells another
important story. Three years ago, Cassie was a difficult
ninth-grader whose conversations with friends touched on drugs,
sex, self-mutilation and violence toward teachers and parents.
Misty discovered this when she read letters Cassie had written to a
friend, whereupon the stunned Bernalls did what Misty calls ``the
hardest thing you can ever do as parents: to put your foot down and
say, `This stops right here.' '' They immediately put Cassie into
another school, regularly searched her room, tapped the phone and
forbade her to see her old friends even though they knew it might
backfire and drive Cassie further away. When Cassie's friends
vandalized their house, they moved to another neighborhood to keep
her away from them. Cassie eventually got better, but it's
impossible to read about this troubled girl at war with her
desperate parents and not think of the boys who later murdered her.
What Cassie Bernall said that day is not as important as what two
other parents wrote to the Bernalls a month later: ``We will never
understand why this tragedy happened,'' Sue and Tom Klebold said,
``or what we might have done to prevent it. We apologize for the
role our son had in your Cassie's death. We never saw anger or
hatred in Dylan until the last moments of his life when we watched
in helpless horror with the rest of the world. . . . May God bring
peace and understanding to all of our wounded hearts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WHAT IF?'' &QL; 
Edited by Robert Cowley (Putnam, $27.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What if, in the summer of 1941, Adolph Hitler had made his major
attack not into Soviet Russia but into Syria and Lebanon _ would he
then have won a strategic position that could have brought him
eventual victory? Or what if, early in his invasion of the Persian
empire, the young King Alexander had been dealt a second blow with
an ax (the first had damaged Alexander's helmet and left him
disoriented and unable to defend himself) by a Persian noble named
Spithridates? What if Alexander's bodyguard had not speared
Spithridates before he could strike again and destroy Alexander's
chance of becoming ``great''? If you feel your blood pounding, the
goose bumps rising, your heart soaring with the thrill of it . . .
then you must be a historian. If you dozed off before the first
question mark, you are a civilian and should refrain from looking
at this book lest you asphyxiate on the futility of it all. This is
an expansion of the the 10th anniversary issue of ``MHQ: The
Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' in which the editor asked
historians to write about the most important ``might-have-beens''
of military history. They had so much fun that many came back for
more. Contributors include John Keegan (who explores the
aforementioned Hitler scenario), David McCullough, Stephen E.
Ambrose and James M. McPherson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LONG PROGRAM'' &QL; 
By Peggy Fleming (Pocket, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Figure-skating champion Peggy Fleming is too nice to write a
book. She didn't get angry at her son when his girlfriend turned up
pregnant. She doesn't blame her mother for being a control freak.
She has been married to the same man for a million years. She went
into a depression during her recent treatment for breast cancer,
but that was caused by a drug _ she stopped taking it, and her
sadness disappeared. We ask you: Where's the dirt? Where's the
trouble? The answer is that there is none. Fleming is as nice as
she appears to be and then some (she calls Nancy Kerrigan ``a very
ungracious loser'' for her behavior after Oksana Baiul beat her in
the 1994 Olympics _ for Fleming, that's like hurling obscenities).
This memoir, which covers her career and personal life, is not
exactly scintillating reading, but Fleming is so likable that we
decline to say more. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service      
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Donna Brazile, who was just named Al Gore's new
campaign manager, did not supply a terse, ``that was a long time
ago, in another country'' response when asked about the night she
stepped down from another presidential campaign, Michael Dukakis',
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She had agreed to resign after it had hit the news wires that
she had prodded reporters, with some way-out-of-school comments, to
check out rumors about Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, she called her mother in Louisiana and told her
that it looked like the two of them would be spending lots of time
together, making gumbo and sitting on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Jean,' _ I called my mom Jean _ `I got fired.' I
said, `I called the vice president a racist, a liar and a
philanderer.' '' (In fact, her comments had been limited to that
third thing she mentioned.) ``And she said, `Is that all?' But I
thought I'd failed my mother,'' Ms. Brazile said, looking for a
split second as though she might cry. ``I've tried never to bring
dishonor to my family and that was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   When her mother, a domestic worker with no health insurance,
died several weeks later in the same New Orleans charity hospital
where Ms. Brazile and her eight siblings were born, Ms. Brazile
said she used her last paycheck from the Dukakis campaign to bury
her. Grieving and ashamed, she lost 40 pounds and, as a Roman
Catholic, she said, ``I did penance. That's what I called it and
that's what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, she lived in a Washington homeless shelter
while working for Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   She recovered, though, became chief of staff for Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the District of Columbia delegate, and today suffers no
obvious lack of confidence in her abilities.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Ms. Brazile is not the sort of person you might meet at a
party and then not remember when you run into her again in an
airport nine years later. When Matt Drudge, publisher of The Drudge
Report, the gossipy Web site, recently referred to her as a ``smear
queen,'' she remarked, ``Well, he got the queen part right. I am a
diva.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which might explain why Ms. Brazile seemed so genuinely
unfazed by the problems facing Al Gore's presidential campaign. She
knows about coming back.
</P>
<P>
   And if her candidate's bio was perhaps a little thin in the
overcoming adversity department, hers was full to bursting. Her
father, she noted, was wounded in the Korean War, run over by an
18-wheeler, had his back broken when he was hit by a crane, and
after suffering a heart attack on a bus, got off and checked
himself into a hospital. Yet he was still around to remark of her
recent promotion: ``Gift from God, Donna, but also another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kenner, La., outside New Orleans and ``across two train
tracks, that's how poor we were,'' just a block from the
Mississippi River, Ms. Brazile said she grew up praying hurricanes
away, because her family didn't have the money for a new roof.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lionel, worked mostly as a janitor, usually holding
more than one job, and her mother was up every morning early enough
to do her six daughters' hair before she had to leave to go clean
house.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Ms. Brazile herself rose at 5:30 a.m. to read the
newspaper to her grandmother, who she said ``gave me a thirst for
knowledge.'' While she was at it, she clipped coupons.
</P>
<P>
   And at a young age, got interested in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom used to call me Nosy Nancy, always sticking my nose
into grown folks' business.'' When she was 9, she heard that a City
Council candidate had promised to pave their roads, improve their
schools and _ this is important _ get a playground built in their
neighborhood, so she became a junior volunteer in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I organized all the kids, and told them that if he won, we'd
get a playground. Which we did. So that was my first job in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Louisiana State University, she was hired
by Coretta Scott King to help organize a 20th-anniversary
reenactment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she worked for the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who she said
taught her to make a proper entrance by arriving late, and Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., to whom she pledged eternal gratitude
because ``he asked me what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   As she prepares to turn 40, this was supposed to be the year
that Ms. Brazile also got a personal life. ``I was going to buy
myself a Jeep, have a relationship that lasted more than two weeks
_ usually it's two weeks and you bore the hell out of me _ and lose
weight. I had it all in my diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, she heard that the vice president would be
dropping by headquarters to address the troops, and Ms. Brazile
decided to make one of her patented entrances by arriving late.
Stepping off the elevator, the first thing she heard was a gaggle
of colleagues yelling, ``Donna! Donna! And I'm like, `Oooooh,
drama!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wanted to see her privately, and assuming she was about to
be fired, Ms. Brazile was already planning a vacation. ``When
you've already been fired once, the thrill is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore elevated her to campaign manager from political
director and announced a shake-up that included relocating his
entire campaign to Nashville from Washington. She called a
subsequent briefing on the state of the campaign ``a tour of
Goreworld that made me lose my appetite; my lunch is in the trash
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she was taking the job because she believed that Al
Gore was the only candidate who really cared about making life
better for Americans left behind by the bull market, uninsured
domestic workers like her mother. Having grown up poor and on a
budget, Ms. Brazile said, will make cutting campaign spending no
big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, called her the best
grass-roots organizer around and if it was a shake-up that Gore
wanted, then Ms. Brazile seems well suited.

BRUINS HOPE TO STOP SLIDE AGAINST AVALANCHE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's probably fitting that a team with the name
Avalanche is at the FleetCenter Monday as the Bruins attempt to
stop a four-game slide that has produced just one point this
season, Saturday's 1-1 tie against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a lot better, I promise you,'' said Boston captain
Ray Bourque at Sunday's open practice at the FleetCenter where he
thanked a gathering of season ticket-holders and Corner Club
members for their support.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque and his teammates could take a big step toward keeping
that promise by improving their scoring (five total goals),
specifically on a power play that has gone 2 for 18 (including 0
for 6 against the Flyers).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of coaches are scratching their heads about their power
plays at this time of year,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns. Indeed,
after Saturday's games, the Bruins ranked 18th in power-play
conversion percentage. ``We had some real good chances against the
Flyers. Sammy (Sergei Samsonov) hit a post there one time. And that
makes a difference between talking about it and not talking about
it. It's that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just something where there's a magic solution you put
out there and it works. You have to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns had his troops working at it Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time,'' he said. ``You don't want to
be too pretty. Sometimes, you just have to simplify it. Get the
shot on net and battle it out is sometimes the best way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   New Bruin Dave Andreychuk, the veteran left wing and career
533-goal man, along with Bourque, have been the team's power-play
scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you want to play with regular linemates as much as
you can, and that was hard to do in preseason when we had a few
injuries,'' said Andreychuk. ``But I feel pretty comfortable here.
Sure, power plays are a big part of the game. There are a lot of
penalties being called and we have to get back to basics on our
power play.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk said the team has to generate speed through the
neutral zone. ``That's where it all starts,'' he said. ``I thought
at times we've had some good attacks, but I think at times we've
just been a little too fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your power play is struggling, the best thing to do is
just try to get some shots on goal. That's what we've got to go
back to. When Ray and Kyle McLaren get the puck on net, I've got to
be in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the talent on the power play. We just have to start to
work together a little bit more. Jason Allison was out most of
training camp (with an injured wrist) and we really didn't have
much time to practice it, and you have to practice the power play
as five guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns also is telling his team not to dwell on the slow start.
He pointed out Sunday that perennial power Colorado was 0-4 out of
the gate last season before getting on track.
</P>
<P>
   Burns reported defenseman Hal Gill, stunned by an accidental
John Grahame stick to the forehead in Saturday's game, was feeling
a little better but would be evaluated before game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a good challenge for us,'' said Burns. ``Colorado
is a good team, a top NHL contending team.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he believed the Bruins improved a bit in their 4-3
loss Thursday night to Ottawa, a game in which they squandered a
3-1 lead, ``but there are still some guys who have to be acclimated
more into our club, guys who don't have a lot of experience when it
comes to the way we play. I think the guys are OK. Everybody's
working hard to get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we have to be more confident with the puck. We
started out strong again against the Flyers (scoring their only
goal 46 seconds after the opening faceoff). We have a lot of
confidence, but then we seem to wake the other team up and then we
seem to change our ways a little bit. We have to adjust to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One way, said Burns, is for the Bruins to get a little meaner.
``Sometimes putting the puck in behind their defense and going down
and running somebody over gets you into games,'' said the coach,
taking a page out of the ``Cam Neely How to Strike Fear Into an
Opponent'' Primer. ``We saw a little bit more of that in the first
period (Saturday night), but now we have to see it consistently
over 60 minutes.''

BIOSPHERE: DESERT GREENHOUSE RISES FROM `ECO-CULT' TO RESEARCH
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORACLE, Ariz. _ It's been a long, strange trip _ from desert
``eco-cult'' to reputable research center.
</P>
<P>
   But in eight years, the massive glass-and-steel pyramid and
eggshell-like buildings of Biosphere 2 have emerged as a genuine
educational and scientific proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very reputable scientist, and I endorse 100 percent
what's going on out there,'' said Wally Broecker, a geochemist at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Broecker has been a driving force behind Columbia's involvement
in Biosphere 2 ever since he was tapped in 1991 to stem the loss of
oxygen inside the once-hermetically sealed structure.
</P>
<P>
   That was nine months into the first experiment, run by the
controversial and now-defunct Space Biosphere Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Four men and four women, known as Biospherians, were cloistered
in the $200 million facility to determine whether they could live
solely off the structure's man-made ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Among the goals was to determine whether Space Biosphere
Ventures ultimately could colonize the moon or even a distant
planet, ``which I thought rather bizarre,'' Broecker said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``You wouldn't transport something the size of the
biosphere to the moon. You size up the weight and forget it; it's
too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, traditional agriculture used inside Biosphere 2
would never work outside the Earth's atmosphere, Broecker said.
Instead, hydroponically grown crops would have been the best hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Broecker disputes reports that Biosphere managers ``were
cheating'' when they pumped oxygen into the vacuum enclosed
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``To their credit, it was extremely well engineered,'' Broecker
said. ``Despite media reports, they were not cheating. They were
too directed. They sacrificed those eight (people) in there to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Biospherians also were charged with conducting experiments
and coping with a ``Gilligan's Island'' existence, marooned inside
the massive structure in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were being starved for oxygen, and they had a lot of
things to do in there,'' Broecker continued. ``Plus, one group of
four didn't get along with the other group of four. They were
skinny, their faces were pocked, they looked unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations also surfaced in published reports that the
Biospherians faced further duress at the hands of Space Biospheres
Ventures co-founder John Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused Allen of running a cult in which he ruled by
fear and intimidation. Allen vehemently denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But they persist even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a religious cult, but an eco-cult,'' Broecker said.
</P>
<P>
   An unpaid consultant, Broecker tried to convince Space Biosphere
Ventures to rethink its experiments. In 1994, halfway through the
living experiment with a second group of Biospherians, the
project's financial backer, Texas billionaire Edward Bass, pulled
the plug entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bass' financial people decided to give the cult the
heave-ho, and it was a cult . . . they then put the Biosphere in
the hands of a management company,'' Broecker recalled. That firm,
he added, spent 1{ years trying to stabilize it and turn it over to
more stable leadership. &QL; 
TAKES OVER FACILITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Columbia came in.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, which formed a science partnership with Biosphere 2 in
1994, expanded its role by taking over the facility two years
later, turning it into a research and teaching facility.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover added a much-need air of legitimacy to Biosphere 2.
</P>
<P>
   Guanghui Lin, an associate scientist who joined Biosphere 2 in
1996, recalled when he submitted his first research paper to a
peer-reviewed scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came back to me like it wasn't worthy research because it
was from Biosphere 2,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent papers were met with far less resistance, and
were soon published in such journals as ``Oecologia and
Biodiversity and Allelopathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's crowning achievement came earlier this year with
the publication of research on how increases in carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is hurting the ocean's coral reefs. The findings
were published in ``Science,'' one of the top scientific journals
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a very nice study there, which is absolutely
scientifically valid,'' said Steven Wofsy, an atmospheric scientist
at Harvard University. ``They didn't answer all the questions, but
you never do in science.'' &QL; 
CLIMATE ZONES STUDIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the research being conducted at the Biosphere 2 is being
done in one of three biomes, or climate zones: an ocean, a rain
forest and a managed forest.
</P>
<P>
   Wofsy, who studies global change, said Biosphere 2 is unique in
its ability to run studies to answer questions, such as what the
ecosystem might look like in 50 or 100 years with the increasing
buildup of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could say you could legitimately criticize it (the
coral reef study) by saying that's just a big pot of water with a
wave machine,'' he said. ``But that will be true with any
environmental study.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the ecosystems in Biosphere 2 is designed to replicate
the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these systems are perfect analogs to the outside
world,'' John Adams of Biosphere 2 said.
</P>
<P>
   But the artificial nature of the glass-dome structure is what
makes the Biosphere 2 a giant lab that allows researchers to tinker
with various aspects of the environment and measure the results
more precisely than in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's valid,'' Wofsy said, ``and in some respects, it's
an elegant place to do these experiments.'' &QL;

`DOUBLE JEOPARDY' BEATS `RANDOM HEARTS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Revenge edged out romance at the nation's
multiplexes as ``Double Jeopardy'' topped ``Random Hearts'' for the
top box office slot with an estimated $13.6 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,913
theaters during a healthy Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeopardy,'' starring Ashley Judd as a wife framed for her
husband's faked murder, racked up its third consecutive victory as
it lost only 20 &UR;  &LR; percent from the previous weekend. The Paramount
release has grossed $65.8 &UR;  &LR; million in 17 days and could hit
$100 &UR;  &LR; million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film is continuing to play very well throughout the
country,'' industry tracker Arthur Rockwell said. ``It's really
connected with Middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing popularity of ``Double Jeopardy'' was a key in
keeping Sony's ``Random Hearts'' out of first place, where many
trackers expected it to open based on the appeal of leading man
Harrison Ford. ``Hearts,'' which also stars Kristin Scott Thomas,
took in $13.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,697 theaters as it debuted amid reviews
that were mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Sony reported the film played well in upscale markets in large
cities, including Los Angeles, and drew a predominantly adult
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening for `Random Hearts' is not too shabby, but Ford's
core audience is action fans, and men were just not interested in
seeing him like this,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the
Reel Source forecasting service. ``It also had to compete for the
date crowd with `Double Jeopardy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said ``Random Hearts,'' in which the stars discover
their dead spouses were having an affair before dying in a plane
crash, has a somewhat limited audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie feels almost like it's from a different era,'' he
added. ``It goes to prove audiences do care about the material and
not just the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' second weekend of ``Three Kings'' came in third
with $11.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,942 theaters as the well-reviewed Gulf War
drama lost only 25 &UR;  &LR; percent from its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Another critical favorite, ``American Beauty,'' followed in
fourth with $9.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,226 theaters as DreamWorks added 520
locations as it continued to maneuver the offbeat comedy as a
potential Academy Awards contender.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution chief Jim Tharp said the studio has no plans to
expand ``Beauty'' further for now, and Bucksbaum predicted the
film, which has nearly $31 &UR;  &LR; million overall, could play well into
next year and hit the $85 &UR;  &LR; million mark. ``I think they're keeping
the number of theaters low right now so the movie will stay fresh
in the minds of Academy voters,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's opening of ``Superstar,'' the latest in the long
line of ``Saturday Night Live'' spin-offs, posted respectable
returns in fifth with $9 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,943. The project, with Molly
Shannon playing her Mary Katherine Gallagher character, should
quickly move into the black since it cost a reported $14 &UR;  &LR; million
to make, a bargain-basement price.
</P>
<P>
   With five films taking in at least $9 &UR;  &LR; million, the overall box
office continued its impressive fall-season performance as it hit
$90 &UR;  &LR; million, up 20 &UR;  &LR; percent over the same weekend last year. The
year-to-date total has gone past $5.6 &UR;  &LR; billion and leads the same
period of 1998 by 8 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of solid holdovers took the sixth and seventh spots with
Disney's 10th weekend of ``The Sixth Sense'' grossing $5.9 &UR;  &LR; million
at 2,784 theaters and Sony's fourth weekend of ``Blue Streak'' with
$5.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,591. ``Sense'' has grossed $242.5 &UR;  &LR; million to
replace ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' as the 15th highest domestic
grosser of all time, and ``Blue Streak'' has hit $55 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were 20th Century Fox's second weekend
of ``Drive Me Crazy'' with $3.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,234 theaters as the
romantic comedy dropped 44 &UR;  &LR; percent, followed by Sony's second
weekend of ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' with
$2.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,210 sites and Universal's fourth weekend of
``For Love of the Game'' with $2.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,414 locations.
Disney's second weekend of ``Mystery, Alaska'' nearly vanished in
11th with $1.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,704 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of art-house launches for well-reviewed dramas generated
strong returns, with Artisan's ``The Limey,'' starring Terrence
Stamp and Peter Fonda, earning $171,900 at 17 theaters and Fox
Searchlight's ``Boys Don't Cry'' with $66,000 at two sites. But
Miramax's expanded run of ``Happy, Texas'' was less impressive with
$160,000 at 39 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Business should remain at a solid pace during the upcoming
weekend with a pair of high-profile dramas opening _ Fox's ``Fight
Club'' with Brad Pitt and Universal's ``The Story of Us'' with
Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer. Bucksbaum predicted ``Fight
Club'' will easily win because of its strong appeal to young adults
and teen-agers and the memorable promotional icon of a ``Fight
Club'' bar of soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox has done a brilliant job of marketing,'' he noted. ``Women
want to see `Fight Club' because of Brad Pitt, and men want to see
it because of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Final results for the Friday-Sunday period will be released
today.

POOR PLAY FINALLY COST PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Your parents can tell you about the
consequences of your actions all they want, but you have to burn
your fingers in the flame at least once to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Your friends can tell you about the consequences of your actions
all they want, but you have to have your heart broken at least once
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell yourself about the consequences of your actions all
you want, but you have to end up in the woodshed at least once to
understand what the truth about consequences really is.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Patriots learned the truth. They got their fingers
singed. They got their hearts broken. They got taken to a woodshed
known as Arrowhead Stadium. Worst of all, they got themselves beat.
</P>
<P>
   They could have defeated the Kansas City Chiefs with a
late-game, 32-yard field goal Sunday but they didn't, losing a
game, 16-14, that they really never should have been in because
they persisted in the same erratic behavior that had dogged them
through a 4-0 September.
</P>
<P>
   For a month,the Patriots talked of how they had failed to play
up to their potential in victories over the wounded New York Jets,
inexperienced Indianapolis Colts, and just plain lousy New York
Giants and Cleveland Browns. They said, quite rightly, that they
knew they couldn't keep making these mistakes, missing these
opportunities and still winning these games at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday they learned they were right.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the snap wasn't quite right and the hold wasn't quite
right and so the kick wasn't quite right. It hit the right upright
and thus the Patriots lost on a glorious fall day when they turned
the ball over four times, committed six false starts, had their
quarterback sacked three times, and couldn't stop a running team
from doing what it wanted to do in the second half, which was grind
the clock to dust by doing the same to the Patriots' defensive
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned our lesson today,'' said defensive end Willie
McGinest after Adam Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal with four
seconds to play slammed into the top of the right upright and fell
to the ground the same way his team had.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come into a hostile environment against a good team
and commit penalties and turn the ball over and not force turnovers
and still win. Good teams take advantage of that. We shot ourselves
in the foot too many times to win this time. It was all our fault.
Every one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was and so they lost. Lost as they secretly knew they would
if they continued to ignore the thin red, white, and blue line
they'd been walking week after undefeated week. Walking it until
they tripped over it because they tempted football fate one time
too many.
</P>
<P>
   They relied on Drew Bledsoe's magic, their own resilience, and
Vinatieri's reliability one time too often. So they are undefeated
no longer, victims of Vinatieri's foot, the Chiefs' legs, and their
own hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to them,'' safety Lawyer Milloy said. ``We held
them in the first half and it seemed like we got satisfied with
that. We should have jumped on them, but instead we made it hard on
ourselves, and this time it didn't work out for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying we were the worst 4-0 team in sports but we
were very, very confident. We still are. Even with all our mistakes
we still had a chance to win with nine seconds left, but we'd been
saying this would get us if we kept playing like this and it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we didn't know we'd been beating ourselves and
then pulling the games out at the end. This time we bit ourselves
in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   They did that by fumbling four times and throwing an
interception in the first half, thereby blowing an opportunity to
take control of the game away from a running team able to gain only
32 yards on the ground in the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They did it by letting an opponent linger too long this time,
linger until it took control of the game instead in the second half
by knocking New England's defense off the ball and Bledsoe on his
back before finally ramming it down the Patriots' throats. Although
the Chiefs would turn all that effort into only a 13-7 lead after
three quarters, they had controlled the ball for 12:26, leaving the
Patriots with only 2:34 to play offense.
</P>
<P>
   Then New England opened the fourth quarter with another long
drive that ended in a turnover. So by the time Bledsoe finally
threw a touchdown pass to Shawn Jefferson with 2:43 to play, and
followed up by getting the ball back with 30 seconds to play and
taking his team 53 yards in 21 seconds, it wasn't quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Close, but not close enough this time to avoid finally paying
the price for cutting corners and tempting fate. Close but an
exploding cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them credit,'' linebacker Chris Slade said of the
Chiefs. ``They stuck with their game plan. They didn't let us deter
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 30 seconds to go I had no doubt we'd win it. When Shawn
caught that pass (a 27-yard completion to the Chiefs' 14 with nine
seconds remaining) I believed it was automatic. But nothing's
automatic. You knew sooner or later the law of averages would catch
up with us. You can't keep skating by, skating by, skating by.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wakeup call for this team. I hate to see us lose to
get a wakeup call, but we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is do they wake up in time and go to work or do
they roll over and go back to sleep and miss the boat to the
playoffs they know they're well capable of boarding?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep doing the things we were doing _ the mistakes
and the penalties _ we were fortunate to be in a close game with a
chance to win at the end,'' Bledsoe said. ``We could have been
blown out by that point. We're too good a team to keep beating
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   So they keep saying.

MISSED FIELD GOAL HANDS PATRIOTS FIRST LOSS

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There were points handed out for bravery
(quarterback Drew Bledsoe) and for resiliency, for making Sunday's
game before 78,636 crazy red-garbed fans at Arrowhead Stadium so
close.
</P>
<P>
   None of those points added up to the 3 the Patriots needed with
nine seconds remaining in the game, however. Three points they
could, and should have, had when Adam Vinatieri missed a 32-yard
field goal attempt that clipped the right upright and didn't go
through.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe engineered another late fourth-quarter drive to put the
Patriots in position to win, but they lost, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some of the luck had run out after four straight wins,
and they fell to 4-1, tied atop the AFC East with the Buffalo
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it all measured and we had it measured well, we just
didn't do it,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll about the final
kick.
</P>
<P>
   The snap by Mike Bartrum and the hold by Lee Johnson weren't so
hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the ball off my thumb and I couldn't get the laces
around,'' said Johnson. ``It was a very poor hold. I couldn't get
the laces around in time and they were at 3 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the kick looked as if it was going to sail through until it
took a sudden right turn and clanged away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably go out and hit about 100 of those, but I
didn't hit the one I had to hit,'' said Vinatieri, who has missed
his last three attempts after hitting his first nine, including
three that were crucial in first three wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' added Vinatieri, who also missed a 48-yard
attempt. ``We needed it and I let them down. I thought it had a
chance, it was going right at it . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham said, ``I never saw the ball hit
the upright, but Arrowhead is a great place. I know we're in
Missouri, but Dorothy's here, too. They have a heck of football
team. My hat's off to Drew Bledsoe. I don't know what other
quarterback would have survived that onslaught. He got hit I don't
know how many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was knocked down more than 10 times, was sacked three
times, and hurried endlessly. By halftime, he had stitches in his
chin, he had been pounded on the shoulder, and he was flexing his
knee. He threw two interceptions and fumbled once. He missed Shawn
Jefferson on deep routes three times, including one that seemed to
be a sure touchdown. In all, the Patriots had four turnovers to
Kansas City's two, and although it might have been Vinatieri who
missed the chip shot at the end, Bledsoe was more than willing to
accept the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam should never have been in the situation to have to make
that kick,'' said Bledsoe, who completed 23 of 45 passes for 334
yards and two touchdowns. ``My job as a quarterback is to hold onto
the ball, not give it to the defense. I turned it over three times,
and that makes it difficult to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe didn't complete a second-half pass until only 4:27
remained in the game. That pass was a 10-yarder to Lamont Warren
that started a 77-yard scoring drive and brought the Patriots
within 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive, Tony Simmons (7 catches, 107 yards), who was
filling in for the injured Troy Brown, caught passes for 13 and 39
yards. On a third and 8, Bledsoe made one of his best throws, an
8-yard pass to Jefferson in the left corner of the end zone with
2:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots elected not to try an onside kick. After the Chiefs
made one first down on the ground, the Patriots forced a punt. They
got the ball at their 33 with 30 seconds remaining. Bledsoe hit
Terry Glenn (8 yards), Ben Coates (18), then found Jefferson for 27
yards down the left side after he beat Eric Warfield. With nine
seconds left and the ball at the Chiefs' 14, the offense had set
the stage for the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was not meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots guard Heath Irwin committed two false starts in the
first three plays and New England had six in the first half as the
crowd noise was incredible. The Chiefs threw all the blitzes they
possibly could at New England early. On the Patriots' second
possession, Bledsoe dropped back and was stripped of the ball by
Derrick Thomas, and it was recovered by KC's Chester McGlockton at
the Patriots' 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs settled for a 22-yard Pete Stoyanovich field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots followed with a 78-yard scoring drive, which
contained another false start by Irwin. Bledsoe also missed
Jefferson downfield, and a reverse lost 9 yards when Kevin Faulk
and Glenn muffed the exchange. But they muddled through and
Bledsoe, holding onto the ball as long as possible, lofted a
beautiful strike to Glenn, who turned James Hasty and went in from
49 yards away to give the Patriots a rare early lead this season,
7-3.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, the Chiefs decided to go back to what
they do best _ run.
</P>
<P>
   They exploded for 108 yards, using four backs but mostly Bam
Morris, to keep drives alive and the keep the Patriots' offense off
the field. On two scoring drives in the second half, Kansas City
ate up 8:06 and 8:05. The Chiefs took the third-quarter kickoff and
scored in 14 plays, 11 on the ground, including Donnell Bennett's
1-yard TD run. They had a nine-play, 38-yard third-quarter drive
that set up a field goal that made it 13-7, in which six of the
plays were on the ground. In the fourth quarter another 14-play
drive, set up by Hasty's interception of Bledsoe, featured 10
running plays before Stoyanovich hit a 23-yarder making it 16-7.
What changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the same things they did in the first half,'' said
the Patriots' Willie McGinest. ``There were no adjustments. It's
all of our fault. They just did what they set out to do and we
couldn't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell said, ``They out-toughed us
in the second half. That's basically what it comes down to, but we
still had a chance to win a game in which we were minus-two in
turnovers in this place. Most teams don't come that close to
winning a game here.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest took offense to the suggestion the previous four games
had been more a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're surviving nothing,'' said McGinest. ``We're fighting our
ass off every week. It's not like we're just surviving. We let them
score too many damned points, and that's why we lost the game.''

WARRICK' HEISMAN HOPES STOLEN AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Peter Warrick blew it.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy, for all intents and purposes, was his to
lose. The star wide receiver of the No. 1 Florida State Seminoles
had no peer, really, when it came to the Heisman race. He was atop
everyone's list.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Warrick suffered a precipitous fall from grace
when he and teammate Lavernaues Coles were arrested last Thursday
for grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, a recalcitrant receiver already on double-secret
probation, was kicked off the team, and Warrick was suspended
indefinitely after the players, abetted by a star-struck,
19-year-old Dillard's department store clerk, took $412.38 worth of
clothing from the store after plunking down only $21.40.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are due in court Monday, but even if Warrick plea
bargains his felony charge down to a misdemeanor, there is no
minimizing the devastating impact it has had on his teammates,
school, coaches, family, and, quite possibly, his future in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   While Warrick issued a nationally televised apology to the
aforementioned parties during Florida State's 31-21 victory over
Miami Saturday, he should just forget the Heisman. He blew it. Big
time.
</P>
<P>
   That should be _ and probably is _ Bobby Bowden's counsel to his
troubled star player.
</P>
<P>
   If Warrick is given a reprieve _ and there is a strong
possibility he could return in time to help the Seminoles to a
national championship once his matter is adjudicated _ Bowden said
he would advise Warrick ``to take a very back seat, a very back
seat. You go out there and just play the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Bowden wants Warrick back in the fold. But the
Florida State coach needs to make sure Warrick pays a price _ and
not just $21.40 _ for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so a nation of Heisman voters turns its lonely eyes toward
you, Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake _ if Hamilton wins the Heisman, it will not be
by default. So far this season, the Georgia Tech quarterback has
staged an impressive Heisman campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Hamilton led the Yellow Jackets on a game-saving drive
for the fifth time in 12 games in a 31-24 overtime victory against
North Carolina. He completed 14 of 26 passes for 273 yards and had
touchdown passes of 47 and 59 yards while rushing for 77 yards,
including a 14-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leader in passing efficiency (191.24), Hamilton so
far this season has passed for 1,347 yards and 12 touchdowns and
has thrown just four interceptions. He now becomes the leading
contender for the Heisman. Although Wisconsin's Ron Dayne is slowly
gathering steam for consideration after the Dayne Train apparently
was derailed in a loss to Michigan three weeks ago, it is clear the
Heisman is now Hamilton's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do now is avoid going on any shopping sprees with
Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which leapfrogged from No. 11 to No. 5 in the
Associated Press ratings, cracked the Top 5 for the first time in
32 years after its impressive 34-31 victory over archrival
Michigan, which plummeted from No. 3 to No. 10 after dropping to
5-1. The victory was especially sweet for the Spartans, one of
eight undefeated teams remaining in the AP Top 25, who have run
their overall record to 6-0 for the first time since 1966.
Quarterback Bill Burke set a school record with his 400 yards
passing, while junior receiver Plaxico Burress set another school
record with his 10 catches for 255 yards, highlighted by long
receptions of 39, 49, and 68 yards. Burress also had a 15-yard
touchdown pass from Burke. ``We've got 365 days until they get
another chance,'' said Michigan State's Amp Campbell. ``We can go
anywhere we want to and brag about it. We can walk into an Ann
Arbor mall wearing our Michigan State hats and be proud.'' . . .
Notre Dame probably was filming a sequel to ``Rudy'' when coach Bob
Davie inserted sophomore tailback Tim O'Neill, a 5-foot-5-inch
nonscholarship player from Troy, Mich., in the waning moments of
Saturday's 48-17 romp over Arizona State. O'Neill carried twice for
4 yards on consecutive handoffs in Notre Dame's penultimate
possession . . . One supposes Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, coaching
his team from his hospital bed while awaiting knee surgery in a
hospital 75 miles away in Rochester, Minn., must have required
cardiac care after his Badgers had to go into overtime to beat
Minnesota, 20-17, on Vitaly Pisetsky's 31-yard field goal . . .
Division 3 Mount Union won its 47th consecutive game _ a 66-0 rout
over Heidelberg _ to match the nation's longest winning streak, set
by Oklahoma (1953-57). Mount Union has won three consecutive
Division 3 national championships and four this decade . . . We
hate to dogpile on the Huskies, but Northeastern's 77-0 loss at
UMass Saturday ranked as the most lopsided in the country that day.
Only Oberlin's 71-0 loss to Wooster came close. There were only
three other teams who won Saturday by scoring 70 points or more:
Nebraska-Kearney over Fort Lewis, 79-13; Sterling over Ottawa,
Kan., 70-42; and Cortland State over New Jersey City, 73-7.

WATER PACT COULD GIVE INDIAN TRIBES HALF OF COLORADO RIVER
RESOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If water is power _ and in the arid West, water is
everything _ the balance of power in Arizona is about to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and federal negotiators are working on an agreement that
could leave 10 Indian tribes in control of nearly half the Colorado
River water that flows through the Central Arizona Project Canal.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough water to serve an urban population of more than 3
million, and someday it just might.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is determined to see that the tribes
get water. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has made it clear that
he will use his authority to take the water from the Arizona if
talks fail. Arizona officials believe some sort of agreement is in
everyone's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, which want the water to settle decades-old claims
against the federal government, likely would lease some of their
bounty back to farmers, who stand to lose the most in the deal, or
to cities thirsty to accommodate new growth.
</P>
<P>
   What worries some CAP users is the prospect of an open water
market that could someday force farmers to compete with cities, or
even pit Arizona against neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here long-term is drying up Pinal County,''
Eloy farmer Norm Pretzer warned Arizona officials. ``It's going to
be pumped dry, and that's going to be it for us. That's going to be
one hell of a drive to Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian water claims against the federal government have bubbled
beneath the surface for years with only scattered success. &QL; 
BABBITT PUSHES ISSUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue took on a new urgency recently. Babbitt, a former
Arizona governor, began pushing for a final agreement. And Arizona
officials formally linked the tribal claims to a plan that would
end a long-standing dispute over financing the $4.7 billion Central
Arizona Project.
</P>
<P>
   The 336-mile canal each year carries 1.5 million acre-feet of
Colorado River water, potentially enough for more than 7 million
urban residents, to Maricopa, Pinal and Pima counties. It supplies
ever-greater portions of the drinking water used by the rapidly
growing populations in Phoenix and Tucson. &QL; Unresolved issues
</P>
<P>
   Tribal water rights are part of three unresolved issues
involving the project:
</P>
<P>
   _How should as yet unused and excess portions of the CAP water
be divided, and who should control those amounts?
</P>
<P>
   _ How much CAP water should be used to help the federal
government settle ancestral water claims among the Arizona's Indian
tribes?
</P>
<P>
   _How much of the CAP's cost should Arizona repay to the federal
government? Arizona sued the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to avoid
paying what it claimed were cost overruns. A judge sided with the
state on key issues, and Arizona last month proposed its repayment
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have long sought to connect all three
questions. The state has objected, saying that the issues are
separate. But in its proposal to settle the CAP repayment costs,
the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, run by 15 elected
Arizonans, included a resolution that could help settle the Indian
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Pearson, director of the Arizona Department of Water
Resources, said linking all the CAP disputes may ultimately speed
final agreements, though she cautioned against piling on too much
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is a delicate balance,'' she said. ``The
momentum of tying these things together is bringing momentum for
closure on all three. But on the other hand, too many issues can
weigh it down. It's like riding a bicycle downhill. More weight
will make it go faster, but too much and you crash and burn.'' &QL; 
`FAIR AND REASONABLE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although more than a half-dozen Arizona tribes are pursuing
water claims, the most critical negotiations surround the Gila
River Indian Community, which already controls the biggest share of
CAP water among the Arizon's tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Gila River spokesman Gary Bohnee said the community is seeking
only a fair and reasonable settlement, one that addresses the
tribe's ancestral claims. He said tribal officials are pleased that
the negotiations seem to be moving forward again.
</P>
<P>
   But Cecil Antone, the tribe's lieutenant governor, leaves no
room for confusion about what will happen if those talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community will have to continue litigation that we
anticipate may last many more decades and continue to cost all
parties literally tens or hundreds of millions of dollars,'' Antone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and federal officials are close to a deal that would
give the Gila River Community nearly 150,000 acre-feet of
additional CAP water. On paper, the two sides are about 5,000
acre-feet apart, but it's not as simple as meeting halfway. An
acre-foot equals 326,000 gallons. &QL;  ARIZONA SEEKS CEILING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona wants to set a ceiling on how much CAP water the federal
government can take for tribal claims. Federal negotiators don't
want their hands tied. Arizona farmers want to be compensated for
the water they will give up to settle the claim. Federal officials
are not eager to wade into non-federal water use.
</P>
<P>
   Many CAP users also want restrictions that say no water given up
by the Arizona in any of the negotiations can be sold or leased
beyond Arizona's borders. Some fear the large pools of unused water
could find its way into negotiations with water-starved California
and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be absolute, in indelible ink,'' said George
Campbell, a member of the CAP board of directors. ``We have to say
there is not and will not be any condition that would allow water
to leave the state of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   No Arizona tribal official has publicly suggested marketing the
water out of state, but the issue festers elsewhere. Just across
the Colorado River in California, the Chemehuevi Tribe has tried to
lease some of its unused water to needy urban users in Los Angeles
and San Diego. &QL; 
LOT AT STAKE FOR TRIBES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Leivas, the tribe's former chairman, said leasing the
water would infuse badly needed cash into the tribe's agricultural
program and could help tribal members become more self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribes have a lot at stake,'' Leivas said. ``I think it's
time we came together. People have to show more respect for the
river. We need to protect it, but we need to get our fair share,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind most of the uneasiness in Arizona is a giant pool of
water, which in the West might as well be another Comstock Lode. If
all the settlements now on the table are approved, 10 tribes will
share control of more than 600,000 acre-feet.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, Nevada's entire share of the
Colorado is 300,000 acre-feet, an allotment that serves an urban
valley of about 1.3 million people surrounding Las Vegas. All 10
tribes combined number barely 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said it's important to remember that many of the tribes
need water for farming operations, which consume more water than
urban use. The Gila River Community produces cotton, wheat,
alfalfa, barley and other crops on about 12,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture, in fact, is the very reason the tribes have claimed
so much water. A 1908 U.S. Supreme Court decision awarded tribes
enough water to meet the purpose of the reservation. For many of
the Arizona tribes, that purpose is agriculture. &QL; 
FARMERS PAYING PRICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But non-Indian farmers say they're the ones paying the highest
price. Under Babbitt's proposed settlement, as much as 200,000
acre-feet now set aside for agricultural use would be taken to
settle the tribal claims.
</P>
<P>
   David Iwanski, executive vice president of the Arizona
Agri-Business Council, said farmers understand they were never to
have a permanent share of CAP water. But they aren't prepared to
give up what they have without compensation, whether it's money or
an assured water supply for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture continues to be the largest user of CAP water,''
Iwanski said. ``We need to respect the fact that debt was incurred
by the farmers and the irrigation districts, and they need that
water to repay that debt. It will take some time before Indian
communities have the infrastructure in place to use their share.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Orme, an attorney representing the Central Arizona
Irrigation and Drainage District, said the settlement as proposed
would hit not only farmers, but in Pinal County, it would end
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question this settlement is being made on the
backs of the people who use water in Pinal County,'' he said. ``Our
growth has to be protected. We need some assurance for future
water.'' &QL; 
URBAN AREAS AFFECTED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County cities also are concerned about the effect of
the deal on growth, though many are already talkiribes about
leasing water. Scottsdale, Peoria, Goodyear, Mesa and other
communities need more CAP water if they are to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Kohlhoff, assistant utilities manager for Mesa, said the
outcome of the tribal settlements are important to help preserve an
assured water supply for cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Arizona water needs to be used in Arizona for
Arizonans,'' Kohlhoff said. If current talks fail, he added, ``the
losers will be the tribes and everyone in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona negotiators want to keep the talks on track if only to
avoid something much worse. In laying out his latest proposal,
Babbitt also spelled out the alternatives. Without a negotiated
agreement, the Interior secretary indicated he is prepared to take
whatever water he thinks necessary. That includes nearly 66,000
acre-feet of still unallocated municipal water that has become a
holy grail for Arizona water officials.
</P>
<P>
   David Hayes, Babbitt's chief deputy and lead water negotiator,
said the secretary isn't trying to use the other proposals as a
club against Arizona, but he wants everyone to understand that
settling tribal claims is a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have a mutually agreeable settlement,'' Hayes
said. By negotiating, he said, Arizona not only creates a future
water source, it avoids a costly and drawn-out court battle that
the tribes could well win. &QL;

   BOSTON _ It rained all day and it stopped at night, and then
came the thunder and the lightning of the Boston Red Sox bats. Much
of it was from John Valentin, who had two home runs among his four
hits and seven runs batted in. But so many others contributed for
24 Boston hits in an astounding 23-7 thrashing of the Cleveland
Indians in Game 4 of the first round of the American League
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston run total broke a record for the most in postseason
history, beating the Yankees' output in an 18-4 victory over the
New York Giants in the 1936 World Series. Their hits total also
broke a major-league record for postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's barrage had the fans roaring in Fenway Park and
it left the Cleveland pitching staff stunned as these two
century-old rivals headed back to Ohio for a climactic Game 5 on
Monday night at Jacobs Field. Who knows who will pitch for Boston
against Charles Nagy of the Indians? Pedro Martinez, the Red Sox
staff ace who is due in the rotation, remains doubtful with back
pain that forced him to leave Game 1. Late Sunday night, with the
game well into its fourth hour, the 33,898 fans chanted ``We want
Pedro! We want Pedro!'' as if their voices could will him back to
health.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen, who failed in Game 2 for the Red Sox, is likely
to begin the game, but manager Jimy Williams refused to say for
sure before Sunday night's game. The winner of Monday's game meets
the Yankees in the best-of-7 American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   This game began with the American flag flapping outward in a
brisk breeze over the Green Monster, the big wall that dominates
left field in this lopsided park, as a man sang of bombs bursting
in air. Soon, Valentin and his teammates slammed balls against and
over the wall. They did the mash. They did the Monster Mash.
</P>
<P>
   They knocked out Bartolo Colon, Cleveland's best pitcher, in the
second inning. They made the Indians look foolish chasing their
rockets. Manny Ramirez, the big right fielder, ran into second
baseman Robbie Alomar with his knee and later used his leg to kick
a ball across the outfield. Ramirez, who led the major leagues with
165 RBI this season, has no hits or runs batted in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, a 32-year-old third baseman, has had trouble with his
fielding, making two crucial errors in this series, one of them
decisive in Cleveland's Game 1 victory. But he had one home run and
three runs batted in during Saturday's 9-3 victory, setting up
Sunday night's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lineup for Boston was shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, a
candidate for the league's most valuable player, who played in the
first two games of the series but missed the third on Saturday. His
right wrist, originally injured by a pitched ball a week before,
became too sore for him to swing the bat or throw the ball. In the
first lineup released by the Red Sox Sunday evening, Garciaparra
was not starting and Lou Merloni, who had two hits in Saturday's
game, was in his place. However, a second lineup was released a few
minutes later, with Garciaparra in and Merloni out.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Garciaparra told him he could play after swinging
the bat in a tunnel beneath the stands. Neither team took batting
practice on the field because of the rain, which began in the late
morning and continued throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hurt the kid,'' Williams said, referring to
Garciaparra. ``The trainer taped his wrist and he went out to the
tunnel and after he got done hitting he came back and said he could
play. So I changed the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Reed entered the game as Cleveland's relief pitcher
at the beginning of the fourth inning, he hit Garciaparra with his
first pitch, which appeared to brush the midsection of
Garciaparra's uniform. Later, after Boston's Jason Varitek homered
off him in the fifth, Reed hit Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove, the Cleveland manager, was criticized for his
handling of pitchers in Saturday's defeat in Game 3. Sunday night,
he started Colon on three days' rest, instead of the usual four,
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never done it,'' Hargrove said. ``I'm hoping for the
best.'' In words that might prove prophetic, he also said: ``Boston
has been very resilient all year. They are capable of winning three
straight. I don't think we can afford the luxury of holding back
our two best pitchers.'' Colon gave up seven runs on six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Red Sox were starting Kent Mercker, a left-handed
pitcher, Sunday night, the Indians replaced two of their
left-handed batters with right-handers. Wil Cordero was in at
designated hitter for Harold Baines; Richie Sexson played left
field in place of David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians scored single runs in the first and second innings;
the Sox got two in the first, five in the second, three in the
third and five in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hit his first home run in the first, driving in Jose
Offerman, who walked ahead of him. His second, also for two runs,
came in the third, a towering shot that disappeared between the
light towers into the night sky high above the screen that reaches
high above the wall. He also singled in the second and doubled in
the fourth, the double driving in three more runs to raise Boston's
lead to 15-2. Also homering was Offerman, a two-run bolt in the
second.

BC'S HASSELBECK, O'BRIEN STILL SORE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After navigating some extremely rough waters to win its
first four games of the season, Boston College's football team
appeared to be cruising toward a 5-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before BC's juggernaut sprang a leak in Saturday's
24-14 loss at Temple, which left the Eagles smarting from their
first loss of the season and starting quarterback Tim Hasselbeck
smarting from a mild separation of his right (throwing) shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien said Hasselbeck was examined by team
physicians Sunday, and X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no fractures, no dislocation, no sprain,'' O'Brien
said tersely. ``It's a mild separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck did not complain about the injury when it happened _
``sometime in the middle of the first half, definitely in the first
quarter,'' the quarterback said. He wound up finishing the game and
completing 14 of 22 attempts for 146 yards and a 3-yard touchdown
pass to Ryan Burch that gave BC a 14-0 lead in the second quarter.
Hasselbeck threw one interception and was sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he was not yet ready to rule out Hasselbeck for
Saturday's Big East home game against Pittsburgh. ``The doctors say
there's a chance (he could play), but we'll see by Wednesday if he
can practice or not,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, then redshirt freshman Brian St. Pierre will make his
first career start against the Panthers, who are coming off a 24-17
loss to No. 16 Syracuse last Thursday night. BC coaches have
prepared St. Pierre for this scenario by giving him time in all
five games this season.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre has completed 14 of 20 passes for 175 yards and been
intercepted twice this season. Against Temple, he completed 6 of 9
attempts for 77 yards but was intercepted in the end zone in the
second quarter when Temple cornerback Fulton Fryar outleaped BC
redshirt freshman Jamal Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good throw, a throw he had to make,'' O'Brien said,
absolving St. Pierre of any blame for the interception. ``I put
that on the receiver, because if he can't come down with it, then
he's got to make sure that the man covering him doesn't come down
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   BC squandered its 14-0 lead when the Owls rallied for 24 points,
including 17 in the second half, to score their first victory of
the season after being shut out in three of their five previous
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, meanwhile, managed to generate minus-8 yards of
offense on their first three offensive series of the second half,
all resulting in three-and-outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was lost in the third quarter,'' O'Brien said. ``We
were never able to blunt their drives or to stop the bleeding . . .
We have no one to blame but ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien also was angry at the media over what he said was a
``perceived inference'' that he had not been forthcoming about
Hasselbeck's injury.
</P>
<P>
   In his initial postgame remarks, O'Brien told the media everyone
on his team had emerged physically sound. However, when he returned
to the locker room, the coach learned from team trainers that ``a
late injury was reported by Hasselbeck,'' he said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   When Hasselbeck emerged from the locker room with his right arm
in a sling, reporters sought O'Brien for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Approached aboard the team bus afterward, O'Brien declined to
discuss Hasselbeck's injury _ or even to acknowledge that he was
aware of it _ deferring comment until his teleconference
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, at which point he lashed out at the media and
accused both Boston newspapers of calling him a liar.

HOLLYWOOD GOES TO THE DOGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a classic Hollywood rags-to-riches tail, er _
tale.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Rowdy, an Australian shepherd-husky mix, lived
in a North Los Angeles shelter, unwanted and unloved. Today he's a
big-time TV star, who travels with an entourage of handlers and
trainers, gets constantly pampered and fussed over, and, if he's
really good, is rewarded with his favorite treats _ hot dogs and
Cheetos.
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy, who was rescued from the East Valley Animal Shelter,
stars in a new Nickelodeon series, ``100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd,''
which premieres Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a consummate pro,'' said executive producer Tommy Lynch.
``He may have a bad day and be fussy, but after a while he gets
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy joins a long line of celebrity animals raised or trained
in the San Fernando Valley and nearby, popular places for trainers
because of the proximity to studios and the availability of land.
</P>
<P>
   Among local animal stars:
</P>
<P>
   The original Benji, rescued from a Burbank shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Cheeta the chimp, of Newbury Park, who starred in ``Bedtime for
Bonzo'' and numerous Tarzan movies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson's chimp, Bubbles, raised by Sylmar trainer Bob
Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   The Taco Bell chihuahua, trained by Studio Animal Services in
Castaic.
</P>
<P>
   Just like with struggling human actors who suddenly make it big,
the career change for animals often results in a tremendous
improvement in their lives, said Jim Moore, a spokesman for the
American Humane Association, which monitors treatment of animals
during TV and film productions.
</P>
<P>
   Most dogs used in productions came from shelters and likely
faced euthanasia because adult dogs are less likely to be adopted
than puppies, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   With stardom, they become pampered, happy animals who often get
more fan mail than their human co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do they have a change in their lifestyle, they have a
complete change in their whole personality,'' Moore said. ``I think
they realize, wow, I've been saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassie, for example, traveled first class on airplanes and only
drank bottled water, Moore said. And the dog playing Beethoven in
``Beethoven's Third,'' now under production, stays cool in a van
with better air conditioning than any of the human cast members
have.
</P>
<P>
   When casting the part of Eddie, the show's producers traveled
all over the western United States and Canada, auditioning some 700
canines before choosing Rowdy for his personality and striking
looks, most noticeable in his pale blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The show is about a 15-year-old neighborhood bully who is
transformed into a talking dog by a mysterious drifter (Richard
Moll) and told he must perform 100 good deeds in order to become
human again.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he was to be the backup dog, ``but Nickelodeon fell
in love with Rowdy,'' said trainer Nancy McMillan, co-owner of
Worldwide Movie Animals. ``I can see why. He has an intense look to
him, with the blue eyes. He's very intense and very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   He had appeared in a few commercials and TV shows before, but
his training was still a little, well, ruff around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, Rin Tin Tin is spinning in his grave with this
acting,'' laughed Rowdy's human co-star, Richard Moll of ``Night
Court'' fame. ``But he's getting better. He's learning where to put
his rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy's slow start was mainly because he was hired only two days
before shooting began and had limited training, McMillan said. He
did, however, show a strong intelligence and an eagerness to learn,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves to work,'' McMillan said. ``He cannot wait to do a
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The pooch's favorite scenes involve anything active, such as
running and jumping.
</P>
<P>
   He hates sitting still, McMillan added.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his commands _ like walking with an actor, stepping to
his mark, retrieving objects and lying down belly up, legs in the
air _ were all learned on the set during production, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, Eddie the dog talks, with help from a dozen
computer animators and the voice of actor Seth Green, but can only
be heard by his owner, Justin, and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy has to keep his mouth closed during filming for the
animation to work, so he is given a small piece of rope to grip
between his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy's co-stars dispute the old showbiz adage about never
working with children or animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer it to acting with (human) actors,'' Moll said. ``He
never gives me an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Coppola, one of several guest directors, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more refreshing because they don't talk back,'' said
Coppola, who is the brother of Nicolas Cage and nephew of Francis
Ford Coppola. ``They don't ask for their motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lynch said, it can be difficult simply because of the
communication barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the hardest show I've ever done, because at the end
of the day, your star is a dog,'' Lynch said. ``It's almost like
directing a foreign actor ... but I've never spoken dog before.''
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of ``100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd'' airs Oct. 16
at 9 p.m. on Nickelodeon.

VINATIERI KICKING HIMSELF AFTER CRUCIAL MISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Adam Vinatieri knows if you kick often enough
with the game on the line you end up feeling the way he felt
Sunday. Trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned at his locker with his eyes glistening and the weight of
his team's failure on his shoulders, Vinatieri sat on a stool and
tried to explain why his latest kick, the one that could have won a
football game with nine seconds to play, failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri has won six such games with last-minute field goals
during his three-plus years as the Patriots' kicker. Until Sunday
he never had missed in such a situation, but if you kick long
enough the ball becomes a traitor. Sunday was Vinatieri's day for
that, which meant it wasn't his team's day.
</P>
<P>
   With nine seconds to go in a 2-point game, Vinatieri lined up a
32-yard field goal at Arrowhead Stadium that would beat the Kansas
City Chiefs if it went straight, as most of his kicks have. It was
a familiar position, a place he had in one sense or another been in
three times this season already without letting his team down.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the snap was off and the hold was poor and the
kick sailed an inch too far to the right, slapping into the upright
and falling to the ground. With it fell the Patriots, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Vinatieri sat in his locker surrounded by
notebooks and minicams, his voice choking in frustration and
disappointment as he tried to explain the unexplainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let the team down,'' Vinatieri said after missing two kicks
Sunday, including the potential winner. ``We needed it and I let
them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when it left my foot it had a chance, but it never
moved. I hit it hard enough but I just pushed it to the right.
Thirty-two yards? I need to hit every one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vinatieri's voice choked with emotion, punter Lee Johnson
listened on the edge of a wall of humanity and finally leaned in to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very poor hold,'' Johnson said. ``Make sure you write
about that. Adam won't say it, but it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he should make it, and I know he should make it, but
I didn't get the laces turned around. They were at 3 o'clock. The
laces were on the right side, and when that happens the ball tends
to go to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what happened as the ball sailed too far to the
right and slapped harmlessly into the upright as the Chiefs poured
onto the field knowing how lucky they had been.
</P>
<P>
   And how unlucky a reliable kicker named Adam Vinatieri had been
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam has won a bunch of games for us in the past and he will
win a bunch of games for us in the future,'' coach Pete Carroll
said. ``We had a chance to win it and we didn't get it. That's all
there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are Vinatieri, pinned in your locker with tears in
your eyes and the weight of your team's defeat on your shoulders.
Then there's a lot more to it than that.

GORE HOPES ARIZONA TRIP BOLSTERS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The last time Vice President Al Gore campaigned in
Arizona, he was jubilant because he and his boss, President
Clinton, were sweeping to an easy re-election that included a
historic victory in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today (MONDAY, OCT. 11), Gore will return as a presidential
candidate in his own right, making a brief swing through Phoenix to
scoop up campaign cash for his unexpectedly tight Democratic
primary battle against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, scheduled to arrive in Phoenix in the morning, will tour a
local school to highlight school overcrowding, then attend a
$250-a-person fund-raiser at Eddie Matney's restaurant in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser is expected to push Gore's Arizona contribution
total over $250,000 _ compared with the $126,000 Bradley had raised
by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent Arizon conducted by Arizona State
University pollster Bruce Merrill, Gore still led Bradley among
Arizona Democrats, 42 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's front-runner status appears increasingly shaky,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore still has a core amount of support here, and if you took
a poll you'd see him ahead, but I think you'd see Bradley closing
like he has all over the country,'' said Sen. George Cunningham,
D-Tucson, who has endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, recent surveys by pollster Earl de Berge have shown
just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that Gore has admitted this is a campaign has
attracted the interest of voters,'' de Berge said. ``And I think
many of them just have real doubts as to whether or not Gore can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, while still trailing Gore in polls, has planted a
foothold in the southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign swing in June, he wooed local Democrats in
Tucson, won the endorsement of that city's mayor, and raised more
than $15,000 for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big hit,'' Cunningham said, noting that southern
Arizonans seem to like Bradley's cerebral, unapologetically liberal
style.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Gore's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the vice president say he will easily outstrip
Bradley's Arizona fund-raising totals. And he retains the loyalty
of most of the state's elected Democratic officials, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They expect voters to warm to his message, too, especially in
the wake of his high-profile makeover, which includes loosening the
stays on his once-rigid wardrobe and moving his headquarters from
Washington, D.C., to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no place to go but up,'' said state Rep. Ken Cheuvront,
D-central Phoenix. ``People have such low expectations of him right
now, they don't look at him as a great orator or speaker, when in
reality when you listen to him he does a great job. I think
people's attitudes will change when they see him in person.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cunningham, Gore's face-off with Bradley is great
for Democrats, who get to pick the best of two quality candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both reek of substance, and they both are on the right
side of the issues most of the time,'' Cunningham said. ``And the
differences between the two are shades of gray rather than black or
white. I think that we could easily support whomever got the
Democratic nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Cheuvront suggested that Gore will grow stronger
fending off Bradley's challenge from the Democratic left-wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore was faltering, and this is making him become more
hardened,'' Cheuvront said. ``It will get him ready for a very
tough general election campaign.'' &QL;

COLT'S TO CUT SALE OF HANDGUNS, HOPING TO LIMIT LIABILITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REMOVES ``once'' from 2nd graf to reverse facts of sentence.) 
(Attn: Conn.)   (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Co., which invented the six-shooter, the
companion of cowboys and Texas Rangers, is abandoning much of its
144-year-old retail gun business in an effort to limit its
liability in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's, the purveyor of the Colt .45, the ``Peacemaker''
romanticized in countless western movies, now plans to make far
fewer weapons and sell them mainly to law enforcement agencies and
the military. But it will effectively stop selling handguns to
civilians, except to gun collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One senior executive said the company was canceling seven
product lines partly because of trouble paying suppliers. But the
executive blamed the litigation for that problem, saying the
company could no longer get loans to finance manufacturing because
the lawsuits ``could be worth zero, or a trillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in West Hartford, Conn., faces 28 lawsuits
from cities, counties and others who hope to punish gun makers with
a strategy similar to the one used against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The change could mean laying off hundreds of the 700 workers at
the Colt's factory in West Hartford, said the a senior executive,
who refused to be named because employees have not yet been told of
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   This winter's pared-down line is to include designer sidearms,
with grips of rosewood and antelope horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These certainly could be used for self-defense, but they
aren't made for that,'' Joseph Cartabona, Colt's director of
handguns, said yesterday. ``You take these to the range on the
weekend for target shooting, or maybe for cowboy-action shooting,
which is getting to be very, very big. They dress up like Annie
Oakley and Wild Bill and shoot'' while on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is reported in the issue of Newsweek on
newsstands this week. The company sent a letter about the change to
its 19 distributors last week, and they are now notifying 3,000
dealers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has received warm and wide
attention for its ``smart gun'' prototype developed in 1996, which
uses a radio signal to prevent unauthorized people from firing it.
To help further insulate the company from legal liability, current
and former executives said, it plans to create a separate company,
perhaps to be called iColt, that would license the smart gun's
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of firearms manufacturers, hoping to avoid
having to turn over embarrassing documents like ones that became
public in tobacco litigation, met in Washington last month to
discuss possible settlement terms with lawyers for the cities and
counties suing them. Gun executives who attended the meeting have
said that the measures being considered include mandatory safety
devices and tighter restrictions on gun retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's officials say they have poured money into legal fees that
otherwise would be going to research and development. Sales to
civilian consumers, through dealers, were about 30 percent of
Colt's business, with the rest coming from military and law
enforcement sales, according to the company executive.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Ezell, president of the Institute for Research on Small
Arms, a nonprofit group based in Alexandria, Va., said concern
about litigation was only a part of the company's many business
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 19th century, the revolver was the peacemaker, and Colt
was the master marketer,'' she said. ``But there are so many
competitors that are doing a really good job, and their name has
not been enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the company's president, Steven Sliwa, resigned
to start the venture that is expected to introduce the Smart Gun
technology. He was replaced by William Keys, a retired Marine Corps
lieutenant general who had served on the board of New Colt Holding
Corp., which owns Colt's. Sliwa had been president for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 million Colt's pistols and rifles have been sold
since Samuel Colt got a patent in 1836 for a firearm equipped with
a revolving cylinder containing five or six bullets, the Uzi of its
day. Until then, the state of the art was a single-shot flintlock
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Today's company is the successor of Colt's Patent Fire Arms
Manufacturing Co., incorporated in 1855. Colt is said to have

BLEDSOE HOLDS ON TO BLAME, IF NOT BALL

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Drew Bledsoe stood before reporters with
stitches in his chin and mistakes on his mind. The Patriots
quarterback incurred both during a 16-14 loss to the Kansas City
Chiefs Sunday. He was only willing to go in detail about one.
</P>
<P>
   How many stitches are there, Drew?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' replied the banged-up signal-caller, who added
only that the stitching was done at halftime. As for the mistakes,
Bledsoe took the blame for putting the Patriots in a situation
where they needed Adam Vinatieri to make a 32-yard field goal with
four seconds left to win it. Vinatieri missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam should never have been in the situation to have to make
that kick,'' said Bledsoe, who fumbled once, was intercepted twice,
and didn't complete a second-half pass until 4:27 of the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job as a quarterback is to hold onto the ball, not give it
to the defense. I turned it over three times and that makes it
difficult to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed 23 of 45 passes for 334 yards and two
touchdowns. He seemed to play two games Sunday, as at times he was
razor sharp, particularly over the last 4:27, when he completed 6
of 7 for 77 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That score came on the Patriots' penultimate drive, when they
moved the ball better than they had much of the day. On
second-and-10 from his 23, Bledsoe completed a 10-yard pass to
Lamont Warren to get things going. Then came a 5-yard pass to Terry
Glenn. Consecutive completions to Tony Simmons were next, the first
for 13 yards, the second for 39.
</P>
<P>
   After an incompletion and a 2-yard pass to Terry Allen, Bledsoe
capped the drive with an 8-yard toss to Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never out of the game,'' said Bledsoe, who also
completed a 49-yard touchdown pass to Glenn in the first quarter,
the longest completion allowed by the Chiefs this season. ``We
never said, `It's over.' We knew we needed to get back in there and
get a touchdown and a field goal and we would win the game. We were
able to get the touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's struggles were due in large part to a defense that
blitzed often, sacked him thrice, forced him into bad throws, and
hit him hard after he let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Before completing a pass to Warren with 4:27 left, Bledsoe was 0
for 8, including 0 for 6 in the second half. In the first half, he
overthrew Jefferson after he had slipped past a defender and had
nothing but open field before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep doing the things we're doing, the mistakes and
the penalties, we were fortunate to be in a close game with a
chance to win,'' said Bledsoe. ``We are too good a team to keep
beating ourselves. We tried to come back and we put ourselves in a
position to win, but we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 19-1 when Bledsoe finishes with a quarterback
rating of 100 or better. Sunday his was 71.9, and he was left
lamenting the interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first interception, I tried to force it to (tight end)
Ben Coates, when I had my fullback open in the flat, and I felt I
could throw it over (the defender) and he made a good play on the
ball,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second, (Chiefs cornerback James) Hasty had good
position on Terry Glenn and I could have worked outside to Shawn
and avoided that one. I just can't make those plays and expect to
win.''

PROGRAM TEAMS RETIRED TEACHERS WITH NEW ONES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bernard Koblin returned recently to his old
stomping grounds, Pasadena's Muir High School, where he spent
nearly two decades teaching driver's education, general typing,
health and whatever else came his way.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a reunion that drew the 81-year-old and his wife,
Sadie, also a former high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   They were there to serve as mentors to first-year teachers Judy
Hu and David Herman, both members of Teach For America, a national
nonprofit organization that recruits college graduates to become
teachers in underserved communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to draw on my experience,'' said Bernard, who will
be mentor to Herman, 22, a math and science teacher at Muir. ``If
it works I'll be happy. If not, we'll try something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple was paired with the new teachers through UCLA's
Center on Aging, which seeks retired teachers and administrators to
volunteer three or more hours each month in the Teach For America
program.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 32 volunteers are working with novice teachers in
five school districts _ Los Angeles, Compton, Long Beach, Lynwood
and Pasadena _ and more are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Compton, we have three or four people (volunteers are)
mentoring, so it's not the ideal one-on-one mentoring that we would
like,'' said Amanda Timberg, program director of Teach For America.
The organization has 109 new teachers in Los Angeles-area school
districts this year.
</P>
<P>
   A support system is available for teachers without mentors who
can attend special meetings, retreats and discussion groups
organized by Teach For America.
</P>
<P>
   The mentors aid new teachers by observing them in the classroom,
helping craft lesson plans and doling out advice on myriad issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadie's a godsend,'' said Hu, 25, an English teacher at Muir
who was paired with the former high school social studies teacher.
``She's my roommate over the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hu, who looks almost as young as her students, said she needs a
coach in a profession that already has been abandoned by two of her
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching is hard alone, and without support it's even
harder,'' said Hu, who delayed her entry into the profession for
two years after college so she could travel in Europe and Africa
and gain some needed life experience.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, she and fellow teacher Herman got the support they
were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   While Sadie observed Hu in the classroom, Bernard reviewed a
list of concerns with Herman. The new teacher's No. 1 worry:
classroom management.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's talking that I can't stop,'' said Herman, who already
has switched some students' seats to cut the chatter. He also is
struggling to make algebra interesting and relevant to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a bunch who's in the middle, a bunch who I'm boring and
a bunch I'm losing,'' Herman said. ``Unfortunately, there's not 36
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard offered a few suggestions and sympathized with the
younger man who grew a beard to look older.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to do an efficient job teaching,'' Bernard said.
``My first year was difficult. I had no mentor, but I had a fellow
teacher to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Devastating'' is how Sadie recalls the first time she faced a
classroom of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what to expect standing in front of a group of
people,'' said Sadie, who taught social studies for 17 years before
retiring in 1988. ``Knowing you want them to learn something is
unnerving.''
</P>
<P>
   And being a mentor doesn't mean pointing out mistakes, Sadie
said, but serving as a confidante who can share ideas and help find
solutions to problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make you incompetent but competent,'' Sadie said of
having a mentor. ``I want her to feel good about being a good
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Koblins have retired from their high school
teaching jobs, neither one has given up the profession. Both teach
business courses part-time at Pasadena City College.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to serve as mentors was an easy decision for the pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're either a teacher or not,'' Sadie said. ``If you're a
teacher, then you can help somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard views his turn as a mentor as returning a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes around comes around, and the good I do will
return,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how to become a mentor, contact Mike Fong, education
coordinator at UCLA's Center on Aging at (310) 794-0676. To find

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Patriots wide receiver/kick returner Troy
Brown suffered a left ankle sprain on the first play of Sunday's
game against the Kansas City Chiefs. At the time, Tony Simmons had
no idea how much his afternoon had been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the team's best reserve receiver, and when he failed to
return, Simmons was summoned to take his place. Not only did the
second-year player from Wisconsin fill in, but he had arguably the
best game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons led everyone with seven catches for 107 yards, an
average of 15.3 yards, in New England's 16-14 loss. He entered the
game with seven catches for 103 yards. His catch total was a career
high and his yardage was second only to the 109 he had against
Indianapolis Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony played very well for us,'' said Patriots quarterback Dedsoe. ``He had a number of plays were he was my side adjustment.
They were blitzing, and he came in and did a good job with that and
got some run after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a great play for us late in the game. He's generally
our fourth receiver, but as I continue to say, even our fourth guy
can play really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually he's the fifth-best statistically, but Sunday he was
tops. Bledsoe was referring to a 39-yard completion to Simmons in
the forth quarter on first and 10 from Kansas City's 49. The
Patriots scored their second touchdown two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went inside the corner, ran up the field, Drew saw me at the
last minute and just threw it up there,'' said Simmons. ``I just
had to make sure I stayed away from the safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that play, Simmons caught an 8-yard slant, a play during
which he snatched the ball out of the hands of Kansas City
cornerback Cris Dishman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just getting open, helping Drew out there if I could,''
said Simmons. ``When Troy went out, I kind of figured maybe I would
be up for a while until . . . his situation was undisclosed, so I
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just played the best that I could, and when I got open, I
just hoped Drew saw me. They were doing a lot of blitzing, but I
just had to go up and get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his shining play, Simmons regretted the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't pass up a situation like that,'' he said. ``We
can't give up the ball, we have to have no turnovers, especially a
team like that. Any team. And we're in their house, too. We turn
the ball over and that kills you in this type of game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling if Simmons will get more work now. But the
player he replaced was impressed with his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony stepped in and played great,'' said Brown. ``He made some
big plays down the stretch.''

IN VIRUS OUTBREAK, A GLIMPSE OF GAPS IN DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS date in 16th graf of 2nd take) (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sept. 23, nearly three weeks after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani announced that New York was being attacked by a
mosquito-borne virus often found in the southern United States,
senior federal health officials convened a conference call to hear
some startling news.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist who initially identified the virus as St. Louis
encephalitis said he had changed his mind, according to an official
who was present. It was probably West Nile virus, a disease never
before seen in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the sudden turn, senior officials at the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention peppered their colleague
with questions. Was he sure? What testing was done? Was it
repeated?
</P>
<P>
   The officials decided not to inform New York of the new finding
immediately. They sent the scientist, Duane Gubler, back to his
laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo., to do more tests. He reconfirmed
the conclusion, and the next morning, calls went out to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Federal public health officials were chagrined but not overly
worried by the sudden switch in diagnosis. West Nile virus is
slightly less virulent than St. Louis encephalitis. And the city
was already eradicating the mosquitoes that transmitted the
disease, whatever it was.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement caused concern among many of the scientists
and government officials who are working to strengthen the nation's
defenses against biological warfare. They saw the New York outbreak
as a dress rehearsal, a test of how public health officials could
detect and deal with the sudden spread of a disease not typically
found in the United States. To them, the missed diagnosis was
unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The encephalitis outbreak in New York is a powerful lesson for
public health authorities,'' said Alan Zelicoff, a senior scientist
at the Center for National Security and Arms Control at Sandia
National Laboratories in New Mexico. ``It is a sobering, not so
reassuring, demonstration of the inadequacies of the U.S. detection
network for emerging diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal officials agree that there is much to be
learned from New York's experience that can be applied equally to
defense against biological warfare and the emerging need to deal
with the global spread of virulent disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the public health system performed well in many regards,
officials point to several key missteps. For instance, in testing
samples from the initial victims, the CDC screened only for six
viruses common in this country. The scientists did not test for
several that have been linked to foreign epidemics or germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the scientist holding a key clue to the true
identity of the virus, a bird specialist who had noticed the
unexplained deaths of crows near the Bronx Zoo, could not get
anyone at the CDC to return her calls for a week. In the end, she
turned to several other government laboratories, including a
military research center, to confirm her suspicions that the CDC
had the wrong virus.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the myriad state, local and federal agencies involved
in the investigation did not always communicate well with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned about the need for, and benefits of,
improvements in laboratory coordination,'' said Scott Lillibridge,
who leads the CDC's Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program.
``We've also learned how helpful surveillance can be, particularly
in beginning to track the beginning, extent or progress of an
infectious disease outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, the federal government has invested
hundreds of millions of dollars on a national program to defend
against biological terrorism. Several officials said that in light
of New York's experiences, much more money should be invested in
the public health systems that detect epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, Dr. Deborah Asnis, an infectious disease specialist
at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens, called the city's
Health Department with some distressing news _ two elderly patients
had come in with symptoms that looked like a neurological illness _
fever, muscle weakness and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcelle Layton, who heads the Health Department's Bureau of
Communicable Diseases, told Dr. Asnis to send samples to the state
Department of Health, and then called the CDC to warn them that
something _ maybe botulism _ was happening in New York City. As the
week went on, the number of sick people started to mount.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to Gubler, one of the CDC's experts on
diseases spread by insects. His suspicions focused on St. Louis
encephalitis, which is often found in the southeastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   To confirm his theory, Gubler tested the samples for antibodies
against six viruses transmitted by insects and commonly found in
the United States. The tests came back positive for St. Louis
encephalitis, which is a close relative of West Nile fever.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC announced on Sep. 3 that tests of blood and spinal fluid
had confirmed Gubler's suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor called a hasty news conference in Queens. His office
of emergency management took the helm and began a $6 million
campaign to wipe out New York's mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, New York City had practically cornered the nation's
supply of insect repellent, and 250,000 brochures about the disease
were printed and distributed, along with free repellent, by 500
city employees.
</P>
<P>
   And New Yorkers quickly began to debate which thing unknown to
their region they feared the most _ St. Louis encephalitis or
malathion, the insecticide that began to rain down from clacking
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bronx Zoo, officials were worrying about what seemed to
be a serious, but separate biological event. Since July, zoo
officials had been receiving calls from people in the Bronx and
Queens about dead birds. Four days after the city's St. Louis
encephalitis announcement, several exotic birds at the zoo were
dead. But not emus. And that made Tracey McNamara nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara, the head of the department of pathology at the
zoo, knew that St. Louis encephalitis, which is carried by birds
and transmitted through mosquitoes, does not normally kill the
birds.
</P>
<P>
   She considered the possibility that the birds were being killed
by another common form of encephalitis. But that disease is deadly
to emus, and the zoo's emus were thriving. Something much more
complicated was afoot, she reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The pathologist took to her lab, spending 12 hours a day
analyzing bird samples. What she found was so disturbing, she said,
that she called the CDC to alert them. The dead birds were bleeding
from the brain and had badly damaged hearts. Was a similar virus
infecting people?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had dead people and dead birds, and I thought we needed to
pursue this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also contacted the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames,
Iowa, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to study the
samples. Around the same time, Ward Stone, the chief wildlife
pathologist for the state Department of Environmental Conservation,
began noticing large numbers of dead crows, and alerted his
counterparts in New Jersey and Connecticut that something strange
was happening to the local bird population.
</P>
<P>
   While the CDC agreed to take some of Dr. McNamara's samples,
agency workers then did not return her daily calls for a week. ``I
got voice mail,'' she said. In fairness, she acknowledged, dead
people were taking precedence.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency seemed slow to grasp the possible link to the
birds' illness. Dr. McNamara is circumspect about criticizing her
colleagues at the CDC, but she said, ``I would say a lesson to be
learned was that there was some tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In the federal government's dress rehearsals of how a city might
detect and handle a sudden outbreak of disease, officials had
foreseen many different scenarios. But no one had anticipated an
outbreak in which crucial evidence would be uncovered by a wildlife
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we respond to introduced diseases in the wildlife
perspective is not very well resolved,'' said Michael Samuel, a
research project leader at the National Wildlife Health Center, a
unit of the Department of Interior, which is also researching New
York's outbreak. ``I don't know that we as a nation have a
contingency plan in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the acting deputy director for science and
public health at the CDC, said that confusion is a normal part of
an investigation of emerging disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who continues to maintain that there was some mistake
here doesn't understand the way science proceeds in outbreak
investigations,'' Ostroff said. ``You won't hear any apologies from
me.'' He said he was not aware of Dr. McNamara's repeated attempts
to reach CDC officials.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Bronx, Dr. McNamara was getting impatient. The
veterinary lab in Ames had already exhausted its capabilities, but
could not specifically identify the strange virus that was killing
the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara sent more samples to the CDC but she also put in a
call to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command,
looking for a favor. Could the laboratory, which does not usually
get involved with civilian requests, take a peek at her samples?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara, it turned out, had some chits to call in. She had
recently attended the wedding of the pathologist who performs such
tests. The lab agreed to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   The system was working, after a fashion. The military's finest
minds on bioterrorism had turned to New York's outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, Dr. McNamara sent the samples to the lab by
overnight mail. Within a day, the Army's unit, which is based in
Fort Detrick, Md., confirmed that a virus of a very different sort
was killing birds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the CDC was beginning to make the connections. On the
same day, officials at the agency called Dr. MacNamara and said
they wanted more material, which she sent out that evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, scientists at the Army lab told her that the tests
of bird samples for West Nile virus ``really lit up,'' Dr. McNamara
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, with help from each of the labs involved, had come to
the same conclusion that same day. The next day, the agency
announced that birds were dying in New York City, and a West
Nile-like virus was the reason. The scientists strongly suspected
that the humans had been killed by the same virus, but had yet to
confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came, strangely enough, from California. The New York
State Department of Health, without telling CDC, sent some of the
brain tissue from people believed to have died of St. Louis
encephalitis to a lab run by Ian Lipkin, a scientist at the
University of California in Irvine who had bumped into state
scientists at a conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, Lipkin found that a form of West Nile virus _ which
scientists now believe is similar to a strain previously found in
Europe _ had sickened the New York patients. Soon after, the CDC
reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``West Nile virus'' had little significance in New
York. But in Washington, they raised red flags among U.S.
intelligence officials who follow bioterrorism, according to a
report in this week's New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a supposed associate of Saddam Hussein published a
book in Britain in which he claimed that the Iraqi leader had
threatened in 1997 to unleash a form of West Nile virus against his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the Iraqi biological weapons program found no
evidence that Baghdad had ever experimented with the virus, and
intelligence officials, along with arms inspectors who had visited
Iraq's laboratories, concluded that the report was baseless.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie coincidence underscored what officials said was a new
reality. ``Sadly the world has changed. The threat of bioterrorism
is real and growing,'' said Dr. Margaret Hamburg, an assistant
secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services who was
previously head of the New York City Health Department. ``Whenever
a new or unexpected disease emerges in an outbreak such as this, it
would be irresponsible not to at least consider the possibility of
bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, the officials said, has been slow to spend money on
detecting outbreaks, even as it invests hundreds of millions in
other bio-defense efforts and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   This year, lawmakers for the first time approved $120 million to
strengthen the CDC's programs for education and monitoring disease.
However, the $40 million set aside for improving state and local
health detection was only disbursed late last month, as a West
Nile-like virus was spreading through New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending hundreds of millions on questionable stockpiles
of vaccines and antibiotics,'' said Zelicoff, the scientist at the
Sandia Laboratory. ``We should be improving the ability of local
public health officials to recognize and report strange illnesses
to a central authority that can quickly tell them what to do about
it.''

CINDY MCCAIN RECALLS STRUGGLE WITH PAINKILLER ADDICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Cindy McCain bared her soul on national television
Sunday, telling how she was addicted to painkillers and stole pills
from the relief agency she founded.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a new admission for Cindy, the wife of presidential
candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   More than frs ago, she spoke with handpicked reporters,
telling them that from 1989 to 1992, she was addicted to Percocet
and Vicodin and took drugs from the American Voluntary Medical
Team, which aided Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cindy McCain told ``Dateline NBC'' that it was tough
to talk about her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to relive a time in your life that you really
wish you never lived,'' she said. ``But it's also good for me to
talk about it, and I'm happy to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she admits she took the drugs from the relief
organization, she emphasized that no needy person failed to receive
medicine because of her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that were suffering were never deprived of anything . .
. I took a good portion of (the drugs) but I didn't take all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As John McCain makes his run for president, the issue of his
wife's addiction has remained in the background, though she has
been asked about it on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the ``Dateline'' interview served as a pre-emptive
strike against political opponents who might bring up the issue
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who also appeared on the show, said he should have
known about his wife's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should've detected this earlier on,'' he said on the TV
program. ``Clearly there were signs. . . . I'd call almost every
day, and sometimes she would sound a little bleary or a little kind
of unconnected and I would think, `Well, she's just tired or
sleepy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said he feels partially responsible for her problem, because
``maybe I was wrapped up too much in Washington and my ambitions to
pay as much attention as I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline'' skipped over some of the more gory details.
</P>
<P>
   The show failed to mention Tom Gosinski, a former AVMT employee
who accused Cindy McCain in a lawsuit of ordering him to conceal
``improper acts'' and ``misrepresent facts in a judicial
proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosinski had been fired from AVMT in 1993, and he alleged he was
let go because he knew too much about her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's attorney, John Dowd, charged that Gosinski was
extorting the McCains by offering to settle the case for $250,000.
That spawned an investigation by the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gosinski's lawsuit was dropped and he was never
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The show also failed to mention Gosinski's charge that Cindy
McCain had asked him to lie to make it easier for her to adopt a
baby from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, backed up by court documents, said at the time that
the adoption of Bridget McCain was ``proper in every respect'' and
saved the life of the child, who needed an operation in the United
States to correct a cleft palate.
</P>
<P>
   Gosinski also had credibility problems. In the county attorney's
report, several AVMT staffers said Gosinski had privately
threatened to blackmail the senator's wife if she ever fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain said she needed the extra drugs to deal with pain
from two back surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having difficulty walking and moving and doing all the
things, and with a young family that makes it very difficult,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The addiction also came during the toughest chapter in John
McCain's political career, the Keating Five scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that that had a very significant effect on Cindy,
because it was very terrible trial for us,'' her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of five senators who met with federal regulators on
behalf of Keating, a key figure in the nation's multibillion-dollar
savings and loan failure.
</P>
<P>
   The senator ultimately received a mild rebuke from the Senate
Ethics Committee for exercising poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was worried about getting caught, Cindy McCain
said, ``When you're addicted, no, you don't think about things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the addiction ended in 1992, where her parents
confronted her about her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   She told her husband about the addiction about a year later,
after she was contacted by the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, which was investigating drugs missing from AVMT.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know where the drugs were. . . . I told them
what I had done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed against her. She paid restitution and
performed community service, working in a soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his wife did something that was ``very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't change the fact that she's a good mother and
she's a good person and she was a member of an organization who
went around the world and did many good things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain said she still has something to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done good things,'' she said, ``and the best thing I've
done is go into recovery and stay drug-free.'' &QL;

RAIN FOILS GOLD CUP FAVORITES 
</HEADLINE>
 CLUB GOLD CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rains washed away the hopes of the backers of
Behrens and Lemon Drop Kid Sunday, as long shot River Keen stole
the show in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, the 4-5 favorite, is a Horse of the Year candidate, but
he could do no better than second after lagging too far back on a
sloppy, speed-favoring track. Lemon Drop Kid, vying for the
3-year-old championship, does not like a wet oval, and that was
further established Sunday as he finished fifth at 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   River Keen, a 7-year-old, was claimed at Hollywood Park Dec. 4
for $100,000 by trainer Bob Baffert on behalf of owner Hugo
Reynolds, who is in road construction, and the Irish-bred horse now
has earned more than $1.3 million for the pair. River Keen won the
Woodward at Belmont Sept. 18 at 5-1, yet he was given little chance
in the Gold Cup and was sent off at 12-1 ($26 to win) under Chris
Antley in the time of 2:01 2/5 for 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who has won 18 Grade I races this year, stayed at Santa
Anita to watch his top 2-year-old colt, Forest Camp, run in the
Norfolk Stakes, but he said River Keen nearly was scratched from
the Gold Cup. ``Seriously, we almost scratched this horse because
he was dead lame (Saturday) night,'' said Baffert. ``He popped a
quarter-crack (a tear in the hoof wall) last week, and we patched
it and it looked like he got a little bit of an infection in there.
They worked on it, and the crew did a really good job. I told them
that if he was still lame to scratch him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to put him into the race, and he was right there,
laying second,'' said Antley, whose own career was revived when he
rode Charismatic to triumphs in this year's Kentucky Derby and
Preakness. ``I found the best place I could for him on the track,
and he held smoothly and finished strong. I had a lot of horse the
whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   River Keen took over the lead turning for home and held off 7-2
chance Almutawakel, ridden by Jerry Bailey and owned by the
Godolphin Stable, through the stretch. Behrens, who was as far back
as sixth on a day during which few horses gained any ground, got up
in the last jump with Jorge Chavez to edge Almutawakel for the
place, but he was 3 1/4 lengths behind River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behrens showed me that he's courageous,'' said his trainer,
Jim Bond. ``He didn't like the surface at all, and he still got
second. They won't beat him in the Breeders' Cup (Nov. 6 at
Gulfstream Park). He needed a race, so we weren't going to
scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   River Keen, who, like Lemon Drop Kid, will go on to the
Breeders' Cup, has a record of 9-3-4-1 this season and has been
first or second in five straight stake races. Can a reformed
claimer be Horse of the Year? If he wins the $4 million Breeders'
Cup Classic, why not?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful Pleasure, an outstanding 4-year-old, showed
Silverbulletday, the presumptive 3-year-old filly champion, her
heels as she led from wire-to-wire to capture the $500,000 Beldame
in a dazzling display. Ridden by Chavez, Beautiful Pleasure, who is
very comfortable over the slop, set withering fractions, including
6 furlongs in 1:09 1/5, and she kept going until she hit the wire 4
3/4 lengths ahead in 1:47 3/5 for the 1 1/8-mile race. Trained by
John Ward, Beautiful Pleasure returned $6.80 to win as the 2-1
second choice. Silverbulletday, trained by Baffert and the winner
of 11 straight races against fellow fillies, chased Beautiful
Pleasure every step of the way at 2-5 with Bailey, but could not
gain, settling for second. ``Jorge Chavez did a wonderful job
today,'' said Ward. ``At times, I thought he was going to let
Silverbulletday get to him. Beautiful Pleasure has such a big
stride that you just have to let her use it in the slop. The
interesting thing about this big filly is that she didn't slide at
all. We were going to run our race today, no matter what. We made
Silverbulletday commit to our style, rather than us committing to
her style. I thought Silverbulletday ran pretty good, considering
she had to do things she didn't want to do. Beautiful Pleasure has
earned herself a spot in that Breeders' Cup Distaff race, and I'm
really looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surfside, a beautifully bred 2-year-old filly, ran to her
bloodlines with a courageous victory in the $400,000 Frizette
Stakes. Darling My Darling, the 7-5 choice under Chris McCarron,
took over the lead from Surfside turning for home, but Surfside
surged back with Pat Day to prevail by a head at 9-5 ($5.90 to win)
in the time of 1:43 for a mile and one-16th. A daughter of Triple
Crown winner Seattle Slew, out of Flanders, who was a 2-year-old
filly champion, Surfside gave Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas
his sixth Frizette winner. ``I was concerned about the mud, but it
turned out right,'' said Lukas. ``I give great credit to Pat Day.
When he has the right horse, he knows where he is at all times. Pat
always seems to save a horse for that extra jump or two. It was a
very, very positive sign for her to come back again; it bodes well
for her down the road. This will set her up for better efforts when
the races go two turns, such as at the Breeders' Cup.''

 SET FOR 3-DAY BREAST CANCER WALK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years ago, thoughts of death and mortality
dominated Barbara Cole's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the breast cancer survivor wants to show people how alive
she is. She's going to walk 60 miles Oct. 22 to Oct. 24 in the Avon
Breast Cancer 3-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's daughter, Amy, has her own reason for walking: her mom.
Amy Cole doesn't want anyone else to go through the roller coaster
of anxiety and dread she and her mother experienced. The walk and
the money it raises is a shout to other women to take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to turn your head and not hear it,'' said Amy Cole,
26. ``Maybe you don't take it all in but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coles are two of nearly 3,000 walkers set to walk from Santa
Barbara to Malibu. Last year, 2,300 participants raised $5 million
in the inaugural event. Three other cities, New York, Chicago and
Atlanta, are also hosting walks this year.
</P>
<P>
   The walks are part of a wave of awareness-raising events
nonexistent 25 years ago. At that time only 5 percent of breast
cancers were caught when they were in a pre-invasive state. The
percentage is now 30 percent, said Dr. Lawrence Bassett, director
of the Iris Cantor Center for Breast Imaging at UCLA. Bassett said
he has seen an exponential increase in the survival rate from
breast cancer since he began his career in 1975, thanks in part to
events like the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now is that there is a decrease overall not
just among women getting screening but among all women, so it looks
like the word is getting out,'' Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, early detection techniques such as self-exams and
mammography have been refined and debated. After years of
controversy, health organizations including the American Cancer
Society have come to the consensus that the age of 40 is the time
women should begin demanding mammograms. Because the X-ray-like
scans catch only 80 percent of breast tumors, Bassett said women
should should operate by a simple mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feel something, it needs to be worked up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The walk funds early detection and education programs around the
country. Most of those programs target low-income and minority
women.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Mallin is walking to honor the memory of his wife, Betty, a
high school counselor who died of breast cancer last year at age
62. Mallin thinks she might have lived longer had she found her
tumor earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had she caught it perhaps a couple years prior, she might have
been helped by it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mallin saw an advertisement of the walk in a newspaper last
April and signed up as a way to say goodbye and started training.
He still hears her voice, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's saying to me she's very pleased that I got into shape,
that I'm doing something to help others and if she were alive
today, she'd be doing the walk,'' said Mallin, a 70-year-old
Realtor.
</P>
<P>
   The Coles and Mallin, like all the other walkers, committed to
raising at least $1,700 each in sponsorships. It sounded like a lot
to Barbara Cole, but she was surprised by the responses to the
appeal letter she sent out months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting Christmas presents for months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The money is one thing, said Cole, whose cancer has been in
remission since earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But she hopes the sight of her face as she walks, her flushed
cheeks, sweat on her brow, will deliver another benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very private person,'' she said. ``This was a coming out
of the closet, a final close-the-door, I'm-moving-on kind of thing.
I'd like there to be a cure but until there is, just getting people
to talk about it and educate is good.''

   WATERPACT (Phoenix) _ If water is power _ and in the arid West,
water is everything _ the balance of power in Arizona is about to
shift. State and federal negotiators are working on an agreement
that could leave 10 Indian tribes in control of nearly half the
Colorado River water that flows through the Central Arizona Project
Canal. It's enough water to serve an urban population of more than
3 million, and someday it just might. The Clinton administration is
determined to see that the tribes get water. Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt has made it clear that he will use his authority to
take the water from the state if talks fail. Arizona officials
believe some sort of agreement is in everyone's best interest. The
tribes, which want the water to settle decades-old claims against
the federal government, likely would lease some of their bounty
back to farmers,who stand to lose the most in the deal, or to
cities thirsty to accommodate new growth. BY SHAUN MCKINNON. Story

GORE HOPES ARIZONA TRIP BOLSTERS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The last time Vice President Al Gore campaigned in
Arizona, he was jubilant because he and his boss, President
Clinton, were sweeping to an easy re-election that included a
historic victory in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today (MONDAY, OCT. 11), Gore will return as a presidential
candidate in his own right, making a brief swing through Phoenix to
scoop up campaign cash for his unexpectedly tight Democratic
primary battle against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, scheduled to arrive in Phoenix in the morning, will tour a
locol to highlight school overcrowding, then attend a
$250-a-person fund-raiser at Eddie Matney's restaurant in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser is expected to push Gore's Arizona contribution
total over $250,000 _ compared with the $126,000 Bradley had raised
by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent Arizona poll, conducted by Arizona State
University pollster Bruce Merrill, Gore still led Bradley among
Arizona Democrats, 42 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's front-runner status appears increasingly shaky,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore still has a core amount of support here, and if you took
a poll you'd see him ahead, but I think you'd see Bradley closing
like he has all over the country,'' said Sen. George Cunningham,
D-Tucson, who has endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, recent surveys by pollster Earl de Berge have shown
just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that Gore has admitted this is a campaign has
attracted the interest of voters,'' de Berge said. ``And I think
many of them just have real doubts as to whether or not Gore can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, while still trailing Gore in polls, has planted a
foothold in the southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign swing in June, he wooed local Democrats in
Tucson, won the endorsement of that city's mayor, and raised more
than $15,000 for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big hit,'' Cunningham said, noting that southern
Arizonans seem to like Bradley's cerebral, unapologetically liberal
style.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Gore's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the vice president say he will easily outstrip
Bradley's Arizona fund-raising totals. And he retains the loyalty
of most of the state's elected Democratic officials, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They expect voters to warm to his message, too, especially in
the wake of his high-profile makeover, which includes loosening the
stays on his once-rigid wardrobe and moving his headquarters from
Washington, D.C., to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no place to go but up,'' said state Rep. Ken Cheuvront,
D-central Phoenix. ``People have such low expectations of him right
now, they don't look at him as a great orator or speaker, when in
reality when you listen to him he does a great job. I think
people's attitudes will change when they see him in person.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cunningham, Gore's face-off with Bradley is great
for Democrats, who get to pick the best of two quality candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both reek of substance, and they both are on the right
side of the issues most of the time,'' Cunningham said. ``And the
differences between the two are shades of gray rather than black or
white. I think that we could easily support whomever got the
Democratic nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Cheuvront suggested that Gore will grow stronger
fending off Bradley's challenge from the Democratic left-wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore was faltering, and this is making him become more
hardened,'' Cheuvront said. ``It will get him ready for a very
tough general election campaign.'' &QL;

CINDY MCCAIN RECALLS STRUGGLE WITH PAINKILLER ADDICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Cindy McCain bared her soul on national television
Sunday, telling how she was addicted to painkillers and stole pills
from the relief agency she founded.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a new admission for Cindy, the wife of presidential
candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, she spoke with handpicked reporters,
telling them that from 1989 to 1992, she was addicted to Percocet
and Vicodin and took drugs from the American Voluntary Medical
Team, which aided Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cindy McCain told ``Dateline NBC'' that it was tough
to talk about her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to relive a time in your life that you really
wish you never lived,'' she said. ``But it's also good for me to
talk about it, and I'm happy to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she admits she took the drugs from the relief
organization, she emphasized that no needy person failed to receive
medicine because of her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that were suffering were never deprived of anything . .
. I took a good portion of (the drugs) but I didn't take all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As John McCain makes his run for president, the issue of his
wife's addiction has remained in the background, though she has
been asked about it on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the ``Dateline'' interview served as a pre-emptive
strike against political opponents who might bring up the issue
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who also appeared on the show, said he should have
known about his wife's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should've detected this earlier on,'' he said on the TV
program. ``Clearly there were signs. . . . I'd call almost every
day, and sometimes she would sound a little bleary or a little kind
of unconnected and I would think, `Well, she's just tired or
sleepy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said he feels partially responsible for her problem, because
``maybe I was wrapped up too much in Washington and my ambitions to
pay as much attention as I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline'' skipped over some of the more gory details.
</P>
<P>
   The show failed to mention Tom Gosinski, a former AVMT employee
who accused Cindy McCain in a lawsuit of ordering him to conceal
``improper acts'' and ``misrepresent facts in a judicial
proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosinski had been fired from AVMT in 1993, and he alleged he was
let go because he knew too much about her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's attorney, John Dowd, charged that Gosinski was
extorting the McCains by offering to settle the case for $250,000.
That spawned an investigation by the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gosinski's lawsuit was dropped and he was never
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The show also failed to mention Gosinski's charge that Cindy
McCain had asked him to lie to make it easier for her to adopt a
baby from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, backed up by court documents, said at the time that
the adoption of Bridget McCain was ``proper in every respect'' and
saved the life of the child, who needed an operation in the United
States to correct a cleft palate.
</P>
<P>
   Gosinski also had credibility problems. In the county attorney's
report, several AVMT staffers said Gosinski had privately
threatened to blackmail the senator's wife if she ever fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain said she needed the extra drugs to deal with pain
from two back surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having difficulty walking and moving and doing all the
things, and with a young family that makes it very difficult,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The addiction also came during the toughest chapter in John
McCain's political career, the Keating Five scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that that had a very significant effect on Cindy,
because it was very terrible trial for us,'' her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of five senators who met with federal regulators on
behalf of Keating, a key figure in the nation's multibillion-dollar
savings and loan failure.
</P>
<P>
   The senator ultimately received a mild rebuke from the Senate
Ethics Committee for exercising poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was worried about getting caught, Cindy McCain
said, ``When you're addicted, no, you don't think about things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the addiction ended in 1992, where her parents
confronted her about her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   She told her husband about the addiction about a year later,
after she was contacted by the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, which was investigating drugs missing from AVMT.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know where the drugs were. . . . I told them
what I had done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed against her. She paid restitution and
performed community service, working in a soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his wife did something that was ``very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't change the fact that she's a good mother and
she's a good person and she was a member of an organization who
went around the world and did many good things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain said she still has something to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done good things,'' she said, ``and the best thing I've
done is go into recovery and stay drug-free.'' &QL;

WATER PACT COULD GIVE INDIAN TRIBES HALF OF COLORADO RIVER
RESOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If water is power _ and in the arid West, water is
everything _ the balance of power in Arizona is about to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and federal negotiators are working on an agreement that
could leave 10 Indian tribes in control of nearly half the Colorado
River water that flows through the Central Arizona Project Canal.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough water to serve an urban population of more than 3
million, and someday it just might.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is determined to see that the tribes
get water. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has made it clear that
he will use his authority to take the water from the Arizona if
talks fail. Arizona officials believe some sort of agreement is in
everyone's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, which want the water to settle decades-old claims
against the federal government, likely would lease some of their
bounty back to farmers, who stand to lose the most in the deal, or
to cities thirsty to accommodate new growth.
</P>
<P>
   What worries some CAP users is the prospect of an open water
market that could someday force farmers to compete with cities, or
even pit Arizona against neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here long-term is drying up Pinal County,''
Eloy farmer Norm Pretzer warned Arizona officials. ``It's going to
be pumped dry, and that's going to be it for us. That's going to be
one hell of a drive to Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian water claims against the federal government have bubbled
beneath the surface for years with only scattered success. &QL; 
BABBITT PUSHES ISSUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue took on a new urgency recently. Babbitt, a former
Arizona governor, began pushing for a final agreement. And Arizona
officials formally linked the tribal claims to a plan that would
end a long-standing dispute over financing the $4.7 billion Central
Arizona Project.
</P>
<P>
   The 336-mile canal each year carries 1.5 million acre-feet of
Colorado River water, potentially enough for more than 7 million
urban residents, to Maricopa, Pinal and Pima counties. It supplies
ever-greater portions of the drinking water used by the rapidly
growing populations in Phoenix and Tucson. &QL; Unresolved issues
</P>
<P>
   Tribal water rights are part of three unresolved issues
involving the project:
</P>
<P>
   _How should as yet unused and excess portions of the CAP waterided, and who should control those amounts?
</P>
<P>
   _ How much CAP water should be used to help the federal
government settle ancestral water claims among the Arizona's Indian
tribes?
</P>
<P>
   _How much of the CAP's cost should Arizona repay to the federal
government? Arizona sued the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to avoid
paying what it claimed were cost overruns. A judge sided with the
state on key issues, and Arizona last month proposed its repayment
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have long sought to connect all three
questions. The state has objected, saying that the issues are
separate. But in its proposal to settle the CAP repayment costs,
the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, run by 15 elected
Arizonans, included a resolution that could help settle the Indian
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Pearson, director of the Arizona Department of Water
Resources, said linking all the CAP disputes may ultimately speed
final agreements, though she cautioned against piling on too much
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is a delicate balance,'' she said. ``The
momentum of tying these things together is bringing momentum for
closure on all three. But on the other hand, too many issues can
weigh it down. It's like riding a bicycle downhill. More weight
will make it go faster, but too much and you crash and burn.'' &QL; 
`FAIR AND REASONABLE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although more than a half-dozen Arizona tribes are pursuing
water claims, the most critical negotiations surround the Gila
River Indian Community, which already controls the biggest share of
CAP water among the Arizon's tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Gila River spokesman Gary Bohnee said the community is seeking
only a fair and reasonable settlement, one that addresses the
tribe's ancestral claims. He said tribal officials are pleased that
the negotiations seem to be moving forward again.
</P>
<P>
   But Cecil Antone, the tribe's lieutenant governor, leaves no
room for confusion about what will happen if those talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community will have to continue litigation that we
anticipate may last many more decades and continue to cost all
parties literally tens or hundreds of millions of dollars,'' Antone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and federal officials are close to a deal that would
give the Gila River Community nearly 150,000 acre-feet of
additional CAP water. On paper, the two sides are about 5,000
acre-feet apart, but it's not as simple as meeting halfway. An
acre-foot equals 326,000 gallons. &QL;  ARIZONA SEEKS CEILING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona wants to set a ceiling on how much CAP water the federal
government can take for tribal claims. Federal negotiators don't
want their hands tied. Arizona farmers want to be compensated for
the water they will give up to settle the claim. Federal officials
are not eager to wade into non-federal water use.
</P>
<P>
   Many CAP users also want restrictions that say no water given up
by the Arizona in any of the negotiations can be sold or leased
beyond Arizona's borders. Some fear the large pools of unused water
could find its way into negotiations with water-starved California
and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be absolute, in indelible ink,'' said George
Campbell, a member of the CAP board of directors. ``We have to say
there is not and will not be any condition that would allow water
to leave the state of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   No Arizona tribal official has publicly suggested marketing the
water out of state, but the issue festers elsewhere. Just across
the Colorado River in California, the Chemehuevi Tribe has tried to
lease some of its unused water to needy urban users in Los Angeles
and San Diego. &QL; 
LOT AT STAKE FOR TRIBES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Leivas, the tribe's former chairman, said leasing the
water would infuse badly needed cash into the tribe's agricultural
program and could help tribal members become more self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribes have a lot at stake,'' Leivas said. ``I think it's
time we came together. People have to show more respect for the
river. We need to protect it, but we need to get our fair share,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind most of the uneasiness in Arizona is a giant pool of
water, which in the West might as well be another Comstock Lode. If
all the settlements now on the table are approved, 10 tribes will
share control of more than 600,000 acre-feet.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, Nevada's entire share of the
Colorado is 300,000 acre-feet, an allotment that serves an urban
valley of about 1.3 million people surrounding Las Vegas. All 10
tribes combined number barely 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said it's important to remember that many of the tribes
need water for farming operations, which consume more water than
urban use. The Gila River Community produces cotton, wheat,
alfalfa, barley and other crops on about 12,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture, in fact, is threason the tribes have claimed
so much water. A 1908 U.S. Supreme Court decision awarded tribes
enough water to meet the purpose of the reservation. For many of
the Arizona tribes, that purpose is agriculture. &QL; 
FARMERS PAYING PRICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But non-Indian farmers say they're the ones paying the highest
price. Under Babbitt's proposed settlement, as much as 200,000
acre-feet now set aside for agricultural use would be taken to
settle the tribal claims.
</P>
<P>
   David Iwanski, executive vice president of the Arizona
Agri-Business Council, said farmers understand they were never to
have a permanent share of CAP water. But they aren't prepared to
give up what they have without compensation, whether it's money or
an assured water supply for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture continues to be the largest user of CAP water,''
Iwanski said. ``We need to respect the fact that debt was incurred
by the farmers and the irrigation districts, and they need that
water to repay that debt. It will take some time before Indian
communities have the infrastructure in place to use their share.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Orme, an attorney representing the Central Arizona
Irrigation and Drainage District, said the settlement as proposed
would hit not only farmers, but in Pinal County, it would end
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question this settlement is being made on the
backs of the people who use water in Pinal County,'' he said. ``Our
growth has to be protected. We need some assurance for future
water.'' &QL; 
URBAN AREAS AFFECTED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County cities also are concerned about the effect of
the deal on growth, though many are already talking to tribes about
leasing water. Scottsdale, Peoria, Goodyear, Mesa and other
communities need more CAP water if they are to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Kohlhoff, assistant utilities manager for Mesa, said the
outcome of the tribal settlements are important to help preserve an
assured water supply for cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Arizona water needs to be used in Arizona for
Arizonans,'' Kohlhoff said. If current talks fail, he added, ``the
losers will be the tribes and everyone in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona negotiators want to keep the talks on track if only to
avoid something much worse. In laying out his latest proposal,
Babbitt also spelled out the alternatives. Without a negotiated
agreement, the Interior secretary indicated he is prepared to take
whatever water he thinks necessary. That includes nearly 66,000
acre-feet of still unallocated municipal water that has become a
holy grail for Arizona water officials.
</P>
<P>
   David Hayes, Babbitt's chief deputy and lead water negotiator,
said the secretary isn't trying to use the other proposals as a
club against Arizona, but he wants everyone to understand that
settling tribal claims is a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have a mutually agreeable settlement,'' Hayes
said. By negotiating, he said, Arizona not only creates a future
water source, it avoids a costly and drawn-out court battle that
the tribes could well win. &QL;

BIOSPHERE: DESERT GREENHOUSE RISES FROM `ECO-CULT' TO RESEARCH
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORACLE, Ariz. _ It's been a long, strange trip _ from desert
``eco-cult'' to reputable research center.
</P>
<P>
   But in eight years, the massive glass-and-steel pyramid and
eggshell-like buildings of Biosphere 2 have emerged as a genuine
educational and scientific proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very reputable scientist, and I endorse 100 percent
what's going on out there,'' said Wally Broecker, a geochemist at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Broecker has been a driving force behind Columbia's involvement
in Biosphere 2 ever since he was tapped in 1991 to stem the loss of
oxygen inside the once-hermetically sealed structure.
</P>
<P>
   That was nine months into the first experiment, run by the
controversial and now-defunct Space Biosphere Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Four men and four women, known as Biospherians, were cloistered
in the $200 million facility to determine whether they could live
solely off the structure's man-made ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Among the goals was to determine whether Space Biosphere
Ventures ultimately could colonize the moon or even a distant
planet, ``which I thought rather bizarre,'' Broecker said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``You wouldn't transport something the size of the
biosphere to the moon. You size up the weight and forget it; it's
too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, traditional agriculture used inside Biosphere 2
would never work outside the Earth's atmosphere, Broecker said.
Instead, hydroponically grown crops would have been the best hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Broecker disputes reports that Biosphere managers ``were
cheating'' when they pumped oxygen into the vacuum enclosed
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``To their credit, it was extremely well engineered,'' Broecker
said. ``Despite media reports, they were not cheating. They were
too directed. They sacrificed those eight (people) in there to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Biospherians also were charged with conducting experiments
and coping with a ``Gilligan's Island'' existence, marooned inside
the massive structure in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were being starved for oxygen, and they had a lot of
things to do in there,'' Broecker continued. ``Plus, one group of
four didn't get along with the other group of four. They were
skinny, their faces were pocked, they looked unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations also surfaced in published reports that the
Biospherians faced further duress at the hands of Space Biospheres
Ventures co-founder John Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused Allen of running a cult in which he ruled by
fear and intimidation. Allen vehemently denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But they persist even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a religious cult, but an eco-cult,'' Broecker said.
</P>
<P>
   An unpaid consultant, Broecker tried to convince Space Biosphere
Ventures to rethink its experiments. In 1994, halfway through the
living experiment with a second group of Biospherians, the
project's financial backer, Texas billionaire Edward Bass, pulled
the plug entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bass' financial people decided to give the cult the
heave-ho, and it was a cult . . . they then put the Biosphere in
the hands of a management company,'' Broecker recalled. That firm,
he added, spent 1{ years trying to stabilize it and turn it over to
more stable leadership. &QL; 
TAKES OVER FACILITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Columbia came in.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, which formed a science partnership with Biosphere 2 in
1994, expanded its role by taking over the facility two years
later, turning it into a research and teaching facility.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover added a much-need air of legitimacy to Biosphere 2.
</P>
<P>
   Guanghui Lin, an associate scientist who joined Biosphere 2 in
1996, recalled when he submitted his first research paper to a
peer-reviewed scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came back to me like it wasn't worthy research because it
was from Biosphere 2,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent papers were met with far less resistance, and
were soon published in such journals as ``Oecologia and
Biodiversity and Allelopathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's crowning achievement came earlier this year with
the publication of research on how increases in carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is hurting the ocean's coral reefs. The findings
were published in ``Science,'' one of the top scientific journals
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a very nice study there, which is absolutely
scientifically valid,'' said Steven Wofsy, an atmospheric scientist
at Harvard University. ``They didn't answer all the questions, but
you never do in science.'' &QL; 
CLIMATE ZONES STUDIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the research being conducted at the Biosphere 2 is being
done in one of three biomes, or climate zones: an ocean, a rain
forest and a managed forest.
</P>
<P>
   Wofsy, who studies global change, said Biosphere 2 is unique in
its ability to run studies to answer questions, such as what the
ecosystem might look like in 50 or 100 years with the increasing
buildup of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could say you could legitimately criticize it (the
coral reef study) by saying that's just a big pot of water with a
wave machine,'' he said. ``But that will be true with any
environmental study.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the ecosystems in Biosphere 2 is designed to replicate
the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these systems are perfect analogs to the outside
world,'' John Adams of Biosphere 2 said.
</P>
<P>
   But the artificial nature of the glass-dome structure is what
makes the Biosphere 2 a giant lab that allows researchers to tinker
with various aspects of the environment and measure the results
more precisely than in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's valid,'' Wofsy said, ``and in some respects, it's
an elegant place to do these experiments.'' &QL;

   Here is Anne Stephenson's ``New &AMP; Notable'' column forthe week
of Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   ``PHYSIOGNOMY: THE MARK SELIGER PHOTOGRAPHS'' &QL; 
(Bulfinch, $75) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have not lived until you've seen Brad Pitt in an evening
gown and goggles. Better yet, look at Drew Barrymore dancing nearly
naked with a sumo wrestler. Or Aerosmith's Steven Tyler with his
lips spread just as wide as they will go (that is to say shockingly
wide _ Tyler can look like a contortionist just by opening his
mouth). Or Keith Richards playing dominoes. Or Howard Stern wearing
a crown of thorns (think about it). On the cover _ the stunned
look, we assume, is from the makeup session _ is Jerry Seinfeld as
the Tin Man. Just inside is a perplexed-looking Tom Hanks
scratching his brow with ape hands. Trust us _ you will look at
this picture for a long, long time. In fact, if you pull this book
out in public, a crowd will gather _ it's that big a draw. Maybe
it's the celebrity factor. Maybe it's Seliger's unpredictable way
with his subjects, who seem willing to do the oddest things at his
request. As chief photographer for ``Rolling Stone,'' he has put
famous faces in the most surreal and unusual circumstances. The
photos go largely unexplained, and we found that to be irritating.
Also, the subjects remain unidentified until the very back of the
book, which makes for some confusion because it's really hard to
tell who some of them are. But those are quibbles. The book is
pricey but fun. With an introduction by Eric Bogosian. &QL; 
``SHE SAID YES'' &QL; 
By Misty Bernall (Plough, $17) &QL; 
It's at issue whether 17-year-old Cassie Bernall said anything at
all before she was shot to death in April at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo. Did Dylan Klebold ask her whether she believed
in God and did she say yes before he pulled the trigger? Her
parents choose to believe she did despite reports to the contrary,
and her mother has now written this book _ proof that grieving
people need to impart some meaning to the death of a child and that
the attention of strangers is oddly comforting. Beyond religious
fervor and parental sorrow, however, Misty Bernall tells another
important story. Three years ago, Cassie was a difficult
ninth-grader whose conversations with friends touched on drugs,
sex, self-mutilation and violence toward teachers and parents.
Misty discovered this when she read letters Cassie had written to a
friend, whereupon the stunned Bernalls did what Misty calls ``the
hardest thing you can ever do as parents: to put your foot down and
say, `This stops right here.' '' They immediately put Cassie into
another school, regularly searched her room, tapped the phone and
forbade her to see her old friends even though they knew it might
backfire and drive Cassie further away. When Cassie's friends
vandalized their house, they moved to another neighborhood to keep
her away from them. Cassie eventually got better, but it's
impossible to read about this troubled girl at war with her
desperate parents and not think of the boys who later murdered her.
What Cassie Bernall said that day is not as important as what two
other parents wrote to the Bernalls a month later: ``We will never
understand why this tragedy happened,'' Sue and Tom Klebold said,
``or what we might have done to prevent it. We apologize for the
role our son had in your Cassie's death. We never saw anger or
hatred in Dylan until the last moments of his life when we watched
in helpless horror with the rest of the world. . . . May God bring
peace and understanding to all of our wounded hearts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WHAT IF?'' &QL; 
Edited by Robert Cowley (Putnam, $27.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What if, in the summer of 1941, Adolph Hitler had made his major
attack not into Soviet Russia but into Syria and Lebanon _ would he
then have won a strategic position that could have brought him
eventual victory? Or what if, early in his invasion of the Persian
empire, the young King Alexander had been dealt a second blow with
an ax (the first had damaged Alexander's helmet and left him
disoriented and unable to defend himself) by a Persian noble named
Spithridates? What if Alexander's bodyguard had not speared
Spithridates before he could strike again and destroy Alexander's
chance of becoming ``great''? If you feel your blood pounding, the
goose bumps rising, your heart soaring with the thrill of it . . .
then you must be a historian. If you dozed off before the first
question mark, you are a civilian and should refrain from looking
at this book lest you asphyxiate on the futility of it all. This is
an expansion of the the 10th anniversary issue of ``MHQ: The
Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' in which the editor asked
historians to write about the most important ``might-have-beens''
of military history. They had so much fun that many came back for
more. Contributors include John Keegan (who explores the
aforementioned Hitler scenario), David McCullough, Stephen E.
Ambrose and James M. McPherson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LONG PROGRAM'' &QL; 
By Peggy Fleming (Pocket, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Figure-skating champion Peggy Fleming is too nice to write a
book. She didn't get angry at her son when his girlfriend turned up
pregnant. She doesn't blame her mother for being a control freak.
She has been married to the same man for a million years. She went
into a depression during her recent treatment for breast cancer,
but that was caused by a drug _ she stopped taking it, and her
sadness disappeared. We ask you: Where's the dirt? Where's the
trouble? The answer is that there is none. Fleming is as nice as
she appears to be and then some (she calls Nancy Kerrigan ``a very
ungracious loser'' for her behavior after Oksana Baiul beat her in
the 1994 Olympics _ for Fleming, that's like hurling obscenities).
This memoir, which covers her career and personal life, is not
exactly scintillating reading, but Fleming is so likable that we
decline to say more. &QL;

SONICS TRY TO MESH MISHMASH LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Apparently, the Sonics are serious about this.
</P>
<P>
   They really are thinking about going into the regular season
with guys who played last year in France (Emanual Davis), Argentina
(Lazaro Borrell), Turkey (Shammond Williams) and the Dominican
Republic (Fred Vinson). They join Russian-born Vladimir Stepania, a
one-year Sonic vet.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Seattle's team. This is Ellis Island's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics might finish in the bottom half of the Western
Conference, but they've already won the airline-miles championship
entering training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stepania and Borrell (a Cuban refugee) are the only
foreign nationals. The rest of the guys are American, although
certainly not All-America in basketball, and not good enough a year
ago to stick on an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the bottom of a roster is rarely a factor
in a championship, it's also true that most championship teams
recruit internationally for the top stars, not for expatriates who
couldn't find work in the booming American job market.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer the Sonics found themselves combing the bazaars
of Istanbul and Buenos Aires, hoping to find someone (begin italic)
si habla (end italic) jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   After just a single display, Sunday's scrimmage at KeyArena,
it's hard to say whether the Sonics' shopping foray has added
merely a bunch of $5 Rolexes.
</P>
<P>
   What is apparent is that none of them are Scottie Pippen, whom
the Portland Trail Blazers recently acquired for a bunch of $5
Rolexes.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of deal-making that (begin italic) didn't (end
italic) go on in Seattle that puts a question mark on this season
bigger and more crooked than a Vin Baker free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen makes the Blazers the third Western team that figures to
be almost unbeatable for the Sonics, behind the Los Angeles Lakers
and NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. Throw in Utah because Karl
Malone and John Stockton put the Jazz ahead 15-0 just by showing
up, and the Sonics for the 1999-2000 season are among many
undistinguished puppies attempting to get out from under the same
heavy blanket for the West's four remaining roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, the Sonics this summer in the free agent
derby struck out on plans A, B and C, then called a halt to
alphabetizing before they ran out of letters and had to borrow from
Cyrillic.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a mishmash, a collection of unproven youngsters
and vets on the downside, most of whom have never spent a moment in
the of Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that there will be start-up problems this season is
to suggest that the New Carissa had a little trouble getting off
the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   As it was put by forward Horace Grant, perhaps the premier new
acquisition, ``This is the first time in my 13 years in the NBA
I've started with a team that had only three or four guys from the
previous year.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the number is five, but three, Stepania, Jelani McCoy
and Rashard Lewis, were rookies. A fourth, Baker, was here but
proof came only via dental records on numerous scones.
</P>
<P>
   But tempting as it is to write off the season as Gary Payton and
the 11 dwarfs _ thereby setting a personal record of a complete
seasonal dismissal before the first exhibition game _ restraint
will prevail, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   This roster is so convulsed that it is impossible to forecast an
outcome. Yes, it is a mishmash, but mishmashes make the playoffs in
the NBA all the time. They never win championships, but no one who
saw Sunday's unveiling, including the Sonics' brass, would offer up
the C-word sober.
</P>
<P>
   What the Sonics have a shot at is to be so completely different
than last year's team as to be moderately entertaining. They have
lost three respected elder statesmen in Hersey Hawkins, Detlef
Schrempf and Dale Ellis, but they have added a bunch of
streetballers who make up with youth and chaos what they lack in
elegance and two-handed chest passes.
</P>
<P>
   For what seems like the 15th consecutive year, the Sonics still
do not have a solid center. In fact, they really don't have a
center at all, figuring to share the pivot among forwards Grant,
Baker and Greg Foster, all of whom are mostly basket-facing jump
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   They don't even have a real front-line banger, although Grant
figures to have at least another year's rebounding and defense in
his 34-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   What they have is a bunch of relatively little guys who like to
hoist and yap. A few of them even care about defense, which might
provide some drama until the ball is lobbed into the hands of
Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan or Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, the Sonics appear to have assembled a bunch
of retreads who hope to hold the fort until McCoy, Lewis and
Stepania get mean and smart.
</P>
<P>
   In the little picture, without an acquisition the caliber of
Pippen, Mitch Richmond, Steve Smith or Penny Hardaway, the Sonics
are hoping for so much sizzle that few customers will notice the
kitchen omitted the steak.
</P>
<P>
   If you were thinking about going on a sports diet, the Sonics
might have a team for you.

SCHOOLS TAKE AIM AT MESSY BATHROOMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Antoinette Reicheach visits the restroom at
Grant High School, she packs her own tissue and soap _ just in case
supplies run short.
</P>
<P>
   At San Fernando High School, student body president Natalie
Hernandez has made bathroom reform a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is never, ever soap,'' Hernandez said. ``The boys'
bathroom is bad, too. I just walk by, and it reeks of urine.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the state of campus restrooms in the Los Angeles Unified
School District.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by stopped-up toilets, empty paper towel dispensers
and graffiti-marred walls, some schools have declared war on messy
student bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how hard our staff works _ vandalism, clogged
commodes, paper towels thrown on the floor and put in the sink all
wet _ that takes staff time. That's a constant battle,'' said
Robert Hamm, deputy director of operations in the district's
Maintenance and Operations Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Although a small number of students vandalize restrooms, keeping
them clean at 532 schools districtwide is a Sisyphean task for
custodians whose ranks have been cut by 35 percent during the past
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   To have enough custodial staff to keep pace with the problem,
Hamm said the district would need to hire an additional 1,255
employees at a cost of $40.1 million in salaries, benefits and
supplies. The district now employs 2,300 custodians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody recognizes that we're drastically understaffed,''
Hamm said. ``The staff that we do have has a range of duties,
including restrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Evan Smith, plant manager at Grant High School,
where graffiti and occasional trash fires keep custodians busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our toughest job, and it's the most important because
it's a health issue,'' said Smith, whose custodians clean school
restrooms after nutrition break, lunch and throughout the day as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Grant High School Principal Joseph Walker said he understands
the task facing school custodians. He would like to assign aides to
patrol the bathrooms and hallways in the school's two main
classroom buildings but said he doesn't have the budget to hire
more employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't maintain safety and maintain the bathrooms at the same
time,'' Walker said. ``I don't have aides to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   SMART RESTROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the district's Maintenance and Operations
Branch began a concerted effort to upgrade school restrooms by
outfitting them with ``smart technology'' _ sensors that
automatically operate urinals, commodes, sinks and hand driers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really been a blessing for us,'' said Thane Opfell,
assistant principal at Monroe High School, which installed the
electronic sensors on urinals and hand dryers in two student
restrooms last year.
</P>
<P>
   Opfell said the automatic hand dryers eliminate the need for
paper towels _ the weapon of choice among vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes a difference in appearance. You don't have
paper towels thrown on the floor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the district's maintenance budget, the improvements
also include new tile, paint, stall doors and partitions to
restrooms that need them. The cost to upgrade a restroom can range
from $7,500 for smart technology to $10,000 including paint, new
tile and other improvements.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the technology has been installed in 134 restrooms at 67
schools. This year, maintenance and operations officials want to
upgrade 100 restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe has also reduced vandalism by posting campus aides
outside the two refurbished restrooms during nutrition break and
lunch. Aides and administrators check other bathrooms throughout
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Opfell likens the task of patrolling student restrooms to
controlling air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get there regularly and on a set schedule to
monitor for graffiti and supply shortages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And to discourage graffiti, Monroe students are in the process
of painting colorful murals in restrooms throughout the school. The
newly refurbished boys' restroom sports an Aztec-themed mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has reduced tremendously the amount of graffiti,'' said
Liz Herrera, Monroe's student body president.
</P>
<P>
   GIVING CUSTODIANS A REAS
</P>
<P>
   At Taft, a series of vandalism incidents prompted school
officials to create an anonymous tip line that students could call
to report suspected hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   The approach has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made all the difference,'' said Assistant Principal Jim
Szabo. ``We made it public to the kids that the only way to have
clean, safe restrooms that are well stocked with paper goods was to
eliminate students who have a different agenda than the rest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At San Fernando High School, students are keeping a close eye on
two new restrooms that have smart technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have been taking care of it,'' said Assistant
Principal Hewitt Hornbeck, who has staked out bathrooms to reduce
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day it was open, a small amount of graffiti was
found in one corner and toilet paper was heaped in a big pile in
the middle of the floor,'' Hornbeck said. ``The kids were so mad
because it was such a nice clean bathroom that they ratted on (the
vandal).''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, San Fernando's student body president, hopes other
school bathrooms will be refurbished if the two new restrooms are
kept in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to have dirty bathrooms,'' Hernandez said. ``With
the smart technology bathrooms, students see that it's clean and
they want to keep it clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, students and administrators said they will
continue fighting bathroom grime.
</P>
<P>
   The district's Maintenance and Operations Branch is considering
rewarding schools where restrooms sparkle. Some of the rewards
could include painting the restrooms and installing smart
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids feel like they need to vandalize the bathrooms.
Unfortunately we can't seem to eliminate the problem,'' Opfell
said. ``We have to manage it and take care of it with the resources
we have.''

IT'S A WILD DAY FOR BAFFERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ You can't win 'em all. It turns out not even Bob
Baffert can win 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's Breeders' Cup preparations suffered setbacks at
odds-on Sunday when leading California 2-year-old Forest Camp lost
to Dixie Union in a fast-paced Norfolk Stakes at sunny Santa Anita
and 3-year-old superfilly Silverbulletday was simply outrun by
Beautiful Pleasure in the Beldame at soggy Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   But in between, it was another huge day for the nation's
dominant thoroughbred barn as River Keen and jockey Chris Antley
scored a 12-1 upset over Behrens in the $1million Jockey Club Gold
Cup at Belmont and 2-year-old Captain Steve and Garrett Gomez led
gate to wire in the Lane's End Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   So it was easy for Baffert to look at the bright side after
Forest Camp was beaten half a length by a more relaxed Dixie Union
and Alex Solis, who rallied from fourth on the outside at 4-1,
reversing their Del Mar Futurity finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go that fast (early),'' Baffert said after Forest
Camp set a :221/5-:454/5 pace. ``Now I don't have to be the
favorite (in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile).''
</P>
<P>
   Both horses ran big races, Forest Camp losing for the first time
in three starts, Dixie Union winning his fourth in five starts and
running a quick mile (1:35.79).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never run a bad race,'' trainer Richard Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, likely to have the strongest contingent in Breeders'
Cup history Nov. 6 at Florida's Gulfstream Park, had assured
himself of the favorite's role in the Juvenile Fillies when
Chilukki stayed undefeated Saturday in the Oak Leaf Stakes. But
that was just a warmup for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert Coast to Coast began shortly after noon Santa Anita time
when Silverbulletday and Jerry Bailey chased loose leader Beautiful
Pleasure and Jorge Chavez throughout the Beldame. It was 3-year-old
Silverbulletday's first race against older females.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, in the 1\-mile Gold Cup, the major prep for
the Breeders' Cup Classic, River Keen took a perfect stalking trip
to a 3\-length victory. Baffert had hinted Saturday that a hoof
crack would force the 7-year-old to be scratched.
</P>
<P>
   River Keen will run in the Classic with barnmate General
Challenge, who assumes the top ranking among active 3-year-olds
after Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid's fifth in the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Behrens, the nation's top-ranked racehorse,
struggled to edge Dubai's Almutawakel for second.

BIG PICTURE LOOKS FUZZY FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coaches always like to say after a game that they
won't know all the answers until watching the tape on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Well, USC coach Paul Hackett viewed the tape Sunday of the
Trojans' 31-24 loss to Arizona, and things didn't look much better
than the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think defensively, we missed a lot more tackles than we
normally do,'' Hackett said. ``It was our poorest tackling.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive tape was even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive front was more of a problem than we
anticipated,'' Hackett said. ``They had eight guys up on the line
and at times it confused us. We didn't block them particularly
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line after the video viewing? ``We just didn't play,''
Hackett said. ``Why? I don't know that (Arizona) is better. But
they were better on Saturday, clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does USC go from here? The Trojans will travel to South
Bend for the unenviable task of facing Notre Dame (3-3) on a
two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the big picture? Does USC fold it in, or can the
Trojans rebound after such an abysmal performance against Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get it together as a team and decide what to do.
As of now, we're not looking too good,'' freshman wide receiver
Kareem Kelly said. ``I know these guys don't want to go back and
play TCU (in the Sun Bowl).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything good in practice, but in the game we do
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is flabbergasted that USC's offense could be, so, um,
pathetic. Especially when he looks around at the Trojans' wide
receiver corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the players, but we just can't get it together,'' he
said. ``Defenses cannot stop myself, R. Jay (Soward) and Windrell
(Hayes).''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has a good point, but USC seems unable to turn its
reservoir of talent at receiver into touchdowns. Maybe they're too
hamstrung by the Trojans' anemic running game and woeful offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans ran for 45 yards against Oregon and 40 against
Arizona, if you take away quarterback sacks.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason they will be just as awful against Notre
Dame, which might be the most physical team on the schedule.
Hackett said no major lineup changes will occur in the backfield
this week, so the dreaded ``we must execute'' theory will have to
suffice.
</P>
<P>
   And there really is little hope in the short term that the
Trojans will improve offensively. The worst thing that may have
happened was scoring 62 points against Hawaii. It provided a false
sense that USC could move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   USC's offense has only outscored its defense 17-13 and 17-7 the
past two weeks. That's a major problem, and something has to be
done about it, or any bowl game might be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Soward underwent a CAT scan Saturday night and the
results were negative. He could undergo further testing this week.
Soward, who suffered a concussion, is expected to play this week.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not as good for right guard Jason Grain, who may
have torn ligaments in his knee and will undergo an MRI today.
``(The trainers) are nervous and concerned,'' Hackett said. Left
tackle Brent McCaffrey (sprained knee, ankle) is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup change: Hackett said Windrell Hayes will start again at
wide receiver, now that he has recovered from his sprained ankle.

   When Oregon covered 84 yards in three plays on its opening
series, how many UCLA fans thought the Ducks were headed for 50?
</P>
<P>
   Questionable call: Had the Bruins lost, quarterback Cory Paus'
incomplete pass with just over a minute left would have been
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was third and 11. But with a 34-29 lead and 1:29 left,
UCLA was playing the clock, not Oregon. A running play would have
used 30 seconds, since Oregon was out of timeouts and couldn't stop
the clock. Instead, the incomplete pass to Danny Farmer stopped the
clock and gave the Ducks 30 precious seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt they thought we were going to run the ball,'' Bruins
coach Bob Toledo said. ``We tried to make a big play. We thought
they'd play for the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for a ring: After a hapless opening series, the
Bruins played Rose Bowl-caliber defense.
</P>
<P>
   They held Ducks tailback Reuben Droughns to 43 yards. They
forced four turnovers. They unnerved quarterback A.J. Feeley with
two sacks and constant pressure. And with few exceptions, they had
solid coverage on Oregon's receivers. (Playmaker Tony Hartley had
one reception for 19 yards.)
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of Oregon's 29 points resulted from UCLA turnovers. The
Ducks scored one touchdown on Matt Smith's 81-yard interception
return and another after UCLA kickoff returner Lovell Houston
fumbled at the 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks went 84 yards on their first drive and 88 on their
last, which ended 1 yard short of the game-winning touchdown.
Otherwise, they gained a meager 271 yards, with one drive longer
than 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're developing an attitude, and we showcased that tonight,''
linebacker Ryan Nece said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes of brilliance: UCLA's offense scored 31 points and
operated at maximum efficiency for a 15-minute stretch late in the
second quarter and early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the game, the Bruins sputtered. They did not run
consistently (2.5 yards per carry); two drives ended on Paus
interceptions and two on blocked field goals. The worst drive
started on Oregon's 20 _ courtesy of a Droughns fumble _ and ended
1 yard later, with a missed field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: Paus was at his best in attack mode. When
throwing on first and second down, he completed 16 of 21 passes for
222 yards. When throwing on third down, he was 5 of 13 for 110
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week II: The Bruins have lost eight fumbles this
year, but only four by the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has fumbled once (Eric Whitfield after an
interception at Arizona State) and the special teams three times,
all Saturday: Houston's kickoff return, Ryan Roques' punt return,
and the blocked punt that bounced off Gabe Crecion.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Tailback DeShaun Foster aggravated his sprained
right ankle on his only carry of the game, in the second quarter.
He spent the rest of the night on the bench, his ankle on ice, and
is questionable for Saturday's game against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: UCLA was the only Pac-10 team to play its first
two conference games on the road. It was a difficult task for a
young team with a new quarterback, but now the Bruins get rewarded:
Beginning with Oregon, four of the last six games are at home.

HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HOUSES 8 FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With seven people crammed into a two-bedroom
apartment, the Serranos are a family desperately in need of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard with so many people and one restroom,'' said
patriarch Mauricio Serrano, 34. ``They don't have any privacy. They
don't have a place to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But next week, thanks to Habitat for Humanity, the Serranos will
move into a brand new four-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization just finished building the eight-unit
Burbank Elms development and is selling the homes to eight families
for a below-market $100,000 each, payable over 30 years with a
1 &UR;  &LR; percent down payment and a no-interest loan.
</P>
<P>
   The project represents a trial run of sorts leading up to
Habitat's largest development ever in the San Fernando Valley north
of Los Angeles, scheduled to break ground in November, said
executive director Terri-Lei Robertson. Habitat, in the Valley
since 1990, is planning a 53-unit development that will be built in
phases over a number of years, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the eight families joined Habitat and local officials to
celebrate the opening of Burbank Elms with a concert, open house
and blessings from two clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   The families were especially glad to finally be moving in
because the project was completed almost a year late.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of Habitat's developments, Burbank Elms was beset by
construction and funding problems. A company that was supposed to
have donated $50,000 in electrical wiring didn't come through,
delaying the work by several months, and then volunteers who
installed the wiring did not follow city building codes, so it had
to be torn out and redone. The project was originally slated for
completion in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Burbank City Council had to bail out the project,
voting to contribute an additional $330,000 to the organization, on
top of the land and other support it had already donated.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those problems was evident Sunday as the families
wandered around each of the new homes, admiring the new paint and
carpeting and especially eyeing the extra breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we got this house,'' said Serrano, who 18 months ago
was in even tougher conditions living in a one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   To be selected for the homes, the families must be earning
between 20 percent and 50 percent of the median income for the
area, and are required to put in 500 hours of sweat equity work in
building their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides marking the start of a new life for eight families,
Sunday's ceremony also took notice of another step in the rebirth
of a neighborhood that only a few years ago was overcome with crime
and rundown buildings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The city has taken several steps to rehabilitate the
neighborhood, said City Councilman Dave Golonski. Among them:
purchasing a number of buildings to rehabilitate and turn over to
the Burbank Housing Corp., a city-founded affordable housing group;
and starting an achievement center for children to play and study
after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough neighborhood,'' Golonski said. But with all the
work that has been done, ``it has come together very positively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank Elms property formerly held a 20-unit apartment
building that was run down and had a shortage of parking, Golonski
said. The city purchased it hoping to increase home ownership in
the neighborhood while reducing density, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood has also experienced a ``drastic reduction'' in
crime since the city's revitalization efforts began, he added.

LAKERS TRY OUT TRIANGLE OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ One week into its development, Project Triangle
finally was unveiled for the public Sunday night, albeit in its
embryonic stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, practicing behind closed doors since training camp
began Oct. 4, gave fans and media a glimpse of their training in
Phil Jackson's triangle offense, scrimmaging before a packed house
at UC Santa Barbara's Thunderdome.
</P>
<P>
   The starters looked sharp early on, but everyone looked sloppy
by the third 10-minute quarter, and Jackson called it a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hauled them off the court after three because we started
making turnovers, and that's a sign of fatigue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The purple team, led by starters Shaquille O'Neal, A.C. Green,
Glen Rice, Kobe Bryant and Derek Fisher, was especially effective
in the new offense early on. Rice and Bryant finished with 12
points each. O'Neal had 10 points and five rebounds but missed all
seven of his free-throw attempts, including an air ball. All
statistics were unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some real good things out there tonight,'' Jackson said.
``That doesn't mean that Shaq's foul shooting is included in
that.... I thought they organized their offense all right for a
week of training. They looked like they knew what they were doing
out there for a little bit at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Green had seven rebounds, and Fisher had seven assists and eight
points before leaving the game with left-knee tendinitis.
Second-year guard Sam Jacobson led the gold team with a game-high
13 points on 5-of-7 shooting, with a trio of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Benjamin, trying to make the team as a backup center, had
six rebounds and five points. John Salley, attempting a comeback,
did not score and finished with two assists and no rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning curve is different for individuals,'' Jackson
said. ``I saw some very bright things out there that I liked from
some players, and other players bewildered me as to what they were
doing out there on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's major concern heading into the exhibition was not so
much whether his team was ready for prime time, but whether his
players could stick to the game plan and resist the temptation to
play to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's named the `Kobe Memorial Game,''' Jackson
quipped after the morning shootaround. Bryant shook his head and
smiled at the jab. ``I do that naturally,'' he said of his showboat
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost here: It's not official yet, but Jackson expects Ron
Harper to sign a contract and report to the team by as soon as
Thursday, when the Lakers return to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The former Bulls guard has been rehabilitating his knee after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery this summer and considering
retirement. Jackson preferred Harper make it to camp but said he
didn't miss much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie doesn't need this. He's been doing this for about the
last seven years. He's got this stuff down,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Glen Rice's bout with knee tendinitis has been the
only significant injury in camp, but Jackson said the empty
trainer's room isn't necessarily a sign that players came to camp
in great condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might say ... that I'm kind of coasting with them, rather
than that they came in in shape,'' he said. ``I don't believe what
I'm reading in the paper about guys being in great shape. I've had
to nurse a couple guys through practices, and we're doing a lot of
teaching and a lot of conditioning ... so we're not running as hard
as a lot of teams run at the beginning.''

RED SOX' MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR BACK TO CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the Green Monster Mash lurched toward midnight,
there were two Brush Hill Transit buses parked on Van Ness Street.
A Delta 727 was on the tarmac at Logan Airport, waiting to take the
Red Sox back to Cleveland and into history.
</P>
<P>
   All the Sox players had brought their suitcases to Fenway Park.
They'd packed toothbrushes, razors, socks, underwear, jackets,
ties, and lucky charms . . . four days' worth of stuff.
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night was going to be either their famous final scene, or
the beginning of a journey that would take them to Cleveland and
(gulp) maybe even New York.
</P>
<P>
   On a night that was both historic and hysterical, the Red Sox
pummeled the Indians, 23-7, to force Monday night's fifth and
deciding playoff game, in Cleveland, starting at 8:17. The Tribe
has Charles Nagy ready to pitch. Sox manager Jimy Williams will go
with Bret Saberhagen. Or maybe he'll shock the world and send Pedro
Martinez to the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Or Lonborg and Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we feel good,'' said Williams. ``Especially after
being behind, 2-0. It's a one-gamer now.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened on the Fenway lawn in Game 4 long will be
remembered by the legions of Red Sox Nation. Boston put 18 runs on
the board in the first five innings. After seven, the Sox line
score read, 2-5-3-5-3-0-3, which represents the phone number of a
Cambridge professor. Perhaps a math professor, or one who deals in
other weird science. We didn't bother to leave a message.
</P>
<P>
   Men have been playing postseason baseball since 1901 when the
Red Sox beat the Pirates in the first World Series at the
Huntington Grounds . . . but no team in playoff history ever scored
as many runs as the Red Sox did Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Nineteen NFL teams
Sunday failed to score as much as the Red Sox did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we threw up, they hit, and where it came down, we
weren't standing,'' said Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll savor this victory tonight,'' said Williams. ``A key
victory in a playoff game. We did some nice things offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to believe. Playoff baseball is supposed to be
tight. This was loose, like a backyard Wiffle ball game between
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Wiffle ball. That's when you get scores like 23-7. That's
when you get 24 hits by one team in a single game.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one John Valentin. In the first four innings he hit two
homers, a single, and a bases-loaded double. That's 4 for 4 with
two homers and seven RBIs in four innings. And that came on the
heels of his Game 3 performance when he homered and doubled,
knocking in three runs. This means that in a seven-inning stretch
over two games, Valentin went 6 for 7 with three homers, two
doubles, and 10 RBIs. Let's see somebody do that again in
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox chased Bartolo Colon, scoring seven runs before the
Cleveland ace could get a man out in the second inning. The routing
of Colon put a ton of pressure on the Tribe and its beleaguered
manager, Hargrove. Cleveland won the first two games of this series
and the Sox were presumed dead when they went to work Saturday
without stars Pedro Martinez (back) and Nomar Garciaparra (wrist).
Dealing with a suddenly depleted pitching staff, Hargrove
sacrificed young Jaret Wright in a 9-3 Saturday loss, then brought
back Colon with only three days of rest. It's the first time all
year Colon pitched without four days off and the Dominican
fireballer had nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the short rest had anything to do with it,''
offered Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   It was heaven for Boston fans. They spent the day worrying about
rain and Nomar's wrist, but by 9:15 it was 10-2, Nomar was looking
OK, and Sox Watchers were contemplating Monday night's starting
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how much psychological damage the
Red Sox inflicted with their Game 4 barrage. By mid-game
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, it looked like the Indians had quit. All their
pitchers seem to be hurt and there was little resistance to the Sox
onslaught. Manny Ramirez, who knocked in 165 runs this year, is
hitless for the series.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy certainly could bail out the Tribe in Game 5.
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's runs won't help the Sox in a close game Monday
night any more than the Indians were able to borrow from their 11-1
rout of the Red Sox in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar said, ``It was embarrassing and
humiliating, but none of those runs mean anything tomorrow. It will
be 0-0.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was a special night for the Red Sox,'' said Valentin.
``We came out swinging the bats pretty good. There's quite a bit of
excitement in the clubhouse, but everybody's put everything in
perspective. Like Sandy said, it's going to be 0-0 when we play and
we gotta do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans were chanting ``Ped-ro, Ped-ro, Pe-dro'' at 11:20 as
the 22d run crossed the plate. Then they switched to ``We Want
Pedro!'' It was a happy ending to what could be the final game at
Fenway in this century.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be more. One more win Monday night and it'll be
Red Sox-Yankees, best-of-seven, and a chance to exorcise some of
the Pinstripe Ghosts that have haunted Olde Fenway for 81 years.

NOTHING NEW WITH USC WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's pass-happy edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   It's almost quaint the way Trojan forces annually find
themselves baffled and confused at mid-season.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder why they no longer dominate opponents, why they
can't beat a ranked team, why they can't win on the road, and why
they can't run the ball down the throat of foes like they did in
days of yore, when noble Trojans like Marcus Allen and Charles
White considered 1,000 yards a pit stop en route to a goal of
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   This no longer should be a surprise. USC has had two losses by
mid-October in 13 of their last 17 autumns, and gone on to lose
five games or more nine times since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   USC's negative yardage effort Saturday against Arizona (minus 20
rushing) was merely their third such game since 1996. They were
minus 23 rushing in last year's Sun Bowl against TCU, which hasn't
been a power since Davey O'Brien won the Heisman in 1938, and were
minus 14 against Washington at home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   I can explain USC's problems in six easy steps, and the formula
isn't exclusive to the Trojans. A lot of the points apply to Pac-10
teams in general and explain why the conference looks to be in
decline.
</P>
<P>
   1. John Robinson left for the NFL after the 1982 season, on the
heels of NCAA probation.
</P>
<P>
   2. The NCAA leveled the playing field by limiting scholarships,
giving schools like Oregon, Arizona and Washington State access to
the best California prospects. And now those schools lose players
to Colorado and prominent Mountain West and WAC schools.
</P>
<P>
   3. The NCAA eliminated the source of many stud players by
implementing Proposition 48 test requirements. Schools like UCLA
and USC do not recruit Prop. 48 athletes. Others like Washington
and Colorado do.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prospects who normally would have limited their options to
the best Pac-10 schools had their eyes further opened to other
colleges via ESPN. Pac-10 basketball went through this phase in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   5. It became vogue to play defense. Skill players found
cornerback as much fun to play as quarterback or receiver. The
Bears' 46 defense was a cool attack defense, and it evolved into
the press defense (eight-in-the-box).
</P>
<P>
   6. Offenses turned to finesse systems, like the widely copied
49ers west coast offense, putting the seat of power in the hands of
the quarterback and placing the power tailback on the list of
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Pac-10 should be surprised by this. The conference
has been the predominant provider of quarterbacks for the NFL for
two decades. There are 17 former Pac-10ers on NFL rosters today,
and seven are starters -- Troy Aikman (UCLA), Drew Bledsoe
(Washington State), Mark Brunell (Washington), Chris Chandler
(Washington), Billie Joe Hobert (Washington), Akili Smith (Oregon)
and Jake Plummer (Arizona State).
</P>
<P>
   Seven others have started NFL games, too -- Steve Bono (UCLA),
Tony Graziani (Oregon), Rob Johnson (USC), Ryan Leaf (Washington
State), Chris Miller (Oregon), Rodney Peete (USC) and the ageless
Warren Moon (Washington) -- and Cade McNown (UCLA) may start next
week for the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, this group does not include the recently retired John
Elway (Stanford), Tommy Maddox (UCLA) and Mark Rypien (Washington
State), or Todd Marinovich (USC), who is in the CFL. ...
</P>
<P>
   While USC has been sending Peete, Marinovich and Johnson to the
NFL, it has been unable to produce a single running back of note.
Since Allen's 2,427-yard season in 1981, the Trojans have had only
five backs crack the 1,000-yard mark. The Trojan running game has
averaged less than four yards a carry in 13 of the last 18 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just USC with running problems. There's just one former
Pac-10 running back starting in the NFL, Washington's Corey Dillon
at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The only other ex-Pac-10 backs finding even modest playing time
are UCLA's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Miami), UCLA's Skip Hicks
(Washington), Washington's Napoleon Kaufman (Oakland), and Oregon's
Derek Loville (Denver). Since 1987, the Pac-10 has produced just
one consensus All-American running back (Cal's Russell White in
1991). ...
</P>
<P>
   While USC muses on its problems running the ball, they might
also try to solve their problems defending the run. Trung Canidate,
not to be confused with Heisman Candidate, ran for 194 yards
Saturday. ...
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't be too quick to write-off the Rose Bowl chances of
any Pac-10 team with two losses. There's been four two-loss Pac-10
champs (1981, 1985, 1992, 1993) in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is 3-0, but it has road games at USC, Washington and
Arizona State left. Washington is 2-0, but it has back-to-back road
games versus Arizona and UCLA in November. Arizona is 2-1, but it
still has Oregon, UCLA, Washington and its annual brawl with ASU
left to play.
</P>
<P>
   USC (thanks to missing the Huskies) and Oregon both have the
difficult part of their schedules behind them. UCLA still has
Arizona and Washington left, but both games are at home and they
get a bye between them. They finish against USC, who they've beaten
eight straight times. ...
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of good seats are still available for the Nov. 26 USC
home game against Louisiana Tech. ...
</P>
<P>
   Is this the most exciting NFL season ever? Nine of 12 games
Sunday (not including Sunday night) were decided by three points or
less. On the season, 39 of 70 games (a percentage of .557) have
been decided by a touchdown or less. And 27 of those 39 (.692) have
been by a field goal or less. ...
</P>
<P>
   News item: Critics say Saturday's match between a woman and a
man was bad for boxing. Reaction: Oh yeah, like everything else
that's happened lately has been good for boxing.

WILLIAMS HAS RISEN TO TOP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WILLIAMS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The announcement will come next month and, atypical of
any information associated with Jimy Williams, it will not be
surprising. Williams will be named the American League's Manager of
the Year. He will earn the award because he was able to do things
no one else expected.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would point to the Red Sox' 94 wins _ many of us
expected 20 fewer _ to illustrate Williams's unpredictability. But
that's only part of the story. The rest of it was on display Sunday
at Fenway Park. On a rainy day, Williams sat inside and talked
about his team. Well, not really. He was supposed to be talking
about his team. What he said, though, is what he wanted you to
know.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, not much. That's part of being a good manager in
the 1990s. The message seems to be simple. The less insight you
give to the public, the more successful you will be. Managers such
as Williams and Cleveland's Mike Hargrove have mastered this
unspoken rule. They are Artists of Misleading Information. Outside
of the park, that's called lying. But when you're here and you're
managing, it's called gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Take the tale of Nomar Garciaparra's wrist. On Friday, the
manager and the shortstop said the wrist was sore. They indicated
that Garciaparra would be given a day off and that it was not a big
deal. On Saturday, Garciaparra was out of the Sox lineup.
Williams's explanation was that the shortstop was hurt and couldn't
play. Sunday, the Sox distributed a lineup without Garciaparra's
name on it. Several minutes later, they revised the lineup, which
included their best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is he came into my office and said he was ready to
play,'' Williams said. ``He could play. So I changed the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have happened that way. But if I were you, I certainly
wouldn't bet on it. That's managing in the Internet Age. If you
aren't good at subterfuge, you won't survive in this game. Hargrove
has been with the Indians since 1991. He knows about misdirection
plays, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this series, Hargrove announced his starting
rotation: Bartolo Colon in Game 1, Charles Nagy in Game 2, Dave
Burba in Game 3, and Jaret Wright in Game 4. The rotation was a
farce and Hargrove knew it. His hope was that the Sox didn't. It
was farcical because the manager knew Burba was injured (although
he never announced it) and was hoping that he could last six or
seven innings. He didn't. Before the game, Wright was told to be
ready in case Burba couldn't go. So Hargrove had no intention of
pitching Wright Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. His plan all along was to come back
with Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the twang in his voice and the folksy tales he
presents, Williams is not given credit for being smart and clever.
I think the man is smart. Not only that, I think he controls the
media as well or better than media ringmaster Bill Parcells. As
Williams spoke in a room Sunday, Jose Offerman was sitting several
feet away, cracking up. Williams was in rare form, giving
monologues rather than inside information. And you know what? The
players love it. They trust Williams. They know Williams is that
friend of yours who holds onto a secret forever.
</P>
<P>
   So, predictably, this is what Williams said Sunday when he was
asked about Pedro Martinez's condition: ``See, we need to focus on
we only got one game here today. We only got (Kent) Mercker. You
know, we got our backs to the wall. We're in a one-game elimination
situation. That's where we are. That's all I can focus on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, you know, when I was a little kid, I liked to play
marbles. You know, everybody has different games they like to play.
I liked to play marbles. A lot of you people think I've lost mine,
I don't know. I still got them at home in a big old brandy snifter.
I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter, but no update on Martinez. That's the way
Williams likes it.
</P>
<P>
   As his marbles commentary echoed throughout the room, Williams
was asked to describe his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, is this finality?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The questioner explained that, no, the query was not intended
that way. Williams then softened his stance and wound up talking
about talented speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we don't have that great orator in our clubhouse,'' he
said. ``That speaker, that spokesperson. But we've got a lot that
speak when they're on the field with the bat or their arm or glove,
you know? Kind of simple guys, but inside they're tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most telling comment the Manager of the Year would
make all day. His team is tough, smart, and misunderstood. So is
he.
</P>
<P>
   One day next season, Williams will be sitting in his office.
Someone who doesn't know better will ask him how he came to be
1999's best manager. He may talk about his team, marbles, and
people who know how to master English. Really, that would be the
most accurate response.

STANLEY TERROR AT PLATE, AND ON BASEPATHS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-STANLEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Historic baseball games offer all sorts of statistical
barometers. For the Red Sox, Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's 23-7 win over the
Indians was no exception. The number of runs, the number of hits,
and the number of players who contributed assigned Game 4 its place
in Boston lore and its rank among playoff games. But there are also
more subtle signs of historic success.
</P>
<P>
   How often, for instance, do you see the solidly built Mike
Stanley get a triple and infield single in the same game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stat of the night. I can't remember back to my last
triple,'' said Stanley. ``Eight years ago . . . was that my last
triple? Legging out a base hit, going first to third _ it's not
usually in my repertoire. It's just nice to be able to help
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Stanley finished his hitting spree, he had collected
five hits in six at-bats. The first baseman started with singles in
the second and fourth innings. The infield single came in the
seventh, courtesy of Indians third baseman Travis Fryman, who
stumbled trying to pick up Stanley's bouncing grounder.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Stanley was the beneficiary of poor judgment by
Cleveland right fielder Manny Ramirez. Stanley launched a fly ball
to the center-field gap. Center fielder Kenny Lofton and Ramirez
both chased the ball. Ramirez slid feetfirst to make the catch but
ended up kicking the ball deeper into the outfield, allowing
Stanley to arrive safely at third. The triple scored Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to continue to focus on what you're doing and go
out and have fun with it,'' said Stanley. ``You try to keep the
attack on.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final at-bat, the first baseman nearly had a home run. He
lofted a ball toward left field, came up a foot short of clearing
the wall, and settled for a stand-up double.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his Red Sox teammates, Stanley had respectable production
early in the series. The first baseman/designated hitter has played
all four games of the Division Series, posting a .625 average and
going 10 for 16. His series batting average leads all Red Sox
players who have batted more than once.
</P>
<P>
   He generated the most offense for Boston in Game 1, going 3 for
4 and driving in Nomar Garciaparra in the fourth inning. All of the
hits were singles off Indians' starter Bartolo Colon. But that
chilly night in Cleveland, Stanley suffered through questions about
an underthrown ball by John Valentin that he failed to scoop for a
crucial out.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has seen a steady improvement throughout the series by
his Boston teammates as they have adjusted to the pressure and
excitement of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a team guys got comfortable,'' said Stanley. ``That
game (Saturday) they started breaking out and feeling good about
themselves. Actually, I saw a lot of good swings in the second game
that we lost. You could sense and see and feel guys starting to
feel a little more comfortable at the plate. Obviously, the last
two games, they've been able to produce. You just see the steady
incline of people feeling better about themselves at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox finished their historic Game 4, the most
important, though unrecorded, measurement may have been the team's
comfort level. And fittingly, Stanley looked pretty comfortable
legging out the infield hit and standing at third after a rare
triple.

RESTLESS NIGHT FOR COLON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The second-guessing began as soon as the bottom of the
Red Sox order tattooed Bartolo Colon in the second inning
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Colon already had given up a two-run homer to John
Valentin. Trot Nixon, the No. 9 hitter, had belted one off the wall
in center. So why was Colon still in the ballgame to give up a
two-run shot to Jose Offerman?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has known for a
couple of weeks what the rest of the world found out over the
weekend: The Indians have no bullpen. And with Dave Burba hurt and
Jaret Wright gone wrong, they have only two starters.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hargrove sent Colon to the mound on three days' rest for
the first time in his career, it was the inspiration for a
conflagration. ``Everything that we threw up there, they hit,''
Hargrove shrugged after the Red Sox had battered half a dozen of
his pitchers for a postseason-record 23 runs. ``When it came down,
it wasn't where we were standing.''
</P>
<P>
   League rules say fielders can't cling to the top of the
scoreboard or set up shop in the screen. That's where the Indians
would have had to be playing Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, as Boston teed off on
everybody from Colon to Steve Karsay to Steve Reed to Paul
Assenmacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing,'' said catcher Sandy Alomar, who kept
standing up and pulling off his mask to watch balls disappear into
the murk. ``It was humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   No pitching staff in baseball history ever had given up 23 runs
in a postseason game. Cleveland's has conceded 32 in two. Now
Hargrove has to use Charles Nagy on three days' rest in Monday
night's all-the-marbles finale at Jacobs Field. And hope that he
can go at least seven innings. ``It's not really great to be in
this position,'' said Nagy. ``But there's nothing else I can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of a breezy summer, when the Indians were miles ahead
of the rest of the American League Central, they had a five-man
rotation. Now, with Doc Gooden off the postseason roster, Wright a
battered shadow of his former self, and Burba doubtful, Cleveland
suddenly has an empty cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove knew better than anyone that his pitching staff isn't
nearly as dominant as it might have looked while Cleveland was
shutting down Boston in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Indians won the division by 21 1/2 games, they were a
.500 club from September on. Gooden won only one game after May 18
and was put on the shelf. Wright went on the disabled list twice
and was 1-3 with a 6.65 ERA after Labor Day. And Burba, their best
pitcher down the stretch (7-3 from Aug. 1 on), was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Cleveland cruised through the first two games
with Colon and Nagy, Hargrove knew the next two would be rough
sledding. He knew Burba could offer only limited innings in Game 3.
And instead of starting Wright Sunday, which was the original plan,
Hargrove went with Colon _ and watched him implode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bart could not get his breaking stuff over and had to rely
heavily on his fastball,'' the manager said after Colon was tagged
for seven runs without getting an out in the second inning. ``I
don't care how hard you throw the ball, if you throw a lot of
fastballs and can't get your breaking stuff over, big-league
hitters are going to get to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a hanging breaking ball to John Valentin in the first
inning that was the red flag. ``If you don't make a good pitch, the
guy's going to hit it hard the way Valentin did,'' Colon said.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove downplayed his starter's three days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the short rest had anything to do with it,'' he
said. ``You know, Bartolo's a good competitor, he's a strong young
man. And, you know, I think it was just one of those nights for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Colon get hammered, is Nagy worried about
starting Monday night's finale on short rest, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' he said. ``I'm a different type of pitcher
than Bartolo. He's a power pitcher, so when he gets more rest he's
stronger out there. Myself, I'm a sinkerball guy. The less rest you
have, the better your sinker's going to be. That's what they say,
anyway. We'll see (Monday night).''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was the same in the Fens for this suddenly Lost Tribe.
``The good part about it is that none of these runs count
tomorrow,'' mused Alomar. ``Tomorrow is 0-0.''

<P>
   The $115 billion that MCI WorldCom has agreed to pay for Sprint,
a rival American long-distance telecoms firm, is a spectacular sum,
albeit in shares rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even world-record-breaking deals no longer seem as exciting
as they once did. And all too often there is little to show that
these mergers will, in the long run, benefit shareholders or, more
important, customers.
</P>
<P>
   By these tests, it is hard to be enthusiastic about this latest
deal either. Recent big mergers in industries from banking to oil
have been driven partly by an outbreak of me-tooism and a frothy
and surprisingly uncritical stock market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, more promisingly, been about an unrelenting
search by big firms for economies of scale. But it is in telecoms
that the action has been most frantic.
</P>
<P>
   The data revolution triggered by the Internet and the explosive
growth of mobile telephones have made previously dull-seeming
utilities appear the acme of techno-glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the telecoms map of
America has been redrawn. The Baby Bell local phone companies,
created after the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, have all but ceased to
exist. In their place stand two supra-regional monsters, SBC in the
West and Bell Atlantic in the East, which have systematically
absorbed their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent Baby Bell left is BellSouth, which entered
the bidding for Sprint with a late offer that MCI WorldCom, with
its more highly rated shares, was easily able to trump. BellSouth
may itself now be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new-look AT&AMP;T, having floundered in its early
attempts to enter local markets, it has bought a big chunk of the
American cable industry in order to gain direct access to
residential customers _ the vital ``last mile.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is MCI WorldCom, which, thanks to the deal-making
of Bernie Ebbers, its boss, has gone from upstart to behemoth in a
little over two years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to see the acquisition of Sprint as just
another mammoth deal, with little effect on competition. Yet to
view this deal complacently would be a mistake. In two respects it
should raise anti-competitive worries inside the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC).
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that, if America's second and third
long-distance operators join forces, and there is no significant
fourth firm, competition may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers points out that the merged entity would still have a
smaller market share (just) than AT&AMP;T, that it is only a matter of
time before the two new ``mega-Bells'' are let into the
long-distance market and that new challengers such as Qwest are
popping up.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But it may take a few years for the newcomers
to get a national presence in long-distance _ and the scope for
tacit collusion between the big two may be worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Further ahead, the FCC should have another concern. One reason
for the wave of restructuring in American telecoms is the belief
that, to achieve customer ``stickiness'' and generate scale
economies in such areas as billing, operators need to offer a
bundle of at least four services _ long-distance, Internet, local
and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the same trend is visible, as a handful of firms such
as BT and Deutsche Telekom evolve into super-regional carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only AT&AMP;T, with its cable strategy, and Sprint, with
its Integrated On-demand Network technology, are on the verge of
packaging together such a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has no wireless service, the main reason for its
bid for Sprint; and SBC and Bell Atlantic have no long-distance
presence _ but, one way or another, they soon will. The question is
whether a potential five competing integrated operators should be
trimmed to only four.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom is resigned to appeasing regulators in America and
Europe by disposing of Sprint's Internet-backbone business.
</P>
<P>
   At a pinch, Ebbers might even be willing to sell Sprint's
long-distance network, if that was the price for carrying off
Sprint's mobile operation. But an ``orphaned'' long-distance
network would do little for competition.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, Bill Kennard, is right to have put Ebbers on
notice that he can expect his deal to be skeptically scrutinized.
Ebbers is sufficiently worried to have raised the spectre of the
rapacious foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not allowed to buy Sprint, he says it will fall into
the hands of Deutlekom. Yet from a competitive perspective,
the German firm would be an ideal owner for Sprint, because it has
money to spend on developing it into a more formidable operator.
</P>
<P>
   The political odds and the weight of Wall Street expectations
are, nevertheless, such that it would take a bold FCC to stop this
deal. And despite the competitive concerns it raises, the telecoms
business is changing so quickly that it is not clear that it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the FCC should consider using this merger as the basis
for a less antagonistic, even if still rigorous, relationship with
the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed now is a ``fast track'' towards achieving the
opening of the local market so as to qualify the Bells for offering
long-distance service. It would involve some compromise on both
sides. But at least that would be a deal that put the customer
first. &QL;

CORDERO HEARS IT FROM FENWAY CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at Fenway Park, Wil Cordero made his
first start of the Division Series. But despite considerably less
playoff time than his teammates, the designated hitter came to the
plate with a lot more history.
</P>
<P>
   The loud booing that followed the announcement of the fifth
player in the Indians' order had nothing to do with any at-bats
against the Red Sox. A pinch-hit performance in Game 1 was not
enough to encourage the crowd's intense displeasure. The fans were
not booing because of anything that happened on the field. The
vitriol related to a time when Cordero played for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On June 11, 1997, when he was an outfielder for the Red Sox,
Cordero was arrested on charges of beating his wife and threatening
to kill her. He eventually pleaded guilty to domestic abuse charges
and received a suspended sentence. The Red Sox released Cordero in
September. Ever since, he has been persona non grata in the Hub.
When he returned with the Chicago White Sox in 1998, he was lustily
booed. And until March, 1999, his baseball career suffered as a
result of his personal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the support of Robbie and Sandy Alomar, Cordero
has resurfaced with Cleveland and resurrected his career. Fellow
Puerto Rican Sandy Alomar spoke to Cordero after a Puerto Rican
League game and learned that the outfielder was jobless. Then the
elder Alomar brother talked with Indians' general manager John Hart
about bringing Cordero to the club. In February, the player with a
troubled Boston past signed a one-year, non-guaranteed contract.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove had his doubts about
Cordero, but the Alomar brothers eased his mind. Now, Hargrove is
an avid supporter of the 27-year-old designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wil's a baseball player,'' said the manager, addressing his
decision to start Cordero in Game 4. ``Wil has been good for us,
you know, obviously his problems here in Boston were publicized.
But that's _ that's hopefully behind him. I think he's taken steps
to remedy the situation. But it has no consideration as far as _ or
bearing on _ him either being in the lineup or not being in the
lineup. Wil Cordero is a very good baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a productive season was cut short in June after
Cordero broke his left wrist against Milwaukee and was placed on
the 60-day disabled list. Before the injury, he earned the Tribe's
designated hitter/left-field assignment over Richie Sexson after he
hit .405 in spring training with 10 doubles, 4 home runs, and 20
RBIs. Cordero continued making contributions by hitting .319 in
April with 7 doubles, 2 home runs, and 11 RBIs. He was activated in
early September and apppeared in 14 games before the close of the
regular season, recording a .238 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero still harbors ill will toward the Red Sox, claiming the
organization caved in to public pressure when it dealt with his
arrest. In the Division Series, he has had two opportunities to
take his anger out on the team that released him two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He had a pinch-hit single with one out in the ninth inning of
Game 1. The hit put runners on first and second. And after a walk
to Richie Sexson, Travis Fryman hit the single to left to win the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boos, Cordero had two singles and a walk through
five innings Sunday night, then hit a solo home run in the ninth.

<P>
   The $115 billion that MCI WorldCom has agreed to pay for Sprint,
a rival American long-distance telecoms firm, is a spectacular sum,
albeit in shares rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even world-record-breaking deals no longer seem as exciting
as they once did. And all too often there is little to show that
these mergers will, in the long run, benefit shareholders or, more
important, customers.
</P>
<P>
   By these tests, it is hard to be enthusiastic about this latest
deal either. Recent big mergers in industries from banking to oil
have been driven partly by an outbreak of me-tooism and a frothy
and surprisingly uncritical stock market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, more promisingly, been about an unrelenting
search by big firms for economies of scale. But it is in telecoms
that the action has been most frantic.
</P>
<P>
   The data revolution triggered by the Internet and the explosive
growth of mobile telephones have made previously dull-seeming
utilities appear the acme of techno-glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the telecoms map of
America has been redrawn. The Baby Bell local phone companies,
created after the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, have all but ceased to
exist. In their place stand two supra-regional monsters, SBC in the
West and Bell Atlantic in the East, which have systematically
absorbed their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent Baby Bell left is BellSouth, which entered
the bidding for Sprint with a late offer that MCI WorldCom, with
its more highly rated shares, was easily able to trump. BellSouth
may itself now be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new-look AT&AMP;T, having floundered in its early
attempts to enter local markets, it has bought a big chunk of the
American cable industry in order to gain direct access to

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Philadelphia Eagles went 18 consecutive
quarters without scoring an offensive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 19th quarter, they crossed the goal line to beat the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It took only one trip to the end zone for one of the worst teams
in the NFL to make laughingstocks of the previously undefeated
Cowboys. The Cowboys sat on a 10-point halftime lead, only to watch
their defense surrender 13 points in the fourth quarter for a 13-10
embarrassment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first victory for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams would go out there and do it, close the deal
early,'' Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith said. ``So we've got a
ways to go as a ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is the only other team to watch the Eagles' offense
score, in the first quarter of the opening game. Tampa Bay, Buffalo
and the New York Giants shut out the offense that ranked next to
last in the NFL coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But one large gap in Dallas' zone defense allowed Charles
Johnson to breeze 28 yards into the end zone with 1:07 to play. The
Dallas defense, which had dominated so thoroughly in the first
half, could only watch, dazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unspeakable and unthinkable,'' cornerback Deion Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly considering the early statistics:
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles didn't cross midfield until 3:19 remained in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia picked up its only first down of the first half
after the two-minute warning before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   That final drive of the first half was for a grand total of 10
yards. The Eagles' other five possessions in the half netted
minus-one, seven, two, six and one yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win was badly needed,'' Philadelphia running back Duce
Staley said. ``(It) was almost like being in a desert with no water
and no signs of water. Coming out of the locker room I saw a spark,
and that's something I haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (3-1) never even had a flicker. Their 10 points came
on halfhearted drives that totaled only 52 yards. They scored on
their second possession of the day thanks to field position,
getting the ball at the Eagles' 29. They essentially floundered for
three plays, then turned to Richie Cunningham for a 42-yard field
goal to go on top 3-0 with 7:07 remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas didn't add to its lead until the second quarter, when it
drove 48 yards on five plays. Rocket Ismail caught a 17-yard pass,
and Smith sprinted for a 22-yard gain. Quarterback Troy Aikman then
connected with Smith on a nine-yard TD strike for a 10-0 edge with
11:35 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be all the scoring they would muster.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were a couple of sustained drives. The Cowboys marched
73 yards to the Eagles' one, but Smith fumbled at the goal line at
the end of the first quarter. They trudged 32 yards on eight plays
early in the second period, but Troy Vincent leaped in front of
Ismail in the end zone for an interception. The rest of the
Cowboys' offense consisted of five punts and another interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a nice job of getting underneath our intermediate
stuff and forcing us to come underneath,'' Aikman said. ``We just
failed to establish anything as far as getting momentum going.
There were things that hurt each drive and kept us from getting
first downs on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they were playing without Michael Irvin, who suffered
trauma to the neck and spine after a first-quarter hit and spent
the night in a hospital. They were playing without Mark Stepnoski,
who left in the second quarter with a lower back contusion and did
not return. They were playing without Everett McIver, who was on
the inactive list with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, they were playing without that spark that
Philadelphia (1-4) somehow found at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my responsibility to get these guys ready, and we didn't
go out and play well enough to win the ballgame,'' Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said. ``Entirely too sporadic. We could not sustain
anything, and that's what killed us today. We really struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' comeback began in the fourth quarter, when they
mounted back-to-back field-goal drives to narrow the gap to 10-6
with 5:42 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Following the second field goal, the Eagles forced the Cowboys
to go three-and-out. Smith gained eight yards on first down but was
hit at and behind the line on his next two carries, and Toby Gowin
punted from his 34.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles then moved from their 28 to the Dallas 28 in six
plays. Quarterback Doug Pederson, who had been booed since the
first half, hit a wide-open Johnson in the middle of the field. He
dived into the end zone just as the Dallas secondary converged on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we're hurt,'' Gailey said. ``I would hope we're
upset. But I don't think we're rock bottom.''

RED SOX HAVE RAMIREZ'S NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The numbers suggested something better _ a club-record
165 runs batted in, 44 home runs, .333 batting average, 131 runs
scored.
</P>
<P>
   MVP numbers for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But that was another lifetime _ back during a regular season
that was all but meaningless for a Cleveland Indians team that had
the AL Central title locked up since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in the postseason indicate something else. No hits,
no runs batted in, and a queasy feeling that what looked so easy a
few days ago, when the Indians were up 2-0 on the Red Sox in the
American League Division Series has turned into a struggle for
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Will the real Manny Ramirez please take one step forward?
</P>
<P>
   Not the one that went 0 for 12 in the first two games against
the Red Sox and not the one that went 0 for 3 with a pair of walks
in Sunday night's wild 23-7 loss to the Red Sox at Fenway which
forced Sunday night's fifth and deciding game. But the cleanup
hitter in a lineup that during the regular season was as dangerous
top to bottom as any in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's game, Mike Hargrove offered a logical
explanation. ``I don't think he's in a slump,'' said the Indians
manager. ``He's been pitched well. They (the Red Sox pitchers) are
hitting their spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the way the Red Sox hit against half a dozen Indian
pitchers, it didn't matter what Ramirez was or wasn't doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we threw up there they hit,'' said Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of Ramirez, whose batting average is
a clean .000 through four games.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations are not easy to come by under such circumstances,
even tougher when Ramirez is involved.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the same player who was in a similar batting
funk after the first two games against the Red Sox in last year's
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   His solution? When he arrived in Boston for Game 3, he dyed his
hair orange _ and responded with a pair of home runs in a 4-3
Cleveland victory as the Indians went on to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez never has embraced the spotlight, which is brighter in
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, he simply had to do his job as the
Indians right fielder in the bottom third of Hargrove's lineup.
When Albert Belle ran off to Baltimore with free agent money,
Hargrove needed a new cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Why not Ramirez, who slowly had established himself since the
Indians chose him in the first round of the June 1991 draft?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' asked Ramirez, who said he was comfortable batting
where he was batting.
</P>
<P>
   To say Ramirez hears tunes that the rest of us do not is
understating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask one of the Indians' clubhouse boys, the one whom
Ramirez asked to get his car washed. A natural question of how to
pay for this service was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's money in the glove compartment,'' said Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Money? Indeed. Try $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was once stopped and cited for three minor traffic
violations. After waiting while the police officer wrote the
ticket, Ramirez pulled out, made a U-turn and was pulled over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Ramirez, whose basic philosophy about baseball, and perhaps
life, is, ``Sometimes they get me. And sometimes I get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in a game of vital importance for both the Red Sox
and the Indians, the Red Sox got the Indians and Ramirez, jumping
to a 15-2 lead in the first four innings before the Indians tried
unsuccessfully to climb back into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, he ended his offensive effort in the ninth by taking
a called third strike.

<P>
   The $115 billion that MCI WorldCom has agreed to pay for Sprint,
a rival American long-distance telecoms firm, is a spectacular sum,
albeit in shares rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even world-record-breaking deals no longer seem as exciting
as they once did. And all too often there is little to show that
these mergers will, in the long run, benefit shareholders or, more
important, customers.
</P>
<P>
   By these tests, it is hard to be enthusiastic about this latest
deal either. Recent big mergers in industries from banking to oil
have been driven partly by an outbreak of me-tooism and a frothy
and surprisingly uncritical stock market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, more promisingly, been about an unrelenting
search by big firms for economies of scale. But it is in telecoms
that the action has been most frantic.
</P>
<P>
   The data revolution triggered by the Internet and the explosive
growth of mobile telephones have made previously dull-seeming
utilities appear the acme of techno-glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the telecoms map of
America has been redrawn. The Baby Bell local phone companies,
created after the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, have all but ceased to
exist. In their place stand two supra-regional monsters, SBC in the
West and Bell Atlantic in the East, which have systematically
absorbed their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent Baby Bell left is BellSouth, which entered
the bidding for Sprint with a late offer that MCI WorldCom, with
its more highly rated shares, was easily able to trump. BellSouth
may itself now be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new-look AT&AMP;T, having floundered in its early
attempts to enter local markets, it has bought a big chunk of the
American cable industry in order to gain direct access to
residential customers _ the vital ``last mile.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is MCI WorldCom, which, thanks to the deal-making
of Bernie Ebbers, its boss, has gone from upstart to behemoth in a
little over two years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to see the acquisition of Sprint as just
another mammoth deal, with little effect on competition. Yet to
view this deal complacently would be a mistake. In two respects it
should raise anti-competitive worries inside the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC).
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that, if America's second and third
long-distance operators join forces, and there is no significant
fourth firm, competition may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers points out that the merged entity would still have a
smaller market share (just) than AT&AMP;T, that it is only a matter of
time before the two new ``mega-Bells'' are let into the
long-distance market and that new challengers such as Qwest are
popping up.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But it may take a few years for the newcomers
to get a national presence in long-distance _ and the scope for
tacit collusion between the big two may be worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Further ahead, the FCC should have another concern. One reason
for the wave of restructuring in American telecoms is the belief
that, to achieve customer ``stickiness'' and generate scale
economies in such areas as billing, operators need to offer a
bundle of at least four services _ long-distance, Internet, local
and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the same trend is visible, as a handful of firms such
as BT and Deutsche Telekom evolve into super-regional carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only AT&AMP;T, with its cable strategy, and Sprint, with
its Integrated On-demand Network technology, are on the verge of
packaging together such a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has no wireless service, the main reason for its
bid for Sprint; and SBC and Bell Atlantic have no long-distance
presence _ but, one way or another, they soon will. The question is
whether a potential five competing integrated operators should be
trimmed to only four.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom is resigned to appeasing regulators in America and
Europe by disposing of Sprint's Internet-backbone business.
</P>
<P>
   At a pinch, Ebbers might even be willing to sell Sprint's
long-distance network, if that was the price for carrying off
Sprint's mobile operation. But an ``orphaned'' long-distance
network would do little for competition.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, Bill Kennard, is right to have put Ebbers on
notice that he can expect his deal to be skeptically scrutinized.
Ebbers is sufficiently worried to have raised the spectre of the
rapacious foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not allowed to buy Sprint, he says it will fall into
the hands of Deutsche Telekom. Yet from a competitive perspective,
the German firm would be an ideal owner for Sprint, because it has
money to spend on developing it into a more formidable operator.
</P>
<P>
   The political odds and the weight of Wall Street expectations
are, nevertheless, such that it would take a bold FCC to stop this
deal. And despite the competitive concerns it raises, the telecoms
business is changing so quickly that it is not clear that it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the FCC should consider using this merger as the basis
for a less antagonistic, even if still rigorous, relationship with
the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed now is a ``fast track'' towards achieving the
opening of the local market so as to qualify the Bells for offering
long-distance service. It would involve some compromise on both
sides. But at least that would be a deal that put the customer
first. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LARRY Dierker not only understands the second-guessing, he has
embraced it and even taken part over the years as an Astros
broadcaster and guest Chronicle columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing is what makes baseball baseball, he says.
Baseball became America's pastime because millions have passed the
time cursing their favorite team, questioning the manager's moves
and talking about next year.
</P>
<P>
   But even Dierker was getting testy, a bit put out, when many
moves he made in the final two games of the Braves series were
questioned not just by you or me but by players and general manager
Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it would take to motivate his team after losing the
decisive third game of the Division Series, Dierker quipped sharply
about having a pep rally. After the clinching Game 4, Dierker
clearly was agitated over being questioned about how he handled the
pitching, saying starter Shane Reynolds didn't look as if he wanted
to be in the game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds shot back with a few barbs directed at the skipper, and
star first baseman Jeff Bagwell called Dierker's comments ``weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Astros are talking about next year yet again. And if
you think it is only Bagwell and Craig Biggio whose legacy on this
team might hinge on the coming season, you're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If you think it's only Moises Alou's mysterious absence from the
bench during the playoffs or Derek Bell's absence of production
that might be addressed during the offseason, you're leaving
someone very important out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, Dierker will be pushing the buttons yet again when
this gang takes its show to the Gashouse next season. And he should
be.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can question Dierker's decision to pitch to the
Astro-killer, Brian Jordan, in Game 3. Maybe you didn't like much
of what you saw from Dierker in Game 4 or throughout the playoffs.
I didn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   But Dierker should be there next spring because he somehow
guided this team to a third division title despite so many setbacks
and injuries, including his own life-threatening condition. Over
the course of the season, Dierker made more moves that proved to be
right than wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He and pitching coach Vern Ruhle helped make the Astros' staff
one of the strongest in the league, and even if some in the
clubhouse quietly questioned his decision-making, it's difficult to
argue with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the third straight early exit from the
playoffs, Dierker figures to have the microscope focused on his
moves more than ever in 2000. And that's the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Consider next season Dierker's most important as Astros manager.
</P>
<P>
   The division race figures to be as heated as it was this season,
considering the young and hungry Reds, a talented Pirates team, the
unpredictable Cardinals and perhaps even Sammy Sosa's Cubs, who
figure to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting to the playoffs in 2000 will challenge Dierker. And
once there, if the Astros can make it for a fourth straight year,
it won't be just Biggio and Bagwell hoping to change their
postseason fate.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker must do more. He is the most likable of men and is
deservedly revered in this city. He is as much the Astros as
Bagwell, Biggio, Jimmy Wynn, Nolan Ryan, Mike Scott, Jose Cruz or
any figure in the franchise's history.
</P>
<P>
   The way Dierker came back from his ugly grand mal seizure in
June, becoming even more of a sentimental favorite and returning to
the bench long before anyone expected, enamored him to millions.
</P>
<P>
   He was there when the Astrodome opened, he was there when it
closed, and in some capacity he has been there throughout the
Astros' history.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Biggio have heard recent cries of the club having to
do something _ make a change _ if it ever is going to get over its
playoff frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the answer to get rid of Bidge and Bags?'' Bagwell said.
``I don't know. Maybe. But that doesn't mean you'll do better
without us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros frankly would be silly to move their cornerstone
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt as confident on my last at-bat, when I was
2-for-whatever, as I ever have,'' Bagwell said. ``I thought I would
do something big, but it just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker surely felt as confident as ever with his playoff moves,
too. It just didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   Is the answer to get rid of Dierker? No. He has earned as much
of a chance as anyone to be there at Enron Field's opening next
year. But if the division race slips away or another playoff series
goes the way of the last three, surely more than a few fans will be
letting off some steam at the Gashouse.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes baseball baseball. And it's what will make the
2000 season probably the most critical of Dierker's managing
career.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A year ago, the postmortems of the Red Sox' Division
Series loss to the Cleveland Indians pointed a finger at the bottom
of the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   In that four-game series, Boston's Nos. 5 through 9 hitters went
a meager 10 for 74, a major power outage.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening two losses of this series in Cleveland, the
bottom half of the order _ along with the top _ was silent again.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in Saturday night's 9-3 victory, in which
the lower half of the order banged out five hits.
</P>
<P>
   And in Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's 23-6 rout at Fenway Park, the Red Sox'
power surge was a sight to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Murder's Row of Troy O'Leary, Mike Stanley, Jason
Varitek, Darren Lewis, and Trot Nixon, which pounded out 14 hits,
drove in seven runs, and was a pivotal part of the explosion that
sparked Boston to a 15-2 lead after four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive was the 7-8-9 trio of Varitek, Lewis, and Nixon,
who had a batting line to die for: nine hits in 13 at-bats with
five extra-base hits, nine RBIs, and 11 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, the lightly regarded bottom third of the batting
order contributed more offensive in one game than it did in an
entire series a year ago and out-hit the entire Indian lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way was Varitek, who went 4 for 5 with a single, two
doubles, and a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had three hits and was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, batting in the ninth slot, had a two-run double in the
first inning, a run-producing sacrifice fly in the third, and a
two-out, two-run double in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 batter Stanley had five hits _ three singles, a double,
and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Only O'Leary, who was hitless in four at-bats, failed to get on
base.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, the Red Sox ruled, and afterward the confidence
in the clubhouse was palpable. And much of the team's offensive
outburst (32 runs in two games) came from the part of the order
once called the Red Sox dead zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to be aggressive at the plate,'' said Varitek. ``We had
to take some of the pressure off our big guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a sense of optimism up and down the lineup. ``You
get in a groove and it does seem contagious,'' said Nixon, who had
five RBIs. ``Now we have to go out and do it again.''

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ARLINGTON _ When the Texas Rangers were swept by the New York
Yankees in the first round of the American League playoffs a year
ago, the Rangers' frustration was tempered by the knowledge they
had lost to a team that was one of the best in recent years, if not
all time, and a sense their day would come.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being swept by the Yankees this season, the Rangers had a
harder time finding reasons to look on the bright side. This year's
postseason train wreck left the Rangers dazed, confused and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we just wanted to get to the playoffs,'' shortstop
Royce Clayton said. ``This year, getting to the playoffs was not
our goal. Getting to the World Series was our goal. It's very
disappointing, but we have to deal with it. We're going to have to
deal with it again next year, and that's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years without a postseason appearance, the Rangers
broke through in 1996 but were ousted in the Division Series in
four games by the Yankees, the eventual World Series champions.
Returning to the playoffs last year, the Rangers were swept in the
Division Series by a Yankees team that had won 114 regular-season
games and would capture another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers and Yankees were paired again this year,
conventional wisdom spoke of a tighter series. The Rangers had
enhanced a potent offense with one of the best hitters in the game,
Rafael Palmeiro, and had won 95 games, a franchise record. The
Yankees (98-64) had compiled the best record in the American League
but had not been the machine they had been the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers players talked openly of this being the year they would
beat the Yankees, but the outcome of Rangers-Yankees 1999 was
eerily identical to Rangers-Yankees 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Rangers hit .152 during the Division Series and scored
one run _ Juan Gonzalez's home run in the fourth inning of Game 2 _
pretty much duplicating what they did in '98, when they hit .141
and scored once.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Rangers produced even a hint of an offense, they might
have been competitive, because their starting pitching was
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that hit .293 during the regular season, best in the
majors, and scored 945 runs, second only to the Cleveland Indians,
the Division Series was an improbable, almost inconceivable, end to
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good hitting team,'' Palmeiro said. ``We ought to be
able to hit any pitcher. I can't explain what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is the Yankees' pitching is such that no team is
going to do much against them in the playoffs this year. The
Yankees got three terrific starts from Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens. Closer Mariano Rivera
was as sharp as ever. Had the series gone to a fourth game, the
Yankees' starter would have been David Cone, who less than three
months ago threw a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said of the way
his pitchers performed against Texas. ``Last year, we did the same
thing, and I remember saying this was the toughest series for us
because you don't want to go through this ballclub again and think
you can hold them to one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that bothered me about our ballclub in the second
half (of the 1999 season) was that our pitching staff walked so
many people. If we went into this series the same way, we would
have been murdered. I felt these guys were ready to pitch, and it's
just a matter of good pitching stops good hitting. We have been
able to pitch in this series. Hopefully, we can continue to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he did not believe the Rangers' hitters had
approached the series any differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when they've had trouble beating us, you know
there's a psychological thing going on,'' he said. ``But I don't
think the approach is any different. Again, I know they scored a
lot of runs (during the regular season). But if you think back to
the All-Star Game in Boston this year, you had (Larry) Walker,
(Mark) McGwire, (Sammy) Sosa _ Pedro (Martinez) took care of all of
them. If you go out there and pitch the way you're capable of
pitching, even the good hitters don't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates refused to say the series had been
a step backward for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in my eyes,'' he said. ``I know our goal is to move
forward and win a world championship, and I'm confident it will
happen here soon. I'll just sit back and take a few months to
analyze what went on in this series and see how it is we can score
most of the year and yet, when it comes to these three games, we
can't smell home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Yank sail onward, the Rangers face an interesting
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Although Oates and general manager Doug Melvin appear to have
the job security that comes with making three playoff appearances
in four years, they work for an owner, Tom Hicks, who has tasted a
championship with his other professional franchise, the NHL Dallas
Stars, and has played kingmaker with the football and basketball
programs at the University of Texas. Hicks indicated last week that
a quick exit from the playoffs by the Rangers would trigger an
evaluation of the franchise's personnel and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have 11 players who are free agents, the most
prominent being second baseman Mark McLemore and third baseman Todd
Zeile. Before getting a single off Clemens in Game 3, McLemore, 34,
was 0-for-14 in the postseason, a slump dating to 1998. The Rangers
also might be tempted to move Gonzalez, who can become a free agent
after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Melvin's mindset came when he was asked during the
series if he would rather build a team that regularly makes the
playoffs or a team that makes one spectacular run to the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is you have to build _ get into the postseason, and
eventually it will happen,'' he said. ``Sort of use that Denver
Broncos theory. The Broncos did it enough times, (and) it
eventually happened. You have to focus on that. If you get there
enough times, eventually it will happen.'' &QL;

   The soldiers herded hundreds of frightened men, women and
children out of their villages and on to the road. When the people
stopped to rest, planes swooped down to bomb and strafe them.
Panic-striken, the survivors hid in two culverts under a railway
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three days, the soldiers repeatedly fired machine
guns into the huddled mass from both ends of the culvert, killing
another 300 villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Too many such stories have been told this year. However, this
particular atrocity was not committed by Serbs. It was committed by
Americans, or so it is said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place in July 1950, when the United States was
fighting to save Korea _ and the Koreans who died _ from communist
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   For years, survivors have sought in vain for an admission of
responsibility by the American government. But now an investigation
by the Associated Press has confirmed the survivors' account with
testimony from old soldiers still haunted by their role in the
killings, and documents showing that they acted under orders.
</P>
<P>
   Shamed by the revelations, the Pentagon has belatedly ordered
its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although not forgivable, the desire of American officials to
ignore the incident is perhaps understandable. It was long ago. The
United States' armed forces are now far more assiduously schooled
in the laws of war than they used to be, and they pride themselves
on avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Kosovo, Bosnia and Haiti, the lives of American
troops are now more often put at risk protecting civilians than
trying to win all-out wars.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such a plea of mitigation makes even less comprehensible
America's continuing opposition to what could be the single biggest
step towards preventing future massacres _ the creation of a
permanent international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has lobbied hard against the establishment of
such a court, even though dozens of countries, including all
America's NATO allies except Turkey, have indicated that they will
ratify the treaty setting up the court.
</P>
<P>
   America has no principled objection to the idea of supranational
bodies dealing with war crimes. Quite the contrary. It was the
prime mover behind the international criminal tribunals for
Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   It refused to guarantee immunity from prosecution to leaders in
the Bosnian conflict even to get a peace agreement. Along with
Britain and France, it supplied information to the Yugoslav
tribunal that led to the indictment of the Serb leader, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bring some belated justice to Cambodia, it has
actively supported the establishment of an international tribunal
to put Khmer Rouge leaders on trial.
</P>
<P>
   America clearly believes in building a system of international
justice, but on one vital condition: that any such system does not
apply to America itself.
</P>
<P>
   Its initial enthusiasm for a permanent court evaporated when
other countries rightly refused to tie the court's powers to the
veto of the U.N. Security Council, which would have made it a mere
political tool of the great powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, America has pleaded that, as the sole remaining
superpower, its soldiers and officials would be the target of
politically motivated prosecutions, hampering its peacekeeping
efforts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   America's allies have similar concerns, so they have restricted
the powers of the court's prosecutor and given the court the right
to act only if national authorities themselves refuse to
investigate or punish alleged atrocities. This should be enough to
allay American fears.
</P>
<P>
   But the real objection of some officials, and of opponents in
Congress, is more fundamental and even less defensible: they cannot
tolerate any infringement of American sovereignty by an
international body over which the United States does not have
direct control.
</P>
<P>
   Such an absolutist version of sovereignty is rapidly becoming an
anachronism. America blew a huge hole through it by intervening in
Kosovo and bombing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Its frequent denunciations of war crimes and other atrocities
abroad, and its promotion of internationally enforceable rules in
trade and arms control are based on the assumption that absolute
claims to sovereignty are no longer legitimate or useful.
</P>
<P>
   Judged in this context, America's opposition to an international
court is not only hypocritical, but misconceived. Even a superpower
would be safer in a world where the rule of international law stood
some chance of being applied.
</P>
<P>
   And the sad tale from Korea is a reminder that even Americans
sometimes commit war crimes and then try to cover them up. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The offseason means rest and relaxation for some, surgery and
rehabilitation for others, and tee times, hunting excursions and
fishing trips for most.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And then there's Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker and his
band of decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Hunsicker might toss his golf bag into the trunk
of his car, but a briefcase and cell phone will be the only things
he'll be toting most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   A long season and short postseason are over, but the work is
just beginning for the Astros' brass. Hunsicker will review the
season and personnel with the coaching staff today, and similar
sessions with owner Drayton McLane Jr., president Tal Smith,
assistant general manager Tim Purpura and numerous scouts will be
held in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the process to improve, which is exactly what
the Astros hope to do in 2000. They have won the National League
Central an unprecedented three consecutive years, and improvement
means advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs _ something
the Astros have been unable to do following each of their
division-winning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Plans were undermined in 1999 by an almost unheard-of rash of
injuries that saw the Astros use the disabled list 16 times. The
fact they managed to win the division was an accomplishment in
itself, but there's work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Holes could be created at shortstop and catcher because Ricky
Gutierrez and Tony Eusebio are free agents. The outfield situation
is unsettled because there are more bodies than positions. As
always, the budget will be an issue because of the uncertainty of
arbitration, particularly in the cases of Jose Lima and Carl
Everett _ both of whom will get significant raises.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus might be on a pair of players who are signed
for 2000 but not beyond. Taking care of second baseman Craig Biggio
and lefthanded pitcher Mike Hampton are near the top of Hunsicker's
offseason to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step is meeting with the staff (today), and then
we'll have some internal meetings with upper management,''
Hunsicker said. ``Once we get through that exercise, we'll begin
making decisions on what direction we're headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in a review-and-reflect mode over the next couple of
weeks, but once we get past the first few weeks of meetings and
planning, they (Biggio and Hampton) will be the first order of
business. That certainly is a priority. Biggio and Hampton are a
year away from free agency, and we want to explore the possibility
of extensions for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible long-term contracts might be in the future
for Lima and Everett, but at this point the focus is on Biggio, a
cornerstone of the franchise for the last 10 years, and Hampton,
who has the look of an ace after posting a 22-4 record in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``With arbitration-eligible players, I always give the player
and his representation the opportunity to talk about their desires
with regards to the possibility of a long-term contract,''
Hunsicker said. ``I'll do the same this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it figures to be a costly offseason for McLane, who
spent about $54 million on players in 1999. At this point, it's
unclear how much that figure will increase next season, but it's
worth noting the Astros' payroll has been on the climb over the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea yet until we go through the first round of
meetings,'' Hunsicker said. ``I don't see any significant increases
in the cards, but we're not in a situation where we have to cut
payroll, either. It's too early to answer that question, but I can
tell you we're not going to end up with a $70 million payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the World Series, Hunsicker can begin
negotiating with his own free agents. Eusebio, Gutierrez, reliever
Doug Henry and outfielder Stan Javier are key players in that
category. Javier, who was acquired from San Francisco in August,
indicated an interest in coming back to the Astros, although there
has been some speculation he will return to the Bay Area, where he
has spent the majority of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Astros' inexperience at catcher (Paul Bako and
Mitch Meluskey each have less than two full seasons in the big
leagues), re-signing the 32-year-old Eusebio would seem to be a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' Eusebio said. ``They
haven't mentioned anything to me. I'd be happy to come back if they
want to sign me, but if not I'll have to find another place to
play. I think I showed them that I could catch a lot of games this
season and that my knees are fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play winter ball in November and get myself in
shape for spring training. I like Houston, and I like playing for
the Astros. I don't think we need to change too much. If we keep
this team together, and we stay healthy, I think we're going to do
better next season.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Astros will handle Gutierrez's situation is not as
clear. He's likely to command more than $3 million a year on the
free-agent market, and backup Tim Bogar is signed for another year
at $500,000. The Astros conceivably could pass on Gutierrez and
team Bogar with a low-priced veteran shortstop, or they could swing
a trade for another shortstop of every-day caliber. There won't be
much available through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have any power over that,'' Gutierrez said. ``I
love it here, but we'll have to see what our options are and see
what happens. It would be hard to walk away from a team like this,
but it's a business. We'll just have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Henry, returning to Houston is his first priority, but he
knows the Astros may decide to make changes in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing if I'm going to be back is the toughest thing,''
Henry said. ``I finished the year on a good note, but when you're
35 years old Gerry said they'll be talking to me in a couple of
weeks. Hopefully, I'm a part of their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   That, along with many other issues, will become clearer over the
next several weeks.

<P>
   The soldiers herded hundreds of frightened men, women and
children out of their villages and on to the road. When the people
stopped to rest, planes swooped down to bomb and strafe them.
Panic-striken, the survivors hid in two culverts under a railway
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three days, the soldiers repeatedly fired machine
guns into the huddled mass from both ends of the culvert, killing
another 300 villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Too many such stories have been told this year. However, this
particular atrocity was not committed by Serbs. It was committed by
Americans, or so it is said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place in July 1950, when the United States was
fighting to save Korea _ and the Koreans who died _ from communist
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   For years, survivors have sought in vain for an admission of
responsibility by the American government. But now an investigation
by the Associated Press has confirmed the survivors' account with
testimony from old soldiers still haunted by their role in the
killings, and documents showing that they acted under orders.
</P>
<P>
   Shamed by the revelations, the Pentagon has belatedly ordered
its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although not forgivable, the desire of American officials to
ignore the incident is perhaps understandable. It was long ago. The
United States' armed forces are now far more assiduously schooled
in the laws of war than they used to be, and they pride themselves
on avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Kosovo, Bosnia and Haiti, the lives of American
troops are now more often put at risk protecting civilians than
trying to win all-out wars.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such a plea of mitigation makes even less comprehensible

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ There have been times Rudy Tomjanovich has had to find the
bright side. It's part of the job. It makes sense, too. If a coach
can't find reasons to be optimistic after a week of training camp,
it's fairly certain he is headed for a miserable seven months.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not one of those times. As the Rockets broke camp and
headed to Houston on Sunday, Tomjanovich did not have to
manufacture enthusiasm. He could barely contain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' he said. ``I'm telling you the truth
when I say that. Sometimes I try to be positive. I'm not trying. I
just am.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling permeated training camp. It would be wrong to say
the upbeat attitude is a marked improvement over last season, when
confidence was also high. But the good feelings of the week in
Austin have come almost as a happy revelation, or at least a
discovery in the wake of the widespread changes throughout the
team. It has become a topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (Hakeem Olajuwon) about something completely
different,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He said, `Coach, man, this team.
Man, we've got some good guys. It's going great.' There is very
good morale, very good playing chemistry and interpersonal
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the team to get to know each other. We got some good
work done. We have a lot of work ahead, but I think we have a nice
foundation. The biggest thing is the positive enthusiasm about this
team. The older guys, Charles (Barkley) and Dream, have expressed
nothing but positive things about this team. They feel rejuvenated
and excited about the new mixture.''
</P>
<P>
   It should not be surprising the Rockets, new and old, enjoyed
their first steps together because those steps were taken at top
speed. Tomjanovich began developing the team by emphasizing its
running game and no matter how difficult the demands of training,
players usually prefer running to the discipline of half-court
drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're emphasizing running,'' guard Matt Maloney said. ``It's
early, but it definitely puts everyone's spirits high. If we came
out and worked on defense the first days, everyone would be worn
out. But there's a positive atmosphere, and there's good thoughts
about this year.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many established veterans on the roster, picking up the
pace has allowed for more offensive chances, and greater
opportunity for players to display their abilities to new teammates
and coaches. With 10 new players on the roster, providing immediate
opportunity to perform went a long way toward players feeling
comfortable with their new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets a chance to showcase skills in the open court,''
guard Shandon Anderson said. ``That's going to keep everyone happy.
At the same time, when we need a basket, we'll know we can go
inside and work our way from there.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, the Rockets said six days of practices
in Austin offered encouraging signs about the season. As much as
players might have been aware of each other, until they got on the
same floor, running the same offense they would have to beginning
with Wednesday's NBA exhibition in Seattle, they really could not
predict what sort of team they could become.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out how deep this team is,'' Barkley said. ``I'm very
impressed with the depth. It's going to be a fun season. We've got
good guys. But I think everybody is surprised at the level of
talent we have. Everybody is impressed with Steve Francis and
Shandon Anderson, but I think Carlos Rogers has been impressive.
It's just been a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   For the holdover Rockets, checking out the newcomers has been
natural and to be expected, and now they have become the source of
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some great new guys,'' Olajuwon said. ``Players like
myself and Charles that were already here, we're excited to see all
these new guys. You have a situation where everybody is excited,
the coaches, the players. You have a concept that is very clear.
We're going to be a running team. That fits the players we have, so
everybody is very upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so natural. It's very competitive but at the same
time, very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   To the newcomers, the first week has been a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loving this team,'' center Kelvin Cato said. ``I'm loving
the philosophy of this team. We'll go out there, run people into
the dirt and win ballgames. I'm loving it. We've got a lot of
scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the league, you hear so much about what people can do
and can't do. Until you see it for yourself, you don't know. I
didn't know Shandon was this quick. I had never seen Steve play at
this level. I didn't know Bryce (Drew) and Matt shoot like they do.
All you heard about was Dream and Barkley. When Pip (Scottie
Pippen) was here, you heard about him. You don't know how good
Cuttino (Mobley) is until you watch him practice every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But making all those parts fit remains as important as
collecting them. There is still much more offense to put in and the
defensive drills will come. The week in Austin was only a start.
And a good start does not always mean a great finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good last year,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We can't make a
negative out of something that was also positive. We have to also
grow and stay on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, we really fit together well and some special
things could happen if we work hard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   American voters have ample reason for holding their leaders in
disdain. At best, politicians seem like canny tacticians, twisting
in the gusts of opinion polls and focus groups. At worst, they are
brazen liars. (President Bill Clinton is both.)
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as something of a surprise to remember that America
has one presidential candidate who is not just a politician with
principles, but an authentic war hero. He is Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as even more of a shock to realize that most voters
don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hero'' is not too strong a term for McCain. In his recent
book, ``Faith of My Fathers'' (Random House), he writes about
surviving five-and-a-half years in a Vietnamese prisoner-of-war
camp, much of that time spent in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, he carved out for himself a sort of
independence through insubordination _ taunting his captors and
breaking prison rules even at the cost of incurring more
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, McCain refuses to ascribe nobility to his
courage. ``Glory,'' he writes in one passage in his book, ``belongs
to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself, to
a cause, to your principles, to the people on whom you rely, and
who rely on you in return.''
</P>
<P>
   That combination _ sheer guts plus a genuine belief in the
greater good _ would sound unbearably corny in almost any other
politician. But McCain is exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he endure his captivity (and as Bob Dole once
remarked, you tend to accord more respect to someone who spent
five-and-a-half years in a box). But for most of the time it was
voluntary: he refused an offer of early release, saying that those
who had been imprisoned before him should be freed first.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to take punishment for his beliefs has been a
hallmark of McCain's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he defied his own party by proposing a big rise in the
tax on cigarettes that would have penalized some of his party's
biggest corporate donors. Republican leaders killed it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he slammed their $792 billion tax cut as a boondoggle
for special interests (though he voted for it anyway, calculating
that it would be vetoed).
</P>
<P>
   He is still defying them by sponsoring a bill to abolish
``soft-money'' (indirect political contributions not covered by
federal campaign laws). These, he says, corrupt the political
system and ``that shames me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these legislative campaigns have a quixotic,
tilting-at-windmills quality about them. It is not clear whether
campaign-finance reform is possible, let alone whether banning soft
money is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever doubts may exist over that, there was no
questioning McCain's moral clarity on two other issues this year,
both concerning foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone in either party, he urged the Senate to give
President Clinton the option of using ground troops in Kosovo _
articulating more clearly than anyone else the view that America
has interests abroad that are worth dying for.
</P>
<P>
   He made a similar point when he said that Pat Buchanan had put
himself outside the Republican pale when he asserted America had no
national interest in stopping Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   On both occasions, McCain was going against his interests. On
Kosovo, voters were reluctant to send in troops. On Pitchfork Pat,
he stood to lose Buchananites in the Republican primary contest.
But as he said, ``No political campaign is worth sacrificing our
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, this must be the sort of man voters have in mind
when they tell pollsters _ as they routinely do _ that they want
their next president to be a man of integrity. It is hard to
imagine what else they could want.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a puzzle about the voters' reaction to McCain. They
may admire him. But they do not seem to want him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls put him third in the beauty contest, behind Elizabeth
Dole, with only 5 percent of the vote. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, his standing is a testament to the fundraising power and
mesmerizing poll lead of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas. The
Bush steamroller is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of victory
that flattens everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   That might change, of course, if Republicans start focusing on
the limitations of their front-runner, as Democrats are now doing
with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Then, McCain (who has raised more money than any Republican
except Bush) might prove the Bill Bradley of the right. But don't
hold your breath: after eight years out of the White House,
Republicans will not abandon their anointed one unless they have
to.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, too, McCain's low rating may reflect the difficulties of
making his main policy proposal, campaign-finance reform,
interesting to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue quickly gets bogged down in incomprehensible details.
And, anyway, at a time of prosperity, most Americans are reasonably
satisfied with their institutions of state.
</P>
<P>
   But there could also be a more profound reason for McCain's
standing. And it is connected with the very thing that also makes
him so admired: his personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with the embarrassments he talks about
with unflinching and abnormal honesty _ collapsing drunk through
the screen door of a girlfriend's house, or dating a stripper
called ``Marie the Flame of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, such episodes just enhance his reputation as an
honest man with real experience (in contrast to Bush's perceived
frat-boy callowness).
</P>
<P>
   No, the doubt concerns his ferocious tenacity in standing up for
what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resisting, being uncooperative and a general pain in the ass
proved, as it had in the past, to be a morale booster for me,''
McCain writes about his experience in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Such insubordination has been a defining feature of his life. It
was heroic when he dealt with his Vietnamese captors. It was
refreshing when he defied his Republican colleagues over tobacco
taxes or campaign finance. It was powerful when placed in the
service of a vigorous foreign policy, especially considering that
everyone else was wobbly about Kosovo and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so clear that ``a general pain in the ass'' is
what voters want.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders set rules for others. They are the overdog.
Others react to them. This may explain why voters admire, but do
not support, McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He is a courageous man. But his courage lies in resisting what
he thinks is wrong. And Americans may not want a resistance hero as
president. &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ After only about 30 minutes of unbridled celebration
following their dramatic National League Division Series victory
over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday, the New York Mets
focused their attention _ and their best shots _ on the Atlanta
Braves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets and Braves open the NL Championship Series on Tuesday
in Atlanta, and the Mets have not forgotten comments by Atlanta
third baseman Chipper Jones and relief pitcher John Rocker in late
September. The Braves beat the Mets five of six times during a
10-day period to gain control of the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it looked as if the Mets had fallen out of the
playoffs. They were one game behind Atlanta on Sept. 21 but fell
eight games back after going 1-8 in the next nine days. After an
11-inning loss at Shea Stadium to Atlanta, the Mets were two games
out of the wild-card lead with three to play. They roared back to
win their final four games, including a one-game playoff against
Cincinnati, and then beat Arizona 3-1 in the NL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves finished their season series against the Mets,
going 9-3, Jones said something to the effect that Mets fans had
better convert to the Yankees if they wanted to follow a New York
team in the playoffs. Rocker was more blunt, being quoted as
saying, ``I hate the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, in turn, aren't fond of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next team we play,'' said Mets manager Bobby Valentine,
the master of the snide comment, ``is going to be playing ghosts
because they said we were dead. I don't know if they've ever played
against people coming back from the grave before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nice,'' said Mets reliever Turk Wendell of beating
Arizona, ``but I think it'll be even more special once we beat the
Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   About Jones, Wendell said: ``All I have to say is he stuck his
foot in his mouth. He's going to have to deal with it every game.
He's going to have to deal with the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   As the boisterous Mets fans left Shea Stadium after Saturday's
win, several chanted, ``We want Chip-pah! We want Chip-pah!''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets and their fans will have to deal with Jones, who
hit four home runs in three games from Sept. 21-23 when the Braves
swept the Mets and finished with a .400 average, seven homers and
16 RBIs in 12 games this season against New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets believe they'll be able to better deal with Jones and
the Braves in the NLCS because of the way they handled the pressure
of the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heart's still pumping,'' said Mets left fielder Rickey
Henderson. ``They felt that when they left, we were no match for
them. They felt we were dead, and that we would not get the
opportunity to see them again. I'm real happy to see them again
since they thought we were dead. Now we can come back alive. The
Braves are a big challenge for this ballclub. Any time you get a
challenge, you get up for that ballgame. This team is going to be
more relaxed now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were giddy after reserve catcher Todd Pratt's home run
in the 10th inning Saturday gave them a 4-3 win in Game 4 and
finished the Diamondbacks. In their champagne-drenched clubhouse,
someone yelled: ``Bring on the Braves.'' Valentine heard the taunt
and answered: ``Yeah. Bring 'em on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's awfully big talk for a team that last season went into
Atlanta for the final weekend needing to win to stay alive in the
wild-card race and were swept in three games. And for a team that
lost five of six games to Atlanta down the stretch this year and
made the playoffs in part because Cincinnati lost two of three on
the final weekend in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets suddenly think all the pressure is on the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a get-back,'' Valentine said. ``I'd like to see what
we can do on the big stage. We'll try to be the underdogs that we
are and just see if we can play on the same field as them. A lot of
people don't think that we have this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics would seem to bear out those opinions. The Braves
outscored the Mets 63-40 in 12 games and hit 18 homers to the Mets'
seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta starting pitchers who will work in this series _
Greg Maddux, Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz _ were a
combined 7-2 against the Mets. Rocker had five saves, allowed no
runs in seven innings and struck out 11 of the 23 Mets he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The New York starters _ Masato Yoshii, Rick Reed, Al Leiter and
Kenny Rogers _ were 1-4 against Atlanta. If Orel Hershiser gets a
start in the series, that figure drops to 1-6. New York's staff ERA
was 5.23 against Atlanta; the Braves' was 3.17 against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that data, New York seems to believe it is the
reincarnation of the 1969 Mets, with a miracle lurking around every
corner. The Mets have had their share of exceedingly good fortune
in the last 10 days against Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Arizona, but
playing Atlanta in October is another matter.

GARCIAPARRA PUTS SELF BACK IN LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GARCIAPARRA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fenway Park press box attendant Guy Spina took the call
at 5:50 Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. There has been a lineup change, he was told.
Nomar's in. The new lineup will be up shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was surprised,'' Spina said, who already had
distributed copies of a lineup that had Lou Merloni as the
shortstop and batting sixth, with no sign of his good buddy
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   An hour earlier, in the family room adjacent to the Red Sox
clubhouse, manager Jimy Williams had informed the team's beat
reporters that Garciaparra would not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have Nomar in the lineup,'' Williams said. ``I didn't
ask him. He didn't swing yesterday, and I don't want to put that
kind of heat on the kid. Take it out of his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Garciaparra took it back into his hands, because by the
time Williams appeared at the pregame press conference, the
flip-flop had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally when he came to the park, I didn't have him in the
lineup,'' Williams said. ``But he wasn't here yet. Because in my
mind, yesterday he couldn't hit in the tunnel. I didn't want to put
a lot of added pressure on this kid, keep asking, `Can you play?'
Is it that monumental to hurt this kid? I don't want to hurt the
kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``So with that in mind, the trainer taped his wrist and he went
out to the tunnel. And after he got done hitting, he came back and
said he could play. So I changed the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had a single in three at-bats, and scored a run
after being hit by a pitch in the fourth. He was lifted for pinch
hitter Merloni in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't suffer any setbacks,'' Williams said. ``I think he's
OK, you know, for tomorrow's game, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 15 days since Garciaparra was struck in the right
wrist by a pitch by Orioles reliever Alberto Reyes at Fenway Park.
After the game, he had X-rays, which were negative, then played the
next day, collecting two singles in four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   He sat out the next game, however. ``It really blew up on me,''
he said at the time, but dismissed the suggestion he might need to
have further tests. ``Whether it's really screwed up or not doesn't
matter,'' Garciaparra said. ``I'm still going to go out there. It's
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a rainout in Chicago, Garciaparra wound up with two
days off, and the next night hit a home run in Comiskey Park in the
victory that clinched a wild-card berth. That would be the last
time he would play in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sept. 30, he was on his way back to Boston for a
magnetic resonance imaging exam. Team physician Arthur Pappas
diagnosed Garciaparra's injury as a bruised tendon (the extensor
carpi ulnaris) in the wrist, administered a cortisone injection,
and Garciaparra missed the last five games of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   He homered and doubled in his first two at-bats in the playoffs
Wednesday in Cleveland but went hitless in three at-bats in Game 2,
with third baseman Travis Fryman stealing a hit from him on his
last at-bat. By the time the series switched to Boston, he was
unable to work out with the club on the offday and was scratched
from the lineup Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar could barely move his wrist,'' teammate Mike Stanley
said Saturday. ``He was having trouble putting on his jacket, for
crying out loud. We didn't go home saying, `Oh my gosh, we're going
to be without Nomar.' We said, `Lou's playing tomorrow; no big
deal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Having to play without Garciaparra, the American League batting
champion, was the worst roster loss the Sox had sustained since
1975, when Jim Rice, who hit .309 with 22 home runs and 102 RBIs,
was hit by a pitch by Vern Ruhle of the Tigers in the season's last
month and missed the playoffs and World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, on the eve of the World Series, the Red Sox were forced
to wait for the National League champion to be decided in a
two-game playoff between the Dodgers and Cardinals. To stay sharp,
the Sox scheduled three exhibitions at Fenway Park against a team
of American League all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day Mickey Haefner of the Senators hit Ted Williams
in the elbow with a pitch,'' said Sox vice president Dick
Bresciani.
</P>
<P>
   Williams played in the Series, the only one in which he appeared
over the course of his 19-season career, but batted just .200, with
no extra-base hits in 25 at-bats and one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted never used it as an excuse,'' Bresciani said, ``but a lot
of people said it really affected his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's teammate, Bobby Doerr, in an interview earlier this
summer, said Williams also had a bad case of the flu during that
Series and never told anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Roger Clemens was pitching against the Orioles in his
last start of the regular season and had a 5-1 lead when Orioles
catcher John Stefero hit a line drive off Clemens's pitching elbow.
There was some doubt whether he'd open the playoffs against the
Angels. He did, but was ineffective and lost, 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Later, of course, came the famous Clemens blister, which led to
his removal from Game 6 of the World Series against the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra appeared in 135 of the Sox' 162 games this season
and made 133 starts. When he started, the Sox were 80-53, 27 games
over .500; they were 14-15 when he didn't. The Sox finished 94-68,
26 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   He had more than his share of aches and pains this season,
beginning with spring training, when he had a strained right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he missed six games with a strained left hamstring. In
May, he missed a game with a bruised right index finger. He missed
two games with a strained left groin in the last week of June,
reaggravated it a week later, and missed the last nine games before
the All-Star break. He missed a game in Oakland Sept. 8 after
fouling a ball off his ankle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   American voters have ample reason for holding their leaders in
disdain. At best, politicians seem like canny tacticians, twisting
in the gusts of opinion polls and focus groups. At worst, they are
brazen liars. (President Bill Clinton is both.)
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as something of a surprise to remember that America
has one presidential candidate who is not just a politician with
principles, but an authentic war hero. He is Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as even more of a shock to realize that most voters
don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hero'' is not too strong a term for McCain. In his recent
book, ``Faith of My Fathers'' (Random House), he writes about
surviving five-and-a-half years in a Vietnamese prisoner-of-war
camp, much of that time spent in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, he carved out for himself a sort of
independence through insubordination _ taunting his captors and
breaking prison rules even at the cost of incurring more
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, McCain refuses to ascribe nobility to his
courage. ``Glory,'' he writes in one passage in his book, ``belongs
to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself, to
a cause, to your principles, to the people on whom you rely, and
who rely on you in return.''
</P>
<P>
   That combination _ sheer guts plus a genuine belief in the
greater good _ would sound unbearably corny in almost any other
politician. But McCain is exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he endure his captivity (and as Bob Dole once
remarked, you tend to accord more respect to someone who spent
five-and-a-half years in a box). But for most of the time it was
voluntary: he refused an offer of early release, saying that those
who had been imprisoned before him should be freed first.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to take punishment for his beliefs has been a
hallmark of McCain's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he defied his own party by proposing a big rise in the
tax on cigarettes that would have penalized some of his party's
biggest corporate donors. Republican leaders killed it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he slammed their $792 billion tax cut as a boondoggle
for special interests (though he voted for it anyway, calculating
that it would be vetoed).
</P>
<P>
   He is still defying them by sponsoring a bill to abolish
``soft-money'' (indirect political contributions not covered by
federal campaign laws). These, he says, corrupt the political
system and ``that shames me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these legislative campaigns have a quixotic,
tilting-at-windmills quality about them. It is not clear whether
campaign-finance reform is possible, let alone whether banning soft
money is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever doubts may exist over that, there was no
questioning McCain's moral clarity on two other issues this year,
both concerning foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone in either party, he urged the Senate to give
President Clinton the option of using ground troops in Kosovo _
articulating more clearly than anyone else the view that America
has interests abroad that are worth dying for.
</P>
<P>
   He made a similar point when he said that Pat Buchanan had put
himself outside the Republican pale when he asserted America had no
national interest in stopping Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   On both occasions, McCain was going against his interests. On
Kosovo, voters were reluctant to send in troops. On Pitchfork Pat,
he stood to lose Buchananites in the Republican primary contest.
But as he said, ``No political campaign is worth sacrificing our
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, this must be the sort of man voters have in mind
when they tell pollsters _ as they routinely do _ that they want
their next president to be a man of integrity. It is hard to
imagine what else they could want.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a puzzle about the voters' reaction to McCain. They
may admire him. But they do not seem to want him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls put him third in the beauty contest, behind Elizabeth
Dole, with only 5 percent of the vote. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, his standing is a testament to the fundraising power and
mesmerizing poll lead of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas. The
Bush steamroller is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of victory
that flattens everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   That might change, of course, if Republicans start focusing on
the limitations of their front-runner, as Democrats are now doing
with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Then, McCain (who has raised more money than any Republican
except Bush) might prove the Bill Bradley of the right. But don't
hold your breath: after eight years out of the White House,
Republicans will not abandon their anointed one unless they have
to.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, too, McCain's low rating may reflect the difficulties of
making his main policy proposal, campaign-finance reform,
interesting to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue quickly gets bogged down in incomprehensible details.
And, anyway, at a time of prosperity, most Americans are reasonably
satisfied with their institutions of state.
</P>
<P>
   But there could also be a more profound reason for McCain's
standing. And it is connected with the very thing that also makes
him so admired: his personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with the embarrassments he talks about
with unflinching and abnormal honesty _ collapsing drunk through
the screen door of a girlfriend's house, or dating a stripper
called ``Marie the Flame of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, such episodes just enhance his reputation as an
honest man with real experience (in contrast to Bush's perceived
frat-boy callowness).
</P>
<P>
   No, the doubt concerns his ferocious tenacity in standing up for
what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resisting, being uncooperative and a general pain in the ass
proved, as it had in the past, to be a morale booster for me,''
McCain writes about his experience in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Such insubordination has been a defining feature of his life. It
was heroic when he dealt with his Vietnamese captors. It was
refreshing when he defied his Republican colleagues over tobacco
taxes or campaign finance. It was powerful when placed in the
service of a vigorous foreign policy, especially considering that
everyone else was wobbly about Kosovo and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so clear that ``a general pain in the ass'' is
what voters want.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders set rules for others. They are the overdog.
Others react to them. This may explain why voters admire, but do
not support, McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He is a courageous man. But his courage lies in resisting what
he thinks is wrong. And Americans may not want a resistance hero as
president. &QL;

FATE SMILES ON VALENTIN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-VALENTIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It seemed that he was trying too hard not to smile. It
was as if John Valentin was auditioning for a spot in the
Buckingham Palace guards' rotation. Just after midnight, he stood
at his Fenway Park locker. He was shuffling through clothes,
pushing some aside and stuffing others into a duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   And not smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll smile a little bit later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you could see a slight grin appear. His team
needed to beat Cleveland Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in the fourth game of this
best-of-five Division Series. The Red Sox did that. They scored 23
runs and Valentin drove in seven. During one eight-at-bat streak in
Games 3 and 4, he had six hits _ three home runs, two doubles, a
single _ and 10 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   You could take the conservative approach and say the Sox beat
the Indians, 23-7. Or you could put it another way: Valentin drove
in as many runs as the Indians scored. He was 4 for 4 with two home
runs. He became the sixth Sox player to hit two homers in a
postseason game. He now finds himself next to Carl Yastrzemski,
Rico Petrocelli, and his buddy Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin is the team's last link to Vaughn. He has a key to the
Hit Dog's Easton home and sometimes goes there and takes some
swings in Vaughn's private batting cage. He sounded like No. 42
early Monday morning after he was reminded that some people wanted
a rookie, Wilton Veras, to replace him at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not he replaces me is the Red Sox' decision,''
Valentin said with a shrug. ``When they do that or if they do that,
someone else will benefit from my services. Until then, I play for
the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Fenway Park was thinking about that Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
Valentin came to bat in the first inning and received a standing
ovation. He responded with a home run. He singled in the second. He
homered again in the third. By the fourth, it was a 10-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Val's a gamer,'' Sox center fielder Darren Lewis said. ``He's
obsessed with the game. He's into every pitch, every at-bat, every
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis spoke some more about Valentin and then turned his
attention to the Boston crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I heard something about them having a lot of flights
available (to Cleveland),'' Lewis said. ``Is that true?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the morning flights to the city by Lake Erie are sold
out. But Sox fans will be relieved to know that Valentin is already
there.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to be fazed by his two-day run. ``It's just two
games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the performance made you wonder. On Friday, the Sox and
Valentin were dismissed. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, everyone got standing
ovations. What started this?
</P>
<P>
   You could almost imagine Valentin among teammates, presiding
over a late-night poker game. During a lull in the conversation,
maybe Valentin proposed that the team have a hitting contest
against the Indians in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dammit, let's do it,'' Valentin probably said as he began to
apply his eye black. And to prove how serious he was about it, he'd
be the one to start the Fenway hitting festival.
</P>
<P>
   If that actually happened, I wouldn't be shocked. In fact, the
Sox have desensitized me to sports stunners. It's so bad now that I
have come to expect the unusual. It's like watching your third
chase scene in an action movie. After a while, you just shrug when
you see the driver of a sputtering Hyundai maneuver his car on an
airport runway, shift into fifth gear, and pull even with the
Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox truly have me twisted. On Saturday, someone came up to
me and said, ``Did you hear about UMass? They were beating
Northeastern, 69-0.'' I nodded and said, ``Did Northeastern come
back?''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Sox have done to New England. At the beginning
of the season, they were heroes to truck drivers and ditch diggers,
window washers and coal miners. Now their popularity has touched
everyone who ever has been underestimated and counted out. Students
who have received Cs for most of their academic careers are now
focused on the Honor Roll. Couples who once believed their love was
gone are now cuddling and listening to Barry White. The Los Angeles
Clippers even think they can win an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in this postseason of resurrection, it is Valentin's
turn to be featured. He said he feels the same as he did a month
ago. He also said he isn't doing anything different. He just looks
different. He explained all of this as he rifled more clothes into
his bag, zipped it, and headed for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   No one thought the team would be in Ohio Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope they score some runs for me,'' said Game 5 starter
Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it shouldn't surprise anyone if the Sox respond
with a 20-run night, Saberhagen throws a two-hitter, and Valentin
goes 5 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   Think about some of the things happening in this series. There
is the cult status of Valentin. Mike Stanley is hitting .625. Manny
Ramirez is hitless (as the fans reminded him _ several times _
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night).
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unusual teams the region ever has seen has a
game Monday night in Cleveland. Valentin will start at third base.
Maybe he'll manage a smile before the night is over.

SEASON RESTS WITH SABERHAGEN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-SABERHAGEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Next up: Bret Saberhagen. Not much at stake. Just a
season. Just a chance to continue what looked impossible only 48
hours ago, a chance to get into the American League Championship
Series against the Yankees beginning Wednesday night in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With Pedro Martinez's back still balky, Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams Sunday &UR;  &LR; night tabbed Saberhagen as the starter for Monday
night's fifth and deciding Division Series game against the Indians
in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, without much discomfort,'' said Saberhagen, who
started and lost Game 2 in Cleveland Thursday night, giving up six
earned runs in 2 2/3 innings. ``Everybody will be well rested,
including myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who combined prayers and pitches to get through the
season, said his arm feels better than it has in some time. ``It's
the first time I've really felt this good in a while,'' he said.
``I've got to go out there, be relaxed, and see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen said he won't push it. ``I won't do anything to
jeopardize the team's chances,'' he said. ``To me, the bottom line
is helping the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he will get that chance.

NORRIS HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _All it takes is two minutes on the phone with Orlin
Norris to get an idea of what Mike Tyson's comeback opponent is
like: intelligent, mild-mannered, normal, the antithesis of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, boxing is a big part of his life. It has been since the
former WBA cruiserweight champion turned pro in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's not like many fighters, obsessed with winning and
holding onto world titles and the glory and other rewards that come
with it. His younger brother, former multi-time champ Terry, was
more like that.
</P>
<P>
   If Norris, 34, is obsessed with anything, it's his family: wife
LaRhonda and their two daughters, Nikki, 9, and Shazay, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a different type of person,'' Norris said. ``When Terry
won his titles, he was saying, `I got to keep my belt, this is
!ital!my title.' When I won mine, I didn't feel like that. I felt
great, but it wasn't everything for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``... My kids and my wife are everything to me. That's where
everything begins and ends.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a big, bad fighter?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Norris, a well-schooled boxer with only average power,
has had a solid, albeit quiet career.
</P>
<P>
   He's 50-5 with 27 knockouts, and has an impressive list of
opponents. He has beaten Greg Page, Oliver McCall, Tony Tucker and
Jesse Ferguson and has lost to Tucker, Bert Cooper and Henry
Akinwande.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Brooks, Tyson's trainer, said Norris is ``a veteran, and
he knows all the tricks in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris' greatest success came in the 190-pound cruiserweight
division, in which he knocked out Marcelo Figueroa to win the title
in 1993. He held the title until he was stopped by Nate Miller two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   It was so difficult for Norris, a natural heavyweight, to make
weight for the latter bout that he had no energy once the opening
bell rang and was stopped in eight rounds. He subsequently
outpointed Miller as a heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   His career could've ended there and he would have been content.
As he put it, ``I've had a good run, I've been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there was one thing eating at him for the past 10
years: He wanted that one shot at the big-time, whether that was an
opportunity to fight for the heavyweight championship or against an
opponent of Tyson's stature.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to fight Evander Holyfield after he outpointed
Page in 1989, but that fight fell through and he wondered whether
such an opportunity would permanently elude him.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't believe it had actually happened until a news
conference held last month to formally announce the Oct. 23 fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much excitement that I felt, it was relief that
it finally was going to happen,'' said Norris, true to his low-key
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one expects much from him against Tyson, who is a
year younger and about the same height and weight (5-10, 220
pounds).
</P>
<P>
   Norris was hand-picked to lose, to be a baby step back into
boxing for an aging former champion who hasn't fought since he
stopped Francois Botha in January because he went back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Logic says Norris has neither the size nor the power to keep
Tyson off of him and will go down quickly, never to be heard from
again.
</P>
<P>
   Norris' response to that? He has a secret weapon: His brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I beat him? I use my head and don't stand in front of
him,'' he said. ``I think I have my advantages: speed, mobility,
boxing ability. I'm going to show the world how I can box.
</P>
<P>
   ``... People are going to be very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Norris will continue to do what he does now: Focus
on the kids.
</P>
<P>
   And not just !ital!his kids, although he could spend every
waking hour with them and remain perfectly happy.
</P>
<P>
   Norris also works with other children in his hometown of
Lubbock, Texas, relating at every turn how he managed to avoid the
pitfalls of growing up in a tough neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to give outside of boxing,'' he said. ``I
witnessed how rough it can be. I wasn't involved in any of it, but
I witnessed it. I'm lucky, I had two parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to the kids, I'm able to talk with them. This is
my neighborhood, the neighborhood I grew up in.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wouldn't hurt his cause if he were to win on Oct.
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help a great deal,'' he said with a laugh. ``I beat
Mike Tyson and people are like, `Yes, Mr. Norris, what would you
like? What can I help you with, Mr. Norris? You want that building
over there for the kids? No problem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris described himself as ``a regular man, just trying to do
what's right.'' He just happens to be a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas-Quartey: HBO is pushing for a bout between IBF junior
middleweight champion Fernando Vargas of Oxnard and former
welterweight champ Ike Quartey, possibly in March.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas had been in negotiations to face WBA junior middleweight
champ David Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Reid is a great kid and a terrific fighter,'' HBO vice
president Lou DiBella said. ``However, it appears that his
promotional firm (America Presents) doesn't want a Vargas fight
right now. We're looking to make a big fight for Fernando, and now
we're talking to the Quartey camp.''
</P>
<P>
   One knowledgeable observer wouldn't have trouble picking a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two best pound-for-pound fighters in the game
right now are Roy Jones and Fernando Vargas,'' said veteran trainer
Emanuel Steward. ``Jones is No.1 and Vargas is No.2. I don't see
anybody beating Fernando. I was very impressed with his performance
against (Raul) Marquez. He showed an amazing ability to analyze his
opponent and fight off the angles that his opponent was giving him.
He showed patience, precision and unbelievable balance. He didn't
waste any punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he nuts?: WBC junior lightweight champion Floyd Mayweather
has rejected a three-year, $12.5million contract offer _ an average
of about $2million per fight _ from HBO.
</P>
<P>
   He called the offer ``a slave contract'' and said he would
accept no less than $3million for his next fight even though he's
never made more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather is immensely talented but hardly the draw such
fighters as Oscar De La Hoya, Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield are.
</P>
<P>
   Even his father/trainer, Floyd Sr., thinks his son has crossed a
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should apologize and hope they accept it,'' he told
the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Press. ``He could be doing himself a big
injustice. If you don't go to HBO, where are you going?
</P>
<P>
   ``... Little Floyd deserves all the money _ De La Hoya kind of
money _ but it takes time.''
</P>

``Best of the Century'' series in November's issue.

extensive, but boxing fans will find it interesting....

   COLORADO SPRINGS _ A Californian, a Texan and a Coloradan are
out drinking. The Texan picks up his Lone Star beer, throws the
bottle in the air, takes out a six-shooter and empties the chamber.
Froth and glass everywhere. ``We've got plenty of beer back in
Texas,'' he says, ``but I've got to keep my aim straight.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour passes, and the Californian starts on his second bottle
of Merlot. He tosses it up, takes out his Saturday Night Special
and blasts away. ``We've got plenty of wine back in the Napa
Valley, but I've got to keep my trigger finger sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Coloradan puts three bottles of Coors beer on the
table, takes out his rifle and shoots the Californian and the
Texan. ``We've got plenty of those back in Colorado,'' he says,
``but the bottles I've got to recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke neatly embodies the changing attitudes of the West. The
huge migration out of California into Rocky Mountain states; the
tension this engenders; and the curious mixture of Old-West gun
culture and high-tech individualism _ between them, these things
have shaped a new political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency, his
victory promised to usher in a period of western dominance of
American politics. The country's economic center of gravity was
shifting westwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reaganism _ populist, internationalist, friendly to business,
skeptical of government _ was distinctively western. And that meant
distinctively Californian; the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest
then seemed little more than California's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of 1980 has been only partly fulfilled.
Economically, the West is the country's fastest-growing area. But
the boom is taking place less in California than in the ``inland
West'' (otherwise known as the mountain West), those states that
straddle the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   So it no longer makes sense to think of this region as someone
else's hinterland. The inland West is a growth area in its own
right. Today's big gravitational shifts are taking place between
different parts of the West, not between the West and the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Latinos pour into California and Texas, whites are pouring
out of California and into the Rockies. As a result, the West is
splitting.
</P>
<P>
   California and the Pacific coast have become more multi-ethnic
and Democrat-controlled. The inland West is economically even more
successful and the most solidly Republican area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the West is becoming like the old California, while
California is becoming less like its old self.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation begins with the rise of the Latino vote.
There are 29 million Latinos in the United States, making them the
country's second-largest minority. California has a third of them,
30 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas in Texas Latinos tend to cluster in the strip
bordering Mexico, in California they are spilling into white
districts, says Rudolfo de la Garza, a professor of government at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This means that whites are starting to need Latino votes to win
even in predominantly white areas. That has changed their political
significance in the state. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Latinos had been a relatively apolitical group.
But galvanized by anti-immigrant measures in California _ notably
Proposition 187, which barred various state benefits to illegal
immigrants _ they are registering to vote on an unprecedented
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion poll for Univision, a Spanish-language
television network, 90 percent of the Latinos questioned said the
most important reason to apply for citizenship is the right to vote
to defend your interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they turned out to vote impressively: though the total
number of votes fell, the Latino turnout rose by nearly a fifth.
This helped to humiliate the once-mighty Republican Party of
California. It lost the governorship, the Senate race, all but two
statewide offices and five seats in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The party's defeat was not entirely due to its alienation of
minority voters. Because of the growth of high-tech firms, whose
executives show little interest in party politics or ideology, the
Republicans are not getting the automatic business support they
once depended on from property developers and aerospace companies,
old stalwarts of the California economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatever the reason, California's Republicans have become _
in the words of one of their own leaders _ the party of ``angry
white males.''
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, the party is self-destructing in the land of
Ronald Reagan. It is $300,000 in debt. Its leaders criticize each
other in the most virulent terms. And in Orange County, the seat of
Reagan's counterrevolution, less than half of all registered voters
are Republican. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a link between the Republican implosion in California
and the party's dominance in the rest of the West. According to
Bill Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in California,
more than 1.6 million people have left the state in the past
decade, most of them middle-income and working-class whites.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, 1.4 million more people moved into the
states of the inland West than moved out of them. If you include
Texas, Oregon and Washington (also targets of Californian flight),
the figure for internal migration is 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of those moving came from California. This had
unexpected consequences. For much of the 1990s, western politicians
talked about the ``greening'' of the West, about the growth of
Democratic power there, and even about the collapse of the ``Old
West,'' socially and economically.
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out quite that way. Certainly the reliance on
primary industries has gone, to the point where ranchers and
farmers feel they are constantly on the defensive. But, instead of
greening, the West has been urbanizing _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The eight inland West states now contain six of the top ten
fastest-growing states by job creation and population, and five of
the ten states with the highest personal-income gains.
</P>
<P>
   This is genuine, bottom-up growth, not the boom-and-bust kind
that used to characterize the West. The gold and copper mining
industries that rose and fell with such spectacular suddenness are
still in the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   This boom is largely a high-tech affair. Denver is one of
America's leading cable-television and telecommunications centers,
home to TCI, a big cable television firm.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah, are other fast-growing
high-tech centers. Intel's largest production plant is in Portland,
Ore. And so on, right up to Washington state and Microsoft.
</P>

   As recently as 1975, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the
state legislatures of the West by 739 to 488 (this excludes
California). Now the Republicans have 712 seats and the Democrats
514.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, there are only four Democrats in the 35-member state
Senate. All eight mountain states have Republican governors. All
the Pacific states (including Alaska and Hawaii) have Democratic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   This is not entirely because of the Californian arrivals. As
Phil Burgess, the head of the Center for the New West, puts it:
``The disappearance of highly unionized, blue-collar workers in the
mines, smelters and mills of the West has eviscerated the core
component of the Democratic base.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of it stemmed from the Californian emigrants'
concurrence with rock-ribbed western conservatism. As it turned
out, those who left California were not greenniks; they were
Reaganite Republicans who brought their views with them. &QL;

   The present western scene, then, is a strange one. For the
moment, ranchers and city-slicker computer wizards both find
themselves under the Republican label, united by a common disdain
for taxes and regulation. Yet social issues, from health care to
immigration, often divide the more tolerant techies from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This ideological disconnect has already caused intense fights
within the western state legislatures, and is likely to have a
large impact on next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Added to this volatility is another Californian import:
Republican intolerance of the growing influence of Latinos, which
threatens to do for the party in the inland West just what it did
for the party in California.
</P>
<P>
   Put all these together, and there is just a slight glimmer of
hope for Democrats who wonder how the New West can be won. &QL;

   COLORADO SPRINGS _ A Californian, a Texan and a Coloradan are
out drinking. The Texan picks up his Lone Star beer, throws the
bottle in the air, takes out a six-shooter and empties the chamber.
Froth and glass everywhere. ``We've got plenty of beer back in
Texas,'' he says, ``but I've got to keep my aim straight.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour passes, and the Californian starts on his second bottle
of Merlot. He tosses it up, takes out his Saturday Night Special
and blasts away. ``We've got plenty of wine back in the Napa
Valley, but I've got to keep my trigger finger sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Coloradan puts three bottles of Coors beer on the
table, takes out his rifle and shoots the Californian and the
Texan. ``We've got plenty of those back in Colorado,'' he says,
``but the bottles I've got to recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke neatly embodies the changing attitudes of the West. The
huge migration out of California into Rocky Mountain states; the
tension this engenders; and the curious mixture of Old-West gun
culture and high-tech individualism _ between them, these things
have shaped a new political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency, his
victory promised to usher in a period of western dominance of
American politics. The country's economic center of gravity was
shifting westwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reaganism _ populist, internationalist, friendly to business,
skeptical of government _ was distinctively western. And that meant
distinctively Californian; the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest
then seemed little more than California's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of 1980 has been only partly fulfilled.
Economically, the West is the country's fastest-growing area. But
the boom is taking place less in California than in the ``inland
West'' (otherwise known as the mountain West), those states that
straddle the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   So it no longer makes sense to think of this region as someone
else's hinterland. The inland West is a growth area in its own
right. Today's big gravitational shifts are taking place between
different parts of the West, not between the West and the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Latinos pour into California and Texas, whites are pouring
out of California and into the Rockies. As a result, the West is
splitting.
</P>
<P>
   California and the Pacific coast have become more multi-ethnic
and Democrat-controlled. The inland West is economically even more
successful and the most solidly Republican area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the West is becoming like the old California, while
California is becoming less like its old self.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation begins with the rise of the Latino vote.
There are 29 million Latinos in the United States, making them the
country's second-largest minority. California has a third of them,
30 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas in Texas Latinos tend to cluster in the strip
bordering Mexico, in California they are spilling into white
districts, says Rudolfo de la Garza, a professor of government at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This means that whites are starting to need Latino votes to win
even in predominantly white areas. That has changed their political
significance in the state. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Latinos had been a relatively apolitical group.
But galvanized by anti-immigrant measures in California _ notably
Proposition 187, which barred various state benefits to illegal
immigrants _ they are registering to vote on an unprecedented
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion poll for Univision, a Spanish-language
television network, 90 percent of the Latinos questioned said the
most important reason to apply for citizenship is the right to vote
to defend your interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they turned out to vote impressively: though the total
number of votes fell, the Latino turnout rose by nearly a fifth.
This helped to humiliate the once-mighty Republican Party of
California. It lost the governorship, the Senate race, all but two
statewide offices and five seats in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The party's defeat was not entirely due to its alienation of
minority voters. Because of the growth of high-tech firms, whose
executives show little interest in party politics or ideology, the
Republicans are not getting the automatic business support they
once depended on from property developers and aerospace companies,
old stalwarts of the California economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatever the reason, California's Republicans have become _
in the words of one of their own leaders _ the party of ``angry
white males.''
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, the party is self-destructing in the land of
Ronald Reagan. It is $300,000 in debt. Its leaders criticize each
other in the most virulent terms. And in Orange County, the seat of
Reagan's counterrevolution, less than half of all registered voters
are Republican. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a link between the Republican implosion in California
and the party's dominance in the rest of the West. According to
Bill Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in California,
more than 1.6 million people have left the state in the past
decade, most of them middle-income and working-class whites.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, 1.4 million more people moved into the
states of the inland West than moved out of them. If you include
Texas, Oregon and Washington (also targets of Californian flight),
the figure for internal migration is 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of those moving came from California. This had
unexpected consequences. For much of the 1990s, western politicians
talked about the ``greening'' of the West, about the growth of
Democratic power there, and even about the collapse of the ``Old
West,'' socially and economically.
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out quite that way. Certainly the reliance on
primary industries has gone, to the point where ranchers and
farmers feel they are constantly on the defensive. But, instead of
greening, the West has been urbanizing _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The eight inland West states now contain six of the top ten
fastest-growing states by job creation and population, and five of
the ten states with the highest personal-income gains.
</P>
<P>
   This is genuine, bottom-up growth, not the boom-and-bust kind
that used to characterize the West. The gold and copper mining
industries that rose and fell with such spectacular suddenness are
still in the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   This boom is largely a high-tech affair. Denver is one of
America's leading cable-television and telecommunications centers,
home to TCI, a big cable television firm.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah, are other fast-growing
high-tech centers. Intel's largest production plant is in Portland,
Ore. And so on, right up to Washington state and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these companies, and much of the growth as a whole, have
been encouraged by people who left California for the great
outdoors. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ You say the Raiders; we smell invader.
</P>
<P>
   How 'bout the Vikings? Not to our liking.
</P>
<P>
   You want the Saints? Support 'em, we ain't.
</P>
<P>
   So that leaves the Cards...
</P>
<P>
   And there's probably a bunch of stupid rhyming words we could
find to finish off this little ditty, but to tell you the truth, we
pretty much lost interest when we started calculating the interest
the NFL owners would be making on Bob McNair's extortion payments.
</P>
<P>
   History lesson: Once upon a time, when we were trying to
establish ourselves as something more than a place that made
movies, we actually used the NFL to help give us some civic pride.
We allowed Cleveland's first NFL team a long visit at the Coliseum,
then a visit to Anaheim, before the reality of the league's greed
was rammed home.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we embraced Brooklyn's lovable (but winning) bums.
We then took in Minneapolis' wayward (but winning) cagers. We
accepted the Raiders the first time when we felt two teams befitted
our standards, and they brought us a Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got ugly. And this Ellis Island mentality didn't work in
the modern-day sports landscape of the City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give us your tired, your weary, your deadbeat franchises
anymore. And, no, it's not because everyone around here is
!ital!apathetic to the NFL; we're only turned off by its pathetic
self-righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   Of those choices above, if we have to get someone's used team,
we'd just as well pass. Your L.A. visa has been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   We suggest trying the Salvation Army, if you're really looking
for a tax break....
</P>
<P>
   And, sure, it kinda irks us right about now to see the St. Louis
Rams kickin' some rear ends....
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while we were force-fed the Broncos-at-Raiders game
on TV Sunday, the home-bound Oaklanders didn't see it. It was
blacked out. For the 17th straight home game. Somethin' about the
Raiders failing to sell out again....
</P>
<P>
   To put into perspective Jackie Robinson's color-barrier-busting
feat in 1947, Time magazine includes it in a special ``Great Events
of the 20th Century'' issue _ not in the sports category with Jesse
Owens' Hitler-dissin' feat at the '36 Olympics, but under events
that affected society. It was, if you remember, the catalyst for
Harry Truman's ordering integration of the armed forces (1948), the
Supreme Court decision against segregated schools (1954) and the
Rosa Parks-inspired bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., led by Martin
Luther King (1955).
</P>
<P>
   So with all that, Robinson will make the ESPN ``SportsCentury''
Top-100 athlete list at No.15. If you factor in what we just ran
down, he's bigger than Ali, Jordan and the Bambino combined. If you
consider him as a pure athlete _ and we're well aware of what he
did at UCLA _ Robinson hardly made the impact to put him that close
to the top....
</P>
<P>
   The wooden leg once attached to famed Chicago White Sox owner
Bill Veeck goes up for auction in Illinois next month. It's even
autographed _ he gave it to a Chicago tavern owner in 1977 as a
good luck charm after a new prosthesis had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Opening bid is $1,000, and speculation is it will go for
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't touch it....
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``Strikeout,'' the book that's been out for a
while by former Detroit Tigers star pitcher Denny McLain.
</P>
<P>
   The big leagues' last 30-game winner has been holed up in a
Pennsylvania federal prison for all kinds of charges. He missed the
Tiger Stadium going-away party, but was hardly mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's Tuesday installment of ``Real Sports'' sent host Bryant
Gumbel to interview the man who insists he's been incarcerated even
though ``I had nothing to do with this... not one damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A snippet of the interview:
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel: ``(In your book) you admitted to giving and receiving
kickbacks, extortion, loan sharking and buying a plane to smuggle
and transport drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   McLain: ``No, that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel: ``They are not my words, Denny, they're yours.''
</P>
<P>
   McLain: ``Well, it made a good book, I guess.'' &QL;

<P>
   Last weekend, in one of the most prosperous and steady countries
in Europe, more than a quarter of those who voted plumped for a
party whose leader, Jorg Haider, is widely regarded _ especially
outside his own country _ as the next worst thing to a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Austria's two established parties, the Social Democrats
and the conservative People's Party, which have run the country
between them since 1945, got their lowest proportion of the vote in
any postwar election.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's Freedom Party came second (though the final count of
absentee ballots might yet bump it down to third) with 27 percent,
behind the Social Democrats' 33 percent but a whisker ahead of the
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Will Haider now get his first slice of top-level power, in
coalition? And, if he did so, would this mean that fascism was
crawling back into the mainstream of European politics?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are that it is hard to say _ and no. The Social
Democratic chancellor, Viktor Klima, who has governed Austria since
1997 in coalition with the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel,
says he will never share power with the Freedomites. Schussel
previously said he would bow out of government altogether if his
lot came third.
</P>
<P>
   Though constitutionally feasible, it is unlikely that the Social
Democrats, as the largest party, would rule as a minority
government, perhaps with the Greens, who pulled in 7 percent; at a
big pinch, they might just seek a minimal agreement (on a budget,
for instance) with the mainstream conservatives, without resuming
their 13-year-old coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is whether Schussel might, after all, be
prevailed upon by some of his power-hungrier colleagues to team up,
as chancellor, with the controversial Haider after all. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   To judge by the steamy comments of some leading politicians
across the continent, an Austrian government with the Freedomites
on board would put the country beyond the pale. Not so, said Edmund
Stoiber, who leads Bavaria's right-wing Christian Social Union and
is himself a possible future German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Looking south across his state's border, he said that a long
period of rule by ``grand coalition,'' as in Austria, was always
bad; that, by implication, Haider's lot had genuinely changed their
spots; and that the mainstream conservatives should agree to share
power with them.
</P>
<P>
   Other continental conservatives were less sanguine. Volker Ruhe,
a leading German Christian Democrat, upbraided Stoiber for his
indulgence towards Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's former fascists, led by Gianfranco Fini, who themselves
briefly shared power in a ruling coalition in 1994, sounded
cautious: Italian and Austrian ultranationalists have unsettled
territorial arguments. But Fini said that Haider was ``no racist
and no Nazi.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how frightening is he? There is no doubt that Haider, the son
of a Nazi official and notorious, some years ago, for praising
aspects of Hitler's ``employment policy'' and for toasting a bunch
of former SS veterans as ``decent fellows,'' gets the old Nazi vote
_ in a country which never truly denazified itself and
proportionately had more Nazi party members, in Hitler's time, than
Germany did.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Haider's people clearly pander to racial and
xenophobic prejudice, harping on illegal immigration and the crime
that they blame on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider also espouses more defensible policies. His strongest
card is opposition to the system of Proporz, whereby patronage for
all sorts of public jobs, down to bottle-washers and drivers, still
tends to be shared out among card-holders of the two establishment
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has other strong views that are likewise unexceptionable
on democratic grounds. He was against Austria joining the European
Union, though he no longer argues for withdrawal; with immigration
again in mind, he is against the EU's eastbound expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Another policy puts him closer to most other continental
mainstreamers: unlike Austria's Social Democrats, he, along with
the People's Party, wants his country to join NATO. Lastly, he has
shed the corporatism of his Nazi political forebears, arguing
instead for privatization and a low, flat tax on income.
</P>
<P>
   The real respectability yardstick, for Haider and others with
the far-right label, is whether they are true parliamentary
democrats who accept the rule of law, replete with safeguards for
minorities. Maybe they do now. Would they if by chance they won
power _ as Haider conceivably might?
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, the answers vary. Disciples of Jean-Marie Le Pen
seem to long for a punch-up in the street. So do the hate-filled
ultranationalist of Central and Eastern Europe, for whom
parliaments are generally obstacles in countries where democracy is
still taking root _ for instance, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Hungary and Russia itself. But nowhere is fascism clearly a looming
feature of the political landscape. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   More promisingly, several political parties that have roots in
anti-democracy have genuinely joined the mainstream: despite their
lineal descent from Mussolini, Italy's post-fascists, under the
rather canny Gianfranco Fini, are nowadays accepted, even on the
left, as having a legitimate role _ as democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in Spain, the ruling mainstream conservative People's Party,
under Jose Maria Aznar, which pulls together several strands
including one that threads back to the old authoritarian right of
General Franco, has moved far enough to the center to have made its
leader an avowed political soul mate of Britain's Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   There are also parties with the far-right tag which are, in
fact, extreme libertarian, and which, by the by, want to squeeze
the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   In Norway, where such attitudes are controversial, Carl Hagen's
Progress Party has steadily crept up in the polls, and now gets
about 15 percent, but he is hardly a threat to Scandinavian
democracy, let alone heir to the viciousness of Vidkun Quisling,
Hitler's Norwegian nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in Switzerland, the flinty, populist, anti-EU People's
Party, with _ yes _ a whiff of anti-immigrant nastiness (a charge
also laid against Hagen), has had similar success challenging the
woollier conservatism of the Christian Democrats for the mantle of
the broad right. But it would be unfair to call it crypto-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   All told, parties with a Nazi flavor are doing poorly across the
continent. In southern Europe, where postwar democracy was once
weakest, the anti-democratic parties, from Portugal to Greece, have
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Europe, xenophobic parties (in Denmark, for
instance, and in ethnically divided Belgium) can sometimes notch up
weighty scores in decrepit cities, often egged on by hostility to
the sovereignty-eroding European Union. But they never come close
to getting real power, beyond the odd city hall.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the splitting of Le Pen's National Front into two
wings, one of them purporting to be more civilized than the other,
seems to have done for both bits of it.
</P>
<P>
   The worst recent outbreak of the nastier sort of far-right virus
has been in eastern Germany, where the racist German People's Union
(DVU), exploiting high unemployment and post-unification trauma,
got 13 percent in a state election last year. But its vote slumped
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's twitchiness about its past is still reassuringly
acute: there is little sign of a thoroughgoing far-right revival.
Anglo-Saxons and perhaps Nordics, without the baggage of a recent
fascist, communist or authoritarian past, are more comfortable with
the simple labels ``right'' and ``left.''
</P>
<P>
   Other continentals prefer ``center-right'' and ``center-left,''
fearing that plain ``right'' carries a hint of anti-democracy. More
and more continentals tend to think, ``We are all centrists now.''
Even the once undoubted far-righters, such as Fini and Haider in
Italy and Austria, would love to relabel themselves as just plain
right. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   A certain queasiness is inevitable when their vote count starts
matching or even overtaking their rivals on the old center-right.
In the early 1920s, their forebears were unwisely shrugged off,
often as comical irrelevances. But that was then. Democracy
nowadays is much stronger, prosperity much more widely spread.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better if Haider were sent packing. But _ thanks in
part to the transnational strictures of the European Union _
neither Austria nor Europe will suffer unduly if he is not. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend, in one of the most prosperous and steady countries
in Europe, more than a quarter of those who voted plumped for a
party whose leader, Jorg Haider, is widely regarded _ especially
outside his own country _ as the next worst thing to a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Austria's two established parties, the Social Democrats
and the conservative People's Party, which have run the country
between them since 1945, got their lowest proportion of the vote in
any postwar election.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's Freedom Party came second (though the final count of
absentee ballots might yet bump it down to third) with 27 percent,
behind the Social Democrats' 33 percent but a whisker ahead of the
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Will Haider now get his first slice of top-level power, in
coalition? And, if he did so, would this mean that fascism was
crawling back into the mainstream of European politics?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are that it is hard to say _ and no. The Social
Democratic chancellor, Viktor Klima, who has governed Austria since
1997 in coalition with the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel,
says he will never share power with the Freedomites. Schussel
previously said he would bow out of government altogether if his
lot came third.
</P>
<P>
   Though constitutionally feasible, it is unlikely that the Social
Democrats, as the largest party, would rule as a minority
government, perhaps with the Greens, who pulled in 7 percent; at a
big pinch, they might just seek a minimal agreement (on a budget,
for instance) with the mainstream conservatives, without resuming
their 13-year-old coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is whether Schussel might, after all, be
prevailed upon by some of his power-hungrier colleagues to team up,
as chancellor, with the controversial Haider after all. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the steamy comments of some leading politicians
across the continent, an Austrian government with the Freedomites
on board would put the country beyond the pale. Not so, said Edmund
Stoiber, who leads Bavaria's right-wing Christian Social Union and
is himself a possible future German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Looking south across his state's border, he said that a long
period of rule by ``grand coalition,'' as in Austria, was always
bad; that, by implication, Haider's lot had genuinely changed their
spots; and that the mainstream conservatives should agree to share
power with them.
</P>
<P>
   Other continental conservatives were less sanguine. Volker Ruhe,
a leading German Christian Democrat, upbraided Stoiber for his
indulgence towards Haider.

   Like much else on the Internet, online advertising is full of
jargon. Here is a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Banners are the inch-high straps found at the top of a web page.
They are the workhorse of Internet advertising, accounting for some
60 percent (including buttons, see below) of all online
advertisements, according to IAB/PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Banners usually carry a company name, a message and an
enticement to click. They can be static or animated, but they are
not interactive, and they carry you to another website if you click
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Although banners remain the most popular form of web
advertising, they are the least likely to elicit a response.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent buttons are smaller than banners and are enduring
features of a site. They can also sit close to relevant content;
and response rates can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, E*Trade, an online broker, can put its button next
to a share tip on a financial site. However, most buttons are not
interactive and, like banners, take you away from the website if
you click on them.
</P>
<P>
   Interstitials are advertisements that pop up on their own
article in between content pages. For the most part, users cannot
click on them. Although they offer features such as video and
audio, they have fallen from favor because they are so big that
they can take as long as two minutes to download, irritating users.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitials are new, improved interstitials that download
``politely'' in the browser's short-term memory so that they do not
interrupt users.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hopple, chief executive of Unistat, which launched the
technology this year, thinks superstitials can match the quality of
television for brand-building advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rich-media expanding banners use technology such as Flash,
Enliven, Shockwave and Java to combine video, audio, animation and
photographs and let the viewer click on them without leaving the
original web page.
</P>
<P>
   They take live website information directly to the viewer,
allowing him to shop, register for information and interact,
without ever leaving the original site.
</P>
<P>
   However, websites dislike them because they cover content, take
time to download and, at worst, can crash the site.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is one of the cheapest, most effective marketing methods
on the Internet, with response rates of between 5 percent and 25
percent. And yet e-mail represents only 1 percent of
online-advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Like rich-media banners, e-mails bring an offer or product
information direct to consumers. The problem is to avoid spam and
clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Users enter sweepstakes to win prizes, get discounts or,
increasingly, cash in exchange for telling a marketer who they are,
i.e., registering.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet software can track movement on the web, it
cannot get personal information such as addresses and age.
Affiliate deals split an advertiser's revenue with the site in
exchange for free advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester estimates that, by 2004, half of all online
advertising revenue will be based on performance. Sponsorships or
co-branded deals usually involve payment up-front whether or not
there is a sale. Such deals often deploy the gamut of
Internet-advertising techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble and Yahoo! have united to market P&AMP;G's Pringles
crisps, Pepto-Bismol medicine and Pampers diapers.
</P>
<P>
   They are using banners and e-mails to bring traffic to the site
and sweepstakes to get users to register. &QL;

   Interstitials are advertisements that pop up on their own
article in between content pages. For the most part, users cannot
click on them. Although they offer features such as video and
audio, they have fallen from favor because they are so big that
they can take as long as two minutes to download, irritating users.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitials are new, improved interstitials that download
``politely'' in the browser's short-term memory so that they do not
interrupt users.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hopple, chief executive of Unistat, which launched the
technology this year, thinks superstitials can match the quality of
television for brand-building advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rich-media expanding banners use technology such as Flash,
Enliven, Shockwave and Java to combine video, audio, animation and
photographs and let the viewer click on them without leaving the
original web page.
</P>
<P>
   They take live website information directly to the viewer,
allowing him to shop, register for information and interact,
without ever leaving the original site.
</P>
<P>
   However, websites dislike them because they cover content, take
time to download and, at worst, can crash the site.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is one of the cheapest, most effective marketing methods
on the Internet, with response rates of between 5 percent and 25
percent. And yet e-mail represents only 1 percent of
online-advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Like rich-media banners, e-mails bring an offer or product
information direct to consumers. The problem is to avoid spam and
clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Users enter sweepstakes to win prizes, get discounts or,
increasingly, cash in exchange for telling a marketer who they are,
i.e., registering.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet software can track movement on the web, it
cannot get personal information such as addresses and age.
Affiliate deals split an advertiser's revenue with the site in
exchange for free advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester estimates that, by 2004, half of all online
advertising revenue will be based on performance. Sponsorships or
co-branded deals usually involve payment up-front whether or not
there is a sale. Such deals often deploy the gamut of
Internet-advertising techniques.

   Like much else on the Internet, online advertising is full of
jargon. Here is a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Banners are the inch-high straps found at the top of a web page.
They are the workhorse of Internet advertising, accounting for some
60 percent (including buttons, see below) of all online
advertisements, according to IAB/PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Banners usually carry a company name, a message and an
enticement to click. They can be static or animated, but they are
not interactive, and they carry you to another website if you click
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Although banners remain the most popular form of web
advertising, they are the least likely to elicit a response.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent buttons are smaller than banners and are enduring
features of a site. They can also sit close to relevant content;
and response rates can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, E*Trade, an online broker, can put its button next
to a share tip on a financial site. However, most buttons are not
interactive and, like banners, take you away from the website if
you click on them.
</P>
<P>
   Interstitials are advertisements that pop up on their own
article in between content pages. For the most part, users cannot
click on them. Although they offer features such as video and
audio, they have fallen from favor because they are so big that
they can take as long as two minutes to download, irritating users.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitials are new, improved interstitials that download
``politely'' in the browser's short-term memory so that they do not
interrupt users.

6 BILLION _ ANYBODY COUNTING?

 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The world takes aboard its 6 billionth passenger sometime
Tuesday. Come on, folks, squeeze together and make room for one
more.
<P>
   That's a humbling number. It makes one aware of one's
insignificance, if one needed awareness of that.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it. Six billion people, and how many of them will read
this column? Not more than half of them.
</P>
<P>
   Six billion, isn't that just about capacity? Maybe somebody
should install Bay Bridge-style metering lights in Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Please be patient, folks. You'll all get your turn. &LR; 
 &UR; We're killing 'em off as fast as we can down there. We've got &LR; 
 &UR; wars raging, genocides, ethnic cleansings, plagues, nuclear &LR; 
 &UR; goofs, now we're throwing earthquakes at 'em right and left. The &LR; 
 &UR; United States is doing a fine job resisting gun control. So &LR; 
 &UR; please stay in your line, either ``Nike Wearers'' or ``Nike &LR; 
 &UR; Makers,'' and the lines will be moving soon. Be sure to have &LR; 
 &UR; your boarding pass ready when your stork arrives. &LR;

<P>
   To get the scoop on the population boom-boom, where better to go
than to the Boom Boom Room? At John Lee Hooker's blues place in the
Fillmore, business was, yes, booming.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing about a blues club is that everyone always seems
to be having a good time. Are they unclear on the concept? Just a
little earlier, many of these same people were moping and bitching
at some bar during happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the blues performers can give you the blues.
Lonesome Long-Gone Howlin' Muddy Blind Lemon Smith. My favorite
blues name is Magic Slim, because like I always say, you can never
be too slim or too magic.
</P>
<P>
   The song subject matter is hardly cheerful. My woman done run
off with the Webvan.com delivery guy. Took my Lexus and my Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there was no doom and gloom at the Boom Boom Room.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Let  &LR; her  &UR; make the Lexus payments. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WANT THE BLUES? Just cue up the tape of Sunday's 49ers game.
</P>
<P>
   The team that once boasted the most enlightened, generous
ownership in the game o' football got smoked by the Ramzzz, a team
that, until a couple weeks ago, was at the opposite end of that
spectrum, owned by a miserly, clueless ditz.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is nearing the end, Young might be toast, the new stadium
plans are a joke, the current 49ers owner has as much allegiance to
San Francisco as does Jerry Falwell. Dark days, fans.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young missed his appointment with the noggin doctor
Friday, and the 49ers would have fined him, but Steve forgot where
he buried his life savings.
</P>
<P>
   Old Genius (Bill Walsh) and the Apprentice Genius (Steve
Mariucci) didn't do the one thing they had to do this season:
protect their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery caller known as Old Homeboy says the 49ers should
have done what Steve Young's ad agency did. In one of Steve's new
TV commercials (for cars? milk?), Young is sitting at his kitchen
table surrounded by cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 49ers should have surrounded Young with cows,'' Old
Homeboy moans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 49ers opted for sleek, twinkle-toed interior
linemen who get tossed around like skunks crossing the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   The 49er fans aren't booing, they're saying, ``Mooooo.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST PERSON to be Y2K'd? It might have been the late Fred
Small.
</P>
<P>
   Fred was born in 1899, and in 1989, at age 90, he applied for an
additional credit card. The company denied Fred because he was
``not old enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer obviously thought Fred was five  &LR; 10 years short of
being born, and the unborn are notoriously bad credit risks.
</P>
<P>
   Fred died at 94, at an awkward stage: Too old to live but too
young for a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   TRUTH IN ADVERTISING? I hope so. I'm going to run to Macy's and
pick up a pair of Sandhurst clogs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeni Paltiel brought the Macy's ad to my attention. It says the
shoe has ``antigravity construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Won't the fellas at the gym be surprised when this old-timer
shows up in clogs and starts dunking in their faces?
</P>
<P>
   I have often walked down this street before, but the pavement
always stayed beneath my feet before.
</P>
<P>
   THE BLUE ANGELS dazzled again over the weekend, although it's
harder and harder for them to impress the fans with their routine,
since more and more commercial airliners are performing similar
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Howard was one of the thousands of oohers and aahers, but
she wonders: What do those Blue Angels pilots do after work to let
their hair down? After buzzing San Francisco rooftops at 600 mph,
what do these guys do for kicks? Drink a brewski and play pinball?
</P>
<P>
   I think what they do is screw up their courage and take a wild,
gut-wrenching ride with one of the city's infamous stunt cabbies,
the Yellow Angels.

 GOP FEARS GAME OF BUDGET POKER AT CLINTON'S TABLE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out in the last session before a
presidential election year, congressional Republicans are once
again heading into a budget showdown with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's near perfect record in past confrontations,
including the  &LR; a 1995 government shutdown that deeply wounded the
GOP, many Republicans fear that this time the fight might cost them
their majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best Republicans can hope for is that no one is paying
much attention and it will have no effect a year from now,'' said
conservative publisher and GOP strategist Bill Kristol.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders find themselves falling into the trap they tried to
set for Clinton: the charge that the president is raiding Social
Security to pay for his new spending.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Republicans who are on track to tap Social Security
money first, because they cannot hold the line on their own
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just could well be the straw that breaks the camel's
back,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., referring to the cumulative
weight of repeated GOP failures to contain spending. ``Republicans
have been near indistinguishable from Democrats, and that ...
perception could have cataclysmic political implications for the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   As the budget fight reaches its crescendo, Republicans find
themselves snared by their own appetite for spending _ from aid to
farmers to military pay increases _ and headed for a budget summit
with a president who knows they will do virtually anything to avoid
another government shutdown, including spending Social Security
money they have vowed never to touch, to pay for programs Clinton
wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're playing poker with somebody and you know at least
part of what's in their hand, you've got an advantage,'' Sanford
said. ``The one thing (Clinton) knows is in our hand is the fact
that we don't want a government shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly the endgame that GOP leaders planned when they
mapped out their political strategy last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tiny five-vote House majority that left no room for
error, Republicans vowed to stay within budget constraints that
were projected to produce a $161 billion surplus _ $147 billion of
it in Social Security revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pass the 13 annual appropriations bills without
touching the surplus to force Clinton to drain Social Security
money to fund his spending programs. It would produce a stark
political contrast: responsible Republicans who protect Social
Security versus spendthrift Democrats who rob future generations.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, boasted in August that
this tactic would force Clinton to negotiate with the GOP ``on his
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months later, Republicans are on their knees
scrounging in dark corners for ways to stuff $612 billion of
spending into a $580 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid tapping Social Security revenue, Republicans have
resorted to a host of accounting tricks, from ``score-keeping
adjustments'' that simply make red ink disappear to designating the
2000 census an ``emergency'' to stretching out payments of the
earned income tax credit to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the effort from a campaign stop in San Jose, GOP
presidential front-runner George W. Bush pointedly distanced
himself, blasting the last ploy as an attempt to ``balance the
budget on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems began early this year, as spending pressure within
the GOP's own ranks, magnified by demands from congressional
Democrats and the White House (Clinton has threatened to veto bills
that don't fund his priorities), inexorably pushed this year's
appropriations bills over budget.
</P>
<P>
   With a five-vote margin that is so tight they do morning head
counts to ensure they have a majority on any given day, Republicans
simply did not have the votes to pass bills that restrain spending,
much less make controversial cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture was the first big item to break the budget, starting
with a mammoth $7.4 billion emergency farm aid package that has
grown to $8.7 billion. Both parties also agreed on a big boost for
the military, with added money for transportation, scientific
research, veterans hospitals and other items. But few were willing
to cut anywhere else to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and I spent 14 hours on the House
floor with the (agriculture) bill trying to cut some things out _
which to both of us didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense _
nobody was willing to hold the line,'' Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Republicans continue to insist they will not dip into next
year's Social Security surplus. ``Our resolve to end the 30-year
raid on Social Security is total,'' House GOP leaders vowed in a
September 28 statement. ``We've drawn a line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   They are about to cross that line.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the party announced a $5 million ad campaign to back
up its promise, the Congressional Budget Office issued a letter
saying Republicans were on course to overspend by $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical idea of cleverness by a congressional party,
which is too cute by half,'' Kristol said. ``We can inoculate
ourselves against Social Security by saying we're not going to
touch the Social Security surplus ... but then you realize, whoops,
well, the appropriations bills aren't going to be quite low enough
... so then they start looking at accounting gimmicks like a 13th
month, and then of course everyone comes down on them like a ton of
bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would spend even more than Republicans, but the
president claims not to be raiding Social Security because he
proposes to increase cigarette taxes by 55 cents per pack.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, however, that won't
cover all the added spending either.
</P>
<P>
   Fully aware that Republicans will do anything to avoid another
government shutdown, Democrats have stepped up their invitations to
Republicans to negotiate, perhaps in another White House budget
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, GOP leaders emerged from a similar powwow with
billions in fresh spending, their tough budget promises in a
shambles, conservative voters disgusted and the loss of six
precious House seats in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months, I have as an interested observer wondered and
worried what the endgame strategy is,'' said retired Napa
Republican Rep. Frank Riggs, ``and I believe it's become apparent
that they really don't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  He added, ``It is somewhat amazing and perplexing because
we've been down this road before. We know that the president holds
most of the cards and that these last-minute, year-end
deliberations ... play right into his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreading another budget summit, Republicans are now floating the
idea of across-the-board spending cuts. Democrats are already
responding by charging that such cuts would eviscerate popular
programs ranging from education to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cal Dooley, a Central Valley Democrat, said the most likely
outcome is a replay of last year, in which ``they end up in a
situation where they have to negotiate an omnibus budget bill with
the president, who is then in a very, very strong position.''

 AS POPULATION HITS MILESTONE, SCIENTIST WORRY ABOUT CONSUMERISM  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime Tuesday, the United Nations estimates, the world's 6
billionth person will be born. The event will probably occur on the
Indian subcontinent, and the baby's parents will likely be of
humble means.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they'll be subsistence farmers, woodcutters or
tradespeople. Maybe they'll own a small shop. Their ambitions will
not be overweening: weatherproof shelter, sufficient food and
adequate clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely the world's 6 billionth inhabitant will grow
up to share its parents' modest aspirations. Given current trends,
the child may consume more than its parents _ much more.
</P>
<P>
   And not just rice and homespun cotton cloth. He or she will
want, and probably obtain, a wide array of sophisticated consumer
goods: a television, radio and refrigerator. Processed food and
drink. Perhaps even a motor scooter or car.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem, many scientists say. The population
crisis isn't just about more people, though that's certainly a big
part of it. The United Nations projects there will be 9 billion or
more living on the planet by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about the inevitable expectations of the billions of
people who will be born in the coming decades. Most will be born in
developing countries; most will aspire to the same energy-intensive
consumerism now promulgated in North America and Europe. And that
could have profound consequences for global ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Already, scientists say, the expanding human population is
causing a mass extinction of other species _ only the sixth time
such a widespread eradication of life has occurred in the planet's
history. And skyrocketing energy use appears to be loading the
atmosphere with carbon dioxide and other trace gases, causing
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of these problems _ and whether humanity can avert
catastrophe _ is a matter of some dispute, but there's little doubt
about one thing: For the first time, human population is shaping
the planet's basic dynamics rather than the other way around. In
some ways, current population trends are heartening _ or at least
not as distressing as they were even a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning programs begun in earnest 30 years ago have paid
impressive dividends. Worldwide, fertility has been more than
halved, down from around six children per woman in the 1950s to
2.06.
</P>
<P>
   In developed countries, the birthrate is even lower than the
global average. The fertility rate in the United States is 2.03.
And both Europe and Japan have rates of 1.4 _ meaning that they may
actually decline in population.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Sherman, director of communication for the population
office of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said birth
control accords reached during a 1994 international population
conference in Cairo are working.
</P>
<P>
   Birthrates have dropped, said Sherman, because women in
developing countries are obtaining the information and materials
they need to limit family size.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman recently returned from a visit to India _ a country that
is approaching 1 billion in population and that promises to
outstrip China as the world's most populous nation by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of our work is being done in Uttar Pradesh, a single
state in India that has a population of about 220 million, which is
close to that of the United States,'' said Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Uttar Pradesh is an extremely poor state characterized by a
rural, conservative culture. Yet people are determined to control
the size of their families, Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everyone we talked to wanted no more than two
children,'' she said. ``Reproduction is a politicized issue in
India, but (birth control) enjoys tremendous support at the village
level. The Cairo accords are working. There are very real
challenges ahead, but significant progress has been and continues
to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the average birthrate for most developing countries
hovers around 3.8, and many African nations post fertility rates of
6 to 7. That means human numbers are still spiraling upward.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the world's population continues to grow at close to
80 million annually because of ``population momentum.'' In other
words, the average woman is having fewer children, but there are
more and more women reaching child-bearing age each year.
</P>
<P>
   The future, in short, looks crowded.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has plotted three likely scenarios for global
population growth, with human numbers ranging from 7.3 billion to
10.7 billion by year 2050. Depending on a variety of factors,
population may or may not stabilize at these levels.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are discouraging in light of current resource
trends. Desertification and deforestation are accelerating in many
countries, local water shortages are expanding into regional crises
and about half of the world's fisheries have been overharvested.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that there are about 740 million acres of
high-quality agricultural land in the world, and about
three-quarters of that amount is already exploited.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the rest into production would require vast monetary
investments for infrastructure and market development, and would
also exact a high environmental price in the form of obliterated
wildlife habitat, soil erosion and water pollution. So there are
clear limits to expanding agricultural production to feed the
billions of new mouths that are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The global marketplace may be creating unprecedented prosperity,
but it is also raising troubling questions about the capacity of
the planet to support such wealth, some scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is that every villager in India and Pakistan now
has access to a television, perhaps even the Internet,'' said Paul
Ehrlich, a Stanford University biologist whose 1959 book, ``The
Population Bomb,'' is considered a seminal text on the modern
population dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, these folks are comparing themselves to Bill
Gates, not their parents or their neighbors,'' said Ehrlich.
``They're adopting the American model of consumerism. There are
twice as many people today as in 1960, but we're using five times
the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said the new consumer paradigm comes at an infelicitous
time, conjoined as it is with a huge, rapidly expanding population
and strained natural systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the scientific community is worried sick,'' he said.
``In some ways, we know how to solve the population problem _ we've
seen some progress there. But we don't know how to solve the
consumption problem. We're basically mining our natural capital _
soil, water, biodiversity _ for transitory economic gain.''
</P>
<P>
   A big, hard and thoroughly unpleasant crunch is inevitable, said
Ehrlich. ``I think a good case can be made that we're already at
the edges of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich has many allies in the scientific community, but he has
been making dire predictions on resource depletion, famine and
epidemics for three decades. So far, few of his prognostications
have come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   While other population experts are hesitant to couch their
concerns in terms as apocalyptic as Ehrlich's, they nevertheless
have serious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the risk of serious environmental problems is high
for the next century,'' said Robert Engelman, vice president of
research for Population Action International, an environmental
research and lobbying group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Engelman said many developing countries already face serious
food and water shortages. ``In terms of food, sometimes that's due
to production problems, sometimes to transport problems, but the
fact remains that many countries are incapable of feeding
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Engelman, there has always been poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In and of itself, poverty is not unique,'' he said. ``What is
unique to our time is a combination of a population that is at an
all-time high and growing, coupled with rising affluence. What is
unique is that we now have a global model based on the U.S. model,
one that says that the good life depends on consuming large
quantities of natural resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Meat is emblematic of this model.
</P>
<P>
   Meat consumption is going up worldwide, and that demands
correspondingly higher per capita production of grain. It takes
about 7 pounds of grain to yield 1 pound of beef. Poultry takes 2.7
pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of meat, while swine eat 6
pounds of grain for every pound of pork.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and Canada, each citizen consumes about a
ton of grain annually _ partly as bread or pastries, but mostly
indirectly, as meat. By contrast, developing countries have yearly
grain consumption rates of about 200 pounds per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Meat is esteemed as a luxury food _ indeed, a status symbol _ in
many developing countries, so demand for it  &LR; is acute and growing.
And with the desire for meat comes the demand for grain-based
livestock feed.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and 2030, grain consumption, primarily as animal
feed, is expected to grow by about 2.5 percent annually in the
developing countries. That may not seem like much, but a single
percentage point can represent millions of tons of wheat, corn,
sorghum and barley _ enough to feed millions of people if eaten
directly.
</P>
<P>
   And those millions of tons of grain represent, in turn, great
quantities of expended natural resources _ from water for
irrigation to the natural gas used to produce fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the environmental impact associated with both the
grain and the meat: rivers polluted with pesticides and nitrates,
exhausted aquifers, eroded soil. And ultimately, there is a wall
waiting to be hit: The quantity of arable land is all too finite.
</P>
<P>
   So should people in Chad, Bangladesh or Bolivia be denied the
chicken dinner they crave? Given the extravagant consumption in the
developed world, that hardly seems fair, population analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, Europe and Japan created the model, and it
isn't a sustainable one,'' Engelman said, ``so we have to be the
ones to apply pressure to change it. We need to look at the way we
live. Is the quality of life really directly correlated to the
amount of stuff we consume? Do we really need the biggest house on
the block and the three SUVs in the driveway? Even if we stabilize
population where it is now, it won't matter much unless we address
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all experts are irremediably gloomy about population growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we should adopt a Pollyanna attitude, but
doomsaying isn't appropriate either,'' said Robert N. Stavins, a
professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University who specializes in natural resource and environmental
economics.
</P>
<P>
   The world stands ``at the frontier of an enlightened policy to
turn things around, though I don't think we're there yet,'' Stavins
said. ``I don't suggest a laissez faire approach, but I think the
marketplace is sending signals that will ultimately improve the
environment and address natural resource issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Stavins said ``nonrenewable'' resources such as oil, coal and
metals are not a critical problem in the long run because the
marketplace will either find new ways to extract them profitably,
assuring steady supplies, or will discover substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, said Stavins, a more worrisome problem is
so-called renewable resources, such as fisheries and timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `tragedy of the commons','' he said. ``There are
generally no incentives to manage these resources, but there are
ample incentives for everyone to exploit them. So while they are
theoretically renewable, they are often exploited to the point of
collapse. And then environmental quality may not be adequate to
assure a recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also ways for the market to address the plundering
of renewable resources, said Stavins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put scarcity value taxes on fish landings, for
example,'' Stavins said. ``Or you can use a tradable permit system,
similar to what's being used to reduce acid rain. Say the
government wants to reduce the catch of a species 10 percent from
10,000 pounds a year. They issue permits for 9,000 pounds total,
and inefficient producers can sell their permits to more efficient
producers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, said Stavins, modern industrialization may
reduce rather than exacerbate pollution and resource waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrialization can cause problems short-term, but studies
have demonstrated that after a certain point, rich, industrialized
societies demand tougher and tougher controls on pollution,'' he
said. ``Globally, it's getting harder and harder to buy dirty
technologies. The incentives are shifting away from them. That's
why I'm not as pessimistic as some people.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one _ not even moderate optimists like Stavins _ is
predicting a future without rough spots. Six billion people create
a great deal of stress, both environmental and social.
</P>
<P>
   Things, in short, could go wrong. Quickly. All the estimates for
population growth, says Engelman, are assuming ``no surprises''
scenarios. Unexpected catastrophes could cause the population curve
to angle sharply downward.
</P>
<P>
   A few back-to-back poor harvests in the world's grain-producing
regions could trigger global famine. AIDS and Ebola could pale in
comparison to the next unknown virus waiting to emerge from an
African or Amazonian rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very real risks ahead, and disease is one of them,''
said Engelman. ``We also don't know what the future climate will
be. If big surprises are in store, all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Engelman, ``if we all work together, we can probably
dodge the bullet. And the real work is in the middle ground,
assuming neither the worst nor the best scenarios. We have to
address population growth and consumption simultaneously. Dealing
with only one or the other won't do it.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 10, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress is rediscovering the
health care crisis _ which did not go away with the 1994 collapse
of the Clinton administration's effort at a comprehensive overhaul.
What often got lost in the partisan maneuvering and millions of
dollars of lobbying is now unmistakably clear: There was an
objective reality out there. This was not just a political
exercise. President Clinton all but snapped an `I told you so' last
week. `What has happened is exactly what we said would happen,' he
said. By Robin Toner. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-SEX-REVIEW (Alexandria, Va.) _ After GOP presidential
aspirant Gary Bauer was criticized for holding private meetings
with a female aide, other politicians and their consultants called
the incident unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals
and at least potentially penalized female aides, particularly in
the wake of the Lewinsky scandal. Bauer and other politicians are
wondering how to preserve their reputations without putting female
aides at a disadvantage in terms of legitimate yet confidential
conferences. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SHOPPING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As electronic commerce
moves into the mainstream, it has prompted a new appreciation for
old-fashioned business skills. Customers, it seems, still have
decidedly offline standards of service. They demand timely delivery
of goods and the ability to easily return merchandise that proves
disappointing, for example. The online retailers who come up short
on those fronts will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin
during this Christmas shopping season. By Steve Lohr. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HOMERUNS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Home runs have become a dime a
dozen. Like 100-point swings in the stock market, they don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in an unparalleled flurry
of four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseam on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity. Yet somehow fans still delight in
each individual long ball as it happens. By Alan Schwarz. (also
moving in `s' category as BBO-HOMERUNS-REVIEW). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-WORRIES-REVIEW (New York) _ The region is in the midst
of outbreaks of E. coli bacteria and West Nile flu, and it is the
latter that most people are more concerned about. West Nile is
exotic to this area, and thus provokes fear and a sense that the
ecosystem is out of balance. E. coli is generally perceived to be
the result of human error _ undercooked meat or negligence with the
water supply _ and thus preventable. What is forgotten is that E.
Coli has killed far more people, including children. By Jennifer
Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-FOREIGN-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's aides
say his chances of achieving a place in history as a master of
foreign policy don't look so bad. Many goals are near fruition. Yet
Clinton was recently forced to retreat on perhaps the longest of
his long-vision goals: ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty.
It is being blocked by Republicans, who may be willing to pass it
only after Clinton leaves office. The incident speaks volumes about
the political atmosphere in which Clinton will have to operate if
he wants to accomplish great things and burnish his legacy in his
final 15 months as president. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-NAZIS-REVIEW (Vienna) _ A look at why fears of a revival
of Nazism in Austria are exaggerated. Austria is sometimes
criticized for failing to deal with its Nazi past, while Germany
has constantly apologized. Yet Austria doesn't have gangs attacking
Jewish cemeteries as Germany does. In Austria, non-Nazi
right-wingers and mainstream conservatives have both been offended
by cries that Jorg Haider is a neo-Nazi. By Donald G. McNeill.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-COMMUNISTS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ In a way, communism still
lives in the former Yugoslavia _ both in patterns of power and
habits of mind. This failure of political and social transformation
helps explain why efforts to overthrow President Slobodan Milosevic
are faltering. While `reform Communists' are back running Poland,
for example, they are a younger generation, humbled and educated by
periods out of power. But in most former Yugoslav republics, the
same leaders still rule as they did 10 years ago in the name of the
Communist Party. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ With the Colombian
government facing its most serious crisis in years, the Clinton
administration is scrambling to assemble a package of military and
economic assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the
hemisphere since the Cold War. But administration officials are
struggling to reassure anyone who will listen that Colombia today
looks nothing like El Salvador once did. By Tim Golden.

   &UR; MOMMY DRESSING: A Love Story, After a Fashion &LR;  By Lois Gould.
Anchor, $12.95. The daughter of a glamorous dress designer tells
how she grew up starved for affection but hypnotized by her
mother's elegance and solipsism. ``What is so extraordinary'' about
this memoir is that it ``makes us feel the helplessness, the awful
emotional ignorance and deprivation that made her mother who she
was, as a parent and as a woman,'' Margo Jefferson wrote in The New
York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MAN IN FULL &LR;  By Tom Wolfe. Bantam, $8.50. The twin tales of a
white Atlanta real estate mogul hurtling toward ruin and a black
football star accused of raping a white woman converge in a wild,
sprawling narrative crammed with the author's zestful reporting on
the ins and outs of the modern South. ``The novel contains passages
as powerful and as beautiful as anything written not merely by
contemporary American novelists but by any American novelist,''
Michael Lewis wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
``The book is as funny as anything Wolfe has ever written; at the
same time it is also deeply, strangely affecting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NIGHT CLUB ERA &LR;  By Stanley Walker. Johns Hopkins
University, $17.95. This popular history of New York during
Prohibition was written by the city editor of The New York Herald
Tribune when the Volstead Act was a fresh memory, and its pages are
jumping with bootleggers, celebrities, swindlers, speak-easy
owners, and assorted tough guys and politicians. ``It is vivid but
accurate, thoroughly informed, and it moves at a smart pace,''
Robert Van Gelder wrote in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; CITY EDITOR &LR;  ($17.95), an
insider's view of a big-city newsroom and 1930s newspaper
journalism. ``Walker's learned essays on freedom of the press,
libel, editing, the varieties of reporting experience and other
topics ... give the book body,'' C.G. Poore wrote in 1934. ``Style
and stories give it flavor and bouquet.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WALL &LR;  By John Marks. Riverhead, $14. In his first novel, an
American journalist follows a large cast of spies, expats and
traitors whose lives are complicated by the fall of the Berlin
wall. ``The story is captivating and reminds us that although each
side of the Cold War was guided by strategy ... it was still a time
of individual choices,'' Charles Norchi wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RESTRAINT OF BEASTS &LR;  By Magnus Mills. Scribner, $11. This
darkly humorous first novel revolves around three slacker fence
builders and drinking buddies in Scotland forced to deal with a
growing number of deadly work-related accidents. The result is ``a
witty, intricate fable about a working-class hell constructed by
its own inhabitants,'' Anthony Bourdain wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEARCH FOR THE GIANT SQUID &LR;  By Richard Ellis. Penguin,
$14.95. Zoology's last grand mystery is the giant squid, which
lives in the deep ocean and can grow to 60 feet. In fact, it has
rarely, if ever, been seen alive, and little is known of its
hunting and breeding habits. Ellis tells what we do know, and can
surmise, and his account ``will send a shiver down your spine, the
kind of shiver from which squid mania is born,'' Laura Miller wrote
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; IMAGINING ATLANTIS &LR;  (Vintage, $13), Ellis wades through
thousands of years of myth about the legendary lost continent and
the legions of quasi-historians and mystics who have weighed in.
After reviewing the geological and archaeological evidence, he
concludes that Plato made it all up. Last year the reviewer Robert
Eisner called this ``an entertaining, thorough yet readable
account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO LEASE ON LIFE &LR;  By Lynne Tillman. Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$12. This novel records a day in the life of a streetwise
proofreader whose revenge on the crazies and operators on her New
York City block pales in comparison with her violent fantasies.
``It dramatizes what the city that never sleeps can do to a tough,
smart, but no longer quite so resilient woman,'' David Gates wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ISAIAH BERLIN: A Life &LR;  By Michael Ignatieff. Owl/Holt, $16. In
this authorized biography, the celebrated liberal philosopher
Isaiah Berlin (1909-97) is portrayed as having lived a charmed life
in which the three strands of his existence _ Jewish, Russian and
British _ were richly interwoven. ``The result is a touching
portrait,'' Steven Marcus wrote last year. ``It gives us a rounded
view of an extraordinarily distinguished mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF I DON'T SIX &LR;  By Elwood Reid. Anchor, $12.95. The hero of
this first novel is a 275-pound offensive lineman from a
blue-collar family who's not sure he wants to get ground up in the
brutal and brutalizing machine of big-time college football. ``In
muscular prose, with appealing imagery ... `If I Don't Six' is by
turns funny, insightful, sad,'' Ira Berkow wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GIANT, O'BRIEN &LR;  By Hilary Mantel. Marian Wood/Owl/Holt,
$12. In 18th-century Britain, a huge Irish dreamer who hawks
himself as a sideshow curiosity crosses paths with a mad scientist
who has an insatiable appetite for dissection. Last year the
reviewer Walter Kendrick admired the novel's ``careful period
setting, its spare, elegant prose and its stretches of wistful
fantasy as the giant spins his tales.''

<P>
   Major league baseball teams have padded their considerable
coffers in recent years by linking corporate sponsors to almost
every play in the game, from the ``AT&AMP;T call to the bullpen'' to a
``National Arbitration and Mediation umpires lineup.'' (No kidding;
it's a dispute-resolution business.) If baseball wants a perfect
corporate match, however, it should call the folks over at Anbesol
and pitch a tie-in for home runs, because we're getting a little
numb to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Like 100-point swings in the stock market, home runs don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in a unparalleled flurry of
four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseum on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the homer-happy news media have fallen asleep to home runs'
metronomic regularity. Major leaguers slammed a record 5,528 home
runs this season, a 10 percent increase over last year's previous
high of 5,064, and barely anyone cared. ``Last year kind of
desensitized everybody,'' said Peter Schmuck, baseball columnist
for the Baltimore Sun. ``I guess nobody noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa captivated the
sports world with their 70 and 66 home runs, respectively, capping
modern players' long climb to grab the crowns of Roger Maris and
Babe Ruth. This season's reprise failed on two counts. With McGwire
hitting 65 and Sosa 63, they neither made a serious run at the new
record nor fell short enough to reaffirm how amazing last year
truly was. Instead, their unremarkable sequel only helped
underscore how current home run totals, like Canadian dollars, have
less value than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are a dime a dozen now. (Or, if you're McGwire, about
$2 million a dozen.) Even the hitters themselves have to
acknowledge it. Doug Glanville, the center fielder for the
Philadelphia Phillies, said: ``When I was growing up, if a guy hit
20, I was like, `Twenty! Wow, he's good!' Now, it's like,
`Whatever. No big deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 20 major leaguers hit at least 36 homers, a total that
a decade ago would have led the American League. The grand slam
once was the most delectable of home runs; now more than 100 of
them get hit every year, sating even the most voracious fan. This
season Robin Ventura of the New York Mets hit two in one
doubleheader. Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals hit two in
one  &UR; inning. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The paradox here is that while home runs as a whole mean less,
fans still delight in each individual long ball as it happens. (The
frenzy receives a steroid-like boost when rock music immediately
gets blared through the stadium speakers. ``Whoomp! There It Is!''
is Yankee Stadium's injection of choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Team owners have built smaller ball parks, shrunk the strike
zone _ yes, it's now smaller than a bread box _ and allowed
aggressive hitters to don suits of armor at the plate (arm pads,
shin guards and the like) to facilitate more and more home runs,
with each of these moves validated at the ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is clear: Americans love anything big, from big
biceps to big drives to big scores, and prefer brute force to
cunning. The home run is indefensible. The pitcher can only watch
the ball's persistent arc, and must stand in shame as the hitter
saunters around the bases. The triple remains baseball's most
exciting play, but excitement involves risk. It requires strategy.
Why go to all that trouble when you can simply beat the other
side's brains in?
</P>
<P>
   This predilection was embodied in New York City's feelings
toward how its Yankees and Mets reached the playoffs this year. The
Yankees essentially hit a home run, enjoying a cozy lead in their
division for the entire summer. The wild-card Mets, meanwhile,
staged an old-fashioned rally, drawing a walk, hitting a single,
getting another single, getting foolishly caught in a rundown, then
extricating themselves and finally scoring with a dust-flying slide
into home. Safe! Ask most New Yorkers and they'll probably say they
prefer the Yankees' commodious approach, when the Mets' journey was
far more thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is moving toward an all-or-nothing culture, to its
detriment. As home runs skyrocket, so do strikeouts. Fewer stolen
bases and hit-and-run gambits make for less strategy and
second-guessing, and before you know it the sport will dovetail
into a dressed-up homer-hitting contest. That's essentially what
fans got in the final weekend of this season _ Fox TV disguised the
McGwire-Sosa longball showdown as the ``Game of the Week,'' even
though the players' teams were a combined 50 games out of first
place while the Mets, Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds were
locked in a marvelous pennant race. The Cubs' manager, Jim
Riggleman, put it best: ``I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no more embarrassed than the modern player who doesn't
hit home runs. A Nike commercial this year featured Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, two of the decade's most
successful pitchers, taking extra batting practice because, they
claimed, ``Chicks dig the long ball.'' For how long is the
question. All home runs, even McGwire's, fall to earth eventually.

high of 5,064, and barely anyone cared. ``Last year kind of
desensitized everybody,'' said Peter Schmuck, baseball columnist
for the Baltimore Sun. ``I guess nobody noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa captivated the
sports world with their 70 and 66 home runs, respectively, capping
modern players' long climb to grab the crowns of Roger Maris and
Babe Ruth. This season's reprise failed on two counts. With McGwire
hitting 65 and Sosa 63, they neither made a serious run at the new
record nor fell short enough to reaffirm how amazing last year
truly was. Instead, their unremarkable sequel only helped
underscore how current home run totals, like Canadian dollars, have
less value than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are a dime a dozen now. (Or, if you're McGwire, about
$2 million a dozen.) Even the hitters themselves have to
acknowledge it. Doug Glanville, the center fielder for the
Philadelphia Phillies, said: ``When I was growing up, if a guy hit
20, I was like, `Twenty! Wow, he's good!' Now, it's like,
`Whatever. No big deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 20 major leaguers hit at least 36 homers, a total that
a decade ago would have led the American League. The grand slam
once was the most delectable of home runs; now more than 100 of
them get hit every year, sating even the most voracious fan. This
season Robin Ventura of the New York Mets hit two in one
doubleheader. Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals hit two in
one  &UR; inning. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The paradox here is that while home runs as a whole mean less,
fans still delight in each individual long ball as it happens. (The
frenzy receives a steroid-like boost when rock music immediately
gets blared through the stadium speakers. ``Whoomp! There It Is!''
is Yankee Stadium's injection of choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Team owners have built smaller ball parks, shrunk the strike
zone _ yes, it's now smaller than a bread box _ and allowed
aggressive hitters to don suits of armor at the plate (arm pads,
shin guards and the like) to facilitate more and more home runs,
with each of these moves validated at the ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is clear: Americans love anything big, from big
biceps to big drives to big scores, and prefer brute force to
cunning. The home run is indefensible. The pitcher can only watch
the ball's persistent arc, and must stand in shame as the hitter
saunters around the bases. The triple remains baseball's most
exciting play, but excitement involves risk. It requires strategy.
Why go to all that trouble when you can simply beat the other
side's brains in?
</P>
<P>
   This predilection was embodied in New York City's feelings
toward how its Yankees and Mets reached the playoffs this year. The
Yankees essentially hit a home run, enjoying a cozy lead in their
division for the entire summer. The wild-card Mets, meanwhile,
staged an old-fashioned rally, drawing a walk, hitting a single,
getting another single, getting foolishly caught in a rundown, then
extricating themselves and finally scoring with a dust-flying slide
into home. Safe! Ask most New Yorkers and they'll probably say they
prefer the Yankees' commodious approach, when the Mets' journey was
far more thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is moving toward an all-or-nothing culture, to its
detriment. As home runs skyrocket, so do strikeouts. Fewer stolen
bases and hit-and-run gambits make for less strategy and
second-guessing, and before you know it the sport will dovetail
into a dressed-up homer-hitting contest. That's essentially what
fans got in the final weekend of this season _ Fox TV disguised the
McGwire-Sosa longball showdown as the ``Game of the Week,'' even
though the players' teams were a combined 50 games out of first
place while the Mets, Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds were
locked in a marvelous pennant race. The Cubs' manager, Jim
Riggleman, put it best: ``I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no more embarrassed than the modern player who doesn't
hit home runs. A Nike commercial this year featured Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, two of the decade's most
successful pitchers, taking extra batting practice because, they
claimed, ``Chicks dig the long ball.'' For how long is the
question. All home runs, even McGwire's, fall to earth eventually.

IT'S INFECTIOUS: FEAR THAT'S OUT OF PROPORTION

   NEW YORK _ As public health threats go, they could not have been
more different. The West Nile-like encephalitis virus, which broke
out in New York City in August, travels by mosquitoes that feed on
infected birds and then bite humans. It tends to sicken elderly
people the worst. The E. coli epidemic, which happened
simultaneously in upstate New York, was food-borne. E. coli strikes
the elderly too, but more often makes children the most ill. One
disease, never before been seen in the Western Hemisphere, is in
fact generally quite benign. The other is somewhat common, with the
potential to greatly sicken many people under the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ask around pediatricians' offices and the New York City
Department of Health, and what do people fear the most? Hands down,
West Nile. In recent weeks, the region seemed close to hysteria
over the virus: Phones lit up in record numbers at the health
department, parents in areas where there was not a single case kept
their children indoors, TV reporters talked in stern tones about
the plague among us. The E. coli outbreak, one of the worst the
nation has ever seen, got scant media coverage and provoked little
public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, this seems understandable. West Nile is exotic to
the New York region, and therefore stirs fear of the unknown. E.
coli is generally perceived to be the result of human error or
oversight _ undercooked meat or negligence with the water supply _
and thus preventable. Perhaps more important, the E. coli outbreak
occurred upstate, off the radar screen of city media, in a rural
area that may be perceived to have lower public health standards
than the city. (Untreated well water at a county fair was tainted
with cow manure from a nearby farm.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the West Nile virus is the lesser peril, especially to
children, the focus of so much parental worry lately. It generally
produces very mild symptoms, especially in healthy, younger people.
Six older people have died _ the youngest was in her 60s _ but more
typical are the dozens of people suspected of having contracted
mild to semi-serious cases of the illness, including one child. In
contrast, infection with E. coli bacteria can escalate quickly from
diarrhea to dementia to death, and the outbreak upstate sickened
hundreds and sent 10 children to the hospital, killing one. At
least eight were on kidney dialysis early on, fighting for their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The two outbreaks affirm that what arouses fear and loathing in
the disease world often defies epidemiological logic. In fact,
hair-raising though little-publicized epidemics happen all the
time, hurting far more people, including children, than the West
Nile virus has. Last week, officials in upstate Chautauqua County
announced a whooping cough epidemic, with over 250 confirmed cases.
Unlike West Nile, that disease does not depend on mosquitoes to
carry it south to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But herald an illness that has never before passed American
shores and watch the panic ensue. ``We know from past experiences
that people get frightened by things that are new and different,''
said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the acting deputy director for science
and public health at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Ebola, bird virus, hantavirus _ all have
caused great fear in recent years. But worldwide what kills more
people, especially children, than all of these? Respiratory
illnesses, Ostroff said. ``You don't hear anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health policy often unwittingly accompanies panic. For
instance, New York will almost certainly devote huge efforts to
mosquito control next year (critics say they're long overdue) even
as vaccination programs for seemingly outdated diseases are
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know why there is a single case of whooping cough
in New York state,'' said Dr. Charles Calisher, a professor of
microbiology at Colorado State University. ``That means to me that
that vaccine hasn't been given to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that if someone comes into New York with West Nile
fever, they are a huge danger to the rest of the population,''
Calisher added. ``But the same thing is true about whooping cough
upstate. That illness is a threat to New York City unless vaccine
coverage is 100 percent, which it never is.''
</P>
<P>
   Government and the media often unwittingly conspire to keep the
focus on certain illnesses. While New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
took pains to present West Nile as largely benign, he and the
health department also held frequent, urgent press conferences on
the matter. One such event was called hastily at 6 p.m. on a
Friday. The agenda? To announce a few new confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough,'' admitted Maria Mitchell, a former city health
commissioner who is now president of AMDEC, a biomedical research
consortium. ``You have to have an appropriate level of concern
without creating panic and hysteria. AIDS was a perfect example.
There were all sorts of worries about forms of transmission that
simply didn't exist. We worked hard on that. But now, in some
populations, there isn't enough fear again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes government officials find themselves in the
uncomfortable position of having to play epidemiologists, a hat
they do not wear as well as, say, that of politicians. Members of
the media often do the public a disservice with errors in reporting
about who is most vulnerable, how the illness manifests itself, and
even how many cases are reported. At one point, television
newscasters insisted that there were two totally different
outbreaks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile has also caused fear because its carrier, mosquitoes,
can be found anywhere, causing people to fear that they can get
sick just walking out the door. ``But if you look at nine people
dying compared to the amount of mosquito bites we have all
gotten,'' said Ms. Mitchell, ``it doesn't seem like the plague.''

   When Amazon.com declared two weeks ago that it was beginning a
bold campaign to become an Internet shopping bazaar, Wall Street
applauded. And why not? Amazon, a corporate poster child of the New
Economy and pioneer of online retailing, would be collecting money
from any business, large or small, that wanted to set up shop under
its cyber-tent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Amazon really needs the cash. Its losses are mounting,
as they are for most Internet merchants. But, Amazon explains, the
red ink merely underlines the scale of its ambitious investment for
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   And what is Amazon spending so lavishly on these days? Building
a high-tech bunker of supercomputers or hiring battalions of
software wizards? No, Amazon is spending much of its money on a
half-dozen huge warehouses across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The New Economy is increasingly coming face-to-face with the
old: Net code hackers and money hustlers meet the members of
Bricklayers Local 247. The hot, new fields of the Internet economy
suddenly include distribution and logistics, the humdrum backstage
of business. Indeed, as electronic commerce moves into the
mainstream _ an estimated 17 million American households will
purchase online this year _ it has prompted a new appreciation for
the business skills of the old bricks-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, it seems, still have decidedly offline standards of
service. They demand timely delivery of goods and the ability to
easily return merchandise that proves disappointing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The online retailers who come up short on those fronts, industry
analysts predict, will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin
during this year's Christmas shopping season as winners are sorted
from losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the dot-com retailers are going to fold after their
venture capital money runs out,'' observed David Pecaut, a senior
vice president of the Boston Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the biggest winners in online retailing could well be
today's department stores, discount chains and specialty stores. In
fact, 62 percent of e-commerce sales are accounted for by
bricks-and-mortar and catalog companies that also have begun online
ventures. Within five years, Pecaut expects that share to rise to
85 percent as companies like Wal-Mart, Nordstrom and Sears improve
their performance on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he says, is that their assets from the ``legacy
world'' _ well-known brands, distribution networks, stores and
purchasing power _ will prove to be advantages, and increasingly so
in electronic commerce. The leading online brands like Amazon and
Ebay, for example, came onto the marketplace a few years ago as
innovative newcomers, when cyberspace was far less crowded and
Internet brand-building was far less costly. The chance of an
Internet start-up gaining that kind of brand recognition today,
Pecaut says, is slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``For marketers, the superior economics in the future are going
to come from the old standards of business _ and not just being
online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new catch phrases of modern retailing have embraced that
notion: multi-channel retailers, integrated shopping and 360-degree
marketing. All are meant to convey the concept of servicing _ or
assaulting _ the consumer on many fronts, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies are even using their high-priced shares
as currency to buy bricks-and-mortar counterparts. For example, the
online auctioneer Ebay purchased Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a San
Francisco-based auction house founded in 1865, for $260 million in
stock earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics for online retail sales, and projections of
future revenue, show meteoric growth. Yet a closer look at the
numbers suggests how much traditional retailing retains its hold,
despite the rapid, up-from-zero growth of e-commerce. Online sales
in the United States will rise sharply this year to $20 billion and
jump to $185 billion by 2004, according to Forrester Research Inc.,
a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. Still, the $185
billion figure, even if it proves accurate, would represent only 7
percent of the nation's retail sales in 2004, the firm maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has clearly created not only new wealth
but a new sense of economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the new Internet economy is its ferocious
speed, the faith that this is a big deal and the uncertainty that
it will pay off,'' said Thomas Eisenmann, an e-commerce expert at
the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from Internet technology will almost surely
come first in an area that gets the least attention: its use as a
low-cost communications technology to automate all kinds of
business transactions. ``The Amazons of the world get all the
press, but the real growth in electronic commerce in the next five
years is going to be in the business-to-business market,'' said
Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that growth will be companies using the Web instead of
faxes, telephones and face-to-face meetings to handle the ``back
office'' tasks involved in trading with their corporate customers
and suppliers. Forrester Research projects that the
business-to-business market could reach $1.5 trillion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Internet-assisted overhaul of dealings among
businesses in the next few years represents an evolutionary instead
of a revolutionary step. Much of the anticipated transformation
amounts to doing the same chores more efficiently because of new
technology _ as was true with the telephone and, before that, the
telegraph, which has been called ``The Victorian Internet,'' in a
book published last year (Walker &AMP; Co.) by Tom Standage.
</P>
<P>
   And if the past is any guide, the surest corporate winners in
the e-commerce business may be the suppliers of basic tools and
services for the Internet: computers, software and technical
know-how. That, at least, seemed to be the lesson of the last great
gold rush in California. It was the general stores and saloons, not
the miners, that pocketed the steady money.

assaulting _ the consumer on many fronts, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies are even using their high-priced shares
as currency to buy bricks-and-mortar counterparts. For example, the
online auctioneer Ebay purchased Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a San
Francisco-based auction house founded in 1865, for $260 million in
stock earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics for online retail sales, and projections of
future revenue, show meteoric growth. Yet a closer look at the
numbers suggests how much traditional retailing retains its hold,
despite the rapid, up-from-zero growth of e-commerce. Online sales
in the United States will rise sharply this year to $20 billion and
jump to $185 billion by 2004, according to Forrester Research Inc.,
a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. Still, the $185
billion figure, even if it proves accurate, would represent only 7
percent of the nation's retail sales in 2004, the firm maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has clearly created not only new wealth
but a new sense of economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the new Internet economy is its ferocious
speed, the faith that this is a big deal and the uncertainty that
it will pay off,'' said Thomas Eisenmann, an e-commerce expert at
the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from Internet technology will almost surely
come first in an area that gets the least attention: its use as a
low-cost communications technology to automate all kinds of
business transactions. ``The Amazons of the world get all the
press, but the real growth in electronic commerce in the next five
years is going to be in the business-to-business market,'' said
Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that growth will be companies using the Web instead of
faxes, telephones and face-to-face meetings to handle the ``back
office'' tasks involved in trading with their corporate customers
and suppliers. Forrester Research projects that the
business-to-business market could reach $1.5 trillion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Internet-assisted overhaul of dealings among
businesses in the next few years represents an evolutionary instead
of a revolutionary step. Much of the anticipated transformation
amounts to doing the same chores more efficiently because of new
technology _ as was true with the telephone and, before that, the
telegraph, which has been called ``The Victorian Internet,'' in a
book published last year (Walker &AMP; Co.) by Tom Standage.
</P>
<P>
   And if the past is any guide, the surest corporate winners in
the e-commerce business may be the suppliers of basic tools and
services for the Internet: computers, software and technical
know-how. That, at least, seemed to be the lesson of the last great
gold rush in California. It was the general stores and saloons, not
the miners, that pocketed the steady money.

   WASHINGTON _ The signs are unmistakable: Washington is
rediscovering the health care crisis. It did not, after all, go
away with the failure of the Clinton administration's attempt at
universal coverage in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   New Census data show the number of uninsured Americans is
climbing, in the face of an extraordinary economic boom. The cost
of health insurance, after a few years of stability, is rising as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives spent last week in angry, anguished
debate over the state of the nation's health care, then passed a
sweeping new bill to rein in the managed care industry and protect
patients' rights. And out on the presidential campaign trail,
candidates are beginning to offer their solutions _ with much
political forethought _ to the increasingly apparent problems of
access, cost and coverage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton all but snapped an ``I told you so'' when
confronted with the Census numbers last week. ``We told you in 1994
that if this were voted down, the insurance companies would
continue to drop people, or employers would, because of the system
we had,'' he said, clearly stung by the notion that 44.3 million
uninsured Americans would be part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The new politics of health care is, not surprisingly, framed by
the failure of the Clinton plan. Even as the uninsured return to
the political agenda, nobody is out campaigning for a plan on the
scale of Clinton's _ or, for that matter, for anything like what
was routinely discussed by several Democratic presidential
candidates in 1992 with what now seems breathtaking naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Even as some experts bemoan the shortcomings of piecemeal,
incremental steps to expand health care coverage, much of the
political class seems committed to the approach; witness the
package of tax breaks intended to encourage coverage that
Republicans in the House passed with much fanfare last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the past seven years have in some ways profoundly changed
the lay of the land: Managed care is no longer a theory but a
reality for most Americans. The Clinton administration did not
restructure the health care system, but the private sector did. As
Bob Blendon, a Harvard expert on public opinion and health, put it,
it was a ``top-down'' revolution that people never got to vote on.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the backlash: The most popular enemy on Capitol Hill last
week was not the bureaucrats in ``big government,'' as it was
during the struggle over Clinton's 1,342-page health plan, but the
bureaucrats in health maintenance organizations and other forms of
managed care. Government regulation, in fact, was presented as a
necessary check on out-of-control HMOs; Rep. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., a dentist and conservative who was elected to Congress in
1994 as a fierce opponent of the Clinton plan, was now standing
shoulder to shoulder with the Democrats and Clinton, leading the
charge against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press, said this concern about the power of HMOs has made
health care more of an issue for middle-class working people with
coverage. The percentage of people polled by the Pew Center who say
``reforming health care'' should be a top priority rose from 56
percent in January 1997 to 69 percent in January 1999. A
particularly big jump occurred among men aged 30 to 49, Kohut said.
This helps explain why a Republican-controlled House, much of whose
leadership is deeply uncomfortable with government regulation,
passed the managed care reform bill by such a lopsided vote last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care backlash is only one piece of the health care
puzzle, although perhaps the easiest piece politically. To many
health care planners and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the primary
concern is the steady rise in the uninsured, many of whom are low-
and moderate-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry what will happen when there's a recession,'' said Dr.
Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at Georgetown University and a
former top health adviser to the Clinton administration. ``If
low-wage workers are in trouble in good times, where will they be
in bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says voters raise similar
concerns in focus groups, something she calls the Jack Nicholson
effect: ``What if this is as good as it gets?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians have only recently begun to venture near the
issue again; there are no easy fixes for the uninsured, big
solutions carry big price tags and the cost, complexity and
political ham-handedness of the Clinton plan are painful, lingering
memories.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley are leading the way; concern about the uninsured tends
to be higher among Democratic primary voters, according to Ms.
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Steelman, who is advising Texas Gov. George W. Bush on
health care, said the issue is ``really on his radar screen,''
particularly the plight of low-income workers who lack insurance,
but she also indicated that his health care proposal was not
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while concern may be rising, even many voters who worry
about the uninsured are wary of big solutions, some analysts say.
``I just don't think there's a mood out there for some big
government program that involves big intervention,'' Blendon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan, which won praise for its boldness because it set
a goal of universal ``access'' to health insurance, was a careful
political document that avoided the new governmental structures and
mandates of the Clinton plan. (Even so, its estimated $65 billion a
year cost may eventually prove a tempting target.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the constituency for ``health care reform'' is divided
and complicated, several experts said. Some voters are insured but
angry at their HMOs. Some voters are motivated by the plight of the
uninsured, and others are mostly concerned about Medicare and
coverage for prescription drugs. ``I just don't think this health
care issue is a cohesive issue the way it was in 1992,'' said
Blendon.

</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what some experts see as the most worrisome trend in
health care _ rising costs _ is the most difficult to discuss
politically. Managed care leaders have tried hard to make the case
that putting new mandates on the industry _ particularly opening it
up to lawsuits _ would raise costs that would ultimately be passed
on to employers and consumers. And industry officials seem stunned
at times at how little credit they get for making care more
efficient and, at least for a while, for controlling costs.
</P>
<P>
   But cost-control in health care is a risky business: the
cost-containment provisions in the Clinton plan led to fears of
rationing. And the gatekeepers and referral requirements of managed
care led to one horrific anecdote after another on the floor of the
House last week about dying children and heedless bureaucrats on
the other end of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry that the managed care revolution has already
squeezed out the easy savings. ``I've thought for many years that
there was an underlying upward trend in medical spending because of
the increase in new capabilities in medicine, which we're now
seeing fairly dramatically in pharmaceuticals,'' said Joseph
Newhouse, a professor of health policy and management at Harvard.
He suggested that after ``some one-time gains from the managed care
revolution'' that upward trend may be reasserting itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rising health care costs, of course, can have a direct effect on
the number of uninsured. And higher costs can raise profound
questions of equity; for example, Congress is currently struggling
with the fairness of a Medicare program that lacks prescription
drug coverage, just when the pharmaceutical revolution offers
immense promise for many of the ills of old age.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, interlocking nature of these issues pushed the
Clinton administration _ and many other health planners, for that
matter _ to go for a grand, comprehensive plan. Working on these
problems with incremental measures, step by step, is harder, some
health planners say, but is probably all the political system can
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA, a consumer group, and the Health Insurance
Association of America plan to convene a conference of past
combatants to try to seek common ground on the uninsured. Ms.
Steelman, a lobbyist and longtime Republican adviser, said of the
larger struggle: ``This isn't about one big-bang theory. This is
about trying to balance costs and needs and rights. It's the
crucible of U.S. politics. It's where it all comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the uninsured take heart from the fact that, at
the very least, the eerie political silence around 44.3 million
Americans is breaking.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Latin American country slides toward chaos.
Leftist guerrillas attack the government, right-wing death squads
attack guerrilla sympathizers, peace talks falter. The economy
spirals downward, scattering thousands of refugees, and fears of
instability sweep through the region. The United States hurries to
the rescue with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
   With the Colombian government facing its most serious crisis in
years, Clinton administration officials confirmed last week that
they are putting together a package of military and economic
assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the hemisphere
since the Cold War. They are also trying to reassure anyone who
will listen that Colombia today really looks nothing like El
Salvador did some two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will not be giving Colombia lots of
sophisticated weapons and aircraft, the officials say, nor will
legions of Colombian soldiers be training at Fort Bragg. U.S.
military advisers in Colombia are to help troops there fight the
drug trade rather than insurgents, except where the insurgents
protect the trade. ``There are, in my view, few if any really
logical, easy comparisons to make between El Salvador 10 years ago
and Colombia now,'' said the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, Thomas Pickering, who once presided over the military
build-up in El Salvador as the U.S. ambassador there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many in the administration and many more
outside it who see quicksand in Colombia. The government that
Washington is supporting in Bogota is weak and increasingly
unpopular. The army it trains has been ineffective on the
battlefield and frequently complicit in the massacres of civilians
by rightist paramilitary groups. The rebel armies it hopes to bend
have held out in the jungles for decades. The administration is
also on unsteady ground at home: For domestic political reasons, it
has proclaimed a central goal in Colombia _ curtailing the drug
trade _ that will likely mislead Americans about what it hopes to
achieve there.
</P>
<P>
   What has panicked both the Clinton administration and
congressional Republicans is not so much the latest turn in
Colombia's cocaine problem as the growing troubles of its new
president, Andres Pastrana. Little more than a year after Pastrana
came to power with bold concessions intended to bring the biggest
rebel army to the negotiating table, the talks are stalled in the
earliest stages, the guerrillas appear stronger and more
recalcitrant and the president is widely criticized as naive.
Unrest within the armed forces has surged and paramilitary killings
have continued. Colombia's long-buoyant economy, having made it
through the regional debt crisis of the 1980s relatively unscathed,
is suffering its most severe recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States sinks deeper into Colombia's troubles
or helps to solve them may ultimately depend a good deal on how it
defines its objectives there. Over the last three months, officials
have gone to unusual lengths to reconsider those aims: Working
groups have been set up, strategy papers have been prepared and
assistant secretaries of all sorts have shuttled back and forth to
Bogota. Yet even as that review got under way, senior officials
seemed to limit its parameters: The center of U.S. policy, they
insisted _ ``the spear point,'' as Pickering put it _ will remain
the illicit drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's drug problem has taken a significant turn for the
worse. Over the last several years, as the authorities in Bolivia
and Peru have made headway in intercepting drug planes and helping
poor farmers supplant crops of coca, the raw material of cocaine,
drug producers have sharply expanded their fields in remote,
sparsely populated areas of southern Colombia. That shift has
strengthened both the Colombian producers and their guerrilla
allies, who profit by taxing the coca fields and hiring out to
guard jungle air strips and drug-processing labs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the drug ``emergency'' that some senior United
States officials have begun to describe does not necessarily
threaten new waves of cocaine washing onto American streets. It is
not clear how or even whether the shifting of coca crops around the
region will affect the availability or price of cocaine abroad.
Nor, despite technological advances in tracking drug shipments
through the Caribbean, can the administration promise that
better-funded interdiction efforts will seriously reduce the flows
of cocaine and heroin into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to several officials, most of the aid proposals being
circulated internally would give relatively short shrift to such
basic (and comparatively inexpensive) solutions as the training of
Colombia's judges and the strengthening of its notoriously porous
prisons. Instead, U.S. ``counternarcotics'' aid will aim to help
the security forces beat back the guerrillas in southern Colombia
so that crop-spraying and lab raids can proceed. As illogical as
the assurance increasingly sounds, administration officials
continue to insist that the United States will stay out of the
civil war.

   WASHINGTON _ A Latin American country slides toward chaos.
Leftist guerrillas attack the government, right-wing death squads
attack guerrilla sympathizers, peace talks falter. The economy
spirals downward, scattering thousands of refugees, and fears of
instability sweep through the region. The United States hurries to
the rescue with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
   With the Colombian government facing its most serious crisis in
years, Clinton administration officials confirmed last week that
they are putting together a package of military and economic
assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the hemisphere
since the Cold War. They are also trying to reassure anyone who
will listen that Colombia today really looks nothing like El
Salvador did some two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will not be giving Colombia lots of
sophisticated weapons and aircraft, the officials say, nor will
legions of Colombian soldiers be training at Fort Bragg. U.S.
military advisers in Colombia are to help troops there fight the
drug trade rather than insurgents, except where the insurgents
protect the trade. ``There are, in my view, few if any really
logical, easy comparisons to make between El Salvador 10 years ago
and Colombia now,'' said the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, Thomas Pickering, who once presided over the military
build-up in El Salvador as the U.S. ambassador there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many in the administration and many more
outside it who see quicksand in Colombia. The government that
Washington is supporting in Bogota is weak and increasingly
unpopular. The army it trains has been ineffective on the
battlefield and frequently complicit in the massacres of civilians
by rightist paramilitary groups. The rebel armies it hopes to bend
have held out in the jungles for decades. The administration is
also on unsteady ground at home: For domestic political reasons, it
has proclaimed a central goal in Colombia _ curtailing the drug
trade _ that will likely mislead Americans about what it hopes to
achieve there.
</P>
<P>
   What has panicked both the Clinton administration and
congressional Republicans is not so much the latest turn in
Colombia's cocaine problem as the growing troubles of its new
president, Andres Pastrana. Little more than a year after Pastrana
came to power with bold concessions intended to bring the biggest
rebel army to the negotiating table, the talks are stalled in the
earliest stages, the guerrillas appear stronger and more
recalcitrant and the president is widely criticized as naive.
Unrest within the armed forces has surged and paramilitary killings
have continued. Colombia's long-buoyant economy, having made it
through the regional debt crisis of the 1980s relatively unscathed,
is suffering its most severe recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States sinks deeper into Colombia's troubles
or helps to solve them may ultimately depend a good deal on how it
defines its objectives there. Over the last three months, officials
have gone to unusual lengths to reconsider those aims: Working
groups have been set up, strategy papers have been prepared and
assistant secretaries of all sorts have shuttled back and forth to
Bogota. Yet even as that review got under way, senior officials
seemed to limit its parameters: The center of U.S. policy, they
insisted _ ``the spear point,'' as Pickering put it _ will remain
the illicit drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's drug problem has taken a significant turn for the
worse. Over the last several years, as the authorities in Bolivia
and Peru have made headway in intercepting drug planes and helping
poor farmers supplant crops of coca, the raw material of cocaine,
drug producers have sharply expanded their fields in remote,
sparsely populated areas of southern Colombia. That shift has
strengthened both the Colombian producers and their guerrilla
allies, who profit by taxing the coca fields and hiring out to
guard jungle air strips and drug-processing labs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the drug ``emergency'' that some senior United
States officials have begun to describe does not necessarily
threaten new waves of cocaine washing onto American streets. It is
not clear how or even whether the shifting of coca crops around the
region will affect the availability or price of cocaine abroad.
Nor, despite technological advances in tracking drug shipments
through the Caribbean, can the administration promise that
better-funded interdiction efforts will seriously reduce the flows
of cocaine and heroin into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to several officials, most of the aid proposals being
circulated internally would give relatively short shrift to such
basic (and comparatively inexpensive) solutions as the training of
Colombia's judges and the strengthening of its notoriously porous
prisons. Instead, U.S. ``counternarcotics'' aid will aim to help
the security forces beat back the guerrillas in southern Colombia
so that crop-spraying and lab raids can proceed. As illogical as
the assurance increasingly sounds, administration officials
continue to insist that the United States will stay out of the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In private, at least, such officials are more candid about
acknowledging that a decade after the Cold War's end, the drug
fight is the only policy objective likely to win political support
for the $1 billion to $2 billion in aid that they have talked of
putting forward over the next three years. (Even then, a Colombia
package will have to compete in the weeks ahead with foreign-aid
proposals ranging from help for peacekeeping in Africa to support
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly disputed that the United States has other
significant interests in Colombia, from oil fields to radar
stations to the stability of a democratic ally. In recent months,
State Department and National Security Council officials, in
particular, have pressed for what they call a more ``integrated''
approach _ one that might include trade benefits, development aid
and human rights programs as well as military support.
</P>
<P>
   But as Colombia's military leaders showed their wish lists
around Washington last week, it appeared that some central issues
remained unresolved: how the beleaguered military might best be
strengthened, how the guerrillas might be drawn into serious talks,
and how those two goals interlock.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 20 letter to Pastrana, President Clinton suggested a
new point of departure for U.S. policy, saying, ``The hardest step
may be the first: convincing all sides in Colombia that a military
solution is not possible and that all will gain from a negotiated
settlement.'' But neither Clinton nor his senior aides have
explained clearly how this might be achieved. Administration
officials have begun trying to recruit other Latin American
countries and United Nations mediators to bring pressure on both
sides. In the meantime, the search for a comprehensive strategy in
Colombia continues to resemble a free-for-all in which different
factions of the administration have put forward different aid
proposals _ many of them with different implications for how to
wage peace.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials, including the commander of U.S. military
forces in Latin America, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, argue that only
significant reverses on the battlefield will bring the rebels to
the bargaining table. But at the pace at which the United States is
now training and re-equipping the Colombian military, officials say
it could take years to start changing the military balance. Critics
of the policy also ask what might happen if Colombia's generals
gain unexpected ground against the guerrillas _ and decide to
continue fighting in order to press for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the thinking has not gone much beyond, `Let's get some
helicopters in there,''' said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at
the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from Washington, the greatest difference between Colombia
in 1999 and El Salvador in 1979 may be that virtually no one in the
White House now believes Colombia's government is in any immediate
danger of falling to the rebels. That consensus may make it harder
for officials to argue for a huge ``emergency'' infusion of
American aid. It could, however, be the basis for an approach to
Colombia's problems that might be sustained even when the flow of
illicit drugs fails to miraculously end.

<P>
   Major league baseball teams have padded their considerable
coffers in recent years by linking corporate sponsors to almost
every play in the game, from the ``AT&AMP;T call to the bullpen'' to a
``National Arbitration and Mediation umpires lineup.'' (No kidding;
it's a dispute-resolution business.) If baseball wants a perfect
corporate match, however, it should call the folks over at Anbesol
and pitch a tie-in for home runs, because we're getting a little
numb to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Like 100-point swings in the stock market, home runs don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in a unparalleled flurry of
four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseum on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the homer-happy news media have fallen asleep to home runs'
metronomic regularity. Major leaguers slammed a record 5,528 home
runs this season, a 10 percent increase over last year's previous
high of 5,064, and barely anyone cared. ``Last year kind of
desensitized everybody,'' said Peter Schmuck, baseball columnist
for the Baltimore Sun. ``I guess nobody noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa captivated the
sports world with their 70 and 66 home runs, respectively, capping
modern players' long climb to grab the crowns of Roger Maris and
Babe Ruth. This season's reprise failed on two counts. With McGwire
hitting 65 and Sosa 63, they neither made a serious run at the new
record nor fell short enough to reaffirm how amazing last year
truly was. Instead, their unremarkable sequel only helped
underscore how current home run totals, like Canadian dollars, have
less value than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are a dime a dozen now. (Or, if you're McGwire, about
$2 million a dozen.) Even the hitters themselves have to
acknowledge it. Doug Glanville, the center fielder for the
Philadelphia Phillies, said: ``When I was growing up, if a guy hit
20, I was like, `Twenty! Wow, he's good!' Now, it's like,
`Whatever. No big deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 20 major leaguers hit at least 36 homers, a total that
a decade ago would have led the American League. The grand slam
once was the most delectable of home runs; now more than 100 of
them get hit every year, sating even the most voracious fan. This
season Robin Ventura of the New York Mets hit two in one
doubleheader. Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals hit two in
one  &UR; inning. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The paradox here is that while home runs as a whole mean less,
fans still delight in each individual long ball as it happens. (The
frenzy receives a steroid-like boost when rock music immediately
gets blared through the stadium speakers. ``Whoomp! There It Is!''
is Yankee Stadium's injection of choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Team owners have built smaller ball parks, shrunk the strike
zone _ yes, it's now smaller than a bread box _ and allowed
aggressive hitters to don suits of armor at the plate (arm pads,
shin guards and the like) to facilitate more and more home runs,
with each of these moves validated at the ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is clear: Americans love anything big, from big
biceps to big drives to big scores, and prefer brute force to
cunning. The home run is indefensible. The pitcher can only watch
the ball's persistent arc, and must stand in shame as the hitter
saunters around the bases. The triple remains baseball's most
exciting play, but excitement involves risk. It requires strategy.
Why go to all that trouble when you can simply beat the other
side's brains in?
</P>
<P>
   This predilection was embodied in New York City's feelings
toward how its Yankees and Mets reached the playoffs this year. The
Yankees essentially hit a home run, enjoying a cozy lead in their
division for the entire summer. The wild-card Mets, meanwhile,
staged an old-fashioned rally, drawing a walk, hitting a single,
getting another single, getting foolishly caught in a rundown, then
extricating themselves and finally scoring with a dust-flying slide
into home. Safe! Ask most New Yorkers and they'll probably say they
prefer the Yankees' commodious approach, when the Mets' journey was
far more thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is moving toward an all-or-nothing culture, to its
detriment. As home runs skyrocket, so do strikeouts. Fewer stolen
bases and hit-and-run gambits make for less strategy and
second-guessing, and before you know it the sport will dovetail
into a dressed-up homer-hitting contest. That's essentially what
fans got in the final weekend of this season _ Fox TV disguised the
McGwire-Sosa longball showdown as the ``Game of the Week,'' even
though the players' teams were a combined 50 games out of first
place while the Mets, Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds were
locked in a marvelous pennant race. The Cubs' manager, Jim
Riggleman, put it best: ``I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no more embarrassed than the modern player who doesn't
hit home runs. A Nike commercial this year featured Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, two of the decade's most
successful pitchers, taking extra batting practice because, they
claimed, ``Chicks dig the long ball.'' For how long is the
question. All home runs, even McGwire's, fall to earth eventually.

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Gary Bauer ordered a glass door for his office
at his presidential campaign headquarters here last week. There was
nothing wrong with the old wooden one _ except that two former
aides have said they left because Bauer frequently closed it to
meet one-on-one with his female deputy campaign chief.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bauer quipped, better a glass door than a glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   There were titters after the conservative former head of the
Family Research Council called a news conference to deny rumors
almost no one had heard _ about improprieties no one seems to
believe occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a particularly funny episode for Bauer, who seems
to have suffered with his base on the Christian right after the two
former aides, men who are now working for his Republican rival
Steve Forbes, came forward to say they quit because Bauer had been
willfully oblivious to appearances. The 27-year-old woman who was
the subject of the rumors certainly isn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians and their consultants said that, especially
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the incident was sadly
unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals, not to
mention the female aides who would be penalized if they had only
limited access to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's reaction to the criticism seemed to speak to a general
skittishness in the post-Monica moment in U.S. politics. And while
the long-term impact on professional women in a still mostly-male
arena is unclear, the state of play for men and women at work on
campaigns is certainly a live issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks again, Bill and Monica,'' said Republican consultant
Alex Castellanos, who added that while he does see a
much-heightened sensitivity to appearances, he does not advise
candidates to safeguard appearances at the expense of female staff.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Joe Trippi left Clinton out of it, but
otherwise agreed. ``It's crazy that it's gotten to this point,'' he
said. ``It's probably the one and only time I agree with Gary
Bauer.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of conservatives felt Bauer should have been more
cautious, and should have stopped meeting privately with his female
aide after their strategy sessions caused talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrong, especially after he was warned'' by his former
aides that long closed-door meetings didn't look right, said Cathie
Adams, head of the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative women's group.
``That should not be part of what a man of integrity does. You've
got to have true friends around you, who will confront you if there
could even be a perception of misbehavior. Maybe it doesn't mean no
closed-door meetings, but not hour after hour with someone half
your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, who was a political adviser to presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, said Bauer should expect to be held to a
particularly high standard because ``many Christians believe that
to avoid temptation, men and women just shouldn't be alone when one
is married.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view ``seems sexist to me,'' Bauer said in an interview
_ one-on-one, with the door open _ in his headquarters, where his
wife, Carol, has an office across the hall, and his 22-year-old

   Susan Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor
who ran Michael Dukakis' Democratic presidential campaign in 1988,
said that men's fear of career-stopping sexual allegations was
acute in the world of politics _ ``a weird world of married men and
single women'' _ but also quite common in the business world. And
in part, she says, that's a result of the laws that were supposed
to protect women from sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are reluctant to go on business trips with women,'' said
Ms. Estrich, who teaches a course in gender discrimination. ``At
the end of a hard day, a man can have a beer and watch the game in
his room with another man, and that's OK, but with a woman, it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that as a result, professional women were often left
without the mentors that are crucial to most successful careers.
``It's pretty hard to be mentored by somebody who doesn't want to
be alone with you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she finds that yes, Monica Lewinsky, and even Ally McBeal,
the mini-skirted TV lawyer, have made men at work still more
nervous. ``The message to guys is, if you see a 24-year-old woman,
particularly one who's a little bit sexy, beware.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate outlook for young women in politics does seem
circumscribed. ``If I were running a campaign today, even I
wouldn't assign a 25-year-old woman to travel with the candidate,''
Ms. Estrich said. ``I wouldn't want to encourage people to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa McClard, the passionately conservative 27-year-old
Bauer aide whose closed-door meetings and campaign trips with her
candidate did become an issue, said she has drawn precisely the
opposite conclusion from her recent educational experience. And
what she feels she's learned the hard way is that you can't let the
whisperers have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has undermined my confidence in the workplace and other
people's confidence in me, because now women are mistrusted in the
workplace,'' she said. ``In the wake of everything that's happened
in the last year, the presumption is that, when the door closes,
there is something else going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll be honest, this has changed things in my job. Whether
it's conscious or subconscious, it's always in the back of your
mind and it's hard to keep a focus and not allow anger to take
over. You don't want to overcompensate, but you have to be
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   After disapproval over her access to Bauer first registered, she
said, ``I went through a phase where I did not wear skirts to the
office and I did not wear makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day somebody said, `Maybe you should pull your hair
back in a bun.' At that point, I didn't know if they were kidding
or not. But when that comment was made, I finally realized that

down all alone, and you know who you are.''

POST-MONICA SKITTISHNESS: SEX, POLITICS AND THE OPEN DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Gary Bauer ordered a glass door for his office
at his presidential campaign headquarters here last week. There was
nothing wrong with the old wooden one _ except that two former
aides have said they left because Bauer frequently closed it to
meet one-on-one with his female deputy campaign chief.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bauer quipped, better a glass door than a glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   There were titters after the conservative former head of the
Family Research Council called a news conference to deny rumors
almost no one had heard _ about improprieties no one seems to
believe occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a particularly funny episode for Bauer, who seems
to have suffered with his base on the Christian right after the two
former aides, men who are now working for his Republican rival
Steve Forbes, came forward to say they quit because Bauer had been
willfully oblivious to appearances. The 27-year-old woman who was
the subject of the rumors certainly isn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians and their consultants said that, especially
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the incident was sadly
unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals, not to
mention the female aides who would be penalized if they had only
limited access to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's reaction to the criticism seemed to speak to a general
skittishness in the post-Monica moment in U.S. politics. And while
the long-term impact on professional women in a still mostly-male
arena is unclear, the state of play for men and women at work on
campaigns is certainly a live issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks again, Bill and Monica,'' said Republican consultant
Alex Castellanos, who added that while he does see a
much-heightened sensitivity to appearances, he does not advise
candidates to safeguard appearances at the expense of female staff.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Joe Trippi left Clinton out of it, but
otherwise agreed. ``It's crazy that it's gotten to this point,'' he
said. ``It's probably the one and only time I agree with Gary
Bauer.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of conservatives felt Bauer should have been more
cautious, and should have stopped meeting privately with his female
aide after their strategy sessions caused talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrong, especially after he was warned'' by his former
aides that long closed-door meetings didn't look right, said Cathie
Adams, head of the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative women's group.
``That should not be part of what a man of integrity does. You've
got to have true friends around you, who will confront you if there
could even be a perception of misbehavior. Maybe it doesn't mean no
closed-door meetings, but not hour after hour with someone half
your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, who was a political adviser to presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, said Bauer should expect to be held to a
particularly high standard because ``many Christians believe that
to avoid temptation, men and women just shouldn't be alone when one
is married.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view ``seems sexist to me,'' Bauer said in an interview
_ one-on-one, with the door open _ in his headquarters, where his
wife, Carol, has an office across the hall, and his 22-year-old
daughter, Elyse, a campaign aide, is just down the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the whole brouhaha over private meetings was hard for
him to comprehend. ``I'm not this debonair guy,'' he said. ``And I
don't understand how we can set a standard that says young
professional women can never rise to a point with a male boss that
they're able to give confidential advice. My daughter said, `Dad,
if that's the standard, I just wasted four years of college.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, feminist standard-bearer?
</P>
<P>
   He gave a wounded smile. ``I'm not the Neanderthal I've been
made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is not, apparently, the only politician wondering about
how to preserve his own reputation without damaging the careers of
female aides. On Capitol Hill, several members said the fact that a
female congressional staff member had been named in Newt Gingrich's
divorce proceedings had further complicated matters.

D-Mont., was accused of, and denied, sexually harassing a female
aide he had let go, ``Every one of us looked at that and said,

   VIENNA, Austria _ Wedged inside a crowd in the central square
here, listening to a politician harangue the throng while 200
student demonstrators behind you scream ``Nazis, raus! Nazis,
raus!'' at him, it's important to quell those waves of memory and
remind yourself: You don't speak German, stupid. Forget all those
black-and-white films you watched as a kid. This isn't ``Triumph of
the Will'' even if you're getting the guttural aural cues. It was
your father who was in on the Normandy landing; you only caught the
flick.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often think they spot Nazism on the march in
German-speaking countries. It's a conditioned reflex, the same way
African newspapers love to run big pictures of tiny Ku Klux Klan
rallies, leaving the impression that every third American is a
Klansman.
</P>
<P>
   One American TV report on the 27 percent showing by Joerg
Haider's right-wing Freedom Party in voting here last week worked
in old clips of goose-stepping soldiers and a fulminating Hitler.
An Israeli headline said: ``One Out of Every Four Austrians Chose a
Neo-Nazi Chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   That offended even Austrians who detest Haider (whose party tied
for second and is highly unlikely to become chancellor).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my translator said, the speaker was criticizing the gap
between the pay of Austrian bank presidents and working stiffs.
It's true that when Haider complains about ``Uberfremdung,'' or
over-foreignization, even Austrians say the word has a certain
``Deutschland Uber Alles'' ring to it. But the overtly racial
element of Nazism is lacking. It's similar to the sentiment
expressed in Ross Perot's ``giant sucking sound'' from south of the
border _ nativist populism.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, it isn't necessarily racial. An Egyptian taxi driver,
Hassan Ramy, told me he was a Haider voter. What about his
anti-immigrant feelings? I asked. He's against the ones who don't
have papers, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   True, Austria was long criticized for failing to deal with its
Nazi past; for years, while Germany apologized, it portrayed itself
as Germany's first victim. And Haider has made what a Jewish leader
in his party called ``a couple of stupid remarks that are
constantly quoted.''
</P>
<P>
   In one, he retorted in the heat of debate that the Third Reich
had a sounder employment policy than the today's governing Social
Democrats, and in another he told a veterans' reunion that included
some Waffen SS soldiers that they were ``decent people who stuck to
their belief through the strongest headwinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither at the Vienna gathering I attended nor at a noisy
beer-tent rally in Haider's home area, near the Slovenian and
Italian borders, did his supporters harp on race. ``Sixty percent
of the people here, I think, are protest votes,'' said Hans
Hechenleitner, 53, explaining that people felt the ruling Social
Democratic-conservative coalition in Vienna left them feeling
powerless. ``There's not racism, except maybe among some of the
uneducated ones, and you have also this difference in the U.S., is
it not so?''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hechenleitner about something Haider has said in Vienna,
complaining about the ``extremist'' tag: ``People say I'll declare
war on Slovenia if I'm elected. But that's not true. In my area, we
have good relations with the Italians and Slovenians.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction suggested Haider had gone a bit bleeding heart in
pandering to the urbane Viennese. Hechenleitner and his friend,
Horst Assam, 62, looked at each other. Hechenleitner finally spoke,
betraying the Austrian mistrust of outsiders: ``No, you can't say
we  &UR; like &LR;  them. But we work together.''
</P>
<P>
   There is definitely something creepy about Haider's xenophobia
and how many Austrians it appeals to. Austria is in the middle of
Europe and has been overrun by a lot of peoples _ and Austrians
themselves are often eager to enumerate their diverse ethnic
backgrounds for you. But there's something in at least 27 percent
of the country that wants to shut the door, and it lives even in
the breasts of Egypto-Austrian cabbies. Andreas Rudas, a senior
tactitian for the Social Democratic Party, called it ``the omnibus
effect,'' as in, ``Once I'm on the bus, I want the doors to close
so it doesn't get crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   What liberal leaders find disturbing is less Haider's rhetoric
on race than his oratory on crime _ which, by extension, whips up
fear of foreigners. Prodded by his claims that it is coddling drug
dealers, the government launched a series of drug raids. ``But the
subtext becomes anti-black, anti-Nigerian,'' said Georg
Hoffman-Ostenhof, a political columnist for the weekly Profil, even
though the black population is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   With 4 percent unemployment, health care for all and a
negligible murder rate here, it's a mystery why a lot of Austrians
are convinced that their tiny nation is a hotbed of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drug dealers?'' my translator, who weighs about 100
pounds and feels safe bicycling anywhere in Vienna at night, asked
Horst Thaler, a 66-year-old in a Tyrolean jacket at a rally for
Haidar's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in the Karlsplatz,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a subway station a few blocks away, so we did. By Times
Square standards, it's an Alpine village. By Austrian standards,
it's littered, and there were several unwashed guys begging for
``Zigaretten.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, coming home from watching the late returns, I
passed the Karlsplatz again. The beggar who approached me was, I
presume, Austrian; he was polite and completely bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Then a music event nearby let out, and a crowd came surging
toward the tram. They climbed on, loud and obnoxious, practically
shouting at each other. They were from North Carolina and
California, they were in black tie and had hearing aids. They were
ticked: They didn't know the opera in Vienna begins at 6, and they
had missed the whole first act.
</P>
<P>
   Uberfremdung.

complaining about the ``extremist'' tag: ``People say I'll declare
war on Slovenia if I'm elected. But that's not true. In my area, we
have good relations with the Italians and Slovenians.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction suggested Haider had gone a bit bleeding heart in
pandering to the urbane Viennese. Hechenleitner and his friend,
Horst Assam, 62, looked at each other. Hechenleitner finally spoke,
betraying the Austrian mistrust of outsiders: ``No, you can't say
we  &UR; like &LR;  them. But we work together.''
</P>
<P>
   There is definitely something creepy about Haider's xenophobia
and how many Austrians it appeals to. Austria is in the middle of
Europe and has been overrun by a lot of peoples _ and Austrians
themselves are often eager to enumerate their diverse ethnic
backgrounds for you. But there's something in at least 27 percent
of the country that wants to shut the door, and it lives even in
the breasts of Egypto-Austrian cabbies. Andreas Rudas, a senior
tactitian for the Social Democratic Party, called it ``the omnibus
effect,'' as in, ``Once I'm on the bus, I want the doors to close
so it doesn't get crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   What liberal leaders find disturbing is less Haider's rhetoric
on race than his oratory on crime _ which, by extension, whips up
fear of foreigners. Prodded by his claims that it is coddling drug
dealers, the government launched a series of drug raids. ``But the
subtext becomes anti-black, anti-Nigerian,'' said Georg
Hoffman-Ostenhof, a political columnist for the weekly Profil, even
though the black population is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   With 4 percent unemployment, health care for all and a
negligible murder rate here, it's a mystery why a lot of Austrians
are convinced that their tiny nation is a hotbed of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drug dealers?'' my translator, who weighs about 100
pounds and feels safe bicycling anywhere in Vienna at night, asked
Horst Thaler, a 66-year-old in a Tyrolean jacket at a rally for
Haidar's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in the Karlsplatz,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a subway station a few blocks away, so we did. By Times
Square standards, it's an Alpine village. By Austrian standards,
it's littered, and there were several unwashed guys begging for
``Zigaretten.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, coming home from watching the late returns, I
passed the Karlsplatz again. The beggar who approached me was, I
presume, Austrian; he was polite and completely bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Then a music event nearby let out, and a crowd came surging
toward the tram. They climbed on, loud and obnoxious, practically
shouting at each other. They were from North Carolina and
California, they were in black tie and had hearing aids. They were
ticked: They didn't know the opera in Vienna begins at 6, and they
had missed the whole first act.

   President Goes on Offensive In a Foray Into Canada
</P>

   The sun was shining, he was among friends, and soon the
president was on a roll, improvising jokes as he worked his way
through a speech inaugurating the new U.S. Embassy in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Blithely unaware of the Canadian government's defensiveness over
its high tax rates, Bill Clinton cracked that his host, Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, ``says that if I come one more time I have
to start paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton, who undoubtedly has been briefed on the national
aspiration of many French-speaking Quebeckers, described a family
trip he made a decade ago to Montreal as a trip to ``France.''
White House stenographers corrected the transcript to read
``Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the blooper that catapulted a routine trip to the top
of Friday evening's BBC television news. He improvised a folksy
image to illustrate his efforts to ``help the people in the land of
my forebears in Northern Ireland get over 600 years of religious
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And every time they make an agreement to do it, they're like a
couple of drunks walking out of the bar for the last time,'' he
said of the zigzag peace process between Protestants and Catholics
in Northern Ireland. ``When they get to the swinging door, they
turn around and go back in, and say, I just can't quite get
there.'' Clinton later apologized for what he called an
inappropriate metaphor.

   Some wanted posters of the future may have no photographs, no

against an unknown suspect is upheld. And the notion of a time

</P>
<P>
   Someone committed three rapes in Milwaukee in 1993. But with the
state's six-year time limit for filing charges about to run out in
one case, police have no idea who the rapist is. So to put a foot
in the door, the prosecutor has filed charges of rape and
kidnapping against ``John Doe, unknown male with matching
deoxyribonucleic acid profile.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can change your name, but you can't change your genetic
code,'' said the prosecutor, Norman Gahn.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the case will be challenged, but is not
frivolous. ''We are at the beginning of an era where law
enforcement has to go back and look at old unsolved cases,'' said
Barry Scheck, a law professor and member of the Commission for the
Future of DNA Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I assure you,'' he said, ``you are going to find thousands
of serial murderers and serial rapists.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of numbers that describes the Milwaukee suspect's

   A Presidential Visit To the Teamsters
</P>
<P>
   For decades, U.S. presidents have shied away from meeting with
leaders of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters because of
that union's malodorous past. But President Clinton cast such
caution aside by attending a dinner honoring James P. Hoffa, the
union's new president and the son of its most famous leader. Union
officials say Clinton spoke at the dinner in the hope of persuading
the teamsters to endorse Vice President Al Gore. White House
officials say the president appeared at the dinner because the
teamsters union is such a large, important organization. These
officials also noted that thanks to a 10-year federal cleanup, the
union is far less corrupt than it used to be. _ By STEVEN

Traditional economic models say the economy is so strong that there

   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid out his
blueprint for the new nation of East Timor _ Timor Loro S'ai in
Tetum, the local language. The two-to-three year project promises
to be the biggest operation the United Nations has had to mount
since rebuilding Cambodia in 1992 and 1993. With a U.N.
peacekeeping force assuming responsibility for defense, the
organization will be expected to take over East Timor's gutted
towns and depopulated civil administration and organize everything
from garbage collection to a new legal system. Putting the troops
in place could take a few months, but Annan made it plain that
civilian administrators should move into the dangerous political
vacuum much sooner. The Security Council is likely to give the
go-ahead in the next week or two.

   India's Hindu Party Gains A Solid Victory

   When election returns were counted in India, the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged in a commanding
position, able to lead a centrist coalition of 24 parties that

   A federal grand jury indicted three key figures in the

Russian emigres named _ former Bank of New York executive Lucy
Edwards; her husband, Peter Berlin, and a business associate,
Aleksey Volkov _ are charged with running an illegal wire transfer
business, but investigators indicated last week that further
indictments are on the way. The investigation is examining whether
the enormous money transfers involved money laundering, the process
of washing ``dirty'' money through a series of bank accounts until
it looks ``clean.'' Investigators say that is hard to prove and
federal investigators still haven't uncovered proof of it at the
Bank of New York.

   Return of the Iron Lady

<P>
   Britain's Conservatives, smarting from their loss to Labor two
years ago, have been in need of steeling. So they sent for the Iron
Lady. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher went to their annual
party conference in Blackpool and moved effortlessly to the center
stage she had occupied until being ousted from office by Tory
rivals in 1990. She may have been too outspoken for the
Conservatives then, but not now. Modern-day Tories want to hear
about British pride and the dangers of encroaching Continentals,
and Baroness Thatcher obliged. ``We are quite the best country in
Europe,'' she said. ``In my lifetime, all the problems have come
from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the
English-speaking nations across the world.''

   Still, when a new batch of those tapes was released by the

   Monsanto Co., the biggest name in agricultural biotechnology,
pledged not to market a controversial product that does not yet
exist: seed genetically altered to produce infertile crops. Such
seed would put a stop to farmers saving seed from their harvest for
replanting the next year, giving biotech companies a better shot at
selling them new seed annually. Monsanto does not currently control
the rights to the technology and some scientists say it will never
work outside of the laboratory, but it has already become so
infamous that Monsanto decided to repudiate it. Biotechnology
critics, referring to it as ``Terminator genes'' or ``suicide
seeds,'' have been using it as a potent symbol for everything they
oppose in agribusiness.

   Train Crash in Britain

   Britain's worst train wreck in decades provoked soul-searching
about safety measures on the national railroad system since it was
sold to private investors three years ago. The debate raised the
question of whether national assets like the railroads should be
shielded from raw market forces and run by the state. The police
said more than 70 people were believed to have died in the crash
between two trains in West London on Tuesday, and scores more were
unaccounted for. _ By ALAN COWELL

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Communism may have died 10 years ago in
Eastern Europe, but it lives on, after a fashion, in Yugoslavia _
both in patterns of power and habits of mind. The failure of
political and social transformation helps explain why efforts to
oust President Slobodan Milosevic are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   While ``reform communists'' are back running Poland, for
example, they are a younger generation, humbled and educated by
periods out of power, during which more liberal reformers bungled
government in their own peculiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the republics of the former Yugoslavia, with the
exception of Montenegro and Slovenia, the same leaders continue to
rule as did 10 years ago in the name of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Montenegro, which is Serbia's last sister republic in
Yugoslavia, the Western-backed leader, Milo Djukanovic, runs his
tiny republic (population 650,000) with all the old habits of
cronyism and patronage. Slovenia is the only former Yugoslav
republic that might be considered democratic.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason for this durability of the old leaders and
their style of rule was the nature of Titoism _ a softer brand of
Communism that rejected Stalinism and the higher authority of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Standing proudly, even contemptuously, outside the Soviet bloc,
with a better living standard, a freer press and easy access to the
Western world for ordinary citizens, the old Yugoslavia became a
model for Soviet reformers like Mikhail Gorbachev. And Belgrade was
also insulated from the crisis of Soviet-bloc communism that led to
its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of Yugoslav communism, with its commitment to
private agriculture and some private business and employment in
service industries, allowed the system to bend rather than snap. In
Yugoslavia, there was less repression aimed at ordinary citizens
and more freedom of expression, especially after Tito died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A higher standard of living meant that the state and its
companies could afford to provide decent social benefits for longer
_ benefits, like good pensions and free education, that people
still fear losing now, even when Belgrade no longer has the money
to pay them on time, and they have become virtual, rather than
real.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the state and its instruments of repression were
used more thoroughly to keep the multi-ethnic Yugoslavia together
and to tamp down national expression _ especially resentment felt
by Serbs at the economic and political sacrifices they were called
on to make for the idea of a federal state.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change swept through Yugoslavia after Tito's death,
but it took the form of national and ethnic ``liberation'' and
conflict rather than political and economic transformation, said
Ivo Viskovic, a political science professor at Belgrade University.
</P>
<P>
   New freedoms of expression were used for nationalist ends, even
by the Serbian intellectual elite. By 1987, the Serbian Academy of
Science had published an infamous memorandum complaining of Serbian
humiliation and mistreatment in Yugoslavia _ a harbinger of
Milosevic's own manipulation of nationalist passions, on which he
built his power.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has been different from the rest of Eastern Europe
for a long time, Viskovic said. ``People didn't suffer so much as
in other countries, and the standard of living was pretty high. So
people didn't feel such a need for a dramatic change of the
system.'' The Serbs, Bosnians, Croats and Slovenes ``tried to free
themselves from the others, instead of from the system of economics
and power,'' he said. ``Led by their political and intellectual
elites, people chose to go to war instead of changing the system.''
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic renamed the party, he has never recanted or
disowned any part of the ideology. Yet he is an authoritarian
coalition-maker, not a dictator, and this is a multiparty state
with the possibility of change through elections.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given the basic tenets of communism as it was
practiced _ social ownership of the means of production and a
single-party state _ the Yugoslav version doesn't really qualify,
says Ljiljana Smajlovic, an independent journalist originally from
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Smajlovic said, ``this place is more like the old
Yugoslavia than any of the other broken states.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cling to what is left, a little frozen in time.'' she
said. ``They still put their confidence in the army and the
education system. They no longer have salaries, but 40 percent of
people are afraid of privatization. They hold to the notion of
socialized medicine and of job security when there is none. They
have lost the reality of social security but they are convinced
they are clinging on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental habits persist in part because of Western-imposed
isolation, and in part because many of Serbia's best, youngest and
brightest _ up to 350,000 people _ have emigrated in the last 10
years. In many ways, the West's quarantine of Milosevic has only
strengthened the curtain of ignorance behind which, like some odd
Wizard of Oz, he continues to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Now people are so poor and desperate here that they have lost
the sense that change is possible, Viskovic said. ``It's much
riskier to be for change now than 10 years ago,'' he said. ``To
lose your job now is a life tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the case of a student who took his doctorate and
taught as a professor in a Smederevo high school, then was fired
six years ago for criticizing the local authorities and has nowhere
to turn for redress. ``People simply feel that if they are in
conflict with the regime they will lose,'' Viskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears, explicit in polling data, have reduced people's
willingness to demonstrate. The regime has fostered such fears,
with cameras filming rallies, sudden investigations by the
financial police and ordinary police visiting homes to check
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a large recent poll of Serbian attitudes, nearly two-thirds
of respondents were unhappy with the regime. But some 70 percent
were afraid to participate in demonstrations compared to only 40
percent in 1996, when Belgrade saw 88 days of pro-democracy
protests. Today, 90 percent fear a decline in living standards, and
nearly as many fear new inflation and the loss of jobs. Some 80
percent fear civil war and 70 percent hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's larger problem of authoritarianism is reflected
throughout the former Yugoslavia, except for Slovenia, Viskovic
said. ``This is not just an inheritance of communism or Titoism but
of our history.'' Except for some 10 years in Serbia before World
War I, he noted, there has been no experience of democracy in the
Balkans in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is not a new leader,'' he said, but a new
generation and a more modern political ideology, where politicians
solve problems through pragmatism and cooperation and not simply
fealty and force.

IN THE NEW YUGOSLAVIA, A FAMILIAR DEAD HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Communism may have died 10 years ago in
Eastern Europe, but it lives on, after a fashion, in Yugoslavia _
both in patterns of power and habits of mind. The failure of
political and social transformation helps explain why efforts to
oust President Slobodan Milosevic are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   While ``reform communists'' are back running Poland, for
example, they are a younger generation, humbled and educated by
periods out of power, during which more liberal reformers bungled
government in their own peculiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the republics of the former Yugoslavia, with the
exception of Montenegro and Slovenia, the same leaders continue to
rule as did 10 years ago in the name of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Montenegro, which is Serbia's last sister republic in
Yugoslavia, the Western-backed leader, Milo Djukanovic, runs his
tiny republic (population 650,000) with all the old habits of
cronyism and patronage. Slovenia is the only former Yugoslav
republic that might be considered democratic.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason for this durability of the old leaders and
their style of rule was the nature of Titoism _ a softer brand of
Communism that rejected Stalinism and the higher authority of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Standing proudly, even contemptuously, outside the Soviet bloc,
with a better living standard, a freer press and easy access to the
Western world for ordinary citizens, the old Yugoslavia became a
model for Soviet reformers like Mikhail Gorbachev. And Belgrade was
also insulated from the crisis of Soviet-bloc communism that led to
its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of Yugoslav communism, with its commitment to
private agriculture and some private business and employment in
service industries, allowed the system to bend rather than snap. In
Yugoslavia, there was less repression aimed at ordinary citizens
and more freedom of expression, especially after Tito died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A higher standard of living meant that the state and its
companies could afford to provide decent social benefits for longer
_ benefits, like good pensions and free education, that people
still fear losing now, even when Belgrade no longer has the money
to pay them on time, and they have become virtual, rather than
real.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the state and its instruments of repression were
used more thoroughly to keep the multi-ethnic Yugoslavia together
and to tamp down national expression _ especially resentment felt
by Serbs at the economic and political sacrifices they were called
on to make for the idea of a federal state.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change swept through Yugoslavia after Tito's death,
but it took the form of national and ethnic ``liberation'' and

RESIDENTIAL WISH LISTS SEEKING GLORY FAR FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

 By JANE PERLEZ   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From inside the White House, Bill Clinton's chances
of carving out a place in history as a master of foreign policy
don't look so bad. The White House, in fact, has a wish list of
fairly spectacular goals, and at least some of them seem
tantalizingly reachable.
</P>
<P>
   A lasting Middle East peace deal that ends the hostilities
between Israel and the Palestinians and Syrians? A better
understanding with China? An opening to Iran? Restoring U.S.
prestige at the United Nations by paying Washington's overdue
bills?
</P>
<P>
   Well, wait a minute. Clinton may want to do all this, but this
is the same president who was forced last week to back down on
perhaps the longest of his long-vision goals: ratification of the
nuclear test-ban treaty. Faced with a Republican phalanx of nays in
the Senate, Clinton buckled; he said he was ready to see a vote put
off for a year or more. That sounded a lot like what the Republican
leadership had in mind: to allow ratification _ if it is allowed at
all _ only on a new president's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The incident speaks volumes about the political atmosphere in
which Clinton will have to operate as he tries to burnish his
legacy in his final 15 months in office.
</P>
<P>
   When presidents enter office, the record shows, they usually
find that a foreign policy masterstroke is the easiest way to
establish their stature as the nation's leader. But as presidents
enter their last year they often find themselves more
circumscribed; election year politics, a weary bureaucracy and, in
Clinton's case, an ever more hostile Congress, are closing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain irony that as an administration nears its
end, foreign policy becomes much more difficult because of the
political context,'` said diplomat Winston Lord, who has served in
both Republican and Democratic administrations. ``Either the
president wants to get re-elected or his party wants to get
re-elected and in the Congress you've got partisan juices flowing
as well. That means the White House, the press, the national
political committees, whether Republican or Democratic, view
everything through the political prism.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is more irony in Clinton's case, because this
president came to office with nary a thought to foreign-policy
initiatives. Then he lost control of Congress, and has spent most
of the time since mired in one partisan battle after another.
</P>
<P>
   He has, of course, had accomplishments, among them placing his
signature on the test ban treaty back in 1996. But now, instead of
being able to build on them, Clinton finds himself again ambushed
by domestic politics. The president's supporters were left
lamenting that Clinton had failed to press Congress for
ratification much earlier, because he feared a confrontation with
the Senate's Republicans over the Democratic domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not all presidents, faced with a hostile Congress, have suffered
on foreign policy like Clinton. President Harry S. Truman launched
the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine in the first years of his
administration, when Republicans controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a major difference between then and now, said
James Chace, a biographer of Dean Acheson, who was one of Truman's
secretaries of state. ``Unlike in Truman's time, there is no
overwhelming threat and Congress can afford to deny Clinton
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``History,'' he added, ``judges by results, and the results
under Clinton show that no overall architecture has emerged. There
are no building blocks like the Marshall Plan or the establishment
of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   So the wish list remains long. Here, according to Clinton
administration policy- makers, is the rough condition of the
wishes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A comprehensive Middle East peace settlement would be prize
No. 1. But Syrian President Hafez Assad so far has turned away the
administration's inducements, while Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have agreed to try for a
framework by February that outlines the final agreement to be
achieved by September. Clinton is on the phone two or three times a
week with Arafat and/or Barak, trying to build trust between the
pair, White House aides say. But even if a deal is completed,
Clinton will be under pressure to be modest about his role in it,
because Barak has made a point of insisting that he and Arafat are
in charge _ and not the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making China a `strategic partner' was a major objective. But
now the administration is struggling to restore relations to where
they were a year ago; allegations of Chinese nuclear spying aren't
helping, nor are China's internal political rivalries.
Administration officials acknowledge that Clinton lost an
opportunity last April when he refused to bend in talks with China
about terms for its entry to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, has taken on the job of lobbying Congress in a last
ditch effort to get U.S. arrears to the United Nations paid. But
meanwhile, U.S. standing at the United Nations has become so dicey
that Washington had to lobby tiny New Zealand to give up its
candidacy on the budget committee so that the United States could
seek the role unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a near-perfect world, Clinton is said to very much desire a
rapprochement with Iran and Cuba. But Iran is still not ready,
administration officials say. And competition for the votes of
Cuban immigrants in Florida in the 2000 election make a gesture
toward Fidel Castro all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the column marked accomplishments, Kosovo looms large. But
while the war Clinton led last spring took Kosovo out of the
clutches of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, many of those
who favored the intervention remain angry that Milosevic remains in
power.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Art in the news
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some news stories so delicious in their idiocy that
commentary is superfluous. I will try to restrain myself.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that public school
educators in Muscogee County, Ga., had teacher aides touch up 2,300
copies of a social study text containing the famous painting
``George Washington Crosses the Delaware.'' It seems someone
noticed that if you looked at it from a certain angle, George's
watch fob could be mistaken by a fifth-grader for tiny, misplaced
genitalia. No compliment, that, to the purported Father of Our
Country. (Kids will actually wonder what a watch fob is.)
</P>
<P>
   It took two weeks for teacher aides to paint out this lurking
menace, which has gone undetected in the long history of both the
painting and the republic. Educators explain they fear
fifth-graders will see what they have seen.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
City. Maybe Rudy Giuliani ought to have a go at shutting them down,
too.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush turns off the hard right
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dismissed as a yawner of foregone conclusions, the Republican
presidential primary grind has suddenly mutated into a lively scrap
over the proper nature and future course of the party.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is still the inevitable nominee, but in recent
comments distancing himself from some of the GOP's more throwback
quarters and constituencies, he has stirred the party's hard right
to anxiety and likely to action. Expect a scramble on the
religious/cultural/political right to settle on a paladin _
probably Steve Forbes: he can afford it _ to harry Bush from here
on out over his ideological apostasies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sparked a re-examination that logically should have
followed the very conservative Reagan years and that in fact seemed
to be under way with George Bush's declaration of a ``kinder,
gentler'' presidency. The former vice president had a chance to
lead his party back toward its traditional moderate conservatism
but he was soon trimming to the right's blusters and his presidency
petered out in a political muddle.
</P>
<P>
   Now George W. _ though, mind you, conservative himself _ has
picked a fight with the hard cases who have led recent Republican
Congresses and have characterized the party in the absence of a
president of its own. But does he mean it? And, if so, will he,
unlike Dad, stick it out?
</P>
<P>
   Balked in its attempt to give to the rich through a big tax cut,
this Congress was settling for taking from the poor, gimmicking a
budget balance by stretching out the tax credits that help
low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush first denounced, and quashed, the impulse as improperly
proposing ``to balance the budget on the backs of the poor'' _
shocking words, those _ then went on within days to scold the party
as catering to affluence and ignoring others' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has since fudged with politically soothing there-theres,
but both utterances were calculated. Could it be that his
``compassionate conservatism'' _ dismissed by Democrats as empty
blather and by GOP conservatives as dangerous blather _ is actually
something Bush is ardent about?
</P>
<P>
   The congressional leadership has taken offense. The Christian
Coalition's Pat Robertson says Bush threatens to ``alienate the
core conservatives of the Republican Party.'' Right-wing mouthpiece
Rush Limbaugh, near giving up on Bush, asked, ``Who wants a
Republican moderate as president?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question, actually, and the likely answer is ``more voters
than not.'' Perhaps Bush figures his nomination is such a sure
thing he can start marginalizing the party's doctrinal enforcers
before rather than after its ratification and can produce, at long
last, a convention in which the party doesn't spend so much time
bowing to its right that what it mainly shows the world is its
rump.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp partisan differences will remain if Bush moves his party
back toward the center as Bill Clinton has moved his. (Abortion,
for one.) But for the first time in years, the proximity might make
compromise, at least on a few matters, more likely than futile
battle.

ERSONAL HEALTH: WHEN GOOD INTENTIONS BACKFIRE AND CREATE FOOD
AVERSIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing from file of 10/4.)  By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you think your toddler or preschooler is living on thin air?
Has mealtime become a battle of wills? How many of these
admonitions are familiar to you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Finish your dinner! The children in (unfortunate country) are
starving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't eat your broccoli, there'll be no dessert
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ask is that you taste it. Just one bite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go out to play until you've finished your lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The (food) is delicious. Just try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan B. Roberts, an expert on childhood nutrition at Tufts
University, says that each statement, along with many others to
cajole small children into eating what's good for them, is more
likely to establish a food aversion than a desire or willingness to
consume the food in question.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Dr. Melvin B. Heyman, professor of pediatrics at the
University of California at San Francisco, with Lisa Tracy, a
writer, have produced an excellent guide, ``Feeding Your Child for
Lifelong Health'' (Bantam, $15.95). It offers strategies that mesh
with children's changing stages and foster interest in foods that
are the essence of good nutrition. The strategies are intended to
keep meals and snacks from becoming battlegrounds and to prevent
children from learning to refuse the foods that parents most want
them to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The book also offers menu suggestions and recipes and lists
caloric needs and reasonable portions for children to age 6. You
may think your 2-year-old is not eating enough, but experts will
reassure you that a third of a cup of cereal, 10 ounces of milk and
two grapefruit segments make a good breakfast, and that half a cup
of noodles with butter and cheese and a quarter of an apple are
adequate for a toddler's lunch.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to leading them to what they need, children are
like horses. You can choose what foods to offer, but it is your
child who decides what and how much to eat. Children instinctively
resist foods forced on them. You should never resort to bribery or
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling your child, `You can have ice cream only if you finish
your spinach,' sends the clear message that dessert is nice and
spinach is an unpleasant chore,'' the authors say. ``Over time he
will come to hate it.'' Instead, offer food opportunities _ ``Would
you like to try some salad?'' _ and be prepared to take no for an
answer. Or try reverse psychology: ``I'm glad you didn't eat your
peas, because I want them.'' Then eat them yourself (unless, of
course, the child decides to eat them first).
</P>
<P>
   Children instinctively resist persuasion, Roberts and Heyman
write. ``Preferences for less healthy foods are actually reinforced
by pressure to eat healthy ones, coupled with the absence of
pressure to eat the less healthy ones.'' Avoid making a child
suspicious of a food by pushing it. If a child refuses to eat
things like green beans, bring them back every week or two (for a
total of 15 times, Roberts suggests) and let the child know he
doesn't have to eat them.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidding less-than-healthy foods can foster an intense desire
for them. When a child eats at someone else's home or at a party,
whatever is served should be permissible. By not keeping less
desirable foods and beverages in your own home, you will reduce the
opportunities to eat them.
</P>
<P>
   When my sons were small, we never had soda, candy, chips, cake
or rich cookies in the house, but all were allowed on occasion.
Fresh fruits were always available, along with homemade muffins and
quick breads made with fruits or vegetables. As a result, they
never clamored for overly sweet or fatty treats, and even now
rarely eat them.
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of what the authors call ``a window of
opportunity'' for introducing many kinds of vegetables. The ages of
1 and 2, when children put everything in their mouths, are good
times to offer a variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits and
fish. I used to buy packages of mixed frozen vegetables, defrost
them and sprinkle them on the boys' feeding trays as finger food.
In those days, they ate every kind, from cauliflower to lima beans.
Even if some vegetables are later refused, children will often go
back to them after this early introduction.
</P>
<P>
   But even children who start out with an appetite for a range of
foods will suddenly, at 2 or soon after, become conservative and
resist anything unfamiliar, often insisting on the same foods day
after day until you're convinced they'll soon turn into peanut
butter and jelly on white bread.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says you can encourage acceptance of new foods by
creating ``bridges of familiarity''; for example, by substituting
sliced banana for the jelly, or by replacing one slice of white
bread with whole wheat. If your child likes breaded chicken
nuggets, introduce fish as breaded sticks or fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to like a variety of fruits and vegetables is extremely
important to your child's growth and future health. But telling a
child that a food is delicious or good for her is a sure-fire way
to make it undesirable. Offer a small amount of the food, eat it
with obvious pleasure yourself, but don't insist that the child try
it.
</P>
<P>
   If your child tends to fill up by eating pasta, potatoes or meat
first, leaving no room for vegetables, try offering cut-up raw or
steamed vegetables and dip before the meal is served. Children love
to dip, and low-fat salad dressing or a simple dip of reduced-fat
mayonnaise or yogurt and ketchup can be all the encouragement a
child needs to eat vegetables. Try flavored yogurt as a dip for
fruit. Keep in mind that children usually prefer crisp vegetables.
For those vegetables my sons categorically refused, I often grated
or pureed them in tomato sauce or soup, or incorporated them into
quick breads and muffins, which the boys sometimes helped to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of participation. When a child helps
to make a food _ whether it is adding cherry tomatoes to the salad,
tearing the lettuce, mixing the batter or growing vegetables in a
garden or window box _ the child is far more likely to want to eat
it. Research has shown that when children become familiar with a
food, like beans in chili, by preparing it in class, they are much
more likely to choose it and eat it in the lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   But don't insist that every new food be tasted. ``Tasting rules
are hard to enforce, lead to arguments and in the long run don't
work,'' the authors state. Instead, casually offer a part of the
food that may have special appeal, like a crispy crust or tasty
sauce, or have someone else at the table say how good the broccoli
or beans are.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid preparing separate meals for children and adults. (If a
dish is to be highly spiced, however, it would be wise to remove
some for the child before the hot seasonings are added.) If a child
refuses to eat a main course, make no comment about it. Simply
offer a plain alternative, like cereal and milk or a cheese
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has unkind words for food tricks, such as cutting
sandwiches into fancy shapes or making faces on hot cereal. I am
not so sure: people's appetites are whetted by their eyes as well
as their taste buds, and my sons got a kick out of the simple
decorations I made on their oatmeal and French toast. Early on we
dubbed broccoli ``baby tree,'' and 29 years later our sons still
enjoy this healthful vegetable.

 &HT;    Reliving the good times
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ This is my hometown. I grew up here back in the
'50s when gasoline cost 19 cents a gallon, and the only ``runners''
anybody'd ever heard of were the rum kind who flourished on the
Florida coast during prohibition. Life was good, but try to
convince a kid of that.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1947, I met a girl named Ann Marie Anderson at
school. We
</P>
<P>
   started doing stuff together. We joined the choir and learned to
sing harmony _
</P>
<P>
   sort of. ``Whispering Hope'' was our favorite. Our mothers made
us circle skirts to wear under the choir robes. Annie's was green.
Mine was white.
</P>
<P>
   We partnered in home ec class. Once we cooked up a prune whip
that was so nasty looking at it gave us a bad case of the giggles.
Once we got in trouble for
</P>
<P>
   frying potatoes when we were supposed to be baking apple crisp.
</P>
<P>
   When my mother had an operation, Ann Marie's mother, a
no-nonsense Swedish
</P>
<P>
   lady, took me in and saw to it that I cleaned up my oatmeal
every morning
</P>
<P>
   before Mr. Anderson drove us to school.
</P>
<P>
   That same year we went steady with two guys named Bill. Once we
danced with
</P>
<P>
   them at a school dance. Both romances lasted a week.
</P>
<P>
   In 10th grade, Ann Marie met A.B., and pretty soon they were a
twosome. A.B.
</P>
<P>
   had a friend named Harry who had a cool '40 Chevy and no
girlfriend. The
</P>
<P>
   fix-up was in. We doubled on Saturday night. I wore a blue dress
and a flowered silk scarf around my neck. Harry had on a tweed
jacket. We went to the Jamboree at school, kind of an in-house
talent show. The Taylor twins tap-danced. Later we wheeled into
Kelly's Drive-In for hamburgers, 25-cent milkshakes, and to see and
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, the four of us spent a lot of time
together, just like we're doing this afternoon, 50 years later in
Ann Marie and A.B.'s living room. Annie and I are giggling and the
guys are telling stories _ same as we did all those years ago _
before three marriages, two divorces, a couple of bypasses, and
bifocals.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night beach parties at Crandon Park were a mainstay of
our social
</P>
<P>
   life. Ann Marie reminds Harry how we had to keep the fire going
until midnight
</P>
<P>
   so he could have a hamburger without having to confess on
Saturday that he'd
</P>
<P>
   eaten meat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we got crazy _ like the night Harry raced Jerry
Gregory across the
</P>
<P>
   Rickenbacker causeway to Key Biscayne. We jumped the median _
twice. Once to
</P>
<P>
   pass Jerry, and once to get back on our own side of the bridge
and out of the
</P>
<P>
   way of oncoming traffic. Ann Marie and A.B. were in the back
seat. Later, when
</P>
<P>
   I asked Harry why he was acting funny, he said he was thinking
about what a
</P>
<P>
   stupid thing he'd done and how close he'd come to flipping the
four of us into
</P>
<P>
   Biscayne Bay.
</P>
<P>
   I went to my first prom with Harry. He showed up looking mighty
fine in a
</P>
<P>
   white dinner jacket and his dad's new ``step down'' Hudson. It
was on loan for
</P>
<P>
   the special occasion. I was feeling fairy tale gorgeous as Harry
helped me
</P>
<P>
   into the car _ until I tried to ``step down'' and got tangled up
in 20 yards of
</P>
<P>
   ice-blue tulle and went sprawling across the front seat. I wasOK, but my
</P>
<P>
   gardenias were smashed. Ann Marie and A.B. were in the back
seat.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday morning we all went for a sail on George Mauer's
boat. The girls
</P>
<P>
   brought food, and the guys brought drink. Four grueling hours
later, with
</P>
<P>
   little help from wind or tide, we waded ashore on a tiny island
in Biscayne
</P>
<P>
   Bay, spread out the picnic and sent Harry to reclaim the jug of
cider we'd
</P>
<P>
   been dragging behind the boat to cool. We were desperately
thirsty, and as it
</P>
<P>
   turned out, doomed to another four dry hours. The boy geniuses
had bought a gallon of apple cider vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Which just happens to be what Annie and I are ragging them about
this
</P>
<P>
   afternoon. But hey, isn't that what old friends, and memories,
are for?

 &HT;    Cats, dogs, kids, lizards and roots, what more?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I can't completely empathize with what Lori St.
John had to worry about. Every morning in my house we have to check
to see what the cats spit up. For a day or two, St. John was hoping
not to have to tell her guest python, ``Now, spit up the cat.''
</P>
<P>
   That cat can release from the ceiling. The python is gone _
reclaimed by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Most every reader of the Waco Tribune-Herald felt the old
epidermis expand and contract at the front-page story about St.
John finding the 9-foot, one-eyed python in the parking lot of the
Bill Logue Juvenile Justice Center and carting it home.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about story placement. Right above the picture of St.
John holding the snake was a teaser to an inside story on how to
``keep your home from becoming a rodent haven.'' A python would do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one obvious problem for St. John was the event that
the python might classify her cat as a rodent.
</P>
<P>
   I can almost relate to this. I don't have any 9-foot pets
slithering around my house. I do recall a hairball nearly that
large.
</P>
<P>
   The average American house is an ecosystem _ many lives entwined
in eco-confines. We have the children. We have house plants. We
have the pets. We have what buggers the pets bring in, and others
uninvited.
</P>
<P>
   If you take away kids, who commonly come with pets, you dispatch
with most of the standard nuclear ecosystem. But you never live in
an eco-vacuum. When I was single, I had no children, no house
plants, no pets. But I did have things growing in my refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   As a bachelor, I thought I was insulated, apart from nature's
forces. Then I found that mice had been convening to nibble through
take-home packets of ketchup I'd been storing for the winter. We
are all somewhere on the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Having children and pets really accents the home-as-wilderness
experience. This ranges from Wild Kingdom rituals around the
refrigerator _ teen-agers hunt in packs _ to house cats waiting for
a june bug to be introduced to their bio-dome.
</P>
<P>
   I've written before about the imported-to-Waco Mediterranean
geckos that hang upside down on our windows, their see-through
bellies showing their last dinner. I've lobbied my wife to allow
them to hang out inside. They're known to control bugs like, for
instance, the ear mites that pester the cats.
</P>
<P>
   The other day (my wife's sworn vow to leave me also factored in)
I finally holstered my interest in giving geckos the run of the
house. I watched in dyspeptic horror as one of our cats chased down
a gecko and made like a python, digestive-wise. Maybe the window
screen is best for see-through lizards.
</P>
<P>
   And lest we assume that the extent of the home-sweet ecosystem
is that which walks and stalks afoot, the other day we faced up to
an invasion under our feet.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer where fire ants were burrowing all the way to the
China Sea for moisture, roots from the Arizona ash in front of our
house gradually and inexorably had strangled off our sewer line,
carving into the pipe like lifers in Shawshank Prison. After
repeated visits from the rooter industry, which may one day prove
more lucrative in Waco than giving allergy shots, we gave in and
gave up our front yard to professionals with a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   As the plumbers replaced our rusted line, they hauled out roots
big enough to serve with rump roast.
</P>
<P>
   I came home after the deed was done to find a gaping wound from
the house to the street, the roots flayed out from the incision. It
was like thorasic surgeons had left a patient unstitched on the
table. The next morning they ``closed up'' _ in O.R. terms _
leaving a scar the size of the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   But at least we could flush. Last time I checked.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, it's scary, all the life forms out
there trying to share inner domains. Wish I didn't have to think
about it.

   INTERNET SAVVY HISPANICS ... AN OXYMORON? _ The United States
may be facing an educational disaster in the coming decades.
According to a study by the Department of Education, three out of
four school-age kids lack the writing ability necessary to land
adequate jobs. Hispanic children with limited English-speaking
ability and who reside in economically depressed homes scored the
lowest. Concurrent with these results, however, come the startling
results of a national survey that concludes that
Hispanics-Americans are second only to Asian-Americans in Internet
access. What does this all mean? Columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras
searches for answers.
</P>
<P>
   THE PATH TO ABUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISN'T A ONE-WAY STREET.
``Here we go again,'' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``This time
the holier-than-thou sinner is the management of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, which is willing to publicly trample the feelings of
millions of religious human beings simply because it believes that
all art is sacred.'' This week, Jarrett offers a hard-hitting
commentary on the controversy concerning Chris Ofili's work ``The
Holy Virgin Mary.'' Jarrett's take: ``Don't ask the taxpayers who
are insulted by the art to finance the promotion of (Ofili's)
ideas. And one need not be impressed by New York's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   NO RESPECT, NO MONEY _ Political campaign financing season has
arrived once again. This year, however, will be different.
Candidates may have a harder time getting donations from
Asian-American supporters. ``Asian-Americans, who have been stung
by the 1996 campaign contribution scandals, will be shutting doors
and taking the phones off the hooks,'' writes columnist Amy Wu.
Many Asian-Americans feel that they were placed under a cloud of
suspicion after two Chinese-Americans were accused of campaign
finance violations. The media and Democratic political opponents
also helped to tarnish the image and reputation of the
Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   GAY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.
Is there really a change in the attitude of GOP presidential
candidates toward gays? On the surface it would seem so, now that
they are on the campaign trail. Rich Tafel, Executive Director of
the Log Cabin Republicans, says George W. Bush has ``laid the
philosophical groundwork for supporting federal nondiscrimination
policies and legislation.'' Columnist Chuck Colbert couldn't
disagree more. GOP presidential hopefuls, Colbert writes, ``fall
very short of fully supporting and wholeheartedly embracing gay
civil rights as shown by their Democratic contenders,'' who favor
passage of a gay civil-rights employment bill, (the Employment
Nondiscrimination Act), hate-crimes legislation, lesbian and gay
adoptions and political appointments.

   INTERNET SAVVY HISPANICS ... AN OXYMORON? _ The United States
may be facing an educational disaster in the coming decades.
According to a study by the Department of Education, three out of
four school-age kids lack the writing ability necessary to land
adequate jobs. Hispanic children with limited English-speaking
ability and who reside in economically depressed homes scored the
lowest. Concurrent with these results, however, come the startling
results of a national survey that concludes that
Hispanics-Americans are second only to Asian-Americans in Internet
access. What does this all mean? Columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras
searches for answers.
</P>
<P>
   THE PATH TO ABUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISN'T A ONE-WAY STREET.
``Here we go again,'' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``This time
the holier-than-thou sinner is the management of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, which is willing to publicly trample the feelings of
millions of religious human beings simply because it believes that
all art is sacred.'' This week, Jarrett offers a hard-hitting
commentary on the controversy concerning Chris Ofili's work ``The
Holy Virgin Mary.'' Jarrett's take: ``Don't ask the taxpayers who
are insulted by the art to finance the promotion of (Ofili's)
ideas. And one need not be impressed by New York's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   NO RESPECT, NO MONEY _ Political campaign financing season has
arrived once again. This year, however, will be different.
Candidates may have a harder time getting donations from
Asian-American supporters. ``Asian-Americans, who have been stung
by the 1996 campaign contribution scandals, will be shutting doors
and taking the phones off the hooks,'' writes columnist Amy Wu.
Many Asian-Americans feel that they were placed under a cloud of
suspicion after two Chinese-Americans were accused of campaign
finance violations. The media and Democratic political opponents
also helped to tarnish the image and reputation of the
Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   GAY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.
Is there really a change in the attitude of GOP presidential
candidates toward gays? On the surface it would seem so, now that
they are on the campaign trail. Rich Tafel, Executive Director of
the Log Cabin Republicans, says George W. Bush has ``laid the
philosophical groundwork for supporting federal nondiscrimination
policies and legislation.'' Columnist Chuck Colbert couldn't
disagree more. GOP presidential hopefuls, Colbert writes, ``fall
very short of fully supporting and wholeheartedly embracing gay
civil rights as shown by their Democratic contenders,'' who favor
passage of a gay civil-rights employment bill, (the Employment
Nondiscrimination Act), hate-crimes legislation, lesbian and gay
adoptions and political appointments.

 &HT;    Ghosts, goblins can find fashion advice on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Servicehe Web can be downright spooky at times.
<TEXT>
But there are times when that's a good thing. If you and your
family are preparing for Halloween, you'll find almost everything
you need on the Web.
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious: costumes. While you can buy almost
any costume you can imagine, it's more fun (and costs less) to make
your own.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a good starting point for our ghostly tour is a Web
page called Mary's Halloween Costumes at cgi.cadvision
</P>
<P>
   .com/(tilde)burke/halloween
</P>
<P>
   /costumes.htm. Unlike many of the Halloween costume pages you'll
find, the costumes described here aren't for sale. Instead, you'll
get hints for doing it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Some are as traditional as the easy-to-make ghost costume _ all
you need is an old white sheet _ or, for avant garde ghosts, try
something more colorful: Others are as wild as dressing a child as
a bunch of grapes (think of a grape cluster made from balloons).
</P>
<P>
   Another site that offers help with homemade costumes is
sponsored by Crayola and is located at www.familyplay.com/advice
</P>
<P>
   /mccracken/d1012.adv.html. At this site, there's some general
advice on selecting the character and safety considerations. (If
you plan to have a vampire in your household, make sure you use
plenty of reflective tape and other bright accessories so that
automobile traffic can spot the vampire easily).
</P>
<P>
   That same page also offers links to information on planning
Halloween parties and for cooking Halloween treats.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at one last Halloween costume site before we move on
_ it's located at www.funfolly.com/h/ca01a.htm. This is a
commercial site, offering to sell costumes. The point of using this
site isn't necessarily to buy the costumes. Instead, you can use
the photographs as idea starters for the kind of costume you make
at home.
</P>
<P>
   For many kids and grown-ups, Halloween also is a time for
parties. As you would expect, there's help in party planning from
the Web, too. Halloween Games for Kids at www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /NapaValley/7458/hgames.htm may give you some ideas for the sort
of entertainment to offer. Truth is, some grown-ups might get a
kick out of these games, too. One game, for instance, involves
dividing partygoers into teams, giving them a roll of toilet paper
and assigning each team to make a mummy. The best mummy wins.
</P>
<P>
   Another page offering Halloween game advice is located at
www.gamekids.com
</P>
<P>
   /hallow3.html. You'll find dozens of games (and several recipes
for party food, too) scattered around on the various links from
this page.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the age of computer-generated party invitations,
you may need a few graphics to make your invitations look right. Or
you may have a personal Web page and be in desperate need of a
photo or drawing of a black cat, ghost or pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you're in luck. There are literally hundreds of Web pages
that offer graphics free for the downloading. One of these pages is
CSP Halloween Graphics at www.cyberspaceplace.com
</P>
<P>
   /halloweenbacks2.html. The only catch is that, if you use an
image on a Web page, you are asked to give credit to this site in
the form of a link.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's our tour of the haunted Web for this week. Just save
some time to get out in the world and get some Halloween candy
which can be much more satisfying than the eye candy you'll find on
the Web.

 &HT;    Operating system upgrade will enhance multiple-user features
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Oct. 23, Apple will release the latest upgrade to
its Mac operating system, or OS.
</P>
<P>
   This latest upgrade, dubbed OS 9, represents evolutionary change
in Apple's venerable software that controls the look and feel of
all Macs.
</P>
<P>
   With OS 9, users will for the first time be able to create and
keep several individual configurations on one Mac. That is, two
people can share a computer but use desktops and configurations
customized to their specific tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer officially announced OS 9 on Tuesday, but reports
about the project, code-named Sonata, and its key features have
been proliferating across the Web for months. To check out the
latest reports, visit such sites as Apple Insider, MacIntouch and
Webintosh.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a summary of OS 9's biggest new features.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata's biggest change will be an expanded ability for Macs to
handle multiple users. With Sonata, several people will be able to
share a Mac and keep separate work environments. Those individual
working environments will be password-protected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one but you _ or a system administrator if
your Mac is on a network _ will be able to change your setup. Among
the things you'll be able to customize will be look, file access
and Internet configuration.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign onto a Mac configured for multiple users via a
written password or through voice recognition. Sonata will include
a new control panel called Voice Password Assistant.
</P>
<P>
   With Voice Password, you select a spoken code word, then say it
until the system understands your voice and the code word. Then a
user can sign onto a Mac by selecting his or her name and saying
the correct password.
</P>
<P>
   Another OS feature getting an overhaul is Apple's new Sherlock
search technology. Sherlock lets users search not only their hard
drive but the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata will add two new important searches to Sherlock. The
first is for people. Sherlock will search out via the Web telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses. What it finds will be listed on your
computer in the Sherlock window.
</P>
<P>
   The second new search is for e-commerce. Type the name of a
product into Sherlock. It will then search the Web for varying
prices and availability of the product, listing the results on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more changes coming with Sonata, many of which
are minor enhancements and bug fixes.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about this upgrade, check out Apple Insider at
www.appleinsider.com

 &HT;    Web pioneer follows the money
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Jim Clark is a bona fide ``been there, done that,
have the T-shirt'' member of the Silicon Valley boys club.
</P>
<P>
   First, he started Silicon Graphics, then hooked up with
University of Illinois wunderkind Marc Andreessen to found
Netscape. Clark took home a bundle after Netscape went public, then
moved on to Healtheon, the medical benefits information company
that was later acquired by Atlanta-based WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   So who better to give the keynote address to the Internet
insiders, players and pretenders at the Industry Standards'
NetReturns 2000 conference at the St. Regis Hotel? The 400-plus
attendees all turned their cell phones off and put down their
PalmPilots long enough to listen to Clark describe his personal and
extremely profitable trip down the fast lane of the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to the assembled industry players was simple: Follow
your gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every entrepreneur knows there's one thing you need to succeed
... follow a strong gut instinct that tells you what you know can
bring about a company that sells something people will want to
buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the so-called dot-com start-ups are fortunate
because they don't have what he calls the ``Barnes &AMP; Noble
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are encumbered by the current way of doing things,'' he
said. ``The great thing about a start-up is that you are not
encumbered. Your goal, of course, is to become encumbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clark's ventures have all been wildly successful,
he's not afraid to admit where things went wrong. Maybe it's OK to
admit where you've messed up when you have a cool billion to show
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Netscape, he said, ``After three months of talking
to Marc, I got it and I got it big,'' he said. Clark said
Netscape's ultimate failure was its focus on business customers:
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to convince newspapers and media companies and direct
marketers that the Web could be a vehicle for electronic commerce.
But it was a little early. And we threw away our portal
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark admits where he went astray with Healtheon. ``The biggest
market I could think of was health care,'' he said. ``We built the
world's best benefits enrollment system, but not a lot of people
wanted it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with wildly successful, if slightly flawed, Web ventures
behind him, Clark isn't about to call it a day. He is still
traveling the highways and byways of Silicon Valley with a new
venture called My CFO (www.mycfo.com).
</P>
<P>
   The venture is built upon Clark's own problems managing the
millions he has amassed as a Web pioneer. As it happens, Clark has
an awful lot of money scattered around in an awful lot of places,
and he's having just the darndest time trying to keep track of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Clark decided to go with his gut again and form a Web-based
company _ his fourth start-up. The year-old company is targeted at
an audience that Clark calls ``high-net-worth individuals with
complex financial lives.''
</P>
<P>
   My CFO's users are worth a million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A business wouldn't consider operating without a CFO,
controller and accountant. We're doing for the individual what
businesses have to do,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of investors and users of My CFO reads like a who's who
of Silicon Valley with a roster of old-money superstars including
Cisco Systems Chief Executive Officer John Chambers. And just for
being Jim Clark, he's already got backing from big-time venture
capitalists such as Kleiner Perkins and Excite At Home Chairman Tom
Jermoluk.
</P>
<P>
   Clark talked of how these high-income individuals have trouble
keeping their financial houses in order, especially when it comes
to money earned from what he termed ``wealth-generating events''
like an initial public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clark's enviable track record, My CFO seems to share
some of the flaws of Clark's other ventures. He's overlooked the
little people again and has underestimated the big ones. If you
have a million dollars, why can't you just hire your own
flesh-and-blood financial managers and pay for it with the cash
generated from all these ``wealth-generating events'' that seem to
happen to Silicon Valley millionaires almost daily?
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Clark's new venture was mixed. ``I think Clark needs
to volunteer at a soup kitchen,'' cracked one attendee milling
around in the lobby during a break. ``He's been down in the Valley
pricing Ferraris, oceanfront property and sports teams too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does hitting the video poker in South Carolina count as a
wealth-generating event?'' muttered one of the conference speakers.
``I don't understand what he's trying to do. It's not a Web site,
it's an intranet investment banking firm for Clark and his
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   My CFO became one of the hottest topics at the four-day
conference. It seems to have everything a turn-of-the-century Web
start-up should have: Big-time backers, super-rich users, and the
envy and resentment of every Web player who didn't think of it and
will never be rich enough to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the public relations people tried to put the best
spin on My CFO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, he's Jim Clark,'' said one of the conference organizers.
``He's done it all, and he's just having fun now. Why shouldn't
he?''
</P>
<P>
   He's just following his gut _ and following the money.

 &HT;    Plug/no play weekend frustrating experience
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks as if it may be time to lighten the load on
the old Pentium 166.
</P>
<P>
   I took it with me and looked into the maw of the circuit-board
abyss. I made it back relatively OK, but I'm not sure the P166 did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, headache-inducing, frustration-filled trip.
Somewhere along the way, the P166 took a near-fatal hit. In fact,
its brains are still a little scrambled and it gets a faraway look
in the monitor. It all started innocently enough.
</P>
<P>
   About a week after putting in the Intel NIC, or network
interface card, which I wrote about in the last column, weird
things began to happen, and my modem started acting goofy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a U.S. Robotics 56K Winmodem, your basic generic Windows
95 plug-and-play hardware. It developed the strange habit of
answering incoming phone calls after one ring with a fax tone. So,
on a Friday afternoon, I went out and bought a Diamond Supra
voice/fax modem for $60. Late Sunday night I was looking at a dead
computer and a Win 95 CD that wasn't even useful as a coaster
because it has a hole in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   I actually enjoy opening up my P166 _ a Toshiba Infinia _ to
tinker and install new hardware. Also, I hoped to rectify my
increasingly poor MindSpring connection. In the past few weeks, the
number of disconnects has jumped from none to frequent, and when it
does stay connected, the download speeds drop to less than 200
bytes!
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the modem wasn't the answer, and slow, overloaded ISP
servers quickly became the least of my problems. I popped the top
on the P166, swapped out the USR modem for the Supra, stuck in the
CD-ROM with the new modem's drivers and turned on the juice _
waiting for Win 95 to do that magic plug-and-play trick and
discover my new hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plug-and-play is really a wonderful thing (you Mac users
stop snickering). Win 95 finds your new piece of hardware, asks for
the drivers, copies them off your CD, restarts itself, and you're
plugged and you're playing.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't expect any surprises when I opened up the Properties
on my computer and looked in the device manager. Egads!
</P>
<P>
   There were several problems. The most confusing thing was having
two COM1 ports and an unnamed COM port along with the COM2 serial
port and the LPT1 printer parallel port. On top of that, the Intel
NIC had one of those alarming yellow exclamation points Win 95 uses
as a hardware conflict alert.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm no greenhorn in the device manager. I've done several
modem upgrades, and have added a TV tuner card, scanners, printers
and NICs.
</P>
<P>
   So I knew all about removing conflicting devices and letting the
Win 95 plug-and-play feature find them again to reinstall the
drivers. So I did ... to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I played plug-and-play for the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I got into the IRQs, DMA channels, reinstalling drivers,
removing devices, you name it. I was swapping cards around into
different PCI and ISA slots _ a trick I had used successfully in
the past. I was in the Setup program, using DOS commands I forgot
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I was doing a lot of plugging but no playing.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba was no help. Support wanted $35 to even let me ask a
question. Forget that. I already paid them $2,200 for the machine.
They weren't getting any more of my money.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I reached a point where trying to dial the modem
resulted in the famed Windows ``fatal exception'' and the blue
screen of death. Then it deteriorated to where I couldn't even boot
into Windows without the machine turning blue.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I decided I had to reformat the hard drive _ after a
three-hour timeout to back up my 8-gigabyte disk.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't throw in the towel until I ran the Windows set-up
program and got a message that a CAB file was corrupt before the
setup program terminated itself. I had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have managed to restore my computer to a shadow of
its former self. It works fine, except that I apparently have a
conflict with my USB serial bus. And I still have that gnarly
unnamed COM port.
</P>
<P>
   I have not yet figured out what the deal is. All I can figure is
that my motherboard _ built for the first-generation Pentium chips
_ wigged out from having too many devices installed. I suppose I
will take the P166 to a pro and see what's what.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if anyone needs a new modem, I have one for
sale cheap.

 &HT;    Magazine offers sneak peek at `Pokemon Yellow' game
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the most anticipated new games of the coming
holiday season is ``Pokemon Yellow,'' the latest in the series of
Gameboy titles featuring this little Japanese character and
friends. There's a preview in the October issue of Nintendo Power
magazine. The reviewer says the game's maze world is all-new.
Samples of this new map are included as part of the article.
</P>
<P>
   Check out Apple's newest portable computer, the iBook, in the
October issue of MacWorld. The iBook is featured in the magazine's
cover story, which explains how the iBook differs from Apple's
other portable computers. The iBook also includes new wireless
technology that lets several users connect simultaneously to the
Internet through one device.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   There's a new flight simulator on the market called ``Fly.''
Published by Gathering and developed by Terminal Reality, ``Fly''
offers a simulation in sound, sight and feel of flying a host of
airplanes. The game is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker has released its latest version of the database of the
same name. Called FileMaker Pro 5.0, this version includes features
that let users share databases over the intranet and develop more
powerful Web pages. FileMaker is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   One of the areas moving rapidly to the Web is employment
classified ads and job services. There are plenty of new sites
offering job openings and help in finding jobs. Now there's a site
that monitors all the other job sites. It's called Career-Builder
Mega Job Search. Career-Builder lets you monitor such popular sites
as Monster.com, CareerPath and Hotjobs. You'll find this site at
www.careerbuilder.com.

 &HT;    Online computer shopping rated
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As we ease into another holiday season, the analysts
are guessing that more and more people will be doing some of their
shopping from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But which sites are the easiest to use? Who has the best
customer service?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, a market research firm, looked at the best Web
sites for buying a computer. Gomez broke the results down into the
best sites for first-time buyers, bargain hunters and serious
shoppers. The results are at Gomez's Web site, www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com ranked first. Gomez said the Web site had the lowest
prices and offers 30-day toll-free customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com offers a strong variety of products, order tracking and
easy access to manufacturers with technical support links,
according to the review. The site was flagged for its ``spotty''
product descriptions and for the online delays for customer service
help.
</P>
<P>
   For bargain hunters, www.buy.com, www.computers4sure.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .onsale.com and www.outpost
</P>
<P>
   .com were the top-ranked sites.
</P>
<P>
   For first-time buyers, www.buy.com, www.pcmall.com,
www.outpost.com and necxdirect.necx.com rated high. First-time
buyers are defined as people interested in sites that are easy to
navigate and have accessible customer service.
</P>
<P>
   For ``serious shoppers,'' Gomez.com ranked www.cdw.com,
www.pcmall.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .buy.com and www.computers4sure.com highly.
</P>
<P>
   Serious shoppers are defined as those who tend to make purchases
for their business. The buyer is drawn to sites that offer the best
selection, detailed account information and a chance for volume
discounts or leasing options.

<P>
   FEMALE CEO FINDS IT'S A LONELY ROAD
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to be young, attractive, female and the head of a
Silicon Valley technology company?
</P>
<P>
   Kim Polese, chief executive of Marimba, talks about what it's
like to walk that fairly deserted street in the October issue of
Upside magazine. Upside is the print version of
www.upsidetoday.com, a Web magazine devoted to the technology
industry's personalities, companies and money.
</P>
<P>
   Polese was part of the product management group responsible for
spreading the word about Java, the programming language in which
many Internet applications are written. She left Sun Microsystems
and helped form Marimba, a company that builds and sells software
that allows software updates to be delivered to networked PCs.
After a good bit of hype, most of which focused on the novel idea
of a young, female CEO, the company went public in April _ but not
before a slight change in direction, from a ``push'' technology
firm to one that delivers software over the Internet and networks.
</P>
<P>
   The woman-as-CEO attention was important and valuable for a new
technology company, but when the company changed direction, Polese
took the heat. Magazine and newspaper stories questioned whether
the company was more hype than reality, and since the hype centered
on her gender, Upside questions whether the criticism was sexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sexism was in the mix,'' Polese said in the article,
``but my reaction when I saw that was not concern about sexism but
disappointment on behalf of my company, my co-founders and our
customers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction to the oddity and the novelty of a woman
CEO. But it didn't really bother me at the end of the day because I
knew we were going to execute, I knew we were going to be
successful, and I knew we were going to kick butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some urban legends aren't false after all
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard the one about the guy who kills himself trying to
get a can out of a soft drink machine? Unlike most so-called urban
legends, this one apparently is true.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 11 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association documents 15 cases of a soda machine falling on someone
trying to retrieve a can. Of those, 12 people were injured and
required hospitalization, and three were crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site devoted to urban legends, www.urbanlegends
</P>
<P>
   .com, looks at some of the more interesting, intriguing and
mostly false stories making the rounds.

 &HT;    International radio spins a unique, charming web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm an analog guy in a digital world.
</P>
<P>
   At home, when I escape the two computers that sit on my desk
here at work, I slide into a more comfortable seat. It faces a
sight that would make any 13-year-old quivery inside. On an
8-foot-long table there are shortwave receivers, ham radio
transceivers, antenna tuners, power meters, and even more
mysterious black boxes that have names and functions too esoteric
to try to explain.
</P>
<P>
   About once a year, I take a break from writing about computers
and spend a few minutes talking to you about shortwave listening
and ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when I first proposed writing one of these columns
about an analog technology so old and basically unchanged that
Marconi would still feel at home sitting at that table with me, my
editors were aghast. No one cared about shortwave radio, they said.
But each time I've written about it, readers from all around the
country have responded with memories and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   My own theory is that there is a magic in the ghostly voices and
music that we hear directly from the source amongst the static. The
first question my friends have when I brag about talking via ham
radio to another operator in some far-off country is about what I
can do with ham radio that I can't do on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After all, anyone with a computer and $20 a month for an
Internet service provider can instantly exchange e-mails and even
voice messages with folks all over the world. And with ham radio _
unlike the good-buddy world of citizens band radio _ fairly
demanding tests are required to get a license from the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   So why go to all that trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I tell my friends. Some of them understand
immediately; others look at me as if I had confessed to a
fascination with collecting matchbook covers. You'll have to decide
for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The way the world is today, most of the information we get is
filtered.
</P>
<P>
   If you read newspapers, and I hope you do, the words you read
have been selected by a reporter and edited by several editors
before they reach your eyes. When you see and hear a big shot on
television, those words and seconds of video have been selected
based on an army of opinions and prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   With ham radio, I am able to talk directly to people in
countries that are in the news. Unlike with an e-mail, I can hear
the tone of voice, sometimes even the family dog barking in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   And even when I use my radio to simply listen to the commercial
broadcasts from these countries _ something you can do yourself, no
license required, with a $100 shortwave from Radio Shack or other
retail outlets _ I can linger for hours. I don't just hear
headlines on these foreign broadcast stations. I can hear the
music, hear the commentary (most of the stations have English
language services), hear the comedies, listen to the radio plays.
... I get a more complete picture than I would ever have from
newspapers or television alone.
</P>
<P>
   All I can do here, because space is limited, is tell you what to
do next, if any of this strikes a chord in your heart. If ham radio
interests you, there's an excellent Web site maintained by the
American Radio Relay League at www.arrl.org where you can get
licensing information free. And, if shortwave listening appeals to
you, look in your favorite bookstore for Passport to World Band
Radio. It has reviews of commercial radios and frequencies of
foreign radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Radio isn't the sort of hobby that will make you rich and
famous, but _ if you are wired just right inside _ it will enrich
your soul.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: How do the networks create the yellow
first-down marker that appears across the field during NFL games?
Is there some kind of object on both sides of the field for a
current or reflection to run between? Why don't the players ever
trip over the yellow marker? _ Tom N.
</P>
<P>
   A: The mysterious yellow line is generated in computerland; in
all, eight computers are used. The folks at Fox Sports said the 1st
&AMP; Ten system, which allows television viewers to see a first-down
line as the goal in a series of downs, does the work. A virtual
line begins with a central computer receiving input from several
cameras. Another computer translates the information into a
graphic. Yellow is used unless it is a team color or used in the
field palette. Yet another computer sends it on to be superimposed
on the program video. To synchronize the computerized first-down
line with the game's program feed, the 1st &AMP; Ten system delays
program video and audio a fixed number of frames.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a fifth-grader at Noble Elementary in Ohio. I have been
working on a project about your state. I need some help from your
readers. I would like them to send me picture postcards from your
area. The class is trying to collect as many postcards as possible.
I thank you for your help with this project. _ Harleigh Butler A:
OK, Texas, show this enterprising Buckeye what ``many postcards''
means. Send the youngster a Texas scene in care of Mrs. Joan
Ledwedge's Class, Noble Elementary School, 130 Minerva St., Tiffin,
OH 44883. I will let you know how well Texas stacks up in her
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a monastery in South Texas that allows
people to stay in their rooms and take a vow of silence during a
retreat. I stayed a few days years ago and want to get in touch
with them again. Is this too vague? _ Robin M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Best guess? The Corpus Christi Abbey located on Lake Corpus
Christi, near Mathis. A vow of silence is not required, but is
respected. This 97-acre site is ideal for a weekend (or more) of
reflection. The monks of Arkansas' Subiaco Monastery came to Texas
in 1927 to staff a new high school. Originally located in Corpus
Christi, the monastery moved to its present location after the
destructive 1970 Hurricane Celia. To book the Benedictine Retreat
Center for a group retreat or an individual, call (361) 547-9797 or

 &HT;    Mad magazine slips into CD-ROM realm
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A couple of years ago, I hailed the issuance on CD-ROM
of every page of every issue of National Geographic magazine. I
called it a milestone in software publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I found the publication of every National Geographic
foldout map only slightly less monumental.
</P>
<P>
   This year we have every page of every issue of Mad magazine. My,
how the publishing pendulum doth swing.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say, surely, that somewhere in the pages of all
the National Geographic es ever published, there is
something for everyone. It is not, however, safe to say that about
Mad magazine.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember, dimly, the days when I looked forward to the
appearance of each new issue, with trenchant and hilarious parodies
of current films and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   Television, for those of you whose parents weren't even born
then, was in its very infancy. It wasn't available in many areas
and even when it was, not many people had a set.
</P>
<P>
   It has probably been 40 years since I looked at a copy of Mad.
The old issues I so enjoyed seem pretty silly now. I don't even
understand much of the newer issues. This is only to be expected,
since in my view television humor, for instance, has been in a
steady decline since the halcyon days of Sid Caesar and Ernie
Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
   As with the National Geographic productions, the Mad magazine
compendium is achieved by scanning in the pages of each issue. Thus
the early ones are displayed on realistically yellowed paper and
faded colors, the later on bright white stock and rich color.
</P>
<P>
   One can also find a certain degree of fascination in the gradual
loosening of publishing taboos over the past 50 years. But of
course, one could find that in the complete page-by-page compendium
of every issue of Playboy, too _ and I suspect that is not far
away.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is reasonably simple but not without problems, at
least on my system. When I select a title within any of the
magazines, it appears in the form of illegible stripes of color.
After zooming in on the pages, they suddenly straighten out and
everything is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Page-turning is just slow enough to be mildly annoying.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember something about the old issues that you
particularly enjoyed, you can enter key words and find the issue in
which it appeared, and the CD-ROM on which it resides. There are
various little side features of mostly sophomoric humor not
directly taken from the magazine, but certainly within its spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This magnum opus of comic-book parody is brought to us on seven
CD-ROMs courtesy of Broderbund.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot in good conscience recommend it to everyone. If it has
been many years since you've seen Mad magazine, I would suggest you
invest in a current issue of it as a kind of test drive before you
lay out $70 for the whole ferschlugginer mess.

 &HT;    Ghosts, goblins can find fashion advice on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Servicehe Web can be downright spooky at times.
<TEXT>
But there are times when that's a good thing. If you and your
family are preparing for Halloween, you'll find almost everything
you need on the Web.
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious: costumes. While you can buy almost
any costume you can imagine, it's more fun (and costs less) to make
your own.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a good starting point for our ghostly tour is a Web
page called Mary's Halloween Costumes at cgi.cadvision
</P>
<P>
   .com/(tilde)burke/halloween
</P>
<P>
   /costumes.htm. Unlike many of the Halloween costume pages you'll
find, the costumes described here aren't for sale. Instead, you'll
get hints for doing it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Some are as traditional as the easy-to-make ghost costume _ all
you need is an old white sheet _ or, for avant garde ghosts, try
something more colorful: Others are as wild as dressing a child as
a bunch of grapes (think of a grape cluster made from balloons).
</P>
<P>
   Another site that offers help with homemade costumes is
sponsored by Crayola and is located at www.familyplay.com/advice
</P>
<P>
   /mccracken/d1012.adv.html. At this site, there's some general
advice on selecting the character and safety considerations. (If
you plan to have a vampire in your household, make sure you use
plenty of reflective tape and other bright accessories so that
automobile traffic can spot the vampire easily).
</P>
<P>
   That same page also offers links to information on planning
Halloween parties and for cooking Halloween treats.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at one last Halloween costume site before we move on
_ it's located at www.funfolly.com/h/ca01a.htm. This is a
commercial site, offering to sell costumes. The point of using this
site isn't necessarily to buy the costumes. Instead, you can use
the photographs as idea starters for the kind of costume you make
at home.
</P>
<P>
   For many kids and grown-ups, Halloween also is a time for
parties. As you would expect, there's help in party planning from
the Web, too. Halloween Games for Kids at www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /NapaValley/7458/hgames.htm may give you some ideas for the sort
of entertainment to offer. Truth is, some grown-ups might get a
kick out of these games, too. One game, for instance, involves
dividing partygoers into teams, giving them a roll of toilet paper
and assigning each team to make a mummy. The best mummy wins.
</P>
<P>
   Another page offering Halloween game advice is located at
www.gamekids.com
</P>
<P>
   /hallow3.html. You'll find dozens of games (and several recipes
for party food, too) scattered around on the various links from
this page.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the age of computer-generated party invitations,
you may need a few graphics to make your invitations look right. Or
you may have a personal Web page and be in desperate need of a
photo or drawing of a black cat, ghost or pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you're in luck. There are literally hundreds of Web pages
that offer graphics free for the downloading. One of these pages is
CSP Halloween Graphics at www.cyberspaceplace.com
</P>
<P>
   /halloweenbacks2.html. The only catch is that, if you use an
image on a Web page, you are asked to give credit to this site in
the form of a link.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's our tour of the haunted Web for this week. Just save
some time to get out in the world and get some Halloween candy
which can be much more satisfying than the eye candy you'll find on
the Web.

 &HT;    International radio spins a unique, charming web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm an analog guy in a digital world.
</P>
<P>
   At home, when I escape the two computers that sit on my desk
here at work, I slide into a more comfortable seat. It faces a
sight that would make any 13-year-old quivery inside. On an
8-foot-long table there are shortwave receivers, ham radio
transceivers, antenna tuners, power meters, and even more
mysterious black boxes that have names and functions too esoteric
to try to explain.
</P>
<P>
   About once a year, I take a break from writing about computers
and spend a few minutes talking to you about shortwave listening
and ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when I first proposed writing one of these columns
about an analog technology so old and basically unchanged that
Marconi would still feel at home sitting at that table with me, my
editors were aghast. No one cared about shortwave radio, they said.
But each time I've written about it, readers from all around the
country have responded with memories and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   My own theory is that there is a magic in the ghostly voices and
music that we hear directly from the source amongst the static. The
first question my friends have when I brag about talking via ham
radio to another operator in some far-off country is about what I
can do with ham radio that I can't do Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After all, anyone with a computer and $20 a month for an
Internet service provider can instantly exchange e-mails and even
voice messages with folks all over the world. And with ham radio _
unlike the good-buddy world of citizens band radio _ fairly
demanding tests are required to get a license from the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   So why go to all that trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I tell my friends. Some of them understand
immediately; others look at me as if I had confessed to a
fascination with collecting matchbook covers. You'll have to decide
for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The way the world is today, most of the information we get is
filtered.
</P>
<P>
   If you read newspapers, and I hope you do, the words you read
have been selected by a reporter and edited by several editors
before they reach your eyes. When you see and hear a big shot on
television, those words and seconds of video have been selected
based on an army of opinions and prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   With ham radio, I am able to talk directly to people in
countries that are in the news. Unlike with an e-mail, I can hear
the tone of voice, sometimes even the family dog barking in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   And even when I use my radio to simply listen to the commercial
broadcasts from these countries _ something you can do yourself, no
license required, with a $100 shortwave from Radio Shack or other
retail outlets _ I can linger for hours. I don't just hear
headlines on these foreign broadcast stations. I can hear the
music, hear the commentary (most of the stations have English
language services), hear the comedies, listen to the radio plays.
... I get a more complete picture than I would ever have from
newspapers or television alone.
</P>
<P>
   All I can do here, because space is limited, is tell you what to
do next, if any of this strikes a chord in your heart. If ham radio
interests you, there's an excellent Web site maintained by the
American Radio Relay League at www.arrl.org where you can get
licensing information free. And, if shortwave listening appeals to
you, look in your favorite bookstore for Passport to World Band
Radio. It has reviews of commercial radios and frequencies of
foreign radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Radio isn't the sort of hobby that will make you rich and
famous, but _ if you are wired just right inside _ it will enrich
your soul.

 &HT;    Cats, dogs, kids, lizards and roots, what more?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I can't completely empathize with what Lori St.
John had to worry about. Every morning in my house we have to check
to see what the cats spit up. For a day or two, St. John was hoping
not to have to tell her guest python, ``Now, spit up the cat.''
</P>
<P>
   That cat can release from the ceiling. The python is gone _
reclaimed by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Most every reader of the Waco Tribune-Herald felt the old
epidermis expand and contract at the front-page story about St.
John finding the 9-foot, one-eyed python in the parking lot of the
Bill Logue Juvenile Justice Center and carting it home.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about story placement. Right above the picture of St.
John holding the snake was a teaser to an inside story on how to
``keep your home from becoming a rodent haven.'' A python would do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one obvious problem for St. John was the event that
the python might classify her cat as a rodent.
</P>
<P>
   I can almost relate to this. I don't have any 9-foot pets
slithering around my house. I do recall a hairball nearly that
large.
</P>
<P>
   The average American house is an ecosystem _ many lives entwined
in eco-confines. We have the children. We have house plants. We
have the pets. We have what buggers the pets bring in, and others
uninvited.
</P>
<P>
   If you take away kids, who commonly come with pets, you dispatch
with most of the standard nuclear ecosystem. But you never live in
an eco-vacuum. When I was single, I had no children, no house
plants, no pets. But I did have things growing in my refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   As a bachelor, I thought I was insulated, apart from nature's
forces. Then I found that mice had been convening to nibble through
take-home packets of ketchup I'd been storing for the winter. We
are all somewhere on the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Having children and pets really accents the home-as-wilderness
experience. This ranges from Wild Kingdom rituals around the
refrigerator _ teen-agers hunt in packs _ to house cats waiting for
a june bug to be introduced to their bio-dome.
</P>
<P>
   I've written before about the imported-to-Waco Mediterranean
geckos that hang upside down on our windows, their see-through
bellies showing their last dinner. I've lobbied my wife to allow
them to hang out inside. They're known to control bugs like, for
instance, the ear mites that pester the cats.
</P>
<P>
   The other day (my wife's sworn vow to leave me also factored in)
I finally holstered my interest in giving geckos the run of the
house. I watched in dyspeptic horror as one of our cats chased down
a gecko and made like a python, digestive-wise. Maybe the window
screen is best for see-through lizards.
</P>
<P>
   And lest we assume that the extent of the home-sweet ecosystem
is that which walks and stalks afoot, the other day we faced up to
an invasion under our feet.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer where fire ants were burrowing all the way to the
China Sea for moisture, roots from the Arizona ash in front of our
house gradually and inexorably had strangled off our sewer line,
carving into the pipe like lifers in Shawshank Prison. After
repeated visits from the rooter industry, which may one day prove
more lucrative in Waco than giving allergy shots, we gave in and
gave up our front yard to professionals with a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   As the plumbers replaced our rusted line, they hauled out roots
big enough to serve with rump roast.
</P>
<P>
   I came home after the deed was done to find a gaping wound from
the house to the street, the roots flayed out from the incision. It
was like thorasic surgeons had left a patient unstitched on the
table. The next morning they ``closed up'' _ in O.R. terms _
leaving a scar the size of the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   But at least we could flush. Last time I checked.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, it's scary, all the life forms out
there trying to share inner domains. Wish I didn't have to think
about it.
</P>

 &HT;    Operating system upgrade will enhance multiple-user features
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Oct. 23, Apple will release the latest upgrade to
its Mac operating system, or OS.
</P>
<P>
   This latest upgrade, dubbed OS 9, represents evolutionary change
in Apple's venerable software that controls the look and feel of
all Macs.
</P>
<P>
   With OS 9, users will for the first time be able to create and
keep several individual configurations on one Mac. That is, two
people can share a computer but use desktops and configurations
customized to their specific tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer officially announced OS 9 on Tuesday, but reports
about the project, code-named Sonata, and its key features have
been proliferating across the Web for months. To check out the
latest reports, visit such sites as Apple Insider, MacIntouch and
Webintosh.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a summary of OS 9's biggest new features.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata's biggest change will be an expanded ability for Macs to
handle multiple users. With Sonata, several people will be able to
share a Mac and keep separate work environments. Those individual
working environments will be password-protected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one but you _ or a system administrator if
your Mac is on a network _ will be able to change your setup. Among
the things you'll be able to customize will be look, file access
and Internet configuration.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign onto a Mac configured for multiple users via a
written password or through voice recognition. Sonata will include
a new control panel called Voice Password Assistant.
</P>
<P>
   With Voice Password, you select a spoken code word, then say it
until the system understands your voice and the code word. Then a
user can sign onto a Mac by selecting his or her name and saying
the correct password.
</P>
<P>
   Another OS feature getting an overhaul is Apple's new Sherlock
search technology. Sherlock lets users search not only their hard
drive but the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata will add two new important searches to Sherlock. The
first is for people. Sherlock will search out via the Web telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses. What it finds will be listed on your
computer in the Sherlock window.
</P>
<P>
   The second new search is for e-commerce. Type the name of a
product into Sherlock. It will then search the Web for varying
prices and availability of the product, listing the results on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more changes coming with Sonata, many of which
are minor enhancements and bug fixes.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about this upgrade, check out Apple Insider at

 &HT;    Web pioneer follows the money
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Jim Clark is a bona fide ``been there, done that,
have the T-shirt'' member of the Silicon Valley boys club.
</P>
<P>
   First, he started Silicon Graphics, then hooked up with
University of Illinois wunderkind Marc Andreessen to found
Netscape. Clark took home a bundle after Netscape went public, then
moved on to Healtheon, the medical benefits information company
that was later acquired by Atlanta-based WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   So who better to give the keynote address to the Internet
insiders, players and pretenders at the Industry Standards'
NetReturns 2000 conference at the St. Regis Hotel? The 400-plus
attendees all turned their cell phones off and put down their
PalmPilots long enough to listen to Clark describe his personal and
extremely profitable trip down the fast lane of the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to the assembled industry players was simple: Follow
your gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every entrepreneur knows there's one thing you need to succeed
... follow a strong gut instinct that tells you what you know can
bring about a company that sells something people will want to
buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the so-called dot-com start-ups are fortunate
because they don't have what he calls the ``Barnes &AMP; Noble
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are encumbered by the current way of doing things,'' he
said. ``The great thing about a start-up is that you are not
encumbered. Your goal, of course, is to become encumbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clark's ventures have all been wildly successful,
he's not afraid to admit where things went wrong. Maybe it's OK to
admit where you've messed up when you have a cool billion to show
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Netscape, he said, ``After three months of talking
to Marc, I got it and I got it big,'' he said. Clark said
Netscape's ultimate failure was its focus on business customers:
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to convince newspapers and media companies and direct
marketers that the Web could be a vehicle for electronic commerce.
But it was a little early. And we threw away our portal
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark admits where he went astray with Healtheon. ``The biggest
market I could think of was health care,'' he said. ``We built the
world's best benefits enrollment system, but not a lot of people
wanted it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with wildly successful, if slightly flawed, Web ventures
behind him, Clark isn't about to call it a day. He is still
traveling the highways and byways of Silicon Valley with a new
venture called My CFO (www.mycfo.com).
</P>
<P>
   The venture is built upon Clark's own problems managing the
millions he has amassed as a Web pioneer. As it happens, Clark has
an awful lot of money scattered around in an awful lot of places,
and he's having just the darndest time trying to keep track of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Clark decided to go with his gut again and form a Web-based
company _ his fourth start-up. The year-old company is targeted at
an audience that Clark calls ``high-net-worth individuals with
complex financial lives.''
</P>
<P>
   My CFO's users are worth a million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A business wouldn't consider operating without a CFO,
controller and accountant. We're doing for the individual what
businesses have to do,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of investors and users of My CFO reads like a who's who
of Silicon Valley with a roster of old-money superstars including
Cisco Systems Chief Executive Officer John Chambers. And just for
being Jim Clark, he's already got backing from big-time venture
capitalists such as Kleiner Perkins and Excite At Home Chairman Tom
Jermoluk.
</P>
<P>
   Clark talked of how these high-income individuals have trouble
keeping their financial houses in order, especially when it comes
to money earned from what he termed ``wealth-generating events''
like an initial public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clark's enviable track record, My CFO seems to share
some of the flaws of Clark's other ventures. He's overlooked the
little people again and has underestimated the big ones. If you
have a million dollars, why can't you just hire your own
flesh-and-blood financial managers and pay for it with the cash
generated from all these ``wealth-generating events'' that seem to
happen to Silicon Valley millionaires almost daily?
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Clark's new venture was mixed. ``I think Clark needs
to volunteer at a soup kitchen,'' cracked one attendee milling
around in the lobby during a break. ``He's been down in the Valley
pricing Ferraris, oceanfront property and sports teams too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does hitting the video poker in South Carolina count as a
wealth-generating event?'' muttered one of the conference speakers.
``I don't understand what he's trying to do. It's not a Web site,
it's an intranet investment banking firm for Clark and his
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   My CFO became one of the hottest topics at the four-day
conference. It seems to have everything a turn-of-the-century Web
start-up should have: Big-time backers, super-rich users, and the
envy and resentment of every Web player who didn't think of it and
will never be rich enough to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the public relations people tried to put the best
spin on My CFO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, he's Jim Clark,'' said one of the conference organizers.
``He's done it all, and he's just having fun now. Why shouldn't
he?''
</P>
<P>
   He's just following his gut _ and following the money.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: How do the networks create the yellow
first-down marker that appears across the field during NFL games?
Is there some kind of object on both sides of the field for a
current or reflection to run between? Why don't the players ever
trip over the yellow marker? _ Tom N.
</P>
<P>
   A: The mysterious yellow line is generated in computerland; in
all, eight computers are used. The folks at Fox Sports said the 1st
&AMP; Ten system, which allows television viewers to see a first-down
line as the goal in a series of downs, does the work. A virtual
line begins with a central computer receiving input from several
cameras. Another computer translates the information into a
graphic. Yellow is used unless it is a team color or used in the
field palette. Yet another computer sends it on to be superimposed
on the program video. To synchronize the computerized first-down
line with the game's program feed, the 1st &AMP; Ten system delays
program video and audio a fixed number of frames.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a fifth-grader at Noble Elementary in Ohio. I have been
working on a project about your state. I need some help from your
readers. I would like them to send me picture postcards from your
area. The class is trying to collect as many postcards as possible.
I thank you for your help with this project. _ Harleigh Butler A:
OK, Texas, show this enterprising Buckeye what ``many postcards''
means. Send the youngster a Texas scene in care of Mrs. Joan
Ledwedge's Class, Noble Elementary School, 130 Minerva St., Tiffin,
OH 44883. I will let you know how well Texas stacks up in her
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a monastery in South Texas that allows
people to stay in their rooms and take a vow of silence during a
retreat. I stayed a few days years ago and want to get in touch
with them again. Is this too vague? _ Robin M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Best guess? The Corpus Christi Abbey located on Lake Corpus
Christi, near Mathis. A vow of silence is not required, but is
respected. This 97-acre site is ideal for a weekend (or more) of
reflection. The monks of Arkansas' Subiaco Monastery came to Texas
in 1927 to staff a new high school. Originally located in Corpus
Christi, the monastery moved to its present location after the
destructive 1970 Hurricane Celia. To book the Benedictine Retreat
Center for a group retreat or an individual, call (361) 547-9797 or

 &HT;    Plug/no play weekend frustrating experience
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks as if it may be time to lighten the load on
the old Pentium 166.
</P>
<P>
   I took it with me and looked into the maw of the circuit-board
abyss. I made it back relatively OK, but I'm not sure the P166 did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, headache-inducing, frustration-filled trip.
Somewhere along the way, the P166 took a near-fatal hit. In fact,
its brains are still a little scrambled and it gets a faraway look
in the monitor. It all started innocently enough.
</P>
<P>
   About a week after putting in the Intel NIC, or network
interface card, which I wrote about in the last column, weird
things began to happen, and my modem started acting goofy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a U.S. Robotics 56K Winmodem, your basic generic Windows
95 plug-and-play hardware. It developed the strange habit of
answering incoming phone calls after one ring with a fax tone. So,
on a Friday afternoon, I went out and bought a Diamond Supra
voice/fax modem for $60. Late Sunday night I was looking at a dead
computer and a Win 95 CD that wasn't even useful as a coaster
because it has a hole in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   I actually enjoy opening up my P166 _ a Toshiba Infinia _ to
tinker and install new hardware. Also, I hoped to rectify my
increasingly poor MindSpring connection. In the past few weeks, the
number of disconnects has jumped from none to frequent, and when it
does stay connected, the download speeds drop to less than 200
bytes!
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the modem wasn't the answer, and slow, overloaded ISP
servers quickly became the least of my problems. I popped the top
on the P166, swapped out the USR modem for the Supra, stuck in the
CD-ROM with the new modem's drivers and turned on the juice _
waiting for Win 95 to do that magic plug-and-play trick and
discover my new hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plug-and-play is really a wonderful thing (you Mac users
stop snickering). Win 95 finds your new piece of hardware, asks for
the drivers, copies them off your CD, restarts itself, and you're
plugged and you're playing.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't expect any surprises when I opened up the Properties
on my computer and looked in the device manager. Egads!
</P>
<P>
   There were several problems. The most confusing thing was having
two COM1 ports and an unnamed COM port along with the COM2 serial
port and the LPT1 printer parallel port. On top of that, the Intel
NIC had one of those alarming yellow exclamation points Win 95 uses
as a hardware conflict alert.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm no greenhorn in the device manager. I've done several
modem upgrades, and have added a TV tuner card, scanners, printers
and NICs.
</P>
<P>
   So I knew all about removing conflicting devices and letting the
Win 95 plug-and-play feature find them again to reinstall the
drivers. So I did ... to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I played plug-and-play for the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I got into the IRQs, DMA channels, reinstalling drivers,
removing devices, you name it. I was swapping cards around into
different PCI and ISA slots _ a trick I had used successfully in
the past. I was in the Setup program, using DOS commands I forgot
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I was doing a lot of plugging but no playing.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba was no help. Support wanted $35 to even let me ask a
question. Forget that. I already paid them $2,200 for the machine.
They weren't getting any more of my money.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I reached a point where trying to dial the modem
resulted in the famed Windows ``fatal exception'' and the blue
screen of death. Then it deteriorated to where I couldn't even boot
into Windows without the machine turning blue.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I decided I had to reformat the hard drive _ after a
three-hour timeout to back up my 8-gigabyte disk.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't throw in the towel until I ran the Windows set-up
program and got a message that a CAB file was corrupt before the
setup program terminated itself. I had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have managed to restore my computer to a shadow of
its former self. It works fine, except that I apparently have a
conflict with my USB serial bus. And I still have that gnarly
unnamed COM port.
</P>
<P>
   I have not yet figured out what the deal is. All I can figure is
that my motherboard _ built for the first-generation Pentium chips
_ wigged out from having too many devices installed. I suppose I
will take the P166 to a pro and see what's what.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if anyone needs a new modem, I have one for
sale cheap.

 &HT;    Online computer shopping rated
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As we ease into another holiday season, the analysts
are guessing that more and more people will be doing some of their
shopping from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But which sites are the easiest to use? Who has the best
customer service?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, a market research firm, looked at the best Web
sites for buying a computer. Gomez broke the results down into the
best sites for first-time buyers, bargain hunters and serious
shoppers. The results are at Gomez's Web site, www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com ranked first. Gomez said the Web site had the lowest
prices and offers 30-day toll-free customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com offers a strong variety of products, order tracking and
easy access to manufacturers with technical support links,
according to the review. The site was flagged for its ``spotty''
product descriptions and for the online delays for customer service
help.
</P>
<P>
   For bargain hunters, www.buy.com, www.computers4sure.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .onsale.com and www.outpost
</P>
<P>
   .com were the top-ranked sites.
</P>
<P>
   For first-time buyers, www.buy.com, www.pcmall.com,
www.outpost.com and necxdirect.necx.com rated high. First-time
buyers are defined as people interested in sites that are easy to
navigate and have accessible customer service.
</P>
<P>
   For ``serious shoppers,'' Gomez.com ranked www.cdw.com,
www.pcmall.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .buy.com and www.computers4sure.com highly.
</P>
<P>
   Serious shoppers are defined as those who tend to make purchases
for their business. The buyer is drawn to sites that offer the best
selection, detailed account information and a chance for volume
discounts or leasing options.

<P>
   FEMALE CEO FINDS IT'S A LONELY ROAD
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to be young, attractive, female and the head of a
Silicon Valley technology company?
</P>
<P>
   Kim Polese, chief executive of Marimba, talks about what it's
like to walk that fairly deserted street in the October issue of
Upside magazine. Upside is the print version of
www.upsidetoday.com, a Web magazine devoted to the technology
industry's personalities, companies and money.
</P>
<P>
   Polese was part of the product management group responsible for
spreading the word about Java, the programming language in which
many Internet applications are written. She left Sun Microsystems
and helped form Marimba, a company that builds and sells software
that allows software updates to be delivered to networked PCs.
After a good bit of hype, most of which focused on the novel idea
of a young, female CEO, the company went public in April _ but not
before a slight change in direction, from a ``push'' technology
firm to one that delivers software over the Internet and networks.
</P>
<P>
   The woman-as-CEO attention was important and valuable for a new
technology company, but when the company changed direction, Polese
took the heat. Magazine and newspaper stories questioned whether
the company was more hype than reality, and since the hype centered
on her gender, Upside questions whether the criticism was sexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sexism was in the mix,'' Polese said in the article,
``but my reaction when I saw that was not concern about sexism but
disappointment on behalf of my company, my co-founders and our
customers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction to the oddity and the novelty of a woman
CEO. But it didn't really bother me at the end of the day because I
knew we were going to execute, I knew we were going to be
successful, and I knew we were going to kick butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some urban legends aren't false after all
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard the one about the guy who kills himself trying to
get a can out of a soft drink machine? Unlike most so-called urban
legends, this one apparently is true.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 11 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association documents 15 cases of a soda machine falling on someone
trying to retrieve a can. Of those, 12 people were injured and
required hospitalization, and three were crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site devoted to urban legends, www.urbanlegends
</P>
<P>
   .com, looks at some of the more interesting, intriguing and
mostly false stories making the rounds.

 &HT;    Mad magazine slips into CD-ROM realm
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A couple of years ago, I hailed the issuance on CD-ROM
of every page of every issue of National Geographic magazine. I
called it a milestone in software publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I found the publication of every National Geographic
foldout map only slightly less monumental.
</P>
<P>
   This year we have every page of every issue of Mad magazine. My,
how the publishing pendulum doth swing.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say, surely, that somewhere in the pages of all
the National Geographic magazines ever published, there is
something for everyone. It is not, however, safe to say that about
Mad magazine.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember, dimly, the days when I looked forward to the
appearance of each new issue, with trenchant and hilarious parodies
of current films and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   Television, for those of you whose parents weren't even born
then, was in its very infancy. It wasn't available in many areas
and even when it was, not many people had a set.
</P>
<P>
   It has probably been 40 years since I looked at a copy of Mad.
The old issues I so enjoyed seem pretty silly now. I don't even
understand much of the newer issues. This is only to be expected,
since in my view television humor, for instance, has been in a
steady decline since the halcyon days of Sid Caesar and Ernie
Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
   As with the National Geographic productions, the Mad magazine
compendium is achieved by scanning in the pages of each issue. Thus
the early ones are displayed on realistically yellowed paper and
faded colors, the later on bright white stock and rich color.
</P>
<P>
   One can also find a certain degree of fascination in the gradual
loosening of publishing taboos over the past 50 years. But of
course, one could find that in the complete page-by-page compendium
of every issue of Playboy, too _ and I suspect that is not far
away.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is reasonably simple but not without problems, at
least on my system. When I select a title within any of the
magazines, it appears in the form of illegible stripes of color.
After zooming in on the pages, they suddenly straighten out and
everything is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Page-turning is just slow enough to be mildly annoying.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember something about the old issues that you
particularly enjoyed, you can enter key words and find the issue in
which it appeared, and the CD-ROM on which it resides. There are
various little side features of mostly sophomoric humor not
directly taken from the magazine, but certainly within its spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This magnum opus of comic-book parody is brought to us on seven
CD-ROMs courtesy of Broderbund.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot in good conscience recommend it to everyone. If it has
been many years since you've seen Mad magazine, I would suggest you
invest in a current issue of it as a kind of test drive before you
lay out $70 for the whole ferschlugginer mess.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Public school educators in Muscogee
County, Ga., had teacher aides touch up 2,300 copies of a social

judgeships must take up the cases that would be given to new
appointments _ if they were ever confirmed. The increased workloads
mean decisions on cases in those overloaded federal appellate
courts take more much time. Justice is delayed _ as much as three
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some of President Clinton's nominations to the federal bench
have taken even longer than two years to be confirmed or denied
confirmation by the Senate after hearings before the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the committee's recommendations. And some
of the president's nominations to fill a judgeship have come only
after more than two years of a vacancy. Justice is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan Citizens for Independent Courts, an offshoot of
The Century Foundation's Constitution Project headquartered in the
nation's capitol, blames both the president and the Senate
Judiciary Committee for the delays that have created this judicial
crisis. After a task force studied the situation, Citizens for
Independent Courts issued a report in September entitled ``Justice
Held Hostage: Politics and Selecting Federal Judges.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, judicial nominations have slowed down
considerably since President Carter's term in office. He took an
average of 240 days to nominate a federal judge; President Reagan
took 254 days; President Bush took 296 days; Clinton takes an
average of 315 days. Justice delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also points out that same tardiness from the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which must recommend confirmation or not, and
the Senate, which votes on the nomination. During the 96th Congress
(Carter was president), it took an average of 90 days to confirm or
deny a nomination. During the 100th Congress (Reagan), it took an
average of 144 days to confirm a nomination; during the 102nd
Congress (Bush), it took 138 days. But for the 105th Congress
(Clinton), it took an average of 201 days to confirm or deny a
nomination to the federal judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   From vacancy to nomination to confirmation in Carter's day took
an average of 330 days _ less than 11 months. In the last session
of Congress, it took Clinton and the Senate an average of 516 days
to fill a vacancy on the federal bench _ approximately 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the number of federal lawsuits filed in a 17-month
period. And there aren't sufficient numbers of federal judges to
handle the workload. It means delays. It means it is likely that
clerks, not judges, are doing a great deal of the work and
analyzing cases they don't have the experience or the legal
foundation to bring to bear.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting phenomenon came to light while the data was being
gathered and analyzed for the report: It takes the Senate nearly a
month longer to confirm female nominees than male nominees. And it
takes two months longer to confirm or deny judicial nominees who
belong to racial minorities. Those figures shouldn't surprise
anyone _ the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate itself are
very nearly ``white male only'' clubs. Is it any wonder then that
fewer than 20 percent of federal judges are women? And less than 17
percent are from minorities?
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a new litmus test working in the Senate. It
has nothing to do with judicial philosophy or judicial temperament;
it's based upon gender and race.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate rejected the nomination of Missouri
Supreme Court Judge Ronnie L. White to a federal district court in
his state. His credentials are impeccable. He was the first black
to be named to the Missouri high court. In June 1997, Clinton
nominated White to a federal judgeship. White waited over two years
to be denied. The vote was down party lines: 54 Republicans against
confirmation, 45 Democrats for confirmation. Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., led the opposition to White's confirmation, complaining that
law enforcement groups in Missouri were against White because he
dissented too often in capital punishment cases.
</P>
<P>
   If race wasn't the reason the Senate rejected White's
confirmation to the federal bench, and his dissent in capital
punishment cases was the reason, it is still the wrong reason _ the
incredibly wrong reason. We cannot have an independent judiciary if
senators let law enforcement groups determine how they will vote on
the confirmation of judges.
</P>
<P>
   If judges were to become the stooges of police departments, it
would be the end of freedom as we know it. In those countries where
the judiciary is the servant of the police or the military, a
dictatorship exists or is in the process of arising. Civil rights
and civil liberties are clubbed and shot down in the streets. And
die there.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope that the report and recommendations issued by the
Citizens for Independent Courts are read and thoughtfully
considered. We've had enough of making the federal judiciary a
political football, to be kicked around by senators and presidents.
</P>
<P>
   There are citizens waiting for some relief from the federal
courts, waiting for money owed to them, waiting for a corporation
to clean up its pollution, waiting to get the rights guaranteed to
them under the Constitution _ waiting for some sense of justice.
</P>
<P>
   There are many judicial nominees waiting to be confirmed or
denied. The Senate needs to pressure the Senate Judiciary Committee
to hold hearings and move on the nominations. The people are
waiting.

THE LOST ART OF HANDWRITING
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color graphic of handwriting) 
 By ALLISON CLARK 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With computers taking over more and more of our written
communication, perfect penmanship may be going the way of spoken
Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies such as e-mail, voice mail, pagers and cell phones
dominate the realm where pen and paper once ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Students are still practicing rote handwriting exercises in
elementary school, but they're learning to type on PCs at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We write a lot less by hand now,'' says Kate Gladstone,
director of the Annual American Handwriting Competition. ''The good
side of that is that we are less fatigued, so when we do write, we
can give a little more attention to that nominal handwriting we do.
But the bad side is that we get less practice. It's almost as if
our hands don't work when they start to write.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are the consequences of becoming a nation of illegibles?
Does it matter if our descenders dip too low or if our t's are
improperly tilted? Gladstone says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of computer information originates as writing _ phone
numbers, messages, faxes,'' she said. ''We write down the stuff
that has to be super quick, but it also has to be super accurate.
Try writing down a Web page address with a sloppy letter _ you miss
just one letter and you've lost the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Another side effect comes into play when children are learning
to write, Gladstone said. Youngsters learn in part by watching
their older siblings and parents form letters. When typing replaces
longhand in the home, that example is missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make an `o,' you start at 12 o'clock and go
counterclockwise. You don't start at 6 o'clock or 3 o'clock. But
you'll see kids doing that now,'' she said. ''It used to be
something you only saw in kids with a perception disability, or
from houses that were illiterate. Now teachers see it with every
kind of background, especially from the top socioeconomic classes
where they're more likely to have computers.''
</P>
<P>
   But extra attention to penmanship in the classroom, say
teachers, would come at the expense of other, perhaps more worthy,
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Compared to 15 years ago, handwriting is less emphasized,''
said Wanda Rentfrow, a curriculum resource teacher at Archer
Elementary outside Gainesville, Fla. ''As a parent and a teacher,
you have to pick your battles. Some children simply do not have the
physical ability to have really nice penmanship. Why cause them
that frustration when you could be teaching them how to read?''
</P>
<P>
   Good penmanship has always been founded on conformity, historian
Tamara Plakins Thornton says in her book, ''Handwriting in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the industrial age, the uniform strokes of the Palmer
method were the norm, and the concept of expressing individuality
through handwriting was unheard of. After all, no one was demanding
flexibility in subtraction or spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Even left-handedness was seen as wayward, associated with
''criminals, insane persons, imbeciles, epileptics, vagrants and
social failures of various sorts,'' as one 1913 magazine article
reported. Today's penmanship allows a slightly wider spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like when I was in school, where you sat up straight
with the paper at a certain angle and someone patrolled the aisles
to reposition you,'' said Nancye Childers, director of the
Gainesville, Fla., Country Day School, where children from
preschool to fifth grade learn the Zaner-Bloser method, a
combination print-script style.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the fifth-graders have very classically perfect
handwriting. But there is more individuality in their writing,''
Childers said. ''They practice writing in terms of fluency more
than the perfect form.''
</P>
<P>
   If standards have relaxed across the board, it may be out of
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time teachers can spend on handwriting is increasingly
less, but the demands are the same,'' Gladstone said. ''They may
not have time to do more than pass out a work sheet and collect it
and put a check on it if it's remotely acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequences may arise on standardized tests, where essay
portions are graded outside of the school by people unfamiliar with
the students' writing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the writing is legible, messy penmanship can detract
from how information is received on a subconscious level, Gladstone
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A more attractive paper gets a better grade,'' she said.
''Studies have shown that the same paper written in a different
hand can vary by almost a letter grade, and these are people who
have been told not to take handwriting into account,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone believes the problem is in how children are taught to
write.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never see writing on a shopping bag or logo that looks
like the script we teach kids. Yet we tell them that's how adults
write,'' she said. ''The basis of the handwriting we teach them _
the vertical line and the circle _ are the hardest shapes for a
person to make. A professional draftsperson needs tools to do this.
So of course we make 5-year-olds do it freehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the speed and neatness of typing, along with the cushy
spell-checking and editing functions of computers, the keyboard may
ultimately prove to be mightier than the pen.
</P>
<P>
   Take the science projects at Country Day, where fifth-grade
students were given the choice of writing or typing their papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single one of them came in typed,'' Childers said. ''The
students thought they looked more official.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Childers believes good penmanship has a place in a
point-and-click world. ''There's still a lot of writing that goes
on,'' she said. ''I don't think it will disappear completely _ I
hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we still have a sentimental attachment to script. What
else could account for all those handwriting fonts on word
processing programs? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The need for an organization like the United Nations was
recognized 200 years ago by Napoleon Bonaparte who said, ''If we
want peace, nations should avoid the pinpricks that precede
cannon-shots.'' In the half century since its establishment, The
United Nations has not always been able to forestall wars, but it
has defused a great number of incipient conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the purposes of our annual observance of United Nations
Day on October 24 is to look back at what this international
organization has accomplished over its lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dealing with disputes between nations, the United
Nations has played a valuable role in many other areas: setting up
the International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, and drafting
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and three sponsoring
treaties on the peaceful use of outer space and the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quiz to test your knowledge of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   1. Q. Was the United Nations the first organization of its type
in modern times?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The League of Nations, founded after World War I, was its
precursor. The League, however, was unable to prevent World War II
and was formally dissolved in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   2. Q. When was the United Nations founded?
</P>
<P>
   A. In April 1945 at the Conference on International Organization
which met in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   3. Q. Was this the first time the term was used?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. As early as 1941 the United States and Great Britain
signed the Atlantic Charter, which served notice that they would
set up a world organization when peace was restored. The following
year, 26 nations signed the Declaration of the United Nations in
Washington, D.C., the first use of the term. President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt coined the name to describe the countries fighting
the Axis powers in World War 11.
</P>
<P>
   4. Q. At the founding conference in San Francisco an American
diplomat who later became very controversial served as executive
secretary. Can you name him?
</P>
<P>
   A. Alger Hiss.
</P>
<P>
   5. Q. How many nations participated in the founding conference?
</P>
<P>
   A. 50. All 50 agreed to adopt the Charter. Poland, not present,
signed later, making 51.
</P>
<P>
   6. Q. What are the purposes of the United Nations?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Charter lists four major purposes: (1) to maintain
international peace and security; (2) to encourage friendly
relations among states based on the principle that all have equal
rights; (3) to promote international cooperation in solving social,
economic, and cultural problems; and (4) to serve as the agency
through which members can act to achieve these goals.
</P>
<P>
   7. Q. Can you name the major organs set up by the Charter?
</P>
<P>
   A. The General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and
Social Council, the International Court of Justice, the Trusteeship
Council, and the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   8. Q. The Secretariat handles all administrative matters and is
headed by its secretary general. The first three occupants of this
post all became quite well-known. Who were they?
</P>
<P>
   A. Trygve Lie of Norway, Dag Hammarsksjold of Sweden, and U
Thant of Burma.
</P>
<P>
   9. Q. Of the six major organs set up by the Charter, which has
the most clout?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Security Council was so designed. It is composed of five
permanent members _ China, France, Great Britain, Russia, and the
United States _ and 10 nonpermanent members elected by the General
Assembly for two-year terms. It can investigate disputes and
recommend means of settling them, including breaking off diplomatic
relations, economic sanctions, and collective military measures.
</P>
<P>
   10. Q. What is a significant weakness in the power of the
Security Council?
</P>
<P>
   A. Permanent members have the right to veto virtually any
decision, often blocking action. As a consequence, the General
Assembly's role has expanded to meet repeated challenges. In
emergencies where the Security Council fails to act, it can
recommend U.N. action, including use of armed force.
</P>
<P>
   11. Q. How is the General Assembly structured?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is a highly visible forum, with each nation, large or
small, having a single vote. A small island nation of 10,000
exercises an equal vote with 1-billion-strong China. While current
issues tend to grab public attention, the Assembly also supervises
activities of the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship
Council, and the specialized agencies.
</P>
<P>
   12. Q. What are some of the specialized agencies?
</P>
<P>
   A. Among the better known are the World Health Organization
(WHO), the International Labor Organization (ILO), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
   13. Q. What is UNICEF?
</P>
<P>
   A. The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund.
It helps children and adolescents worldwide, especially where the
need is greatest, in devastated areas and developing countries. For
its wide-ranging efforts, UNICEF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   14. Q. How is the United Nations secretary-general chosen?
</P>
<P>
   A. He is appointed by the General Assembly upon the
recommendation of the Security Council for a term of five years,
and he may be reelected. He is in charge of a group of civil
servants whose loyalty is expected to be to the world community at
large. His role as the embodiment of the UN as a whole gives him
considerable diplomatic influence.
</P>
<P>
   15. Q. Who is the current secretary-general?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kofi Annan of Ghana is the seventh to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
   16. Q. How has the composition of the United Nations changed
since its inception more than half a century ago?
</P>
<P>
   A. At the outset, Western nations predominated. Today, with a
constantly rising membership, the majority of nations are nonwhite
third-world countries.
</P>
<P>
   17. Q. How many members are there today?
</P>
<P>
   A. The membership, at 185, is edging up toward the 200 mark.
Since there are numerous Territories or Protectorates which may
eventually become states, the prospect of 200 may not be that far
off.
</P>
<P>
   18. Q. The World Almanac tells us that there are 192 independent
countries in the world. That means there are seven which have not
joined the United Nations. Who are they?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga, Tuvalu, Taiwan, Switzerland, and
Vatican City. Some small lands eschew membership expenses; Taiwan
incurs China's veto; and spunky little Switzerland, it seems, is
just not a joiner.
</P>
<P>
   19. Q. Can you name the official languages of the UN?
</P>
<P>
   A. Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   20. Q. Only one nation has ever withdrawn from the United
Nations. Can you name it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Indonesia withdrew, but rejoined less than two years later.
</P>
<P>
   21. Q. Where is the U.N. headquarters?
</P>
<P>
   A. In New York City on land donated in large part by John D.
Rockefeller, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   22. Q. What is the origin of the quote: ''Since wars begin in
the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of
peace must be constructed?''
</P>
<P>
   A. The constitution of UNESCO.

   OK, so it doesn't look much like a love nest. No candles, no
Persian rugs, not one Barry White CD: just a drab hospital room
equipped with a Barcalounger.
</P>
<P>
   But romance _ or at least its offspring, arousal _ is what it's
all about here at the Women's Sexual Health Clinic at the Boston
University School of Medicine. This room is a testing ground for
new generations of drugs to treat women who have lost their zest
for sex _ and therefore, suggest researchers at the center, for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the drug being tested is the one already proven
wildly successful for men: Viagra. The preliminary results of this
ongoing study reveal that Viagra significantly improves sexual
response in some women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinic director Jennifer Berman and a handful of other
researchers across the country are trying to answer a question that
has puzzled humanity since Ovid first suggested onions were
aphrodisiacs: What causes passion? And _ more important to the
pharmaceutical companies investing billions in search of the answer
_ can it be bottled?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Pfizer's Viagra last year ushered in a
season of sexual reawakening for millions of men. If clinical
trials are successful, Viagra will eventually be made available for
women, although Pfizer has yet to announce marketing plans. In the
meantime, numerous new drugs for enhancing sexual function _ for
both men and women _ are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The competition must come up with drugs that do what Viagra does
_ increase blood flow to sex organs _ but do it better. Or they
must come up with a blockbuster pharmaceutical that does what
Viagra definitely doesn't do _ create a desire for sex, not just
the ability to have it if you already want it.
</P>
<P>
   The story of scientific progress is often the story of
serendipity, and that is certainly true with the new breed of
designer sex drugs in the works. Just as sildenafil, the active
ingredient in Viagra, began its life as a treatment for angina, so
several of the new sex drugs originally had another use entirely _
until some smart person figured out that those frequent erections
being reported by test subjects weren't just the result of youth
and good health.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new treatments being tested are, like Viagra,
vasodilators. All strive for essentially the same end result of
increasing blood flow in the genitals. And it is thought that these
vessel dilators work in clitoral tissue just as they do in penile
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   A female version of Zonagen's Vasomax, which is trying to outdo
Viagra, is in the works. Testing of Vasofem, which may be
formulated as a vaginal suppository rather than a pill, began last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Apomorphine, another blood-vessel dilator, has been used for
years to treat tremor-causing Parkinson's disease. It turned out
that many male Parkinson's patients experienced an unexpected side
effect: improved erections. Tests on women began in July.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States 43 percent of women experience some form of
sexual dysfunction, according to a 1999 survey from the University
of Chicago, but they don't all have problems with their blood
vessels. Some have problems with their libidos. They'd rather be
doing something altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators like Viagra may restore physical function, but they
cannot give a woman a sex drive. That seems to be the job of
hormones. Specifically, the hormone we associate with the male sex
drive: testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Estratest, a pill from Solvay Pharmaceuticals that combines
estrogen and a testosterone derivative, has been on the market for
more than 30 years as an alternative to standard estrogen therapy.
But along with a decrease in hot flashes, many patients were
reporting an increase in energy and sexual enjoyment. The people at
Solvay knew a good thing when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling area of hormone research involves
work on PT-14, a peptide molecule derivative of a
melanocyte-stimulating hormone that's being investigated by Palatin
Technologies. In a study completed in May, PT-14 was given to 10
men with erectile dysfunction and helped nine of them. If
additional trials go well for men, testing on women should begin in
about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators require sexual desire to create an erection or
vaginal lubrication; testosterone seems to create sexual desire. A
guy on PT-14 can be thinking about his income tax returns and still
achieve a level of tumescence that a character in a gothic romance
novel would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we might soon have an arsenal of pharmaceuticals
available to treat sexual dysfunction begs a question: Do we need
to medicalize yet another fact of nature, that some people don't
have as strong a sex drive as others?
</P>
<P>
   Are we using medicine to shrink diversity in the range of human
behavior? And what will we lose if everyone's alike? If Henry James
had had a vigorous sex drive, would he have only written greeting
cards?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is ambivalence among researchers about using
medicine for social engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something that can be done to enhance a woman's
possibility for reaching her full sexual potential, I'm all for
it,'' says sex therapist Laura Berman, who runs the Women's Sexual
Health Clinic at Boston University with her sister Jennifer. ``That
said, with drugs for sexual dysfunction, women can use them as
Band-Aids and not resolve real issues in their lives _ like abusive
relationships or body-image problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman also sees a risk: that men and women _ but especially
women _ may begin to have unrealistic expectations of their own
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Other health specialists fervently disagree.
   ``This isn't about medicalizing _ it's about improving our
understanding of sexuality, particularly how men's and women's
sexuality differ,'' says Marianne Legato, director of the
Partnership for Women's Health at Columbia University in New York.
``We're on a quest for real information about female sexuality. For
the most part, sexuality has only been studied in men.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gruwell, a 43-year-old mother from Springfield, Ill., who
found that Estratest restored her libido after the removal of her
uterus and ovaries, says, ``A man gets Viagra and the news is all
over the world. But women have to fight tooth and nail for this
stuff. It aggravates me.''

 By JUDITH NEWMAN  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   OK, so it doesn't look much like a love nest. No candles, no
Persian rugs, not one Barry White CD: just a drab hospital room
equipped with a Barcalounger.
</P>
<P>
   But romance _ or at least its offspring, arousal _ is what it's
all about here at the Women's Sexual Health Clinic at the Boston
University School of Medicine. This room is a testing ground for
new generations of drugs to treat women who have lost their zest
for sex _ and therefore, suggest researchers at the center, for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the drug being tested is the one already proven
wildly successful for men: Viagra. The preliminary results of this
ongoing study reveal that Viagra significantly improves sexual
response in some women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinic director Jennifer Berman and a handful of other
researchers across the country are trying to answer a question that
has puzzled humanity since Ovid first suggested onions were
aphrodisiacs: What causes passion? And _ more important to the
pharmaceutical companies investing billions in search of the answer
_ can it be bottled?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Pfizer's Viagra last year ushered in a
season of sexual reawakening for millions of men. If clinical
trials are successful, Viagra will eventually be made available for
women, although Pfizer has yet to announce marketing plans. In the
meantime, numerous new drugs for enhancing sexual function _ for
both men and women _ are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The competition must come up with drugs that do what Viagra does
_ increase blood flow to sex organs _ but do it better. Or they
must come up with a blockbuster pharmaceutical that does what
Viagra definitely doesn't do _ create a desire for sex, not just
the ability to have it if you already want it.
</P>
<P>
   The story of scientific progress is often the story of
serendipity, and that is certainly true with the new breed of
designer sex drugs in the works. Just as sildenafil, the active
ingredient in Viagra, began its life as a treatment for angina, so
several of the new sex drugs originally had another use entirely _
until some smart person figured out that those frequent erections
being reported by test subjects weren't just the result of youth
and good health.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new treatments being tested are, like Viagra,
vasodilators. All strive for essentially the same end result of
increasing blood flow in the genitals. And it is thought that these
vessel dilators work in clitoral tissue just as they do in penile
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   A female version of Zonagen's Vasomax, which is trying to outdo
Viagra, is in the works. Testing of Vasofem, which may be
formulated as a vaginal suppository rather than a pill, began last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Apomorphine, another blood-vessel dilator, has been used for
years to treat tremor-causing Parkinson's disease. It turned out
that many male Parkinson's patients experienced an unexpected side
effect: improved erections. Tests on women began in July.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States 43 percent of women experience some form of
sexual dysfunction, according to a 1999 survey from the University
of Chicago, but they don't all have problems with their blood
vessels. Some have problems with their libidos. They'd rather be
doing something altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators like Viagra may restore physical function, but they
cannot give a woman a sex drive. That seems to be the job of
hormones. Specifically, the hormone we associate with the male sex
drive: testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Estratest, a pill from Solvay Pharmaceuticals that combines
estrogen and a testosterone derivative, has been on the market for
more than 30 years as an alternative to standard estrogen therapy.
But along with a decrease in hot flashes, many patients were
reporting an increase in energy and sexual enjoyment. The people at
Solvay knew a good thing when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling area of hormone research involves
work on PT-14, a peptide molecule derivative of a
melanocyte-stimulating hormone that's being investigated by Palatin
Technologies. In a study completed in May, PT-14 was given to 10
men with erectile dysfunction and helped nine of them. If
additional trials go well for men, testing on women should begin in
about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators require sexual desire to create an erection or
vaginal lubrication; testosterone seems to create sexual desire. A
guy on PT-14 can be thinking about his income tax returns and still
achieve a level of tumescence that a character in a gothic romance
novel would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we might soon have an arsenal of pharmaceuticals
available to treat sexual dysfunction begs a question: Do we need
to medicalize yet another fact of nature, that some people don't
have as strong a sex drive as others?
</P>
<P>
   Are we using medicine to shrink diversity in the range of human
behavior? And what will we lose if everyone's alike? If Henry James
had had a vigorous sex drive, would he have only written greeting
cards?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is ambivalence among researchers about using
medicine for social engineering.

 By JOSEPH D'AGNESE  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A handgun is remarkably simple to operate. You pick it up, point
it and squeeze the trigger. The gun does the rest of the job. The
hammer cocks and then crashes down on the firing pin, sparking a
tiny gunpowder explosion that expels the bullet from its cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, the process is child's play.
That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently handle guns, with deadly results. According
to the National Safety Council, 220 kids under the age of 14 died
in 1997 as a result of playing with guns.
</P>
<P>
   For other kids, the game of point and shoot has become an outlet
for personal rage. Ever since the shooting massacre at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., last spring left 14 students and one
teacher dead, many national and state legislators have confronted
gunmakers with a challenge: In a safety-conscious culture rife with
air bags and childproof medicine bottles, why can't someone design
a gun that kids can't operate?
</P>
<P>
   Congress is pressuring manufacturers to create safer guns,
childproof guns _ smart guns that fire only when an authorized user
pulls the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: A criminal grabs a cop's gun. A child finds Daddy's
weapon in the bedroom. Neither can shoot because they don't have
the specially designed ring, bracelet or pin that electronically or
magnetically unlocks the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon, seemingly lifted from the works of Ian Fleming,
won't fire unless the microchip sensor recognizes the user's
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such guns are not a futuristic fantasy. Make no mistake: The
technology is very much here and now and no more complicated than
popping open the garage door with a remote device.
</P>
<P>
   All engineers have to do is shrink the necessary circuitry to
fit into a gun _ and keep it working flawlessly. That's the tough
job.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, consider dropping your cell phone or
electronic notebook out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a laptop inside of your firearm,'' says
Jonathan Mossberg, vice president of 0.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the
world's largest maker of pump-action shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know firearms, there's an amazing amount of stresses
that go on when you pull a trigger,'' explains Mossberg, who is
developing a smart shotgun. ``It's like hitting something with a
sledgehammer every time you fire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the percussion, there's also smoke, heat and accumulated
residue of gun oil and gunpowder. Altogether, a gun is a most
inhospitable home for a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   But engineers are working around the problem. They're tucking
critical processors into insulated gun grips, away from the line of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a semiautomatic pistol, that space normally
houses a magazine clip full of bullets. So the chips must be
miniaturized to fit under a gun grip's thin decorative plate _ and
still be cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   As for power, one maker experimented with NiCad rechargeable
batteries but switched to 10-year lithiums, figuring customers
would balk charging their guns like electric shavers. No wonder one
engineer grumbles, ``Building a smart gun is a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer smart guns are probably still about two to four years
away _ plenty of time to work out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a few. Though several companies are rumored to be
working on the project, only a handful have gone public with their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Company of Connecticut, best known for the
Colt .45, has toiled for three years on a smart gun intended for
law enforcement, but not home use.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the foibles of making smart guns were on full display
when the company demonstrated its radio wristlet device. The weapon
jammed as a reporter looked on but subsequently fired a hundred
rounds flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not perfect yet,'' a company spokesman admits. ``When the
processors get hot, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks who may be the first to rely on silicon to defend
their lives _ cops and other law enforcement workers _ are watching
all of these developments closely. But there is still plenty of
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has really worked this out,'' says Magna-Trigger's Rick
Devoid, also a New Hampshire police officer and firearms
instructor. ``Nobody wants to rely on a battery. If a battery
fails, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Americans are accustomed to glitches in their everyday
electronics. When it comes to guns, however, inconsistent behavior
won't do; performance must be foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer shaping a gun of the future offers this disparity:
``If your computer doesn't let you log on, you're inconvenienced.
If your smart gun doesn't shoot when you need it, you're dead. If
it fires when it shouldn't, your child could be too.''

ALICE COOPER TEES OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's 51 and he can do what he wants, which means Alice Cooper
plays lots of golf and lots of loud rock music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially I don't have to do this,'' he said. ``I choose to
do it. When I'm off tour, by the time eight or nine months go by, I
want to be back on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper is finishing up the latest leg of what he called his
``Rock 'n' Roll Carnival Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing this show for two years now,'' he said.
``It's time to put it to bed. Next summer we'll start a whole new
show based on a new album that will be called `Brutal Planet.'
It'll be Alice's new-century address: very pessimistic, very
apocalyptic, very hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this current show is for the Alice fans. We do all the
hits plus some deep album cuts, gems that only the hard-core fans
will know.''
</P>
<P>
   From Washington last week, Cooper (born Vincent Furnier) talked
about his hometown, golf and Goth rock at the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You must have noticed that several performers are still doing
what you started almost 30 years ago _ Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie.
What do you think about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I admire anyone who goes out of their way to do a show. I may
not agree with everything they say or do, but at least they are
doing a show. Even Cher, I've heard, puts on a real extravaganza.
Now that's obviously not my kind of music, but you've got to
appreciate her making the effort to do a real production for her
audience.
</P>
<P>
   I think some of this is a backlash against the Seattle//slacker
stuff where bands were withdrawn and boring. Why be boring? Have
some fun. Rock shows should be like movies: I don't go to a movie
hoping it'll change my life. When I saw ``Jaws 3,'' it wasn't a
great movie, but it was worth the seven bucks to see the shark eat
the helicopter. It was a wonderful waste of time. ...
</P>
<P>
   I like to think I was responsible for knocking some barriers
down in the late '60s. Back then, you weren't allowed to say ``show
biz'' and ``rock'' in the same breath because rock was anti-show
biz. Everyone was like James Taylor, very into peace and love and
``I wanna change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Alice Cooper came around, and it scared everyone. It was
like Busby Berkeley meets ``A Clockwork Orange.'' There was
violence, but it was choreographed, a la ``West Side Story.'' I
don't like real violence, of course; this was theater, a show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You come from Detroit, like a lot of other hard-core rockers
and shockers: Iggy Pop, the MC5 and now the Insane Clown Posse, Kid
Rock and Eminem. How has your hometown influenced you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alice Cooper actually broke out of Detroit. We tried to get
started in L.A., but they hated us. The only bands who would take
us out on tour were the Doors and the Mothers of Invention. So we
moved back to Detroit, where they ate us up. We'd play gigs with
the Stooges and the MC5 and fit right in with that.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? In L.A., people go, ``Hmmm. Let's see, who's
playing tonight: Oh, Iggy and Alice.'' Then they go home from work,
change out of their nice work clothes into Levi's, a black T-shirt
and black boots and then drive to the show. In Detroit, they show
up straight from work in jeans and boots. And in Detroit you never
see anyone plugging their ears. In fact, they'll kill you for not
being loud enough.
</P>
<P>
   The other difference: Detroiters are viciously loyal. I'm still
a huge Lions and Tigers fan because I'm a dyed-in-the-wool
Detroiter. It has totally infected my music. I'll never be in a
band unless it has at least two guitars. I don't go for the
keyboard//horns thing. I want big, loud guitars. And that's pure
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have become an accomplished golfer. How did Alice find
golf?
</P>
<P>
   A: I started 17 years ago, when I stopped drinking. My wife says
I traded one bad habit for another, but I had to fill my time with
something. Time is the enemy for an alcoholic: You sit around
watching TV and you think, ``I'd love a beer.'' So for two years or
so, I played 36 holes a day. I got hooked and I got really good. I
was playing with pros every day. My handicap went from like 39 to 9
in one year. Now it's 3, and I can pretty much play 3 anywhere. ...
</P>
<P>
   I keep Alice and golf separate though. I never impose golf on
Alice. Or him on it.

THE CHOICE TO CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Tracy Allen glances back at the old one and shakes her
head at the sorry picture. Given to angry outbursts or the silent
treatment. Always finding somebody else to blame. Feeling miserable
and reveling in it.
</P>
<P>
   The old Tracy Allen drove people away. They never knew what to
expect from her. When her supervisors tempered a generally
favorable job evaluation with concerns about her angry outbursts,
Tracy faced the depths of her problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right then that this can't continue,'' Allen says. ``I
realized it was going to destroy my life. I realized I'd better do
something about this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Allen subsequently joined a support group for people disabled by
their anger. She began to talk to a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, ``I realize that life isn't peaches and cream. It
isn't fair. We can cross our arms and stick our lips out and become
angry and get into the blame game, or we can learn to deal with
what life's thrown at us. We have a choice to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Choices. Along with genes and neurochemicals and environmental
factors such as the way we were toilet-trained, they have a lot to
do with who we are. Science has long grappled with the question of
our makeup _ physical, emotional, mental. With how much of us is
fixed and how much of us is elastic.
</P>
<P>
   Every few weeks it seems another gene is found and identified,
our fate further sealed. The early-to-bed, early-to-rise gene. The
gene that determines how much trouble one is likely to have
quitting smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains much that under the right circumstances, given
effective guidance, driven by enough desire, can be altered. Panic
disorder, pessimistic thinking, depression and sexual dysfunctions
are notable examples, according to Martin Seligman, a University of
Pennsylvania psychology professor and author of the book What You
Can Change &AMP; What You Can't.
</P>
<P>
   Julienne Thomas, an Overland Park pastoral psychotherapist who
consults with patients mostly about their marital and family
difficulties, puts it this way: ``I wouldn't be in this business if
I didn't think it was absolutely possible to generate change.''
</P>
<P>
   Will to change
</P>
<P>
   Charles Welsh is also in the change business. He's the clinical
director for psychiatric services at Research Mental Health
Services. He knows people can remake parts of themselves. He's done
it. Remade himself at midlife from minister to graduate student to
psychologist. From one who smokes to one who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Change can happen, he'll tell you. But within certain parameters
and grounded in certain prerequisites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some features of personality are more changeable than others.
Some people are more willing to change than others. Some are more
interested than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Most amenable to change, he says, is ``the person who values
learning, change and growth ... who wants to find better ways to
live ... who wants to read a lot, learn a lot and associate with
others for positive causes.'' And, it should be noted, who can
relate to the old light-bulb joke: How many psychiatrists does it
take to change a light bulb? Just one, provided the bulb wants to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I address with people is, `Are you willing to
change?' If you're willing to consider other ways, if you're
willing to attempt it, to experiment _ and that requires an act of
commitment _ that can surmount what one would call deficits in
ability. Change takes place more as an act of will than as an act
of being able.''
</P>
<P>
   Journey man
</P>
<P>
   Ben Worth was on schedule and on target for the good life. He
was just waiting for the satisfaction to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   He'd followed the prescription. He'd racked up a law degree and
an MBA. He was a lawyer in general practice, working hard, working
Saturdays, bringing home lots of money. He'd purchased a big house
in Johnson County and filled it with lots of stuff. He'd been
married to the same woman since 1968. His daughter was on the
high-school tennis team.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the big emotional payoff. He kept waiting. Then
he started to wonder: Why didn't it feel better? He began looking
for answers in marriage counseling, in men's groups, in a search
for a spiritual life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I looked more deeply at things, I saw that this isn't what
I want to do with the rest of my life,'' he says. Gradually he left
law practice. He and his wife divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Worth says he made a 180-degree turn from Type A to ``laid back,
easygoing, spiritually oriented,'' from focused on work to focused
on people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very goal-oriented. Now I'd say I'm process-oriented. I
enjoy the journey now. I didn't before.''
</P>
<P>
   He married a woman on the same spiritual path and moved to
Raytown. Three years ago he established the American Buddhist
Center at Unity Temple on the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In his mission to remake his life, Worth, 53, sought out many
resources, such as counselors and support groups. Meditation was
one of the primary tools that he says helped him to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would remake themselves must have ``the courage to
look deep within, to shift your focus from the outer world and what
everyone else is telling you you should want and examine your
belief system in light of what works for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful strategy, Worth says, is ``associating with
like-minded people. Rather than continuing to sit around having a
drink with friends and bitching about life, you associate with
people who want to share the challenge of looking inward.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartography of character
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mayer has for years studied the structure of personality
and the interplay of thought and emotion. An associate professor of
psychology at the University of New Hampshire-Durham, Mayer has
concluded that our personality traits are pretty well entrenched.
But here's the good news: He says that ``almost any trait... can be
changed through learning and creating better mental models.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that learning for most people is rather flexible,'' he
says. ``We know we can change people through education.''
</P>
<P>
   Say, for example, that an introvert wants to become more
sociable at parties, but her mental model of her social environment
_ her mental map _ has always told her that people ignore her at
parties. By observing and learning from a morlly skilled
friend that when people at parties are engaged in conversation they
often appear to be ignoring other people, our introvert can, in
effect, redraw her mental map. She can, Mayer asserts, learn to see
her social interactions more objectively.
</P>
<P>
   Growth factor
</P>
<P>
   The event that launched Mary Jane Hart's journey was the death
in 1988 of her son, Tyler. It unleashed lots of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find out who I was and what I came here to do. I
felt I had to find some answers. I had grown up doing what
everybody told me to do, but I felt there was something not right
with that. I think I totally lost touch with myself and my views.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 she joined a group aimed at bolstering self-esteem. It
lead her to conclude that she had subjugated her needs to those of
her husband and six children, that she had learned subservience and
dependence and needed to unlearn them.
</P>
<P>
   She began to say no. She learned how to deal with the car
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you do that, you're defining who you are,'' the
Independence woman says.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at 54, she began working outside the home for the
first time in 25 years. In May she divorced her husband of 27
years.
</P>
<P>
   Change is scary, she says. And in her case, it involved a fear
of being rejected by people she loves. When she felt herself in the
grip of fear, she would ask herself: ``Where is this fear coming
from? What's it stopping me from reaching?''
</P>
<P>
   And she would remind herself of her counselor's constant
admonition: Growth is choosing to act in a different way in the
face of the same old feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Note to self
</P>
<P>
   When Tracy Allen decided to master her anger, she got a little
green notebook and kept it with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'd start getting angry or irritated, I would take
this notebook out. I'd start thinking, `What are my body signs?'
For me it was chest pounding and tension in the neck and shoulders.
I'd get fidgety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask myself questions like, `What's my mind talk?'
There were comments in my mind like, `I don't like you. Why can't
it be done right? I just want to give up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Allen, who lives in Overland Park, would jot down what she
wished for at that moment: Peace. Not to be judged. Respect.
Support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used that little green notebook. That was the beginning
stage to help me think about, `Why am I angry?' ''
</P>
<P>
   With help from Jerry Medol, who leads several anger-management
groups, Allen concluded that much of her hostility was a response
to her feeling abandoned as an adolescent by her mother, when her
mother became seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   A natural introvert, Allen, 37, says the notebook helped her
begin talking to people, telling them how she was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I've learned is ... you need to ask yourself,
`Is this a hill I want to die on?' Whenever you feel you have to
prove a point or get back at someone, you have to think if you want
to suffer the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the assist she got from her anger support group
and Medol, Allen says her faith in God reinforced her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me a lot about who I am and who he is. God loves me
and has a great plan for me. That doesn't mean God is going to let
everything good happen in my life. There's been a lot of good, but
there's been some not-so-good. But he still loves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen also developed an appreciation for what she has, and she
began to shed the cherished image of herself as a downtrodden,
miserable victim. That meant giving up the attention it had
garnered for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got too many people walking around as victims. You have
a choice to pick up and go on. I'm excited about my life, the
direction it's going. I'm not saying I have completely forgotten
what's taken place in my life, but I don't let my past dictate my
present or future.''

`CRAZY' FOR EACH OTHER: MELANIE GRIFFITH AND ANTONIO BANDERAS TRY
SOMETHING NEW

entertainment package.)

 (Ina color slide of Melanie Griffith in a scene from ``Crazy
in Alabama.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Listening to Melanie Griffith's distinctive little-girl voice,
it's easy to take her lightly.
 &HT;    She may be a 42-year-old veteran of a quarter-century in the
movie business, with a resume that includes an Oscar nomination as
Best Actress, four marriages and three children by three different
fathers.
 &HT;    But when she starts talking, she could say the nastiest things
and it would be, well, cute.
 &HT;    Don't be fooled.
 &HT;    ``Melanie Griffith breaks your heart,'' says actor Antonio
Banderas, her husband of two years. ``But I don't think people
should be fooled into thinking she is weak. She is one of the
strongest women I know. She is a survivor, and I've never seen her
more sure of herself.''
 &HT;    After two years of marriage, Griffith and Banderas are still
acting like googly-eyed newlyweds. Just ask Griffith about their
recent weekend getaway to Paris.
 &HT;    ``We made love six times in one day and then flew home,'' she
says with a giggle.
 &HT;    Recently, Griffith lost a significant amount of weight, and
Banderas congratulated her with a massive diamond.
 &HT;    ``He's so romantic,'' she says, giggling again. ``I can't say
enough about my man.''
 &HT;    But Banderas' best gift may be Hollywood's taking her seriously
as an actress. In his first stint behind the camera, the
39-year-old Banderas directed her in ``Crazy in Alabama,'' a new
comedy/drama about women's rights and racial tolerance that's being
hailed in advance reviews as her best work in years.
 &HT;    The film has brought the two to an early-morning breakfast at
New York's Regency Hotel. Both are casually dressed _ she in
skintight blue jeans and a white T-shirt, he in blue jeans, a red
T-shirt and a matching baseball cap turned backward. Both are
smoking cigarettes, despite a hotel staffer's reminded that it's a
no-smoking floor.
 &HT;    ``Please,'' Griffith purrs in that unique voice, ``it's the only
vice I have left.''
 &HT;    The rule is waived, and the two puff on.
 &HT;    It was Griffith who first came across ``Crazy in Alabama,'' Mark
Childress' novel about a glamorous, eccentric Alabaman who kills
her abusive husband, chops off his head and sticks it in a
Tupperware container. Then she takes off for Hollywood to pursue
her dream of television stardom.
 &HT;    She engaged the author to write a screenplay for Green Moon
Productions, the production company she and Banderas recently
floated, and convinced Banderas to make it his directorial debut.
 &HT;    Marriages have foundered over one partner directing the other,
but both deny any special strain on their relationship.
 &HT;    ``We had a great time,'' Banderas says. ``But it was difficult
for me in my head, because I know we actors are very insecure. We
are very sensitive. I didn't want to touch a nerve within her that
would hurt our personal relationship. So we put it all on the table
and talked about it.
 &HT;    ``By the time she got on the set, she was ready to go.''
 &HT;    ``The best part is that we had this time to spend together,''
Griffith adds. ``And as a director, he's so fun and cool. When he
would watch a take, everyone would be waiting to see how Antonio
reacted. If he liked your acting, he would throw his hands in the
air and scream, `Yes! Yes!' It was very passionate on the set.
 &HT;    ``The worst part is that he knows me too well,'' she says. ``He
would know if I wasn't giving him everything he wanted. He would
say, `Do it again.' But I didn't get upset. I did as I was told. We
didn't fight for one minute.''
 &HT;    Which, she adds, was a good thing.
 &HT;    ``Temper-wise we really are different,'' Griffith explains. ``I
react in a flash _ I'm very emotional. He's the type that holds it
in there and then explodes.''
 &HT;    Banderas can understand the actor's point of view because he's
been a star for more than a decade _ first in his native Spain,
where he won acclaim in Pedro Almodovar's ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown'' (1988) and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' (1990),
and then in an American career which peaked in 1998 with ``The Mask
of Zorro.''
 &HT;    ``I had a plan to become a huge movie star,'' he says candidly.
``I felt like I had this empty space just waiting to be filled up.
I craved the fame.''
 &HT;    Griffith laughs. Born into the movie industry _ her mother is
the actress Tippi Hedron, best known for Alfred Hitchcock's ``The
Birds'' (1963) _ she never saw Hollywood from the outside, as her
husband did. In fact, she actually set out to be a model, only to
find that what she thought was a modeling audition was actually
casting for the film ``Night Moves'' (1975). She got the part and
was on her way, more or less in spite of herself.
 &HT;    ``It's like my entire career beginning was this big mistake,''
she says. ``I wanted to act, but I didn't like all the attention
that goes with it.''
 &HT;    Despite her share of hit movies _ most notably her
Oscar-nominated role in ``Working Girl'' (1988) _ that attention
has focused primarily on her private life. At age 14 she fell in
love with 22-year-old Don Johnson on the set of her mother's movie
``The Harrad Experiment'' (1973). They married when she turned 18,
only to divorce a year later. Next she married actor Steven Bauer
at 24, had a son and got divorced. She later remarried Johnson, had
a daughter and got divorced again.
 &HT;    By comparison, Banderas' life has been uneventful, involving
only a single divorce.
 &HT;    Griffith's second marriage to Johnson, which she declines to
discuss, was on the skids when she and Banderas were cast together
in ``Two Much'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``We fell in love while shooting,'' Banderas recalls. ``It was
unavoidable. Our love was like a big fire.
 &HT;    ``At first it seemed like this type of love was an illusion,''
he says. ``We were filming a movie. It was movieland, but once the
film ended, I found out that it was real. I needed her and she
needed me.''
 &HT;    Griffith got a quick divorce, and almost immediately Banderas
proposed.
 &HT;    ``I get down on my hands and knees on the beach of North
Carolina where I was filming a movie,'' he says. ``And Melanie
started laughing. Can you believe it? I thought she'd be crying,
but she was giggling.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``And then Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin walk up to us on the
beach in the middle of the proposal,'' he adds. ``They were also in
town filming a movie. I'm like, `Get out of here! I'm proposing!'''
 &HT;    Today the two live in a Spanish-style mansion in Brentwood,
Calif., with their 2-year-old daughter Stella and Griffith's other
two children, 9-year-old Dakota and 13-year-old Alexander.
 &HT;    ``I think the key to this marriage surviving is that you have to
love the person you have in front of you first thing in the
morning,'' Banderas says. ``I love her during the worst moments.
Yes, there are moments when love disappears, but then you find
yourself falling in love with your own wife again.''
 &HT;    Chances are their family will be expanding soon _ Griffith says
they'd like to have another baby next year.
 &HT;    ``We're working all the time on getting pregnant,'' she says
with that sugar-sweet voice and a roll of her eyes. ``We're
practicing all the time to meet our goals for the millennium.''

CLOSING ENCOUNTERS? `THE X-FILES' BEGINS WHAT MAY BE ITS FINAL
SEASON 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in a
scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the biggest cliffhanger of all for ``The X-Files'': Will
the show return after this, its seventh year?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: David Duchovny, who as FBI Agent Fox
Mulder made paranoia sexy, most likely won't be back. As he entered
the final year of his contract on the show, the actor sued Fox
Television, alleging that it had deprived him of syndication
profits to which he was rightfully entitled.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's just as well, because Duchovny is clearly
running out of patience with the show, as witness his response to a
question about fans' most popular topic, the relationship between
Mulder and Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson).
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you how uninterested in that I am,'' he says.
``I could not make it clear enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the grand conspiracy that is the show's underlying
story?
</P>
<P>
   ``I care as little about that as I care about the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a done deal. But wait: Anderson is signed for
another year, and series creator Chris Carter admits that, while
he's writing this year as the show's final go-round, his mind could
still be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd consider anything,'' Carter says. ``I would have to feel
good about the kinds of stories we were telling. I know Rod Serling
was very upset when they turned `Twilight Zone' into an hour show
from a half-hour show _ he felt that it wasn't right for the
stories, and that's when he bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't feel right to me and it was just being done as a
commercial venture, I would be less interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Television president Doug Herzog sees no need to make an
immediate decision on an eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' Herzog says. ``Ultimately, if everybody
wants to do it, I'm sure we'll figure out a way to do it. If not,
it won't get done. We'll have to cross that bridge when we get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny, who also wrote and directed last season's acclaimed
episode ``The Unnatural,'' stresses that if he leaves it will be to
pursue other career paths, not because he feels, as some fans have
complained, that the show lost its edge last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe four or five shows that we did were some of
the best that we've ever done,'' the actor says. ``We did some
clunkers _ we always do. I mean, we have the kind of show that
reaches further, in terms of story and execution, than any other
show on TV. So when we succeed we're better than any show on
television, and when we fail we can be worse than a lot of pretty
bad shows on television.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't return, Duchovny adds, Anderson could certainly
carry on without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was indispensable at one point, I'm no longer
indispensable,'' he says with a shrug. ``Nobody is. It's a brand
name _ it's Crest, it's Menudo. Look at `NYPD Blue' _ I'd be an
idiot to sit here and say, `It's not going to go on without me.'''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, and then admits that it isn't that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want it to,'' he concedes. ``I mean, there would be
a part of me that would be sitting at home wishing fervently that
it would fail. You know, I feel like it's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Duchovny's eyes are on the big screen. Other than
the 1998 ``X-Files'' movie, his films _ ``Kalifornia'' (1993) and
``Playing God'' (1997) among them _ haven't done as well as his
television roles, which have also included a cross-dressing federal
agent on the cult favorite ``Twin Peaks'' and a turn as himself on
``The Larry Sanders'' show, where his flirting with Sanders caused
the host (Garry Shandling) to go into a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My television history is really cool,'' Duchovny says,
``because I did `The X-Files,' `Twin Peaks' and `The Larry Sanders
Show' _ those are three great TV shows.''
</P>
<P>
   His next attempt to conquer the big screen will be ``Return to
Me,'' a romantic comedy written by and starring comedian Bonnie
Hunt, with whom he appeared in the movie ``Beethoven'' (1992). The
film was made during this past summer's hiatus from ``The
X-Files,'' and Duchovny admits that it was sometimes hard to keep
them separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple times when Bonnie would say, `This is
encroaching on `X-Files' a little bit,''' he admits. ``I don't know
_ that character is so much a part of me, and the differences can
be subtle. Sometimes you lose track.''
</P>
<P>
   But making the film got him thinking about ``what it is I want
to do with the rest of my life,'' he says. ``I'll turn 40 next
August, so I think it's a really good time to ask that.''
</P>
<P>
   The path ``The X-Files'' will follow, Duchovny thinks, is that
blazed by ``Star Trek,'' whether the series ends after this season
or in a year or two. So fans shouldn't expect a final episode that
will tie up all the loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show's going to continue on in movie form,'' he says, ``so
I don't think that we'll have to have any kind of end _ you know,
we're not going to blow the place up or have it all be a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll just keep teasing them,'' he says. ``The
interesting thing about everybody's interest in the relationship
between Mulder and Scully is that they want some kind of resolution
with that. But look at our show _ each week, something happens to
Mulder and/or Scully that is completely life-changing, and yet we
come back the next week as if nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be just as well, the actor adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `We want resolution, we want closure,''' Duchovny
says. ``But when you give them answers, they go, `That's not as
exciting as not knowing. Why did you tell me?'''

NOT JUST ONE OF THE BOYS: HILARY SWANK AND `BOYS DON'T CRY' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Hilary Swank with Chloe Sevigny in a
scene from ``Boys Don't Cry.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Boys don't cry, perhaps, but Hilary Swank does.
 &HT;    The tragic story of Brandon Teena brings tears to the young
actress' eyes, just as her breakthrough performance as the doomed
Teena is doing to many of those who see the film ``Boys Don't
Cry.''
 &HT;    The $1.4 million, reality-based drama, written and directed by
Kimberly Peirce and starring Swank and Chloe Sevigny, is currently
in limited theatrical release. It's a controversial story, all the
more so because it happens to be true.
 &HT;    Teena was no ordinary young man, mostly because he was a she _ a
Nebraska woman named Teena Brandon who pretended to be a man. Teena
fell in love with a woman (Sevigny) in 1993 and befriended her
family and pals, but was ultimately raped and murdered by those
same friends when they discovered her secret.
 &HT;    ``This had to be the most challenging role I've ever done, and
it could be the most challenging role I'll ever get to play,'' says
Swank, previously best known for her roles in ``The Next Karate
Kid'' (1994) and ``Beverly Hills, 90210.'' ``Knock on wood, this
won't be the best role I ever play, because I'm only 25.
 &HT;    ``I had plenty of doubts,'' she admits. ``There was a lot to do.
It was really important that I pass as a boy. And, any time you
play a real person, you've got trepidations because you want to
honor that person's memory in a respectful way.
 &HT;    ``Also, just in general, you want to rise to the challenge of a
good role.''
 &HT;    Pulling a De Niro, Swank worked out, underwent vocal training to
deepen her voice and cut off her long hair. She also went out on
the town, venturing into bars and other public places dressed and
behaving like a male.
 &HT;    The experience fascinated the actress.
 &HT;    ``I learned a lot about myself and a lot about humanity,'' says
Swank _ who, sporting a skintight halter sweater and a skirt during
a conversation in the bar at New York's Rihga Royal Hotel, is
unmistakably a woman. ``There were fun times, when people saw me
and treated me like a young boy, and there were other times when
people couldn't figure out what I was, and those people made me
feel very uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``I found that very lonely,'' she says. ``People didn't want to
talk to me or even deal with me. Most of the bars I went to were
gay and lesbian bars, and there I was just another person. So I
found places where I fit in and places where I felt uncomfortable
and the people around me felt uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``I'm glad I did it, though,'' she concludes, ``because it was
important for me, in terms of playing the character, to understand
even just a little of what Brandon experienced.''
 &HT;    The transformation into a boy was fascinating, the actress
reports.
 &HT;    ``Once I saw myself with my hair cut and looking completely
different, I thought, `Wow, what a wonderful thing to be able to
do,''' she says. ``It amazed me that I could be such a chameleon,
that my face could look so different.
 &HT;    ``That's a very exciting thing for an actor to find out.''
 &HT;    Swank also believes she came to understand Teena.
 &HT;    ``He only lived 21 years, but in those 21 years his life was so
full,'' she says, her eyes welling up. ``He lived every moment so
fully.
 &HT;    ``He had the courage to follow his dream,'' she says, ``and
there's nobody in the whole world who doesn't have a dream. Anybody
can relate to that. We all have dreams. That's why everyone can
relate to the film.
 &HT;    ``Some people may not want to see a movie about a transgender
person or a gay character,'' Swank adds, ``but to me the film
transcends all of that. It transcends gender and gets to a deeper
issue. It's about something that happened in our society, and
hopefully the film will make people think about how and why it was
allowed to happen, and also how we can stop it from happening
again.''
 &HT;    Though the film has already garnered stellar reviews, some
people are taking writer/director Peirce to task for fictionalizing
elements of Teena's saga. Given the brouhaha over the fictional
elements historian Edmund Morris has introduced into his Ronald
Reagan biography, ``Dutch,'' a ``Boys Don't Cry'' backlash may have
been inevitable.
 &HT;    Swank appears to be caught a bit off-guard by the issue, but
quickly jumps to her director's defense
 &HT;    ``What can be hard about telling a true story as a movie is that
it has to be a movie,'' she says. ``Kim puts it so well, but a
movie has to hit dramatic arcs and you have to tell so much in two
hours ... Kim had to squash Brandon Teena's story together and tell
whatever she felt were the most important parts. You can't touch on
everything unless you want it to be some epic film.
 &HT;    ``My feeling is we tried to be very loyal to Brandon and his
story,'' she says. ``Ultimately, it's public domain _ if someone
wants to take it and, like Kim did, tell it as she felt it
happened, that's her right.
 &HT;    ``I feel she did a great job. She told a story in an hour and 40
minutes that really does justice to it.''
 &HT;    Swank discovered her own passion for telling stories through
acting at an early age. Born in Lincoln, Neb. _ not far from where
``Boys Don't Cry'' takes place _ and raised in the state of
Washington, Swank was 8 when a teacher asked her to write a skit
and perform it before her classmates.
 &HT;    ``I remember standing up there and something in me came to
life,'' she says, a smile crossing her face. ``It felt so good and
so exciting. I ran home and said, `Mom, I want to be an actress.'
 &HT;    ``She said, `That's fun. Go play.'''
 &HT;    Undaunted, Swank became a regular in school plays and local
repertory theater. Eventually her mother came around.
 &HT;    ``When I was 15,'' she recalls, ``my mom _ who was separated
from my father and at a crossroads in her own life _ said, `You're
really serious about this, aren't you? Do you want to go down to
Los Angeles and give it a try?'
 &HT;    ``My mom has been a huge supporter and a driving force in my
career.''
 &HT;    In 1994, the 20-year-old actress had her first experience with
Hollywood's star-making machine. Her performance in the title role
of ``The Next Karate Kid'' was expected to put her on the map _
until the film flopped.
 &HT;    ``Looking back, I can say I'm glad it didn't happen,'' she says.
``I don't know what choices I would have made, because I was so
young. I didn't know what kinds of movies I wanted to do, and I
might have gotten myself pigeonholed. Now I'm doing what I love.''
 &HT;    In other words, now Swank acts only when she feels compelled to
do so. In fact, since wrapping ``Boys Don't Cry'' nearly a year
ago, she hasn't worked. Instead, she's been reading scripts, taking
meetings, traveling and relaxing at home in Los Angeles with her
husband of two years, actor Chad Lowe.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully `Boys Don't Cry' will just give me more choices and
let me do the work I respond to,'' she says. ``Then, if I have a
short career, at least I did it doing work I'm proud of.''

DEAD MEN TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a dead guy starts talking, we tend to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Provided, of course, that we realize he's a dead guy.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Not if you've been going to the movies lately, where
dead guys have been doing a lot of talking. (Warning: If you
haven't seen ``Jakob the Liar'' or ``The Sixth Sense,'' you may not
want to read farther.)
</P>
<P>
   See if this sounds familiar:
</P>
<P>
   - In ``American Beauty,'' the disembodied voice of suburban
husband Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) guides us on a tour of his
life. Lester introduces himself by telling us: ``I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year I'll be dead. In a way, I'm dead already.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Lester is talking to us from beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   - In `the Liar,'' Robin Williams portrays a Jew who
entertains his fellow ghetto residents while awaiting the arrival
of Nazi troops who will take them to their deaths. Jakob narrates
the story; we don't realize until the end, when he's shot, that
he's been dead the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   - In ``The Sixth Sense,'' Bruce Willis plays a child
psychiatrist treating a boy plagued by the ghosts of people who
don't realize they're dead. In the end the shrink (and the
hoodwinked audience) realizes that he is himself one of those dead
people.
</P>
<P>
   - In ``Stir of Echoes'' the ghost of a murdered girl seeks
revenge on her killers by communicating first with a little boy and
later with the child's disbelieving father (Kevin Bacon).
</P>
<P>
   Right now we're experiencing a sudden pileup of loquacious
corpses, but the dead-man-talking is part of a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roman playwright Seneca used the device of a ghost seeking
revenge in his `Hercules Furens,' '' said Robert Wilson, professor
of English at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. ``And it has
been employed ever since. The most obvious example is Shakespeare's
`Hamlet.' Another Elizabethan play, Thomas Kidd's `The Spanish
Tragedy,' is also about a ghost seeking revenge. In that instance
the ghost is the play's narrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many religions and cultures around the globe entertain
the possibility that the recently deceased may not realize they're
no longer alive, it seems to be a fairly recent arrival in Western
literature.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more dramatic depictions of this circumstance was
Ambrose Bierce's 1891 short story ``An Occurrence at Owl Creek
Bridge.'' In that Civil War tale, a Southern spy is being hanged
from a bridge by Union troops. The rope snaps, he falls into the
stream below, escapes and makes his way to his home. Just as he
embraces his family, he finds himself once again dangling from a
rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much later a French director made it into a short film which
played on TV's `Twilight Zone' in 1962,'' notes John Tibbetts,
assistant professor of film at the University of Kansas. ``Lots of
baby boomers vividly recall that telecast.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years after Bierce, the horror author H.P.
Lovecraft wrote the short story ``The Outsider,'' which might be
viewed as a prototype for the setup of ``Sixth Sense.'' Tibbetts
says: ``It's a first-person narrative about a man who emerges from
an underground bunker and wanders around before realizing he's dead
and has left his own grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example is the film ``Jacob's Ladder'' (1990) in which a
Vietnam veteran (Tim Robbins) finds himself tormented by hellish
visions. At the end of the film we realize that Jacob was killed in
the war and never returned home. The entire experience has been
either a depiction of the afterlife or a hallucination experienced
at the moment of Jacob's death.
</P>
<P>
   In this century Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer-winning play ``Our
Town'' depicts a graveyard in which the village's dead continue to
dwell, observing the living and little by little drifting away from
their earthbound existences.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous example of a dead narrator is
screenwriter Joe Gillis, played by William Holden in 1950's
``Sunset Boulevard.'' That film begins with a shot of Joe's corpse
floating in a swimming pool. The dead man becomes the teller of the
tale, often delivering sardonic comments on what we're witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit I don't really see the advantage of that
approach,'' Tibbetts said. ``It's the one thing about `Sunset
Boulevard' that really bothers me. Same thing with `American
Beauty' _ it seems like a cop-out. To me it indicates there's flaw
in the whole first-person narrator thing. Either you're dead or
you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, though, views the device as an effective
attention-getter: ``Talk about speaking with authority ... the
character is dead and still talking. Who's not going to pay
attention to what he has to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agree, though, that there's no mystery as to why we're
all of a sudden getting so many movies about the chatty deceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's both millennial _ as 2000 approaches lots of people are
getting nervous _ and a result of the fact that the baby boomers,
who are running Hollywood, are in their 50s,'' Tibbetts said.
``More than half our lives are gone, and that's what it's all
about. We're aware of our own mortality and are trying to deal with
that fact in our popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies and TV shows about individuals whose intellects survive
death offer reassurance, Tibbetts said. ``Also, films like
`American Beauty' may reflect the idea that many of us feel like
we're walking ghosts. In this new technological age, we're not sure
what our identities are any more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the recurring themes of Renaissance culture is memento
mori, or `remember me,' '' said Wilson. ``When you see paintings of
the saints in their cells, there's usually a skull on the desk. The
idea is to remind us that you will become this. It plays into the
idea that death is the great leveler. Doesn't matter if you're a
king or a commoner.''

MAGIC, MEMORIES AND REGRETS: EDDIE FISHER LOOKS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy''le is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Eddie Fisher at a recent
book-signing.) 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When Eddie Fisher sees what's going on with Ricky Martin, pop
music's hottest heartthrob of the moment, he can relate. Back in
the 1950s, the same kind of spotlight was on him.
 &HT;    In 1951, for example, soon after he arrived at Fort Hood, Texas,
for basic training as a newly drafted private, Fisher turned out
with the other soldiers for his first mail call.
 &HT;    ``One guy got two letters, another got four,'' he recalls. ``I
got 4,500. I felt like I was almost the only person in the world _
everything was happening to me.''
 &HT;    Post-Sinatra and pre-Elvis, the Philadelphia-born singer's
records regularly topped the charts in the years immediately after
World War II. Today, however, he's best known for a series of
high-profile marriages _ to Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor and
Connie Stevens _ that produced four children, including Tricia
Leigh, Joely, Todd and ``Star Wars'' heroine Carrie Fisher.
 &HT;    In retrospect, Fisher says, his is a story of missed
opportunities and unnecessary failures.
 &HT;    ``I get an A+ in poor judgment,'' he says. ``I should have paid
a thousand percent more attention to my music. I don't know if it
was laziness or the fact that everything came so easily to me.''
 &HT;    Behind the headlines, the marital and extramarital relationships
and the drug addiction that straitjacketed him for nearly four
decades was a golden-throated lyric baritone who had waves of
bobby-soxers swooning at New York's Paramount Theater and in movie
houses across the country. Crooning what he calls ``bubble-gum
songs'' _ among them ``Dungaree Doll,'' ``Lady of Spain'' and ``Oh
My Papa'' _ he was Frank Sinatra's heir apparent. But it wasn't to
be.
 &HT;    ``I didn't pay much attention to my career and my singing,''
Fisher admits. ``It looks like I did if you listen to the work, but
I certainly paid more attention to women and drugs.''
 &HT;    Fisher's voice was his ticket out of a dysfunctional immigrant
family buffeted by the Depression. First singing at services in a
local synagogue, he moved on to Philadelphia radio programs and
then into New York ballrooms and Catskills resorts, all before he
was 20. Soon recordings and then television beckoned.
 &HT;    Those days are long gone for the 71-year-old singer, who lives
with his fourth wife, Betty Lin, in a sun-drenched, 18th-floor
aerie overlooking San Francisco Bay. He no longer performs live,
but is at work on a new CD due in 2000, and has recently published
a memoir, ``Been There, Done That'' (St. Martin's Press, 1999),
co-written by David Fisher, who's no relation.
 &HT;    A previous autobiography, ``Eddie: My Life, My Loves,'' appeared
in 1981. But Fisher admits that it wasn't the whole truth.
 &HT;    ``I wrote that first book scared,'' he says. ``I was still under
the influence of drugs _ I began stories and they never ended. What
I wrote was true, but it didn't tell the complete story.''
 &HT;    In the new book, which has provoked controversy for its
kiss-and-tell accounts of his amorous adventures, Fisher is
anything but evasive.
 &HT;    ``I was truthful to the nth degree,'' he says.
 &HT;    Affable yet a bit hesitant in some of his responses, the singer
makes no excuses for his checkered past. Even today, six years into
a ``devoted'' marriage to Lin, a former graphic artist and
restaurateur, and nearly a decade after ending his drug dependency,
he admits that he's ``not completely comfortable'' with himself.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I ever was or ever will be,'' he says. ``But I'm
as comfortable as I can be.''
 &HT;    Wearing dark glasses and a hearing aid, Fisher admits that he
can't claim to have considered himself strong in any area of his
life.
 &HT;    ``I guess you would call me weak,'' he says hesitantly. ``I just
wanted to be a nice guy. I didn't want to be tough _ I think I was
a gentle man. I just gave in. I could have been a lot stronger than
I was.''
 &HT;    If he could reverse anything in his life, he adds, it would be
his involvement with drugs, which began in April 1953 when Max
Jacobson, a well-known Manhattan doctor popular with the stars,
injected him with a ``vitamin cocktail'' that actually contained
methamphetamine.
 &HT;    ``At one point, I thought I was smart enough to ask him, `Max,
what's in there?''' he recalls. ``And he said, `If I told you,
would you know?'''
 &HT;    In time, Fisher became dependent on cocaine.
 &HT;    His 1955 marriage to singer/movie star Debbie Reynolds made them
America's reigning sweethearts for a while, but Fisher says that
even before his notorious involvement with Elizabeth Taylor the
marriage was in trouble.
 &HT;    The end began when their good friend, producer Mike Todd, was
killed in a 1958 plane crash. Fisher's consoling of Taylor, Todd's
widow, soon turned into a liaison and then marriage _ which, in
turn, was shattered by Taylor's affair with Richard Burton during
the making of ``Cleopatra'' (1963).
 &HT;    In Fisher's conversation, as in his book, Taylor emerges as the
most unforgettable, if elusive, person in his life.
 &HT;    ``It was magical,'' he says. ``She had great humor. She was mad
about me, as much as I was mad about her. But it's hard to define
our relationship _ it's an experience that I couldn't completely
put into words.''
 &HT;    Fisher's children have reacted angrily to the book, and while
he's clearly proud of them, plugging Joely's current tour as Sally
Bowles in ``Cabaret'' and showing off the song Tricia wrote for
him, he admits that he wasn't much of a father, even compared to
his own father, whom he calls ``a nasty, abusive man, a tyrant.
 &HT;    ``He was better than I was, much better,'' Fisher says. ``He
came home every night. I was never there. There's a bond, but it
isn't built on anything, except that they're my children and I see
them now and then _ mostly then.''
 &HT;    His fans' disillusionment over his romantic entanglements
hastened Fisher's career decline in the 1960s, but he blames
himself more than anyone else.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't smart enough to know that when you're on top, or near
the top, it's tougher to stay there than get there,'' he says. ``I
thought I was a kind of god. I was there and I was going to remain
there.
 &HT;    ``Sinatra, on the other hand, seemed like he wasn't paying
attention to his career, but he built a repertoire unlike anyone
else's,'' Fisher adds. ``And he worked at his singing. No one ever
told me to do so. No one dared, because I was doing so well _ when
everything you put out is a hit, they don't want to interfere with
success.
 &HT;    ``But they should have,'' he says. ``The songs I made into hits
were not songs that belong in a repertoire for life. Anything I
would have recorded in that period would have been a hit.''
 &HT;    Many what-ifs swirl around Fisher's story _ what if he hadn't
met Max Jacobson? What if Mike Todd had lived? What if Fisher
hadn't picked up the ``Cleopatra'' script from a pile and suggested
to Taylor that she consider playing the title role?
 &HT;    Fisher generally isn't inclined to speculate, but he does wonder
how he might have fared if he'd come along today, growing up in a
world of music videos, strong multicultural sounds and new
directions in pop?
 &HT;    ``I wasn't as handsome as Ricky Nelson or Ricky Martin,'' he
muses. ``Maybe Ricky Nelson. But good talent finds a way. I don't
know to what level I would have risen.
 &HT;    ``But I think I would have made it at any time. It would have
worked out.''

 (Includes a color slide of Melanie Griffith in a scene from ``Crazy
in Alabama.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Listening to Melanie Griffith's distinctive little-girl voice,
it's easy to take her lightly.
 &HT;    She may be a 42-year-old veteran of a quarter-century in the
movie business, with a resume that includes an Oscar nomination as
Best Actress, four marriages and three children by three different
fathers.
 &HT;    But when she starts talking, she could say the nastiest things
and it would be, well, cute.
 &HT;    Don't be fooled.
 &HT;    ``Melanie Griffith breaks your heart,'' says actor Antonio
Banderas, her husband of two years. ``But I don't think people
should be fooled into thinking she is weak. She is one of the
strongest women I know. She is a survivor, and I've never seen her
more sure of herself.''
 &HT;    After two years of marriage, Griffith and Banderas are still
acting like googly-eyed newlyweds. Just ask Griffith about their
recent weekend getaway to Paris.
 &HT;    ``We made love six times in one day and then flew home,'' she
says with a giggle.
 &HT;    Recently, Griffith lost a significant amount of weight, and
Banderas congratulated her with a massive diamond.
 &HT;    ``He's so romantic,'' she says, giggling again. ``I can't say
enough about my man.''
 &HT;    But Banderas' best gift may be Hollywood's taking her seriously
as an actress. In his first stint behind the camera, the
39-year-old Banderas directed her in ``Crazy in Alabama,'' a new
comedy/drama about women's rights and racial tolerance that's being
hailed in advance reviews as her best work in years.
 &HT;    The film has brought the two to an early-morning breakfast at
New York's Regency Hotel. Both are casually dressed _ she in
skintight blue jeans and a white T-shirt, he in blue jeans, a red
T-shirt and a matching baseball cap turned backward. Both are
smoking cigarettes, despite a hotel staffer's reminded that it's a
no-smoking floor.
 &HT;    ``Please,'' Griffith purrs in that unique voice, ``it's the only
vice I have left.''
 &HT;    The rule is waived, and the two puff on.
 &HT;    It was Griffith who first came across ``Crazy in Alabama,'' Mark
Childress' novel about a glamorous, eccentric Alabaman who kills
her abusive husband, chops off his head and sticks it in a
Tupperware container. Then she takes off for Hollywood to pursue
her dream of television stardom.
 &HT;    She engaged the author to write a screenplay for Green Moon
Productions, the production company she and Banderas recently
floated, and convinced Banderas to make it his directorial debut.
 &HT;    Marriages have foundered over one partner directing the other,
but both deny any special strain on their relationship.
 &HT;    ``We had a great time,'' Banderas says. ``But it was difficult
for me in my head, because I know we actors are very insecure. We
are very sensitive. I didn't want to touch a nerve within her that
would hurt our personal relationship. So we put it all on the table
and talked about it.
 &HT;    ``By the time she got on the set, she was ready to go.''
 &HT;    ``The best part is that we had this time to spend together,''
Griffith adds. ``And as a director, he's so fun and cool. When he
would watch a take, everyone would be waiting to see how Antonio
reacted. If he liked your acting, he would throw his hands in the
air and scream, `Yes! Yes!' It was very passionate on the set.
 &HT;    ``The worst part is that he knows me too well,'' she says. ``He
would know if I wasn't giving him everything he wanted. He would
say, `Do it again.' But I didn't get upset. I did as I was told. We
didn't fight for one minute.''
 &HT;    Which, she adds, was a good thing.
 &HT;    ``Temper-wise we really are different,'' Griffith explains. ``I
react in a flash _ I'm very emotional. He's the type that holds it
in there and then explodes.''
 &HT;    Banderas can understand the actor's point of view because he's
been a star for more than a decade _ first in his native Spain,
where he won acclaim in Pedro Almodovar's ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown'' (1988) and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' (1990),
and then in an American career which peaked in 1998 with ``The Mask
of Zorro.''
 &HT;    ``I had a plan to become a huge movie star,'' he says candidly.
``I felt like I had this empty space just waiting to be filled up.
I craved the fame.''
 &HT;    Griffith laughs. Born into the movie industry _ her mother is
the actress Tippi Hedron, best known for Alfred Hitchcock's ``The
Birds'' (1963) _ she never saw Hollywood from the outside, as her
husband did. In fact, she actually set out to be a model, only to
find that what she thought was a modeling audition was actually
casting for the film ``Night Moves'' (1975). She got the part and
was on her way, more or less in spite of herself.
 &HT;    ``It's like my entire career beginning was this big mistake,''
she says. ``I wanted to act, but I didn't like all the attention
that goes with it.''
 &HT;    Despite her share of hit movies _ most notably her
Oscar-nominated role in ``Working Girl'' (1988) _ that attention
has focused primarily on her private life. At age 14 she fell in
love with 22-year-old Don Johnson on the set of her mother's movie
``The Harrad Experiment'' (1973). They married when she turned 18,
only to divorce a year later. Next she married actor Steven Bauer
at 24, had a son and got divorced. She later remarried Johnson, had
a daughter and got divorced again.
 &HT;    By con, Banderas' life has been uneventful, involving
only a single divorce.
 &HT;    Griffith's second marriage to Johnson, which she declines to
discuss, was on the skids when she and Banderas were cast together
in ``Two Much'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``We fell in love while shooting,'' Banderas recalls. ``It was
unavoidable. Our love was like a big fire.
 &HT;    ``At first it seemed like this type of love was an illusion,''
he says. ``We were filming a movie. It was movieland, but once the
film ended, I found out that it was real. I needed her and she
needed me.''
 &HT;    Griffith got a quick divorce, and almost immediately Banderas
proposed.
 &HT;    ``I get down on my hands and knees on the beach of North
Carolina where I was filming a movie,'' he says. ``And Melanie
started laughing. Can you believe it? I thought she'd be crying,
but she was giggling.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``And then Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin walk up to us on the
beach in the middle of the proposal,'' he adds. ``They were also in
town filming a movie. I'm like, `Get out of here! I'm proposing!'''
 &HT;    Today the two live in a Spanish-style mansion in Brentwood,
Calif., with their 2-year-old daughter Stella and Griffith's other
two children, 9-year-old Dakota and 13-year-old Alexander.
 &HT;    ``I think the key to this marriage surviving is that you have to
love the person you have in front of you first thing in the
morning,'' Banderas says. ``I love her during the worst moments.
Yes, there are moments when love disappears, but then you find
yourself falling in love with your own wife again.''
 &HT;    Chances are their family will be expanding soon _ Griffith says
they'd like to have another baby next year.
 &HT;    ``We're working all the time on getting pregnant,'' she says
with that sugar-sweet voice and a roll of her eyes. ``We're
practicing all the time to meet our goals for the millennium.''

CLOSING ENCOUNTERS? `THE X-FILES' BEGINS WHAT MAY BE ITS FINAL
SEASON

 (Includes a color slide of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in a
scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the biggest cliffhanger of all for ``The X-Files'': Will
the show return after this, its seventh year?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: David Duchovny, who as FBI Agent Fox
Mulder made paranoia sexy, most likely won't be back. As he entered
the final year of his contract on the show, the actor sued Fox
Television, alleging that it had deprived him of syndication
profits to which he was rightfully entitled.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's just as well, because Duchovny is clearly
running out of patience with the show, as witness his response to a
question about fans' most popular topic, the relationship between
Mulder and Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson).
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you how uninterested in that I am,'' he says.
``I could not make it clear enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the grand conspiracy that is the show's underlying
story?
</P>
<P>
   ``I care as little about that as I care about the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a done deal. But wait: Anderson is signed for
another year, and series creator Chris Carter admits that, while
he's writing this year as the show's final go-round, his mind could
still be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd consider anything,'' Carter says. ``I would have to feel
good about the kinds of stories we were telling. I know Rod Serling
was very upset when they turned `Twilight Zone' into an hour show
from a half-hour show _ he felt that it wasn't right for the
stories, and that's when he bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't feel right to me and it was just being done as a
commercial venture, I would be less interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Television president Doug Herzog sees no need to make an
immediate decision on an eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' Herzog says. ``Ultimately, if everybody
wants to do it, I'm sure we'll figure out a way to do it. If not,
it won't get done. We'll have to cross that bridge when we get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny, who also wrote and directed last season's acclaimed
episode ``The Unnatural,'' stresses that if he leaves it will be to
pursue other career paths, not because he feels, as some fans have
complained, that the show lost its edge last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe four or five shows that we did were some of
the best that we've ever done,'' the actor says. ``We did some
clunkers _ we always do. I mean, we have the kind of show that
reaches further, in terms of story and execution, than any other
show on TV. So when we succeed we're better than any show on
television, and when we fail we can be worse than a lot of pretty
bad shows on television.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't return, Duchovny adds, Anderson could certainly
carry on without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was indispensable at one point, I'm no longer
indispensable,'' he says with a shrug. ``Nobody is. It's a brand
name _ it's Crest, it's Menudo. Look at `NYPD Blue' _ I'd be an
idiot to sit here and say, `It's not going to go on without me.'''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, and then admits that it isn't that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want it to,'' he concedes. ``I mean, there would be
a part of me that would be sitting at home wishing fervently that
it would fail. You know, I feel like it's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Duchovny's eyes are on the big screen. Other than
the 1998 ``X-Files'' movie, his films _ ``Kalifornia'' (1993) and
``Playing God'' (1997) among them _ haven't done as well as his
television roles, which have also included a cross-dressing federal
agent on the cult favorite ``Twin Peaks'' and a turn as himself on
``The Larry Sanders'' show, where his flirting with Sanders caused
the host (Garry Shandling) to go into a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My television history is really cool,'' Duchovny says,
``because I did `The X-Files,' `Twin Peaks' and `The Larry Sanders
Show' _ those are three great TV shows.''
</P>
<P>
   His next attempt to conquer the big screen will be ``Return to
Me,'' a romantic comedy written by and starring comedian Bonnie
Hunt, with whom he appeared in the movie ``Beethoven'' (1992). The
film was made during this past summer's hiatus from ``The
X-Files,'' and Duchovny admits that it was sometimes hard to keep
them separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple times when Bonnie would say, `This is
encroaching on `X-Files' a little bit,''' he admits. ``I don't know
_ that character is so much a part of me, and the differences can
be subtle. Sometimes you lose track.''
</P>
<P>
   But making the film got him thinking about ``what it is I want
to do with the rest of my life,'' he says. ``I'll turn 40 next
August, so I think it's a really good time to ask that.''
</P>
<P>
   The path ``The X-Files'' will follow, Duchovny thinks, is that
blazed by ``Star Trek,'' whether the series ends after this season
or in a year or two. So fans shouldn't expect a final episode that
will tie up all the loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show's going to continue on in movie form,'' he says, ``so
I don't think that we'll have to have any kind of end _ you know,
we're not going to blow the place up or have it all be a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll just keep teasing them,'' he says. ``The
interesting thing about everybody's interest in the relationship
between Mulder and Scully is that they want some kind of resolution
with that. But look at our show _ each week, something happens to
Mulder and/or Scully that is completely life-changing, and yet we
come back the next week as if nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be just as well, the actor adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `We want resolution, we want closure,''' Duchovny
says. ``But when you give them answers, they go, `That's not as
exciting as not knowing. Why did you tell me?'''

NOT JUST ONE OF THE BOYS: HILARY SWANK AND `BOYS DON'T CRY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Hilary Swank with Chloe Sevigny in a
scene from ``Boys Don't Cry.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Boys don't cry, perhaps, but Hilary Swank does.
 &HT;    The tragic story of Brandon Teena brings tears to the young
actress' eyes, just as her breakthrough performance as the doomed
Teena is doing to many of those who see the film ``Boys Don't
Cry.''
 &HT;    The $1.4 million, reality-based drama, written and directed by
Kimberly Peirce and starring Swank and Chloe Sevigny, is currently
in limited theatrical release. It's a controversial story, all the
more so because it happens to be true.
 &HT;    Teena was no ordinary young man, mostly because he was a she _ a
Nebraska woman named Teena Brandon who pretended to be a man. Teena
fell in love with a woman (Sevigny) in 1993 and befriended her
family and pals, but was ultimately raped and murdered by those
same friends when they discovered her secret.
 &HT;    ``This had to be the most challenging role I've ever done, and
it could be the most challenging role I'll ever get to play,'' says
Swank, previously best known for her roles in ``The Next Karate
Kid'' (1994) and ``Beverly Hills, 90210.'' ``Knock on wood, this
won't be the best role I ever play, because I'm only 25.
 &HT;    ``I had plenty of doubts,'' she admits. ``There was a lot to do.
It was really important that I pass as a boy. And, any time you
play a real person, you've got trepidations because you want to
honor that person's memory in a respectful way.
 &HT;    ``Also, just in general, you want to rise to the challenge of a
good role.''
 &HT;    Pulling a De Niro, Swank worked out, underwent vocal training to
deepen her voice and cut off her long hair. She also went out on
the town, venturing into bars and other public places dressed and
behaving like a male.
 &HT;    The experience fascinated the actress.
 &HT;    ``I learned a lot about myself and a lot about humanity,'' says
Swank _ who, sporting a skintight halter sweater and a skirt during
a conversation in the bar at New York's Rihga Royal Hotel, is
unmistakably a woman. ``There were fun times, when people saw me
and treated me like a young boy, and there were other times when
people couldn't figure out what I was, and those people made me
feel very uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``I found that very lonely,'' she says. ``People didn't want to
talk to me or even deal with me. Most of the bars I went to were
gay and lesbian bars, and there I was just another person. So I
found places where I fit in and places where I felt uncomfortable
and the people around me felt uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``I'm glad I did it, though,'' she concludes, ``because it was
important for me, in terms of playing the character, to understand
even just a little of what Brandon experienced.''
 &HT;    The transformation into a boy was fascinating, the actress
reports.
 &HT;    ``Once I saw myself with my hair cut and looking completely
different, I thought, `Wow, what a wonderful thing to be able to
do,''' she says. ``It amazed me that I could be such a chameleon,
that my face could look so different.
 &HT;    ``That's a very exciting thing for an actor to find out.''
 &HT;    Swank also believes she came to understand Teena.
 &HT;    ``He only lived 21 years, but in those 21 years his life was so
full,'' she says, her eyes welling up. ``He lived every moment so
fully.
 &HT;    ``He had the courage to follow his dream,'' she says, ``and
there's nobody in the whole world who doesn't have a dream. Anybody
can relate to that. We all have dreams. That's why everyone can
relate to the film.
 &HT;    ``Some people may not want to see a movie about a transgender
person or a gay character,'' Swank adds, ``but to me the film
transcends all of that. It transcends gender and gets to a deeper
issue. It's about something that happened in our society, and
hopefully the film will make people think about how and why it was
allowed to happen, and also how we can stop it from happening
again.''
 &HT;    Though the film has already garnered stellar reviews, some
people are taking writer/director Peirce to task for fictionalizing
elements of Teena's saga. Given the brouhaha over the fictional
elements historian Edmund Morris has introduced into his Ronald
Reagan biography, ``Dutch,'' a ``Boys Don't Cry'' backlash may have
been inevitable.
 &HT;    Swank appears to be caught a bit off-guard by the issue, but
quickly jumps to her director's defense
 &HT;    ``What can be hard about telling a true story as a movie is that
it has to be a movie,'' she says. ``Kim puts it so well, but a
movie has to hit dramatic arcs and you have to tell so much in two
hours ... Kim had to squash Brandon Teena's story together and tell
whatever she felt were the most important parts. You can't touch on
everything unless you want it to be some epic film.
 &HT;    ``My feeling is we tried to be very loyal to Brandon and his
story,'' she says. ``Ultimately, it's public domain _ if someone
wants to take it and, like Kim did, tell it as she felt it
happened, that's her right.
 &HT;    ``I feel she did a great job. She told a story in an hour and 40
minutes that really does justice to it.''
 &HT;    Swank discovered her own passion for telling stories through
acting at an early age. Born in Lincoln, Neb. _ not far from where
``Boys Don't Cry'' takes place _ and raised in the state of
Washington, Swank was 8 when a teacher asked her to write a skit
and perform it before her classmates.
 &HT;    ``I remember standing up there and something in me came to
life,'' she says, a smile crossing her face. ``It felt so good and
so exciting. I ran home and said, `Mom, I want to be an actress.'
 &HT;    ``She said, `That's fun. Go play.'''
 &HT;    Undaunted, Swank became a regular in school plays and local
repertory theater. Eventually her mother came around.
 &HT;    ``When I was 15,'' she recalls, ``my mom _ who was separated
from my father and at a crossroads in her own life _ said, `You're
really serious about this, aren't you? Do you want to go down to
Los Angeles and give it a try?'
 &HT;    ``My mom has been a huge supporter and a driving force in my
career.''
 &HT;    In 1994, the 20-year-old actress had her first experience with
Hollywood's star-making machine. Her performance in the title role
of ``The Next Karate Kid'' was expected to put her on the map _
until the film flopped.
 &HT;    ``Looking back, I can say I'm glad it didn't happen,'' she says.
``I don't know what choices I would have made, because I was so
young. I didn't know what kinds of movies I wanted to do, and I
might have gotten myself pigeonholed. Now I'm doing what I love.''
 &HT;    In other words, now Swank acts only when she feels compelled to
do so. In fact, since wrapping ``Boys Don't Cry'' nearly a year
ago, she hasn't worked. Instead, she's been reading scripts, taking
meetings, traveling and relaxing at home in Los Angeles with her
husband of two years, actor Chad Lowe.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully `Boys Don't Cry' will just give me more choices and
let me do the work I respond to,'' she says. ``Then, if I have a
short career, at least I did it doing work I'm proud of.''

 (Includes a color slide of singer Eddie Fisher at a recent
book-signing.) 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When Eddie Fisher sees what's going on with Ricky Martin, pop
music's hottest heartthrob of the moment, he can relate. Back in
the 1950s, the same kind of spotlight was on him.
 &HT;    In 1951, for example, soon after he arrived at Fort Hood, Texas,
for basic training as a newly drafted private, Fisher turned out
with the other soldiers for his first mail call.
 &HT;    ``One guy got two letters, another got four,'' he recalls. ``I
got 4,500. I felt like I was almost the only person in the world _
everything was happening to me.''
 &HT;    Post-Sinatra and pre-Elvis, the Philadelphia-born singer's
records regularly topped the charts in the years immediately after
World War II. Today, however, he's best known for a series of
high-profile marriages _ to Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor and
Connie Stevens _ that produced four children, including Tricia
Leigh, Joely, Todd and ``Star Wars'' heroine Carrie Fisher.
 &HT;    In retrospect, Fisher says, his is a story of missed
opportunities and unnecessary failures.
 &HT;    ``I get an A+ in poor judgment,'' he says. ``I should have paid
a thousand percent more attention to my music. I don't know if it
was laziness or the fact that everything came so easily to me.''
 &HT;    Behind the headlines, the marital and extramarital relationships
and the drug addiction that straitjacketed him for nearly four
decades was a golden-throated lyric baritone who had waves of
bobby-soxers swooning at New York's Paramount Theater and in movie
houses across the country. Crooning what he calls ``bubble-gum
songs'' _ among them ``Dungaree Doll,'' ``Lady of Spain'' and ``Oh
My Papa'' _ he was Frank Sinatra's heir apparent. But it wasn't to
be.
 &HT;    ``I didn't pay much attention to my career and my singing,''
Fisher admits. ``It looks like I did if you listen to the work, but
I certainly paid more attention to women and drugs.''
 &HT;    Fisher's voice was his ticket out of a dysfunctional immigrant
family buffeted by the Depression. First singing at services in a
local synagogue, he moved on to Philadelphia radio programs and
then into New York ballrooms and Catskills resorts, all before he
was 20. Soon recordings and then television beckoned.
 &HT;    Those days are long gone for the 71-year-old singer, who lives
with his fourth wife, Betty Lin, in a sun-drenched, 18th-floor
aerie overlooking San Francisco Bay. He no longer performs live,
but is at work on a new CD due in 2000, and has recently published
a memoir, ``Been There, Done That'' (St. Martin's Press, 1999),
co-written by David Fisher, who's no relation.
 &HT;    A previous autobiography, ``Eddie: My Life, My Loves,'' appeared
in 1981. But Fisher admits that it wasn't the whole truth.
 &HT;    ``I wrote that first book scared,'' he says. ``I was still under
the influence of drugs _ I began stories and they never ended. What
I wrote was true, but it didn't tell the complete story.''
 &HT;    In the new book, which has provoked controversy for its
kiss-and-tell accounts of his amorous adventures, Fisher is
anything but evasive.
 &HT;    ``I was truthful to the nth degree,'' he says.
 &HT;    Affable yet a bit hesitant in some of his responses, the singer
makes no excuses for his checkered past. Even today, six years into
a ``devoted'' marriage to Lin, a former graphic artist and
restaurateur, and nearly a decade after ending his drug dependency,
he admits that he's ``not completely comfortable'' with himself.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I ever was or ever will be,'' he says. ``But I'm
as comfortable as I can be.''
 &HT;    Wearing dark glasses and a hearing aid, Fisher admits that he
can't claim to have considered himself strong in any area of his
life.
 &HT;    ``I guess you would call me weak,'' he says hesitantly. ``I just
wanted to be a nice guy. I didn't want to be tough _ I think I was
a gentle man. I just gave in. I could have been a lot stronger than
I was.''
 &HT;    If he could reverse anything in his life, he adds, it would be
his involvement with drugs, which began in April 1953 when Max
Jacobson, a well-known Manhattan doctor popular with the stars,
injected him with a ``vitamin cocktail'' that actually contained
methamphetamine.
 &HT;    ``At one point, I thought I was smart enough to ask him, `Max,
what's in there?''' he recalls. ``And he said, `If I told you,
would you know?'''
 &HT;    In time, Fisher became dependent on cocaine.
 &HT;    His 1955 marriage to singer/movie star Debbie Reynolds made them
America's reigning sweethearts for a while, but Fisher says that
even before his notorious involvement with Elizabeth Taylor the
marriage was in trouble.
 &HT;    The end began when their good friend, producer Mike Todd, was
killed in a 1958 plane crash. Fisher's consoling of Taylor, Todd's
widow, soon turned into a liaison and then marriage _ which, in
turn, was shattered by Taylor's affair with Richard Burton during
the making of ``Cleopatra'' (1963).
 &HT;    In Fisher's conversation, as in his book, Taylor emerges as the
most unforgettable, if elusive, person in his life.
 &HT;    ``It was magical,'' he says. ``She had great humor. She was mad
about me, as much as I was mad about her. But it's hard to define
our relationship _ it's an experience that I couldn't completely
put into words.''
 &HT;    Fisher's children have reacted angrily to the book, and while
he's clearly proud of them, plugging Joely's current tour as Sally
Bowles in ``Cabaret'' and showing off the song Tricia wrote for
him, he admits that he wasn't much of a father, even compared to
his own father, whom he calls ``a nasty, abusive man, a tyrant.
 &HT;    ``He was better than I was, much better,'' Fisher says. ``He
came home every night. I was never there. There's a bond, but it
isn't built on anything, except that they're my children and I see
them now and then _ mostly then.''
 &HT;    His fans' disillusionment over his romantic entanglements
hastened Fisher's career decline in the 1960s, but he blames
himself more than anyone else.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't smart enough to know that when you're on top, or near
the top, it's tougher to stay there than get there,'' he says. ``I
thought I was a kind of god. I was there and I was going to remain
there.
 &HT;    ``Sinatra, on the other hand, seemed like he wasn't paying
attention to his career, but he built a repertoire unlike anyone
else's,'' Fisher adds. ``And he worked at his singing. No one ever
told me to do so. No one dared, because I was doing so well _ when
everything you put out is a hit, they don't want to interfere with
success.
 &HT;    ``But they should have,'' he says. ``The songs I made into hits
were not songs that belong in a repertoire for life. Anything I
would have recorded in that period would have been a hit.''
 &HT;    Many what-ifs swirl around Fisher's story _ what if he hadn't
met Max Jacobson? What if Mike Todd had lived? What if Fisher
hadn't picked up the ``Cleopatra'' script from a pile and suggested
to Taylor that she consider playing the title role?
 &HT;    Fisher generally isn't inclined to speculate, but he does wonder
how he might have fared if he'd come along today, growing up in a
world of music videos, strong multicultural sounds and new
directions in pop?
 &HT;    ``I wasn't as handsome as Ricky Nelson or Ricky Martin,'' he
muses. ``Maybe Ricky Nelson. But good talent finds a way. I don't
know to what level I would have risen.
 &HT;    ``But I think I would have made it at any time. It would have
worked out.''

KC ZOO GETS BABY APE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've probably heard about the recent birth of the baby
orangutan at the Kansas City Zoo. And you probably know how
important it is for the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   But you probably haven't heard the story behind the story.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't heard about the pudding and the PVC pipes. You
haven't heard about the frozen raspberries or the ultrasound tests.
And you haven't heard about the groundbreaking behavior
modification work that made this birth more than just cute and
cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of the one-of-a-kind relationship between the
baby's mother and the humans who take care of her.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years zoologist Beth Moore and senior staff
veterinarian Kirk Suedmeyer have worked countless hours to get the
mother, named Jill, to trust them. In the end, using positive
reinforcement, they trained her do a combination of things that no
other zoo in the world has been able to get an orangutan to do.
</P>
<P>
   They trained her to voluntarily stick her arm into a PVC pipe
with a hole cut in the top so Suedmeyer could regularly draw blood.
They trained her to urinate into a cup and hand it over for
analysis. And, almost unbelievably, they trained her to waddle to
the front of her cage, grab the bars over her head and allow
Suedmeyer to rub gel on her swollen tummy for ultrasounds.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed caretakers to monitor the health of the baby
orangutan like never before _ a critical step considering Jill's
last baby was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wourms, Zoo director, was thrilled. Not only did the
accomplishment reflect well on the Kansas City Zoo, but it also
provided researchers with ``invaluable information about
reproduction in an endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   Among zoo people the story is nothing short of remarkable.
That's why researchers are writing professional papers on it.
That's why Kansas City Zoo staffers are being asked to speak at
conferences. And that's why an international film crew flew here
from England to record the birth _ and the events leading up to it
_ for a National Geographic television series on great apes.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted in London, series producer Jan Euden said she was so
impressed that the Kansas City Zoo's work with Jill has become a
major part of the first episode, to be aired next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen this anywhere else,'' Euden said ``I think it
is absolutely remarkable what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   As long as anyone can remember, if zoo staff needed to draw
blood or perform an ultrasound on orangutans and other great apes
they had one choice: Immobilize the animals first.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for that. Orangutans are extremely strong _ six
to seven times stronger than humans. Getting close to them can be
dangerous. Which makes the prospect of giving them shots, drawing
blood and rubbing ultrasound goo on their bellies all the more
dicey.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the Kansas City zoo manage it?
</P>
<P>
   Suedmeyer just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is ask them,'' he said. ``We just never
asked them before.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, why go to the time, trouble and expense of
shooting them with a tranquilizer dart when you can earn their
cooperation with positive reinforcement?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the pudding and frozen raspberries.
</P>
<P>
   Orangutans love pudding and frozen raspberries. They also love
gelatin, frozen blueberries and yogurt. You can see it in their
faces as they lift their heads and pucker their lips _ the
universal orangutan symbol for ``more.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, training and big spoonfuls of favorite treats,
Suedmeyer and Moore learned orangutans would do almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   The program of behavior modification _ called ``operant
conditioning'' _ began almost seven years ago with another
orangutan. It started with changing the animal's feelings about the
vet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before,'' Suedmeyer said, ```every time I would come up it was
a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he changed his approach. He decided to come to the bars and
just sit. No tranquilizer gun. No nothing. He just sat.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, through training, the animal learned that if he came
close to Suedmeyer, he would be rewarded _ with pudding,
raspberries or something else.
</P>
<P>
   They trained Jill the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Come here, get a treat. Put your arm through the pipe, get a
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Let them stick you with a needle, get a really, really BIG
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Since zoo staff members knew they would need to see the infant
orangutan, Moore even used positive reinforcement to train Jill to
show her the baby.
</P>
<P>
   They practiced with a stuffed orangutan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with her touching the baby outside bars,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we gave her the little stuffed animal inside the
bars. And we were teaching her things, like to hold it up in case
we needed to give it a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when she had her own baby, I thought: `Oh my gosh. There's
just no way she's going to let us see it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Jill surprised Moore by showing her the baby _ which was
recently named ``Pendamai,'' an Indonesian word meaning
``peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She came up to the bars, and I told her it was really a
beautiful baby,'' Moore said. ``I said `Gosh, Jill, you did such a
beautiful job.' And I said `Can I see your baby?' And she just sort
of leaned forward and let us look at the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo spokesperson Denise Rendina saw the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That animal absolutely presented the baby for Beth to see,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like `That is just the sweetest thing I have ever
seen.' It was phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you want an animal to show you her baby or let you give
it a shot, the key is patience, trust, training and rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Orangutans can't reason like humans, Suedmeyer said. But they
can make a simple cost-benefit decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, `Yeah, that's going to hurt. But it won't hurt that
badly, and really like those raspberries.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suedmeyer, Moore and the staff already are talking about the
next stage of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already discussing doing possible artificial
insemination down the road by collecting semen samples from Doc
(the baby's father) and inseminating Jill when Doc has passed
away,'' he said. ``It will take us years, but I know we can do
it.''

AUTHORS' ANIMALS ARE GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARJEAN BUSBY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many times last week did you sneak a moment for yourself and
think about life's good things? Don't laugh yet. What you needed,
of course, was an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   But this week (Oct. 11) you can read Chicken Soup for the Cat &AMP;
Dog Lover's Soul.MDSD/.MDNM/, a just-released collection of true
stories about pets, people and their remarkable bond. Designed as a
day brightener, it's warm, uplifting, sometimes poignant or
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Each selection is only two to four pages long, so you could
finish several stories while waiting for your ride or your wash to
finishing drying.
</P>
<P>
   California authors Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen
previously worked with Idaho veterinarian Marty Becker and Iowa
free-lance writer//editor Carol Kline on a litter mate called
Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul.
</P>
<P>
   The first book has sold 1.8 million copies since April 1998,
says Kline, a dog rescue volunteer and self-esteem facilitator.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first book I personally read close to 3,000 stories
submitted by people all over the world,'' she recalls in a phone
interview. ``But for this one I had some help in reading. I'd
screen out stories, particularly if they were not uplifting or were
too journalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Becker, a popular television figure, have stories in
both critter books. Her work enhances the ``On Love'' chapter and
``The Magic of the Bond'' pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Kline also helped Jim Kerr of the Colorado Boys Ranch
horsemanship program produce ``Sweet Pea's Mama,'' a story for the
pets-as-healers section. He had plenty of proof that animal
interactions are therapeutic and can mend broken spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Many stories are reprinted from other publications. Barbara
Bartocci of Overland Park gave permission for ``Mighty Hercules''
to appear. Earlier, Reader's Digest featured her account of a
family picnic, three snakes and her son's soaring confidence as he
cared for them.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonist Charles Barsotti of Kansas City shows a
physician-patient drawing in the healers' section. Doctor dog
prescribes: ``Eat some grass.'' Other humor typifies Bil Keane of
``The Family Circus'' and Jonny Hawkins, who has provided humor for
more than 175 publications.
</P>
<P>
   This Chicken Soup edition ($12.95, Health Communications Inc.)
names on the cover five celebrity writers: Sarah, Duchess of York;
James Herriot; Dave Barry; Cleveland Amory; and Roger Caras, a
leader in the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Kline and her co-authors will use their store visits and media
opportunities for a personal crusade: public awareness that 6
million pets a year are euthanized after they lose their home,
although their behavior problems are treatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people give up too fast, but I'd like to inspire them to
go the extra mile,'' Kline says. ``They can learn behavior
techniques, ask experts and take a small amount of time to analyze
the problem.''

GETTING A BEAD ON THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To bead or not to bead. It's not much of a question for people
on the fashion trend track.
</P>
<P>
   So-called power bead bracelets, said to impart such gifts as
health, courage and fortune, are selling out everywhere, from
mainstream department stores to New York street vendors.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, embellished sweaters, jeans, shoes and bags
are surfacing in retail stores. At the recent New York spring
designer shows, bead-splashed voiles, silks and chiffons for day
and night flooded the runways. And closer to home, bead stores are
seeing a rush of people who want to create their own bracelets and
decorated jeans.
</P>
<P>
   So much for austerity. Adornment is having a run.
</P>
<P>
   Millennial movement
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the most visible beading right now is empowerment or
feng shui bead bracelets, which took off in recent months with the
speed of a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The empowerment is said to vary with the type of bead. For
example, a card attached to a black onyx bracelet promises that the
gem boosts willpower. According to accounts from Milk &AMP; Honey Inc.,
which makes bracelets, rose quartz is the bead of love. Amethyst
brings serenity. And on it goes.
</P>
<P>
   They range from $5 at New York street stands to $20 at
department stores and as much as $80 at specialty stores such as
New York's Henri Bendel. At the New York fashion shows last month,
the press corps was sharing vendor locations thought to have the
best deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a block north from the tents, on the, uh, southwest
side of the street. I bought 10 for $20 ...'' was how the
conversation went.
</P>
<P>
   The idea started with American jewelry designer Stella Pace, and
as celebrities started wearing them, consumer demand began to rise.
The idea proliferated to a range of craftsmen, jewelry companies
and loving hands at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hated them when I first brought them in,'' says
Marlo Thornton, the accessories buyer at Halls, a Kansas City
specialty store where Carol Dauplaise bracelets are $15. ``But
we've had to reorder several times.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hodak, the fashion director for the parent company of the
Jones Store, echoed the success story. ``We've reordered them many
times,'' she said, recalling how she had seen them just the day
before on fashion professionals in New York designer showrooms.
``It's all different age groups, not just the young,'' who are
embracing the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Many think the appeal is more in the meaning of the beads than
the look. Ann Zbryk, the manager of Nomadic Notions bead store in
Overland Park, says a young man was in recently asking for a bead
of courage.
</P>
<P>
   When Janet Bloom, the owner of D'Bronx Pizza in Kansas City, was
given the beaded bracelet for health and a Buddha prayer bracelet
for happiness and well-being, she was sure they were all she
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to disturb the balance,'' she says. ``How could
you ask for anything more?''
</P>
<P>
   But then she started buying them as gifts for friends and
family. ``It makes them feel good,'' she says. And she believes so
strongly in the power of her own, she stores them in her evening
bag when she goes to a formal event so they will never be too far
away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Irenka Jakubiak, editor of Accessories magazine, says the
jewelry represents a millennium-inspired ``movement toward
spiritualism'' and a movement away from the impersonal. ``It's back
to finding something to believe in,'' she says, ``a hope for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparel apparent
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile beads also are flooding the apparel scene. The idea
was boosted by Gucci designer Tom Ford and his fall homage to the
flash and splash of Las Vegas glitz. Since then, we've seen the
light meter punched up about 1,000 watts on clothes and other
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Spade's new shoe line includes beaded thongs. In his recent
spring show, Tommy Hilfiger fringed his jeans with Swarvorski
crystal beads. A woman standing in the crowd at a fashion show in
Times Square was wearing slipperlike flip-flops embroidered with
jeweled beads.
</P>
<P>
   In the home decor market, beads are showing up on lamps, pillows
and gifts, says Tom Julian, a New York-based trend tracker for
Fallon McElligott Advertising. And for do-it-yourselfers, Nomadic
Notions has had a ``huge increase in volume'' of business in all
kinds of beads and how-to classes, Zbryk says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly at a time when the fashionables were consumed by
simple minimalism of tank tops and Gap T-shirts, a new decorative
motif seems a natural evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Steele, the fashion historian and curator at New York's
Fashion Institute of Technology, says it's the ``pendulum effect,''
in which fashion swings from one extreme to another.
</P>
<P>
   To her it's reminiscent of the bohemian and hippie movement of
the late '60s, when beads, embroidered mirrors and other ethnic
adaptations replaced the severely austere, modern lines of
Frenchmen Courreges and Cardin.

   WASHINGTON _ Millions of Americans are expected to go on line in
coming weeks to shop for Christmas presents. Consumer advocates
worry that these Web newcomers won't understand the possible
pitfalls of shopping in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   They also point out that many merchants, too, will be engaging
in e-commerce for the first time. When wet-behind-the-ears shoppers
meet up with inexperienced e-tailers, problems are sure to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Helen Gillespie, president of e-BuyersGuide.com, a
Burlington, Mass., firm that gives consumers advice, offers these
tips for avoiding problems in this new shopping world:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy early. Many holiday shoppers wait until the last minute
because they know they can run to the mall on Dec. 24 and find
something. But most online merchants will need a minimum of three
days to take an order and get the gift delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie says that considering how young and inexperienced most
online merchants are, shoppers ought to allow far more time than
just three days for them to fulfill an order. ``Companies are going
to be struggling to keep up with the delivery requests,'' Gillespie
said. ``If you really want to be assured that your order will be
filled, shop before Dec. 15.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't shop during lunch hour. Analysts say e-tailers are
busiest between noon and 3 p.m. Eastern time because so many office
workers surf the Web during their lunch hour. Adding to that heavy
load will only increase the odds that customers' browser traffic
will overwhelm Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure the e-tailer offers you a toll-free phone number to
answer questions about your purchases. Any company that is too
cheap to accept toll-free calls is not likely to serve the customer
well.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're sending gifts to loved ones in far-away places, make
sure they can return merchandise without too much trouble. ``Stick
to brand names and find out from the retailer how easy it will be
to make returns,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set limits. Because you don't have to carry around heavy
shopping bags, it's easy to forget how much money you have spent.
Consumer advocates urge e-shoppers to keep track of purchases to
stay within spending limits and to avoid getting carried away with
online auctions.

 &HT;    THIS YEAR COULD BE KEY TO MAKING 'E-TAILING' MAINSTREAM
 &HT;    With E-COMMERCE-ADVICE and E-COMMERCE-DATA. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories for release Sunday, Oct.

   WASHINGTON _ For retailers, the holiday shopping season is the
crucial period of the year when their decisions about inventory,
staffing, pricing and advertising will result in drinking champagne
in January _ or bathing in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the stakes are even higher for merchants who plan
to use the Internet to capture customers. The electronic retailers,
or e-tailers, who can attract eyeballs and open wallets during the
last 10 weeks of 1999 may well become the masters of merchandising
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an absolutely huge season for online companies,''
said David Baltaxe, who studies Internet commerce for Current
Analysis, a research firm in Sterling, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Having enough merchandise in stock, employees on hand and
sophisticated technology in place will be the keys to handling
explosive growth, he said. ``This is the first year that we'll have
real mainstream shopping done through the Internet. Sales are
expected to be three times what they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much Christmas shopping will be done on the Web
vary from roughly $5 billion to $8 billion. Whatever the final
tally, it is sure to be a leap from last year's $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important to e-tailers will be the ``buzz'' the
season generates. Companies that perform well from mid-October
through December could see their stock prices rocket up in January
as more investors become believers in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Christmas '99 is so important because it will be
the first time that millions of Americans will try shopping with a
mouse rather than at a mall. Their experiences could shape a
lifetime of buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly scenarios haunt e-tail boosters who fear those experiences
won't measure up to expectations. They worry that shoppers will
show up online, only to find they can't get accurate inventory
information or understand how to complete orders. Or perhaps
consumers will find what they want and buy it, only to discover the
delivery system is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my nightmare: It's December 23rd and I'm at the mall
shopping because the things I ordered didn't show up,'' said Mary
Helen Gillespie, president of e-BuyersGuide.com, a Burlington,
Mass., firm that gives consumers advice.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are turning to the Web because ``they want to make
things easier for themselves,'' Gillespie said. Online merchants
``have to fulfill those expectations, not make life more difficult.
If they don't perform, people are going to say: 'I'm never going
back there.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if consumers find Web shopping a breeze, the
retail world may be turned upside down. Traditional merchandisers
who expect customers to drive to a store during business hours may
find they can't compete with the 24-hour-a-day e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's round-the-clock convenience will be the main lure
during the hectic holiday season for Damali Noel, a 27-year-old
Atlanta resident who recently made an online purchase through
FlowersAGoGo.com, a Decatur, Ga.,- based florist. She said that
smooth transaction has encouraged her to try surfing the Web for
bigger purchases during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats leaving the house,'' she said. ``You can sit in your
robe ... and shop in the middle of the night. It's very
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that convenience is what draws people to the Web, Wall
Street analysts are trying to figure out which kinds of companies
have the best chance of getting everything right. The Internet
offers essentially three formats for buying goods. One is the pure
Internet company, such as Amazon.com, which operates only in
cyberspace. Some observers believe these Web-only businesses will
be the winners in the e-tail world because of their laser-like
focus on online consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But others predict this holiday season will reveal the strengths
of the second type of Web merchant: the traditional retailers who
have stretched over into the Internet. Their advantage is having
real storefronts where sh reduce shoppers' concerns about making
exchanges of gifts. ``We are trying very hard to make sure you get
the right product right from the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, the e-commerce analyst, said Lands' End's
spending spree to boost technology and staffing is typical this
year. ``A lot of money has been spent to make sure people are
ready,'' he said. ``Last year, some Web sites crashed because they
weren't prepared for the crush of business. ... They won't let that
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is so intense because the scrutiny from Wall Street
will be so close, he said. ``Now is the time to prove you can grab
(online customers) and make sure they enjoy using you,'' he said.
``If you can do that, you'll find the Holy Grail _ the ability to
carry over customers'' into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Big holiday sales and satisfied customers will prompt venture
capitalists and stock investors to pour much more money into
e-commerce, making instant millionaires, even billionaires, out of
many e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   Those entrepreneurs are hoping they'll please first-time holiday
shoppers like Jennifer Reichenbach, a 32-year-old Atlanta resident
who recently has begun making purchases online, primarily because
of the 24-hour-a-day convenience. ``I really, really like it,'' she
said. ``In fact, I almost fear getting addicted to it.''

   But others predict this holiday season will reveal the strengths
of the second type of Web merchant: the traditional retailers who
have stretched over into the Internet. Their advantage is having
real storefronts where shoppers can return merchandise without
having to ship goods back. For example, if a consumer goes on line
to buy a Christmas present through gap.com, he knows the recipient
will be able to return the gift at any Gap store and pick out
something that fits better.
</P>
<P>
   The third type of online merchant is the catalog company, which
sits somewhere between the Internet-only e-tailers and the
traditional stores with Web sites. The companies with vast
experience in direct merchandising are trying to use their brand
names and well-developed delivery systems to leap ahead of others
online.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End, the 35-year-old clothes company based in Wisconsin,
is perhaps the most aggressive in trying to make the transition
from the printed catalog to the Web. Last year, the company sold
about $61 million worth of goods through its Web site, or about 4.5
percent of total sales. That was up from $18 million in 1997. So
far this year, Web-based sales are running at 2.5 times last year's
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, vice president of electronic commerce at Lands' End,
said that to boost holiday sales, the company has started offering
a ``live chat'' box to allow customers to ``talk'' to sales clerks
while looking at merchandise on line. By clicking on the chat box,
the shopper will synchronize her screen with the clerk's so that
together, they can exchange messages about clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper also can use the ``shop-with-a-friend'' option,
which brings a companion into the chat. That will allow, for
example, two sisters who live hundreds of miles apart to go on line
together and chat while picking out a present for their parents,
Bass said. In addition, they can put the clothes on a model, a
cyberfigure who can be configured to resemble the recipient of the
gift.
</P>
<P>
   By using these new technologies, Lands' End hopes to greatly
reduce shoppers' concerns about making exchanges of gifts. ``We are
trying very hard to make sure you get the right product right from
the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, the e-commerce analyst, said Lands' End's
spending spree to boost technology and staffing is typical this
year. ``A lot of money has been spent to make sure people are
ready,'' he said. ``Last year, some Web sites crashed because they

``If you can do that, you'll find the Holy Grail _ the ability to

capitalists and stock investors to pour much more money into

   ``I love food,'' Matt Damon says. ``Everything bad _ I love
pizza, beer, chocolate and spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a case for Carrie Latt Wiatt, nutritionist to the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, the founder of Diet Designs, is Hollywood's most
high-profile calorie counter. Her custom-made meals have been
delivered to Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Dennis Quaid, Neve
Campbell, Reese Witherspoon, James Cameron, Danny DeVito and dozens
of other Hollywood types who've needed help staying svelte between
movies.
</P>
<P>
   When Alicia Silverstone couldn't get into her catsuit for the
last ``Batman'' extravaganza, Wiatt was the one director Joel
Schumacher called on for help.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiatt's most recent coup was adding Damon to her list of
dieters. Last year, the actor packed on the pounds as he waited to
begin shooting ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, who usually works out of an immaculate headquarters in
Culver City (complete with a stainless-steel kitchen and a staff of
nine), helped him slim down in time for the shoot. But he worried
about how he'd fare on the movie's set in Rome, surrounded by all
that pizza and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   So she hopped on a plane to Italy, toting a supply of what she
describes as Damon's ``fun food'': his favorite turkey jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, Wiatt instructed Italian chefs to expand their
repertoire with her low-fat meals for Damon, including creamy
polenta lasagna, crab cakes and chicken with Marbella sauce. She
also plowed her way through the city's fashionable restaurants,
where, she says, she taught Damon that he could lose weight without
being afraid of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have the thin-crust pizza, but only two or three
inches,'' says the earnest but glamorous Wiatt, 41. ``Pasta, but
two or three ounces at a time. He didn't think he could eat pasta,
and all of a sudden he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most people would wince at the prospect of a three-inch
slice of pizza _ why even bother? _ Damon pronounces himself happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrie helped me get through the movie,'' he says. ``I'm not a
person who diets well. She gave me food that I actually liked, and
I didn't feel like I was depriving myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly Wiatt's goal. As part of her mission to teach
America that less is more, she has written a book called ``Portion
Savvy'' (Pocket Books: $24), illustrated with cardboard pop-outs of
little chicken breasts, scoops of rice, undersized apples and
minimuffins.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt is horrified by the national obsession with super-jumbo
plates of fries, overflowing boxes of buttered popcorn, eight-ounce
bagels and 60-ounce soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do they get the idea that we need this kind of food?''
she says. ``It's ridiculous. It's obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from her skill at preparing restaurant-quality,
nutritionally balanced food in moderate but satisfying portions,
Wiatt's secret lies in tailoring her 1,000- to 2,000-calorie daily
menus to suit individual tastes.
</P>
<P>
   (An editor at W magazine who tried her food for two weeks lost
six pounds completely painlessly on a 1,600-calories-a-day regime.)
</P>
<P>
   Everything is fresh; she even refuses to go mass-market because
she doesn't want to freeze her food. And she takes into account the
dieter's sweet tooth, providing lemon bars, butterscotch chip
brownies and dainty servings of tiramisu, mousse and chocolate chip
meringues.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing the frequent smile of a true believer, Wiatt describes
herself as ``part therapist, part scientist, part motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   She schedules regular appointments with clients, asking probing
questions about eating habits, medical problems and food
preferences. Then she finishes with a weigh-in on the unforgiving
scale that looms in a corner of her otherwise cheery office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is so intimate, and sometimes people make it their
intimate friend and get too close,'' Wiatt moans. ``Aaargh! Think
of how we're codependent in certain relationships. They don't work.
They're dysfunctional. And why would food be any different? I can
get people to think about establishing a healthier relationship,
establishing boundaries. ''
</P>
<P>
   For people who can't stay away from their refrigerators, it
helps to have breakfast, lunch and dinner prepackaged and
delivered, because there's no need to think about eating until it's
time to open one of Wiatt's boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The meals are never predictable: There's sea bass with tamarind
sauce and couscous; corn cakes with black-bean salsa; artichoke
pizza with goat cheese. Wiatt's list goes on and on, her menu
changing to incorporate seasonal foods.
</P>
<P>
   Local clients pay $200 for the first consultation and four
follow-up visits, plus $230 a week for 15 meals. (The meals can be
shipped to some other cities at an additional charge.)
</P>
<P>
   But price is not an object for most of Wiatt's clients, who also
appreciate her cheerleader sunniness (``Oh, you're so cute,'' she
says when she's complimented on the food).
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, who received her master's degree in nutrition from
California State University at Northridge, began her business in
her home kitchen about 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was cooking for friends of her parents in the San
Fernando Valley, but she'd already picked up a handful of
show-business clients _ including her now best buddy Sela Ward _ by
the time Ward's agent recommended her to her future husband, ICM
agent Jim Wiatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed the cardinal sin _ I married my client,'' she says
with her great guffawing laugh. ``I said, `Wait a minute. I can't
date you. You're my client.' He said, `Well, I'll fire you, then.'
So he married me instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was in 1992, and the divorce came two years later,
by which time Wiatt's business had skyrocketed, fueled by her new
husband's connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet people for reasons; I believe that,'' she says,
adding that, Hollywood being Hollywood, she feels ``blessed'' to
have kept most of her clients after the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if someone said, `Don't go to her,' people respected and
knew that I was doing a good job.'' She reflects for a minute. ``It
was an important time in my life. He was my husband. He wasn't just
an agent who introduced me to people. Would I go back and marry
someone else in the business? Not a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, however, Wiatt has gone into ``the business'' herself.
In her syndicated TV show, ``Living Better with Carrie Wiatt,'' she
visits farmers' markets and yoga classes, dispenses health and home
advice and comes across as a high-energy, low-fat Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt's own increasing celebrity has made her more aware of the
pressures that her clients have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors in the past have done some real extreme dieting and
used some very dangerous methods,'' she says. ``Everything from
diet pills in the '70s to ... I don't want to say this, but who
knows who snorted coke?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt also worries about ultra-thin actresses being judged too
harshly by the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not anorexic,'' she says. ``You'd know. Their teeth
would be gray. They'd be in the hospital. I've seen bulimics and
anorexics and they're not. I think women are becoming much more
focused on being fit and having a positive body image.''
</P>
<P>
   As a nutritionist, Wiatt's goal is to teach people her methods,
then set them free. But as much as she believes in herself, she
stops short of fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to cheat within the structure,'' she says.
``For me, life without chocolate would not be worth living.'' &QL;

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEWS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NOBEL-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Dr. Guenter Blobel, a cellular
and molecular biologist at Rockefeller University, is awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that proteins
carry signals that act as ZIP codes, helping them find their
correct locations within the cell. The research has had an
``immense impact'' on studies of the cell, the assembly said, and
helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind diseases like cystic
fibrosis. Blobel, 63, was born in Germany and earned his Ph.D. at
the University of Wisconsin. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER-REVIVAL (Undated) _ Like a furred phoenix rising from the
ashes, or a creature cognizant of its nine-lifetime warranty, the
tiger has come back. Far from disappearing, the tiger in some parts
of its range in Asia is practically thriving, its numbers
measurably greater today than just a few years ago. And though
conservationists who have long battled to save the tiger warn
against complacency and emphasize that the tiger is still
endangered, they admit to an unusual sensation these days:
optimism. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ANNIVERSARY (Undated) _ The Internet revolution began
quietly 30 years ago this month. With one scarcely noticed
milestone after another, the planetary nervous system envisioned in
the early '60s _ cyber rhetoric is as old as a Beatles tune _
unceremoniously began insinuating itself into society. A strange
amalgam of Defense Department money, engineering expertise, and
even a dab of countercultural idealism, slowly brought on the Net
we know today. By By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   WAVE-OBSERVATORY (Undated) _ A whisper from one of the most
exotic events in the universe could be among the first detections
when a new, $350 million gravity wave observatory begins operating
next year. The event is the violent merger of a pair of black
holes, a cataclysm that throws off ripples in the fabric of space
called gravitational waves or, more simply, gravity waves. It was
to detect such waves that physicists designed the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which will
be dedicated on November 11 and begin a shakedown period of initial
operations in January of next year. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Fears of breast cancer are now
distorting the reality of the disease, which should be put in
perspective. Heart disease and lung cancer are far more deadly for
women. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-REACTIONS (Undated) _ Doses of prescriptions recommended in
the Physicians Desk Reference may be too high for many people and
may cause adverse reactions, ranging from dizziness and nausea all
the way to death, according to an article published last month in
the journal Postgraduate Medicine. For many drugs _ including
Viagra, Prozac and some medicines used to treat high blood
pressure, allergies, insomnia and high cholesterol _ smaller doses
would work just as well as the standard ones, with far less risk of
bad reactions, said the author of the article. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   ATWATER-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Conversation with Dr. Tanya Atwater, who
early in her career discovered how the western United States had
been developed and determined the role of tectonic plates. Now, she
is working on an animated film explaining earthquakes to children.
As for living with quakes, she explains that good roofs protect
people from rain and good construction can protect them from
earthquakes. By Claudia Dreifus.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY-FLU-SEASON (Undated) _ Health officials have been
surprised by early cases of the flu in several spots around the
nation, but say that it's very hard to predict just how difficult
this flu season will be. By Randi Hutter Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   EPHEDRA-DEBATE (Undated) _ A nutritional supplement used by
dieters, athletes, students and late-shift workers, not to mention
others simply looking for a jittery high, is enjoying enormous
popularity in the United States. But critics call it ``legal
speed'' and say the herb, ephedra, is too easily abused. By Mary
Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICINE-BALL (Undated) _ The medicine ball, darling of the
trimming and toning crowd before its exile to six decades of
exercise Elba, has bounced back. By Andrea Higbie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Your science questions answered.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on ants that protect their turf
by gardening, moons for asteroids. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Researchers have established how
disruptive serious snorters can be to their partners; new
guidelines on how to handle head injuries on the playing field; if
you live in an integrated neighborhood and have a heart attack, it
seems you stand a better chance of someone giving you CPR; a new
study suggests a link in men between stress and a chemical in their
blood that has been associated, at high levels, with a risk of
prostate cancer; three physicians in Italy contend that licorice
root may impede sexual performance and may even cause loss of sex
drive in men.

   1. FOR WORLD SECURITY, RATIFY THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST
</P>
<P>
   BAN TREATY During the 1990s, the United States has made a vital
contribution to arms control and non-proliferation. Thanks to the
common resolve of the world's powers, we have achieved a
substantial reduction in nuclear arsenals, the banning of chemical
weapons, the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and, in 1996, the conclusion of
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The decisions we
take now will help determine, for generations to come, the safety
of the world we bequeath to our children, write Jacques Chirac,
Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroeder. New York Times Op-Ed. 800 words.

THE BIZARRE WORLD OF MATTHEW BARNEY When Matthew Barney came onto
the world art scene in 1991, with his surreal sculptures and
videos, he was instantly successful. Since then, his work has only
got better and stranger. He has mostly been making a series of
increasingly elaborate films, called ``Cremaster.'' Now 32, Barney
is the most important American artist of his generation. By Michael
Kimmelman. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (5,100
words) + edited article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
THE VIRUSES ARE COMING As the earth grows warmer, and as pathogens,
aided by increased global trade, political chaos and the
destruction of rain forests, find new hosts, people who have never
set foot in Africa will be contracting malaria, just as last month
Americans who never set foot in Africa contracted the West Nile
virus, which was discovered in Uganda in 1937 and had never been
seen in this hemisphere. What it means is what we already know :
pathogens have no borders. By Jeffrey Goldberg. From The New York
Times Magazine. 1,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
THE NEXT CARDINAL Because of the prominence of the position, New
York's next archbishop will not only most likely be named a
cardinal. He will also characterize the church's leadership well
into the next century. And 40 years after John F. Kennedy became
the first Catholic president of the United States, the church in
America is becoming an immigrant church all over again. Hispanic
Catholics, 24 million and counting, are quickly becoming the
largest ethnic group in the 62-million-member church. By Paul Elie.

time and space on your PC. NASA has a scheme in which you can use
your desktop computer as part of a program in the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI.) By Eleanor Lawrence. 500
words.
</P>
<P>
   (b) The Brain Bank You'd never guess that the rolling parkland
of Belmont, a leafy Boston suburb, is home to shelves of pickled
and frozen brains. This 'brain bank' has existed for over 20 years.
Each year it receives around 350 brains (each brain must reach the
bank within 24 hours of death,) and sends out more than 6,000 bits
of brain tissue to researchers. By Sara Abdulla. 500 words.

   (a) Scientists Unmake Diet ``Myth'' Willpower
</P>
<P>
   To attribute dieting success or failure to willpower,
researchers say, is to ignore the complex interaction of brain
chemicals. By Jane Fritsch. 1,500 words
</P>
<P>
   (b) Of Mice, Men and a Gene That Jumpstarts Follicles There is a
sudden ray of hope for balding people. The new herald of
hirsuteness is no mere cream or chemical but a gene with the
strange and potent name of Sonic hedgehog. By Nicholas Wade. 1,500

<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The Senate Republicans' defeat last
week of the nomination of Missouri State Supreme Court Justice
Ronnie White to the federal bench was a blatantly unfair and racist
act. GOP senators simply deferred to Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft's
opposition to White, who is the first black to serve on the state
high court. But the Senate action could well hurt the right-wing
Ashcroft, who is running for reelection next year. By MARIANNE
MEANS.

   FORFEIT. We have a copy of the Claire McCaskill report on

<P>
   SHOTS: Immunization rates are way down in all five metro
counties, but drastic drops have been recorded in Jackson and
Wyandotte counties, according to statistics to be released Tuesday
by the Partnership for Children. One big reason is that education
efforts have faltered because of high turnover at the health
departments. But health officials say they're also fighting a
growing anti-vaccination movement, fueled by alleged misinformation
on the Internet. (Complete report card story is embargoed for
Wednesday) Photo. Graphic. Donald Bradley. 20.

   CREME. Creme de la Creme, a new nursery and preschool in
Leawood, looks like nirvana for little kids. There's the Beauty and
the Beast soundtrack wafting throughout the 21,000-square-foot
building, the Trike Autobahn on the manicured playground outside,
the model train rolling around a track near the ceiling of the faux
Victorian streetscape. And that's just the trappings. Every 30
minutes, preschoolers are moved to a different activity, from
French to math to creative movement. Tuition at Creme runs almost
twice as high as the area average _ it's $12,000 a year for
preschoolers _ but satisfied parents say their children's happiness
is worth it. Yet child development experts warn that high cost does
not equal high quality. Kate Beem. Photo. 45.

   1. WHY THE PRESS LOVES JOHN MCCAIN, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is miles ahead in the very first contest of the 2000
campaign: the press primary. Journalists go weak in the knees
around the guy. Why do the hacks love McCain? You could start with
our admiration for a quality not many of us possess: physical
courage. McCain isn't just a war hero, he's a Faulknerian
character, in a very different sense than Bill Clinton is. And I
think that at this point, even those of us who think Clinton has
been a good president hunger for a successor more deserving of our
respect.

</P>
<P>
   Outside of recent African immigrants to the United States, there
are virtually no black Americans of purely African descent, which
is to say no black people who lack white ancestry, left in this
country. Four centuries of race mixing have had a similar impact on
Americans who define themselves as white. Convincing estimates show
that by 1950 about one in five white Americans had some African
ancestry. How did so much ``black'' blood get into so many
``white'' people?

   3. THE BUSH TRIANGULATION STRATEGY, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   The media's understanding of George W. Bush's
``triangulation''--that he is trying to ``distance himself from the
GOP's right wing'' and ``stake out the middle ground'' between two
extremes--oversimplifies the game. Bush isn't positioning himself
on a straight line between Bill Clinton and the congressional GOP.
He is venturing into a third dimension, rejecting the whole
Washington debate, and defining his contest with Al Gore along a
new axis.

</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, the $123 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when
it veered off course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere. NASA
revealed the cause: One part of the orbiter's navigation system was
speaking in English units and another in metric. Why hasn't the
U.S. adopted the metric system?

   Have you read Scott Shuger's roundup, available every day at
www.slate.com ? Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   TODAY'S PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   USA Today leads with thIO's scheduled debate today at its
national convention over the union's possible presidential
endorsement of either Al Gore or Bill Bradley. Although the union
is meeting in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times front has only a
postage-stamp-sized reefer to its page B1 AFL-CIO story, choosing
instead to follow up on its Saturday lead, the Mexican flood/mud
aftermath, a story nobody else fronts. The LAT's emphasis today is
on the spreading unrest among some 200,000 displaced survivors
demanding faster distribution of food and water. The New York
Times, which fronts the AFL-CIO, leads with the Clinton
administration's strong opposition to European Union thoughts of
supplying heating oil and other aid to Yugoslavia. The U.S.
concern, says the Times, is that such supplies might shore up
Slobodan Milosevic's political position by alleviating public
discontent. The line the U.S. has drawn is relieving ordinary
Serbians' suffering, yes, rebuilding Serbia, no. The Washington
Post, often thought to be hung up on the federal government,
homebodies in a big way, with three of its six front-pagers
twanging local instead. The paper stuffs the AFL-CIO convention and
leads with the resignation of the head of a Virginia county
government.
</P>
<P>
   USAT's AFL-CIO coverage lends plenty of credence to the idea
that the organization is genuinely undecided about Gore vs.
Bradley. In the third paragraph it quotes Gore saying he's
uncertain of the outcome and waits until the eighth to quote a
union official who thinks Gore has ``a good chance.'' By contrast,
both the NYT and WP say Gore is ``assured'' of the union's
endorsement. The WSJ is a bit less emphatic, saying that pro-Gore
union leaders now say they have the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Both USAT and the Post include an observation that impugns the
choice's significance: if the union does indeed make a choice now,
it will be its earliest endorsement since going for Walter Mondale.
(The WP says that was in 1983, USAT says 1984.)
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and USAT front the decision by Colt Manufacturing, a
leading maker of handguns (and, the NYT points out in a nice
historical touch, the inventor of the six-shooter), to abandon much
of its retail handgun business. The company will still sell to law
enforcement and the military but will basically stop selling
weapons to civilians who aren't collectors of old-style
commemorative guns. Apparently, the company's motivation is to
avoid legal liability and money damages possibly arising from
verdicts in any of the lawsuits currently being brought by various
local governments. The Colt shift was discovered by Newsweek, a
fact mentioned in the second paragraph at USAT, in the eighth at
the Times.
</P>
<P>
   An inside NYT piece by Felicity Barringer makes an observation
that raises deep questions about the media's true values: In the
week following the simultaneous breaking of well-researched
allegations of a U.S. massacre of civilians during the Korean war
and of the Jesse Ventura Playboy interview, less and less was said
about the former and more and more was said about the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ reports that the British government has instructed
physicians in the National Healtce not to prescribe the new
anti-flu drug from Glaxo. Given that this is what the headline
says, the reader might well conclude that the Brits believe that
the drug is dangerous. That's why it's a mistake for the Journal to
wait until the fifth paragraph to mention that the U.K. government
merely thinks that the drug isn't cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   The WP gives op-ed space to Pat Buchanan so that he can continue
to develop his foreign policy position on World War II. Der Patzer
tries to firm up his view that before Germany's declaration of war
on the U.S., it posed no strategic threat to this country, today
including an appeal to...Hitler, who said, ``Everything I undertake
is directed against Russia. If the West is too stupid and too blind
to comprehend that, I will be forced to come to an understanding
with the Russians, to smash the West and then after its defeat, to
turn against the Soviet Union.'' Gee, wonder why Buchanan didn't
quote the clearest thing Hitler ever said about his plans?--''The
Sudetenland is the last territorial claim I have to make in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAT fronts a report about tighter rules regarding personal
uses of office computers and how companies are increasingly using
sophisticated tracking technology to enforce them. Examples in the
story of concerns where the new technology and the worker
resentment it breeds are in evidence: AT&AMP;T, Pacific Bell, the FCC,
Delta Airlines, Exxon, the State Department, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, and Lockheed Martin. There's one company that
almost surely is a hotbed for this issue that the story makes no
mention of: the LAT.

He is venturing into a third dimension, rejecting the whole
Washington debate, and defining his contest with Al Gore along a
new axis.

   4. WHY HASN'T THE U.S. GONE METRIC? by Matt Alsdorf
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, the $123 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when
it veered off course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere. NASA
revealed the cause: One part of the orbiter's navigation system was
speaking in English units and another in metric. Why hasn't the
U.S. adopted the metric system?

   TODAY'S PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   USA Today leads with the AFL-CIO's scheduled debate today at its
national convention over the union's possible presidential
endorsement of either Al Gore or Bill Bradley. Although the union
is meeting in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times front has only a
postage-stamp-sized reefer to its page B1 AFL-CIO story, choosing
instead to follow up on its Saturda the Mexican flood/mud
aftermath, a story nobody else fronts. The LAT's emphasis today is
on the spreading unrest among some 200,000 displaced survivors
demanding faster distribution of food and water. The New York
Times, which fronts the AFL-CIO, leads with the Clinton
adation's strong opposition to European Union thoughts of
supplying heating oil and other aid to Yugoslavia. The U.S.
concern, says the Times, is that such supplies might shore up
Slobodan Milosevic's political position by alleviating public
discontent. The line the U.S. has drawn is relieving ordinary
Serbians' suffering, yes, rebuilding Serbia, no. The Washington
Post, often thought to be hung up on the federal government,
homebodies in a big way, with three of its six front-pagers
twanging local instead. The paper stuffs the AFL-CIO convention and
leads with the resignation of the head of a Virginia county
government.
</P>
<P>
   USAT's AFL-CIO coverage lends plenty of credence to the idea
that the organization is genuinely undecided about Gore vs.
Bradley. In the third paragraph it quotes Gore saying he's
uncertain of the outcome and waits until the eighth to quote a
union official who thinks Gore has ``a good chance.'' By contrast,
both the NYT and WP say Gore is ``assured'' of the union's
endorsement. The WSJ is a bit less emphatic, saying that pro-Gore
union leaders now say they have the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Both USAT and the Post include an observation that impugns the
choice's significance: if the union does indeed make a choice now,
it will be its earliest endorsement since going for Walter Mondale.
(The WP says that was in 1983, USAT says 1984.)
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and USAT front the decision by Colt Manufacturing, a
leading maker of handguns (and, the NYT points out in a nice
historical touch, the inventor of the six-shooter), to abandon much
of its retail handgun business. The company will still sell to law
enforcement and the military but will basically stop selling
weapons to civilians who aren't collectors of old-style
commemorative guns. Apparently, the company's motivation is to
avoid legal liability and money damages possibly arising from
verdicts in any of the lawsuits currently being brought by various
local governments. The Colt shift was discovered by Newsweek, a
fact mentioned in the second paragraph at USAT, in the eighth at
the Times.
</P>
<P>
   An inside NYT piece by Felicity Barringer makes an observation
that raises deep questions about the media's true values: In the
week following the simultaneous breaking of well-researched
allegations of a U.S. massacre of civilians during the Korean war
and of the Jesse Ventura Playboy interview, less and less was said
about the former and more and more was said about the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ reports that the British government has instructed
physicians in the National Health Service not to prescribe the new
anti-flu drug from Glaxo. Given that this is what the headline
says, the reader might well conclude that the Brits believe that
the drug is dangerous. That's why it's a mistake for the Journal to
wait until the fifth paragraph to mention that the U.K. government
merely thinks that the drug isn't cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   The WP gives op-ed space to Pat Buchanan so that he can continue
to develop his foreign policy position on World War II. Der Patzer
tries to firm up his view that before Germany's declaration of war
on the U.S., it posed no strategic threat to this country, today
including an appeal to...Hitler, who said, ``Everything I undertake
is directed against Russia. If the West is too stupid and too blind
to comprehend that, I will be forced to come to an understanding
with the Russians, to smash the West and then after its defeat, to
turn against the Soviet Union.'' Gee, wonder why Buchanan didn't
quote the clearest thing Hitler ever said about his plans?--''The
Sudetenland is the last territorial claim I have to make in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAT fronts a report about tighter rules regarding personal
uses of office computers and how companies are increasingly using
sophisticated tracking technology to enforce them. Examples in the
story of concerns where the new technology and the worker
resentment it breeds are in evidence: AT&AMP;T, Pacific Bell, the FCC,
Delta Airlines, Exxon, the State Department, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, and Lockheed Martin. There's one company that
almost surely is a hotbed for this issue that the story makes no
mention of: the LAT.

FROM WILD WEST TO `KLEPTOCRACY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, observers proclaimed Russia as a Klondike of oil,
gold, and promise and predicted that the old communist giant would
head into the new millennium looking like a Western-style market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the decade that began with sanguine visions of a frontier of
opportunity is closing with a fin de siecle fear of corruption and
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   As an investigation into Russian money laundering through the
Bank of New York gained momentum last week, Russia seemed further
than ever from the heady assessments of years past, when headlines
touting ``reform'' hung over the country like a halo in a medieval
icon. Now Russian banks, firms, immigrants, and even the Kremlin
stand accused of tainting the global money system by moving
billions of dollars in ill-gotten gains out of Russia and into
Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   The change in image is dramatic, if only because corruption in
the vast country is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is mischaracterization of Russia a novel recent
phenomenon. From ``wild west'' and ``land of robber barons'' to
``free market economy'' and, now, ``Indonesian-style kleptocracy,''
the analogies and categories used to explain the country's tortured
transition from central planning to something not unlike a command
economy, yet not a traditional market, have widely missed the mark,
according to seasoned Russia watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Holmes, a professor of political science and Russia
specialist at Princeton University, says decision-makers, scholars,
and journalists have used familiar names and images ``as an
anesthetic, because it's too painful to say we don't understand the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a land where people are not paid wages yet continue to work,
where living standards have plummeted yet starvation and riots are
rare, and where barter, not cash, is the currency of domestic
business, comparisons to the familiar fail to capture a very
strange system indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear words like chaos used to describe things, it
means we haven't been able to identify the form of order; it's not
recognizable to us,'' says Holmes, who also teaches at New York
University Law School. ``It says more about our cognitive
disabilities than about Russia per se.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern observers are not alone in their perceptual shortcomings.
In his famous pronouncement that Russia was ``a riddle wrapped in a
mystery inside an enigma'' _ perhaps the most worn cliche ever used
to describe a nation _ Winston Churchill articulated the
bewilderment outsiders felt in attempting to fathom an unfamiliar
order. Indeed, the newest image of Russia as a ``gangster
economy,'' with tentacles in the global money network, is a dark
incarnation of Churchill's idea that Russia is unlike the orderly
and transparent West.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that the West viewed Russia's
post-communist odyssey as a messy version of American history.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet Union came apart at the seams in 1991,
observers took to calling Russia a ``wild west.'' Take heart, US
and European advisers told foreign investors: Today you haul in
bags of cash to set up joint ventures; tomorrow you will see Wall
Street on the Moscow River.
</P>
<P>
   Flourishing street trade and brisk privatization inspired books
with titles like ``How Russia Became a Market Economy'' and ``The
Coming Russian Boom.'' Dazzled economists declared curious
phenomena like barter and nonpayments a side show to the grand
transformation. The International Monetary Fund preached tight
monetary policies as it doled out $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Others saw a land of nascent Rockefellers and Carnegies.
Russia's new industrial titans, flush with assets acquired through
cozy deals with the government, would follow their 19th-century
robber-baron cousins and instinctively heed capitalism's call to
turn enterprises into profitable outfits that invested in
themselves and in their country's future.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, with dead executives piled up outside
Siberian aluminum smelters and privatization officials gunned down
in St. Petersburg, the country was branded a Chicago of the 1920s,
a gangland steppe.
</P>
<P>
   August 1998 ended the conceit that Russia had been following the
``laws'' of capitalist development. As the ruble collapsed and
Moscow underwent an unprecedented debt default, ``It destroyed the
last credibility of those who defended the West's assessments of
and policies for Russia,'' says Jerry Hough, professor of political
science at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that when money laundering charges surfaced
exactly one year later, the West was in no mood to see a reflection
of its own development. At House Banking Committee hearings in
Washington last month, Republican congressman Jim Leach of Iowa
declared that Russia was ``one of the world's most virulent
kleptocracies.''
</P>
<P>
   A stark assessment, considering Washington's strong support of
President Boris Yeltsin and his ``reformist'' efforts this decade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russia's freshly tarnished image reflects a growing
sense that the West's recipes for revival have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia may have free elections, a lively, independent press, and
bearable inflation, but the greater part of its 147 million
citizens live in what may be the greatest economic depression in
history. Critics like Holmes blame not crime but crippling fiscal
austerity prescriptions, and argue that Washington should have
orchestrated a Marshall Plan of humanitarian aid rather than trying
to micro-manage an economy and society it poorly understood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Moscow has made many mistakes in the last nine years.
Capital flight and tax evasion have impoverished state coffers.
There is little rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   But such flaws are not the same thing as organized crime and
money laundering. While organized crime is rampant in Russia, far
from all Russians are crooks. And as a growing number of scholars
argue, far from all phenomena that cannot be labeled ``market'' or
``reformist'' are criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money laundering is the wrong term to describe what has been
going on in Russia,'' Hough says.
</P>
<P>
   So what is going on?
</P>
<P>
   David Woodruff, a political scientist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, argues that the West got so mesmerized
with its prescriptions for capitalist changes that it missed the
real story: the development of what may be the world's largest
non-cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever its virtues, or its vices, the progress of market
reform is a dangerous narrative frame for anyone trying to make
sense of the course of Russian politics and economics,'' Woodruff
writes in ``Money Unmade: Barter and the Fate of Russian
Capitalism.'' Instead, he argues, the focus should be on the use of
barter and non-cash payments by Russia's 89 regions and large
industrial enterprises to conduct ordinary business.
</P>
<P>
   But getting economists and policy makers to analyze why oil
refineries pay workers with sausages, instead of analyzing exchange
rates and balanced budgets, is tough.
</P>
<P>
   The current climate of angst about ``dirty'' Russian money won't
help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West was overly romantic in its expectations of what would
happen in Russia,'' said Jeremy Azriel of the Rand Corp., a think
tank. ``But now there is a real danger that the Russian business
community will be so thoroughly tarred and feathered that a lot of
honest people will be put out of business.''

WHEN A NAME BECOMES SLUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For eons, it seems, the residents of this massive
metropolis have lived grudgingly with the colloquial label of
``chilango'' _ an encapsulation of the gruff, arrogant, whiny, and
world-revolves-around-us attitude that makes them widely disliked
beyond their polluted and crime-ridden city limits.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a new edition of a prominent Spanish-language
dictionary has, for the first time, elevated ``chilango'' into
Latin America's official lexicon. In its entry for Mexico City, the
Orthography of the Spanish Language, which is compiled by the Royal
Spanish Academy, includes a reference to its inhabitants as
``chilangos'' for males and ``chilangas'' for females.
</P>
<P>
   To many people here, though, the name _ and its appearance in a
hardcover reference book _ is equivalent to a slur, and has sent
tremors through the city's intellectual and talk-radio circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that it's not an appropriate name, but there
is no other,'' Gonzalo Celorio, a writer and professor at the
National Autonomous University told the Mexico City daily La
Jornada, which broke the story last week in a lamenting article
that took up almost a full page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chilango'' has historically been used in a negative context,
and most often by people from other parts of Mexico who love to
complain that the capital _ which holds roughly 20 percent of the
country's 96 million residents _ gets too much attention and money
at the expense of the poorer provinces.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find a US equivalent to this Mexican moniker.
Americans gripe about pushy New Yorkers, provincial Bostonians, or
laid-back Californians, but ``chilango'' takes all the best and
worst qualities of a population _ aggressive, demanding, slimy, and
calumnious _ and wraps them into one word.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike racial, ethnic, or religious labels, which can
reflect a cultural attitude, a ``chilango'' can be someone from
just about any origin, so long as he was born in or acts like
someone from Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the social competition between the provinces and the
capital, but it is a type of insult,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet
and president of PEN, an international writers group, who, despite
having lived here for the past 40 years, doesn't consider himself a
``chilango.''
</P>
<P>
   There are varying theories for the name's origin. Some say
``chilango'' is loosely rooted in a Mexican profanity that is used
to describe everything from sex, rape, or a conquest, or that it
refers to Mexicans' love of spicy food loaded with chile peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, offered by the Mexican writer Carlos
Monsivais, is that the name came from fishermen _ sometimes called
``huachinangos'' _ from Veracruz state who, beginning in the
mid-1800s, gave their city-slicker clients the same name they used
to refer to their slippery and sometimes dirty catch.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the controversy over ``chilango'' may be more about
age than place. Most older people _ like those who aired their
complaints on radio shows last week _ bristle at the label, while
today's younger generations proudly wear the name like a defiant
badge.
</P>
<P>
   But like it or not, Monsivais said, ``chilango'' is here to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should be so upset, especially because
there's no other word that better describes us,'' he said. ``It's a
name that has become indispensable and won't be substituted for
something else.''

   SCIENCE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NOBEL-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Dr. Guenter Blobel, a cellular
and molecular biologist at Rockefeller University, is awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that proteins
carry signals that act as ZIP codes, helping them find their
correct locations within the cell. The research has had an
``immense impact'' on studies of the cell, the assembly said, and
helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind diseases like cystic
fibrosis. Blobel, 63, was born in Germany and earned his Ph.D. at
the University of Wisconsin. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>
   TIGER-REVIVAL (Undated) _ Like a furred phoenix rising from the
ashes, or a creature cognizant of its nine-lifetime warranty, the
tiger has come back. Far from disappearing, the tiger in some parts
of its range in Asia is practically thriving, its numbers
measurably greater today than just a few years ago. And though
conservationists who have long battled to save the tiger warn
against complacency and emphasize that the tiger is still
endangered, they admit to an unusual sensation these days:
optimism. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ANNIVERSARY (Undated) _ The Internet revolution began
quietly 30 years ago this month. With one scarcely noticed
milestone after another, the planetary nervous system envisioned in
the early '60s _ cyber rhetoric is as old as a Beatles tune _
unceremoniously began insinuating itself into society. A strange
amalgam of Defense Department money, engineering expertise, and
even a dab of countercultural idealism, slowly brought on the Net
we know today. By By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   WAVE-OBSERVATORY (Undated) _ A whisper from one of the most
exotic events in the universe could be among the first detections
when a new, $350 million gravity wave observatory begins operating
next year. The event is the violent merger of a pair of black
holes, a cataclysm that throws off ripples in the fabric of space
called gravitational waves or, more simply, gravity waves. It was
to detect such waves that physicists designed the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which will
be dedicated on November 11 and begin a shakedown period of initial
operations in January of next year. By James Glanz.

</P>
<P>
   DRUG-REACTIONS (Undated) _ Doses of prescriptions recommended in
the Physicians Desk Reference may be too high for many people and
may cause adverse reactions, ranging from dizziness and nausea all
the way to death, according to an article published last month in
the journal Postgraduate Medicine. For many drugs _ including
Viagra, Prozac and some medicines used to treat high blood
pressure, allergies, insomnia and high cholesterol _ smaller doses
would work just as well as the standard ones, with far less risk of
bad reactions, said the author of the article. By Denise Grady.

As for living with quakes, she explains that good roofs protect

speed'' and say the herb, ephedra, is too easily abused. By Mary

<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to see the dilemma school vouchers present for the
Democratic establishment? Ask Al Gore why, given the growing
minority-community support for the idea, he's against letting
parents use public dollars for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the choice were between a continued gradualism (in school
improvement) and radical departures like vouchers, then I might
throw my hand in with them, just out of a feeling that we can't
lose another generation and so throw the kitchen sink at it,'' the
vice president says.
</P>
<P>
   So would Gore then stipulate that if public education hasn't
made marked improvements in, say, five years _ more than another
high school generation _ he would support vouchers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to give up on public schools or give you a date
. . . because I am not going to surrender,'' Gore replies.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, lip service aside, Gore's hypothetical is a
demand without a deadline, a someday that will never come.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vice president's reply demonstrates the political
crosscurrents on vouchers, a policy proposal rapidly making the
transition from conservative nostrum to mainstream acceptability.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is simple. Not only do vouchers empower parents and
pupils, but by injecting competition into the system, they do more
to stimulate improvement in the public schools than any top-down
government edict.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the conservative origin of the idea _ economist
Milton Friedman first offered it the 1950s as a way to apply market
principles to education _ the political left has traditionally
treated the proposal as though it were radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   Undergirding Democratic establishment opposition is the fact
that vouchers are anathema to the teachers unions; the two largest
_ the National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers _ endorsed Gore last week. And vouchers represent one more
victory for privatization, at the cost of a public institution.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the idea is increasingly popular with
black and Latino voters, whose children are disproportionately
trapped in underperforming urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers' appeal among minority voters is one reason vouchers
have finally arrived on the public agenda as a realistic policy
proposal. And arrive they have.
</P>
<P>
   Under Governor Jeb Bush, Florida this year enacted a voucher
plan for pupils in its worst schools. Milwaukee has had a voucher
plan since 1990 for low-income students, and has included religious
schools since 1995; Ohio passed a voucher program for Cleveland in
1995; in 1998, Congress passed _ and President Clinton vetoed _
vouchers for the District of Columbia. In New Mexico, Governor Gary
Johnson, a Republican, has made enacting a voucher program such a
priority he's attracted international attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light bulbs are going off,'' declares Johnson. ``People are
talking about this issue everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   More impetus has come from the private sector. Since 1992, 69
private programs have sprung up across the country, providing $275
million in voucher scholarships for more than 100,000
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But the market test of any idea is a political campaign, and
it's there one can best see the growing appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive proposal has come from John McCain, the
Arizona senator running for the GOP presidential nomination, who
has called for a three-yearbillion demonstration project to
provide 1 million vouchers for economically disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously something that has gained popularity and
support within the inner city,'' said McCain. ``The indications are
that they work, and that's why I'm saying we ought to have a test
voucher program.''
   Among McCain's Republican rivals, Texas Governor George W. Bush
last month said he favored letting disadvantaged students in poorly
performing schools use federal Title 1 money for private-school
tuition. Last week, he proposed allowing states to use as much as
$2 billion in federal block grants for voucher programs and for
establishing tax-free accounts that could be used for
private-school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes is a strong advocate of vouchers, and
former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, like Bush, wants to give
states the option of using federal dollars for such programs.
</P>
<P>
   But vouchers aren't just for Republicans anymore. Bill Bradley,
the former New Jersey senator challenging Gore for the Democratic
presidential nomination, has supported vouchers in the past as a
way to give poor children an alternative to particularly dangerous,
drug-ridden schools.
</P>
<P>
   And despite news reports that he's backed off that support,
Bradley, in a recent Globe interview, said he hadn't abandoned the
idea. The key issue for Bradley is whether the resulting
competition improves the public schools; to that end, he's watching
the programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to eliminate any possible thing that I can do
to improve the public schools,'' says Bradley, who says he would
emulate Franklin D. Roosevelt's model of selective policy
experimentation. ``When I am president, I am going to try this, I
am going to try that, but we are going to improve urban public
schools,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's position reflects a growing mainstream interest. In
July, The Atlantic Monthly argued that the access, equity, and
individual choice that vouchers offer make them an important idea
for progressives. And in the Oct. 4 New Republic, Paul Peterson, a
government professor at Harvard, makes a liberal case for vouchers,
saying that fears schools would ``cherry pick'' the best students
simply haven't been borne out in the much-watched private voucher
program offered to low-income children in San Antonio's Edgewood
School District.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have other dire predictions of disaster been born out.
</P>
<P>
   If vouchers haven't proved a cure-all, most reviews of the
Milwaukee and Cleveland programs have recorded widespread parental
satisfaction. And of the five big studies done so far of those
programs, ``all but one finds significant positive effects on
academic performance,'' says Jay Greene, an assistant professor of
government at the University of Texas at Austin, who has worked on
several of those evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   As for the effect on the public schools _ Bradley's test _
there's growing evidence that voucher competition in Milwaukee,
Cleveland, and even in Florida's incipient program has pushed the
public schools to do better.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he has seen the same result from the competition
charter schools have brought to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   So why, among the serious candidates, is Gore the lone holdout
on vouchers?
</P>
<P>
   In his visit to the Globe last week, Gore cited these concerns:
Vouchers would drain money from the public schools; private schools
lack sufficient capacity to replace the public schools; private
academies wouldn't take poor children; vouchers would pay for
``only a fraction'' of tuition and would exclude those with special
needs or disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The last is a real (though hardly insuperable) concern. But
voucher supporters answer each of the others with convincing
counterarguments. To wit: The threat of losing public dollars is
essential to creating competition; the aim isn't to replace public
schools but to foster improvement through competition, though
private-school capacity would increase as demand grew.
</P>
<P>
   And far from excluding low-income students, the Cleveland and
Milwaukee programs, as well as the Bush and McCain proposals,
target that very population. Finally, vouchers would be inadequate
only if one hopes to attend elite boarding schools like Groton or
Middlesex or St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the figures published by the federal government
itself, on average, private school costs half as much as public
school per year,'' says Andrew Coulson, author of ``Market
Education.'' For 1996, for example, the average private school
tuition was $3,116, compared to an average per pupil cost of $6,653
in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is the one Steve Wollmer, spokesman for the
National Education Association, identifies: Any realistic voucher
program must rely heavily on religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take religious schools out of the equation, we don't
even have the discussion,'' says Wollmer, whose organization
opposes vouchers. ``So what this is really about is whether we are
going to use public dollars to fund religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly right: It's the religious schools that make a
voucher system work. So should public dollars go for religious
schools? On the constitutional question, there's some expectation
the US Supreme Court may take up vouchers this term.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents point to powerful policy parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as resources are put in the hands of parents rather
than schools directly, I don't see any difference between taking a
voucher to a private high school and taking a Pell Grant to Boston
College,'' says Jim Peyser, chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education. (That said, the stricter Massachusetts state
Constitution would clearly have to be changed to allow use of state
dollars for such a program.) Perhaps the best way to think about
the question may be to return to Al Gore's rhetorical choice. It's
been 16 years since the Reagan administration's blue-ribbon
commission issued its famous report, ``A Nation at Risk,''
declaring that America faced ``a rising tide of mediocrity that
threatens our very future as a nation and as a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, only an optimist would say the nation's schools have
made even the gradual progress Gore says could finally drive him to
vouchers. As for urban schools, well, the latest National
Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that, at best, only 40
percent of urban students had reached a basic level of achievement
in reading, math, and science.
</P>
<P>
   It is against such a reality that voters have to judge Gore's
claim that the nation is poised for ``dramatic'' school improvement
_ the kind that would make vouchers unnecessary.

COLORFUL CAST GATHERING FOR REFORM PARTY SCRAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Minutes after Boston lawyer Robert LaMarca
strolled into the Reform Party's state convention the other day, he
was minted as a member of the party and a delegate to its national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Casting an eye over the delegates milling about a hotel
conference room, it didn't him take much longer to sum up the
movement he'd joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chaos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos with consequences _ and characters. Born of H. Ross
Perot's willpower and wealth, the Reform Party, with its claim on
millions in federal matching funds and the potential to alter the
outcome of the 2000 presidential race, already has attracted one of
the oddest arrays of political personalities in the history of
American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the players already in the fray or preening at
ringside.
</P>
<P>
   In the far corner glowers Jesse ``The Mouth'' Ventura, the
Minnesota governor and former boa-feathered wrestler who says he
wants to be reborn as a bra and scorns organized religion as ``a
crutch for weak-minded people.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the canvas glares Patrick J. Buchanan, the Catholic
conservative who promises that his ``pitchfork brigade'' will
return the Lord's Prayer to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   And here comes Donald J. Trump, the deep-pocketed developer who
has long considered politics too dirty because it meant shaking
germ-laden hands.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this in Perot's dream of a third-party
juggernaut: The Mouth, The Christian Soldier, and The Donald are
ready to rumble for the soul of the party, a free-for-all that
could have life-or-death implications for the movement.
</P>
<P>
   To the distress of Republican front-runner George W. Bush,
Buchanan is poised to bolt from the GOP and defy Ventura by chasing
the Reform presidential nomination. In his quest, Buchanan may win
the help of a startling new soul mate _ Lenora B. Fulani, a
self-described New York leftist who controls a pivotal bloc of
Reform activists, even as she fends off criticism that she is,
among other things, ``a Marxist crackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   As Buchanan and Fulani broke bread last week at a restaurant
facing Central Park, Trump was around the corner on Fifth Avenue
answering Ventura's call to plan an exploratory campaign in pursuit
of the Reform nomination. And Perot was home in Texas with his own
untold intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The list doesn't end there. The lineup of other possible
contenders or draftees for top spots on the Reform ticket includes
actor Warren Beatty and actress Cybill Shepherd, and US
Representative James A. Traficant Jr., an Ohio Democrat renowned
for his ``Made in America'' tirades on the House floor. Traficant
has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker,'' Traficant thundered in 1996, ``I say it is time
for American consumers to tell Nike to take a hikey.''
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the party's presidential contest will be
Ventura's personal choice for party chairman, Jack Gargan, a
68-year-old poker-playing, pool-shooting maverick who makes no
secret that he has ``an eye for the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are my good points,'' said Gargan, who will play a
key role in determining who wins the Reform nomination and its
$12.6 million ``honeypot'' of matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, in an interview, said he worries about the party's
survival. Because Perot faltered in 1996, securing only 8.4 percent
of the presidential vote after seizing 19 percent in 1992, the
Reform movement risks lurching toward irrelevance with a lackluster
performance in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say this, but all the factions in this party that
I was hoping to bring together are just getting spread further
apart,'' Gargan said. ``I feel like I'm riding a tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the party's treasure trove of federal funds is likely to
keep the Reform candidate viable until the November election, long
after all but the final Democratic and Republican candidates have
left the national stage. And if the Reform candidate fares well, he
could influence the outcome of the presidential race, if not win
it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those prospects, some of Buchanan's fellow conservative
commentators have sounded the alarm, warning him not to leave the
GOP fold. The Reform Party is ``a dysfunctional fringe movement in
the midst of an identity crisis,'' Oliver North wrote last week in
his syndicated column. ``The net effect of Pat throwing his lot
with this cast of characters will be to finish, at best, in second
place in the 2000 presidential contest, and to commit himself to
the political equivalent of a padded room.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, evidence abounds that this will be a wild season in
Reform politics. Ventura figuratively bared all in the November
issue of Playboy, defending the Navy in the Tailhook
sexual-harassment scandal (``much ado about nothing'') and
advocating the decriminalization of drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   He has ignored a letter from Perot's leadership team asking him
to leave the Reform movement because his Playboy comments ``about
religion, sexual assault, overweight people, drugs, prostitution,
women's undergarments, and many other subjects do not represent the
values, principles, and ethics upon which this party is built.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buchanan ``is in the bunker,'' aides said, fending
off charges that his new book shows him to be soft on Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Trump rushed onto ``Larry King Live'' Thursday to muse about
Oprah Winfrey as his possible running mate: ``She's popular, she's
brilliant, she's a wonderful woman. . . . She'd be sort of like me.
I mean, I have a lot of things going, and she's got a lot of things
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani has been on CNN and other news outlets, talking up the
Reform Party and talking down assertions by the Anti-Defamation
League that she springs from a cult-like movement that has espoused
anti-Semitism. Fulani ran for president in 1988 and 1992 as leader
of the New Alliance Party, which merged with the Reform Party in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Fulani said she is focused on party-building
rather than ideology, although she called Buchanan's overtures to
her ``a funeral for social conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani also bristled at assertions stemming from her association
with the New Alliance Party. ``I am not an anti-Semite,'' she said.
``I feel very uncomfortable with how people throw those things
around. Basically, I feel hurt and misjudged, and people don't know
what the hell they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is going to be an interesting year for those tracking
the Reform Party. Just ask Frank Coppinger, a former state
representative from West Roxbury who recently abandoned his
Democratic roots and joined the party of Perot, Ventura, and
company.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the Massachusetts chapter's Worcester gathering
last Sunday, Coppinger offered his prediction: ``This is going to
be one of the craziest elections you'll ever see.''

A REPUBLICAN DEFEAT IN HMO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the one group in the nation most in need of health care
is the Republican leadership in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering setbacks from a series of self-inflicted
political wounds during their stubborn opposition to a proposed
patients bill of rights, the GOP leadership and other Republican
extremists in the House of Representatives were virtually trampled
last week by the Democratic-led vote of 275 to 151 to approve the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory for the patient protection bill, which
includes a patient's right to sue a health plan in state courts,
underscores the growing public support for this grass-roots
movement to protect patients from health maintenance organizations
and other managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of this strong measure are optimistic that a
patients' rights bill will pass the Senate and, when all is done,
will remain strong enough for President Clinton, a staunch backer
of the House bill, to sign into law.
</P>
<P>
   As Edward M. Kennedy, who sponsored a patient protection bill in
the Senate that was the basis for the House-passed version, said,
``The Senate flunked the test in July, but the House has given us a
new chance to do the right thing.'' And the right thing is for the
House-Senate conference to adopt the House bill but without the
costly tax breaks that Republican extremists managed to tack on in
an apparent effort to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who backed the House bill no doubt are aware that
many voters will view Republicans who fought the bill as on the
side of the medical/insurance establishment, and lawmakers who
backed the bill as on the side of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the list of protections the House bill provides is the
right to see specialists, the right to independent review of health
plan denials, guaranteed payment for emergency care, and, of
course, the right to sue a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The much-weaker Senate bill _ passed in July with the backing of
the managed care industry _ provides protections only to the 48
million Americans in plans regulated by federal law. The
House-passed bill covers all Americans, more than 161 million, with
private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The right-to-sue issue appears to be at the crux of the
Republican opposition to the House-passed measure. The House bill
allows patients to sue in state courts, and it lifts the federal
ban on lawsuits for patients in health plans that fall under
federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the House bill argue that giving patients the right to
sue will produce more lawsuits that in turn will force up the cost
of health premiums _ a hardship on working families.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument rings hollow, given how little interest HMOs
and other managed care companies have shown in protecting working
families. They are out to protect the interests, and the profits,
of the health insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The right to sue is essential because so many patients have been
seriously injured _ or have died _ because of badly managed HMOs,
and they or their families have had virtually no legal recourse.
</P>
<P>
   And there is little reason to believe GOP arguments that waves
of frivolous lawsuits will result from the House-passed bill. Texas
two years ago passed legislation that is a model for the
House-approved bill. Since enacted, according to backers of the
House bill, the Texas law has resulted in five lawsuits, with the
possibility that two of them might be withdrawn. The one that went
forward involved a pyschiatric patient who didn't want to leave the
hospital, fearing he would kill himself. The health plan
nonetheless discharged him even earlier than his scheduled date.
When he committed suicide by drinking anti-freeze, his widow sued.
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws have been passed in California and Missouri,
reflecting the growing movement for state and federal protections
for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Many other patients harmed while under HMO care did not get any
help because they either had no right to appeal, or were not
informed that they did. Both the state law in Texas and the
House-passed bill spell out those rights.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of evidence that a flood of lawsuits will flow
from the right to sue, the GOP's scare tactic about higher costs
can be dismissed. In fact, one insurance company executive recently
acknowledged that his plan would not charge higher premiums to
patients if legislation gave patients the right to sue. And an
examination of costs in right-to-sue venues showed only a 3-cent
monthly increase in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most supporters, as well as some enlightened
insurers, see the right-to-sue clause as a deterrent against HMOs
mistreating patients.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to the House-Senate conference committee to agree on
a measure close to the House bill. It is something most Americans
want and need. Once it passes Congress, some GOP extremists may
finally realize that embracing the patients' rights bill could have
saved their own political lives _ but for them it will be too late.

WHEN DO FISH SLEEP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do fish sleep at night?
</P>
<P>
   G.W. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bailey, Curator of Fishes at the New England Aquarium,
says that fish don't sleep they way we think of sleep. In the
fish-eat-fish underwater world, the challenges of survival require
more creative ways of resting than just shutting down for eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish usually rest for just minutes at a time, kind of like cat
naps,'' Bailey says. And most species don't zonk out into a deep
sleep. They'll find a protect somewhere and slow their
metabolism down.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell when a fish is sleeping, since they never close
their eyes? (They don't have eyelids. Sharks have membranes they
roll down over they eyes, but only to protect them while they're
feeding.) Parrot fish find a sheltered spot in the reef they
inhabit, and secrete a mucous cocoon around themselves, to keep
their scent in so they won't be attacked while resting.
</P>
<P>
   Trigger fish back in to a crack in a reef or between some rocks,
and trigger a set of spines to shoot out, wedging themselves in to
the crack. Then they can safely turn down their metabolism, since a
predator can't pull them out without ripping the rocks out of place
too.
</P>
<P>
   Brightly colored reef fish, like angel, goat, butterfly, or
surgeon fish, turn their colors down when they rest. ``Their brain
generates those colors, stimulating chromatophore cells. They use
the color to communicate during the day,'' Bailey says. ``They
don't need to communicate when they rest, and they're safer if they
blend into the environment, so they just shut that off at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fish are nocturnal, active at night, and do their resting
during the day. Moray eels, soldier fish, and squirrel fish, use
their large eyes to do their feeding at night, then drop to depths
of 2-300 feet during the day and find caves and crevices to rest
in.
</P>
<P>
   Some fish go to school when they rest. Mackerel, cod, and
haddock ``normally don't have much use for each other during the
day,'' Bailey says. But at night they form into schools. Bailey
says these groups don't behave the way schools of fish do when
they're awake, actively swimming about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They join together because when their individual sensory
systems are turned down, the overall protective sensory power of
the group is greater than that of any one individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fish that school when they're active, swim off as
individuals to find tiny nooks and crannies in the rocks or reefs
for protection while they rest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ``grabber sleepers.'' Remoras attach to their
host, go into a resting state while riding along wherever their
host goes, and, as Bailey says, ``they're on the train to breakfast
when the host starts feeding,'' providing the scraps the remoras
feed on. In New England's turbulent ocean waters, some small fish,
and juveniles, attach to sea plants that are rooted to the ocean
floor, or to rocks, to keep from drifting off.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a bit about the myth that sharks never sleep. Wrong.
Some,urse sharks and reef tip sharks, reach very deep
metabolic slowdown. They'll find some sheltered place and reach
such a deep state of rest that predators can attack them easily.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ram ventilators,'' sharks that have to keep swimming to
force oxygenated water over their gills so they can breathe,
include the great white, mako, blue, whale, and basking sharks.
Bailey says they rest by shutting down one or two systems at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   How do they keep swimming? ``They're designed to keep that
system operating all the time. It's like our heart. It slows down,
but it never stops,'' Bailey explains.

PARTISAN POLITICS HELPS DERAIL A JUDGE'S NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was ugly _ as all displays of raw, purely partisan politics
in the Senate are.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more ugly because it was tinged by race _ not the
overt insensitivity that is easy to shout about, but the subtle
kind to which all white people remain prone and which forms the
real foundation of the country's continuing shame.
</P>
<P>
   With New England's six Republican senators in a crucial role
without apparently realizing it, a partisan 55-45 vote last week
rejected the first African-American judge on the Missouri Supreme
Court for a US district court vacany after more than two years of
unconscionable limbo and two approving votes by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronnie White's nomination was headed for approval as
recently as last week, when Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi used his weekly party caucus lunch to launch a party
loyalty crusade on behalf of embattled Senator John Ashcroft of
Missouri, a prominent social issue conservative who is pushing
every divisive hot-button on the issue console to save his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the New Englanders aren't worth attention. Judd Gregg
(Republican) and Bob Smith (newly Independent) of New Hampshire are
pretty consistent partisan and ideological go-alongs; some days
they act like the same person.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Jeffords of Vermont, John Chaffee of Rhode Island, and
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine have richly deserved
reputations for thoughtful independence, well-maintained relations
across the aisle, and dilligent work. When they go along, it's
worth paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Their votes were key because they helped provide cover for a
decisive fifth vote from a far more culpable moderate, Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, who had twice voted favorably on Judge
White in the Judiciary Committee, as had chairman Orrin Hatch and
Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   None of the New England Four had so much as a syllable to utter
before, during or after the Senate's highly publicized action.
Later, when asked for reasons, only Collins' office was silent.
</P>
<P>
   The one common reason they cited was a tradition of deference to
the position of the senators from the state involved, especially
when the senators are from their political party. Given the chaos
of legislative life, this is a position that deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   This point was especially well made on behalf of John Chaffee,
whose policy it also is not to let the judicial philosophy of a
particular nominee (even if the senator disagrees with it) affect
that deference.
</P>
<P>
   His position, however, is fatally undercut by the role played in
this fiasco by Ashcroft's Missouri colleague, Christopher Bond. In
his re-election campaign last year, Bond worked hard in the black
community to get a third of its vote, in part by trumpeting his
highly favorable view of Judge White. And Bond appeared in person
to introduce the judge with appropriate encomiums when he appeared
before the Judiciary Committee two years ago, and his support was a
matter of record when President Clinton renominated Judge White
after the current Congress commenced work last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ashcroft did not actively oppose Judge White until this
summer, at which point Bond began to waver publicly. This flagrant
flip-flopping should have been a red flag for senators to put aside
their usual deference to inquire more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although deference to home-state senators is
appropriate, there should be greater deference to the actions of
the Judiciary Committee, which not only did the leg work on Judge
White's background but twice sent his nomination along in
bipartisan votes of support.
</P>
<P>
   The word from Jim Jeffords is that he had no idea the judge is
African-American until after vote. If Jeffords said he had seen
extra-terrestials in Burlington, my first impulse would be to
believe him, but he should have known it, given the last-minute
eruption of controversy driven by Lott and Ashcroft. Even casual
inquiry would have disclosed the judge's race.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact is, tellingly, that minority judicial nominees in
this Congress have been more than twice as unsuccessful as whites.
And the vote to reject Judge White was going to be the first to
reject a nomination in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Only Olympia Snowe took a shot at the judge. She said she was
``particularly concerned'' about two cases where he ``refused to
uphold jury verdicts even in the most egregious cases.'' This
dovetails with Ashcroft's more flamboyant assaults on him as
``pro-criminal'' and ``insufficiently supportive'' of the death
penalty, which border on defamation.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint is not simply that he has supported capital
punishment in nearly three-fourths of the supreme court cases he
helped decide, nor that a majority of his votes to overturn death
sentences were part of court majorities. The real point is that it
is never fair comment to judge an appellate decision on the
brutality of the underlying crime.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is not Judge White's record but the extent to
which the Ashcroft and Bond political flip-flops should influence
other senators.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever an incident happens that picks at the scab over
America's deep racial wound, the big question is rarely about what
bad people or no-count people do; it's what good people do that
matter most.
</P>
<P>
   And in this ugly mess, the New England Four didn't help; they
enabled.

KNOW YOUR BMI , THEN YOU CAN FUDGE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you know your BMI? No?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday I asked 10 people if they knew their own BMI. Not one
of them did. Five of them didn't know what a BMI is. The other five
knew, but didn't know theirs. Two of the five said they'd prefer
not to know their own BMI. I can't blame them. I'm not exactly
thrilled to know mine.
</P>
<P>
   A BMI isn't a new kind of luxury automobile. BMI doesn't stand
for Barely Making It, although in certain cases, my own for
example, it might apply.
</P>
<P>
   BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It's the latest thing in
diet-speak, a fancy way of indicating how fat you are. Instead of
saying, ``I need to lose 15 pounds,'' you say, ``My BMI is reaching
crisis levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about your BMI sounds impressive because instead of just
whining about your weight, you're taking a serious interest in your
health.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the BMI was much in the news. A study of more than 1
million Americans by the American Cancer Society, reported in the
New England Journal of Medicine, found ``compelling and
irrefutable'' evidence of a link between excess weight and a higher
risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   According to this study, 55 percent of Americans are overweight.
More of us are fat now than ever before. But we knew that. All we
have to do is look around to see that we've become the super-size
nation. Which brings us back to the BMI.
</P>
<P>
   The higher your BMI, the grimmer your prospects. The study
reported a gradually increasing risk of death beginning with a BMI
of 25, except among black women. For reasons as yet unknown to
science, black women with sky-high BMIs were at no more risk than
their slimmer sisters. Researchers are looking into it. Meanwhile,
55 percent of the rest of us are on the old treadmill to oblivion,
and the pace picks up with every pound.
</P>
<P>
   You may ask: Why do I need to find out my BMI? I know I'm fat.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's only a matter of hours before everybody's BMI
becomes crucial conversation fodder. You'd better determine what
yours is pretty quickly, so you'll be prepared to lie about it.
Knowing your BMI probably won't make it any easier to lose weight,
but being able to talk knowledgeably about your BMI will give the
impression that you're making a serious, informed effort to get
fit, even if you're not.
</P>
<P>
   Determining your BMI is simplicity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Step one: Convert your weight in pounds to kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Got that? No?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it's done. Divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. The
resulting figure is your weight in kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Step two: Convert your height from inches to meters.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this easy? It's not?
</P>
<P>
   OK. First determine your height in inches. Then divide that
figure by 39.37. Presto. Your height in meters.
</P>
<P>
   Step three: Square your height in meters, then divide your
weight in kilograms by your height squared.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it. You should have your BMI. Those doing
the figuring by hand may want to take a doughnut break. You've
earned it.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, your calculations will have produced a BMI
somewhere between 1 and 50. Lower is better, health-wise. A figure
between 15 and 25 is normal. Between 25.1 and 30, you're
overweight. Anything over 30 is obese.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? You may want to do something about lowering your BMI.
Or you may just want to talk about it. Either way, you're prepared.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' _ Too little, too late.
This marketer's dream is a lightweight compared with Brian
DePalma's nightmarish original. Released in 1976, ``Carrie''
features Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in a mother-daughter matchup
worthy of Joan and Christina Crawford. Rent that instead of this
sorry successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob the Liar'' _ Forget about Robin Williams in ``Jakob the
Liar.'' This 1977 German original, directed by Frank Beyer, is the
version to see. The remarkable story of a storyteller who keeps
alive the dreams of concentration-camp prisoners is told with
unsentimental skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare's Women &AMP; Claire Bloom'' _ The marvelous
exploration of a great playwright led by an exceptional actress
proves that educational and entertaining are not mutually
exclusive. Great family viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gulliver's Travels'' _ Max Fleischer, Paramount's version of
Walt Disney, made the 1939 animated classic with great technical
skill and faithfulness to the Jonathan Swift tale. The newly
remastered version gives younger viewers a good idea what great
classic animation looks like, with its marvelous attention to
details.

INDEX FUNDS SHOULD HELP PAY OFF STUDENT LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 49-year-old single woman who recently finished
graduate school. Currently I earn $32,000 a year. I live in an
apartment, and the only debt I have is $20,000 in student loans
that have interest rates between 7.66 percent and 8.26 percent. I
have a combined amount of $2,200 in my savings and checking
accounts. Recently I received a $60,000 inheritance, which I was
considering using to pay off my entire student loan. I can save at
least $400 a month. I would like to know where and how to invest
this inheritance and future moneys. I would like some ideas to
insure a comfortable life in retirement. My Social Security is
estimated at $7,000 a year, based on my past employment.
</P>
<P>
   M.B., Northampton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You'll have to save pretty aggressively to achieve that
comfortable retirement, but the $60,000 inheritance certainly gives
you a nice leg up. Given that building your retirement account
should be your primary focus, I'd abandon the idea of prepaying the
student loans. If you invest the money for long-term growth, the
returns should exceed the interest level on the student loans.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to put the money in Vanguard index funds.
I suggest you explore two avenues. The first is direct ownership of
funds in taxable accounts, and the second is using variable annuity
accounts, which will defer the taxes on the growth within the
account. Thinking about taxes is important, because if you invest
the money now and embark upon a program of adding $400 a month to
your retirement savings, you would amass $456,164 by age 65, a
projection which assumes 10 percent average annual portfolio
growth. In the final year of that projection, you would be
contributing the same $400 a month as now, but more than $41,000
would be added through internal growth.
</P>
<P>
   If your portfolio growth is taxed each year as it is realized,
you could well reach a point that you would have to withdraw money
from the fund accounts to pay the taxes they generate. But with the
variable annuities, you'd face tax liabilities (only on the
internal growth of the account) only when it is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to divide your investments 50-50 between
variable annuities and taxable accounts. I suggest a portfolio made
up of 50 percent Vanguard Index 500, and 16 2/3 percent each in
Vanguard Mid-Cap Index, Vanguard Small-Cap Index, and Vanguard
Balanced Index.
</P>
<P>
   As for your additional savings, I suggest you start by putting
$166 a month of your extra income into a Roth IRA invested in
Fidelity Health Care fund. While Roth IRAs do not provide you with
the tax deduction you can get from traditional IRAs, they
compensate for this by allowing withdrawal of all funds --
including the growth within the account -- on a tax-free basis once
you reach your retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining $233 to be saved, Id suggest a good proven
value-oriented stock fund such as Vanguard Windsor II or Vanguard
Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   A few final pointers: Since winning your graduate degree should
propel you into as higher earning capacity, calculate your current
retirement savings as a percentage of your income, and then
increase the dollar savings level by applying the same percentage
of your earnings each time you get a raise. If you become eligible
to participate in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan or any other tax-deferred
savings plan, join it, whether or not your employer matches your
contributions. Like the variable annuity accounts, this will defer
the taxes on this money until you are in your non-earning
retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, treat the retirement savings program as a discipline --
you are starting pretty late, and you can't afford to miss a
payment or two from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been tempted to invest in high-yield uninsured
certificates such as are advertised in the enclosed clipping. They
pay between 8.5 percent and 10 percent interest. I've received the
companies statements and still cant decide if its safe enough. I
have a large amount of money in Vanguards Prime Money Market fund,
which pays 4.9 percent interest, but that is also not insured,
although I don't lose sleep about it. What do you think of the
offers represented in the clip?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Saylorsburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think much of it, to be honest. When you read the
fine print, you see that the advertised rates are teasers. For
example, in the ad you sent, the company offered a 7.79 percent
yield if you invested $50,000 or more, or a 7.25 percent yield if
you invested as little as $5,000. But the catch is that this rate
only applies until Jan. 15, 2000 -- after that the rate will be
adjusted weekly.
</P>
<P>
   So while the headline on the advertisement proposes that you
lock in the high rates, the lock quickly comes off and you then
will have a variable-rate certificate. If you invested the $5,000
minimum you would be only $30 ahead of the yield on the Vanguard
money market fund, assuming it held at the level it was at when you
wrote. Actually, it would probably be less than $30, since the
Prime Money Market funds yield has risen to 5.07 percent as this is
written.
</P>
<P>
   What I suggest you do is go through the literature you have been
sent, seeking to determine first what yields these certificates
have actually paid after the lock in period has expired, and
second, what is the credit quality of the ultimate borrowers. My
guess is that the closer you look, the less attractive these
instruments are.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are beginning a retirement savings plan. We are
40 and 37 years old and earn $80,000 combined. We bought our house
two years ago. We invest $791 a month which is evenly divided
between Mainstay Growth and Equity and Fidelity Contrafund II
funds. We put $166 a month into a Roth IRA invested in Mainstay
Capital Appreciation fund, and $250 a month each into Janus Twenty
and Dreyfus S&AMP;P Index funds. We have about $7,000 in a Vanguard
Index 500 account. Finally, we have an emergency fund to which we
contribute $250 a month. In two months, we will be able to raise
our savings level to $2,000 a month. Is our portfolio too heavily
weighted with aggressive growth funds? Should we include a midcap
and an international fund. How will out net worth look in 15 years?
</P>
<P>
   S.S., Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. To begin with the punch line, if you raise your monthly
savings level from $1,707 to $2,000 after two months and if you
achieve average annual portfolio returns of 10 percent, you would
amass $826,866 in 15 years (and $1,485,008 after 20).
</P>
<P>
   I think the relative lack of diversification in your portfolio
is more troublesome than the concentration of growth funds. I'm not
sure what you refer to as Mainstay Growth and Equity; perhaps you
mean Mainstay Growth Opportunity and Mainstay Equity Income or
perhaps Mainstay Equity Index.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way it goes, it adds up to too much reliance on
large-cap domestic stock funds. So you should indeed look for
mid-cap and international positions, and if I were you I'd also
establish positions in a small-cap and a health care fund, keeping
each of these minor themes in the overall portfolio limited to
about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I based the estimate of 10 percent long-term portfolio growth on
the idea that within a year or two you will feel that youve
established enough in that emergency fund and will then divert
those savings into the stock funds which form the core of the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I am hoping that the account to which you contribute that $791 a
month is a 401(k) or some other tax-deferred savings plan. If not,
I would look beyond the Roth IRA for more tax-advantaged saving
vehicles. If neither of you have tax-deferred savings plans
available at work, I suggest you consider putting a sizable part of
your retirement savings in variable annuities, which are available
from most major mutual fund companies, and which tend to be modeled
on and track the results of the more popular retail funds.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small amount of insurance involved in the variable
annuity contract, which is what qualifies these instruments for tax
deferral. The cost of this insurance generally tends to reduce the
variable annuity account performance to a level about 1/2 percent
lower than that of the corresponding retail funds. In my opinion,
that 1/2 percent is an attractive price to pay for the tax
deferral.

THE END OF FASHION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  The Mass Marketing of the Clothing Business 
By Teri Agins 
Morrow, 320 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the concept of fashion gone out of style? Certainly
magazines are no longer dictating wardrobe choices for the masses.
And the idea of paying full price for a new designer creation is,
for many people, laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Just what happened to the influence of the elite designer? Wall
Street Journal reporter Teri Agins contends that kind of fashion
has given way to the power of mass marketing from retailers like
the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The End of Fashion,'' Agins chronicles the industry over
the last century, from the golden years when elitist Parisian
designers and their wealthy socialite customers set the standards
for style around the world and the masses followed their lead. She
writes that in the 1980s and '90s, a fundamental power shift
occurred: Suddenly the general public, not designers, was
determining the styles it wanted and the prices it was willing to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Agins attributes this shift to the social changes in the lives
of consumers. For one thing, women ``let go of fashion'': ``By the
198lions of baby-boomer career women were moving up in the
workplace, and the impact of their professional mobility was
monumental. As bank vice presidents, members of corporate boards,
and partners at law firms, professional women became secure enough
to ignore the foolish runway frippery that bore no connection to
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike stopped dressing up, even at work. Thanks in
part to the computer nerds in the Silicon Valley, Agins writes,
casual day was born, creating a huge market for the likes of khakis
and knit shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Agins points out that consumers' values were altered at the same
time. ``Most people used to put `fashion' on a pedestal,'' she
writes. But that changed when stores like Ann Taylor, Gap, Banana
Republic, and J. Crew ``turned out good-looking clothes that
deflated the notion that fashion belonged exclusively to the
elite.'' As a whole generation of people under 40 grew up wearing
these comfortable, affordable clothes, high-fashion designer labels
became less relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Agins says, top designers _ many of whom had taken
their companies public _ stopped gambling on fashion whims and
instead produced wearable apparel, as well as accessories,
cosmetics, and home furnishings. These items may appear lesscreative, but they sell _ which is what shareholders want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of Fashion'' is a fascinating read for anyone who
loves the industry, its players, or clothing itself. Through
interviews with high-placed sources throughout the business, Agins
tells interesting stories about the fierce rivalry between Ralph
Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger; how Giorgio Armani developed a publicity
machine to get his clothes on Hollywood's A-list of celebrities;
and how Donna Karan struggled after taking her company public.
</P>
<P>
   Agins also traces the history of the French couture industry
from its triumph in the 19th century through the years when its
influence began to wane. The cultural and sexual revolution of the
1960s brought major change, she argues: With the advent of the
miniskirt, suddenly shopping in small boutiques with low prices was
``in.'' To keep up, French designers like Emanuel Ungaro and Yves
Saint Laurent introduced ready-to-wear collections for their own
shops, causing even rich clients to get accustomed to more
affordable quality clothing _ and presaging the wider changes of
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Agins writes, creativity in fashion is expressed more in
marketing than in apparel. Designers have learned to circumvent the
fashion press by taking their message directly to consumers via
multiple-page advertising inserts in magazines. ``Today's
`branding' of fashion has taken on a critical role in an era when
there's not much in the way of new styling going on _ just about
every store in the mall is peddling the same styles of clothes,''
she says. ``That's why designer logos have become so popular; logos
are the easiest way for each designer to impart a distinguishing
characteristic on what amounts to some pretty ordinary apparel.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's era of Gap-like uniformity, Agins's book helps
readers figure out what happened to American style. Her insightful
analyses are well documented by industry experts. And her
conclusion _ anything marketed well will sell _ hits home to those
who have witnessed dramatic cultural changes over the decades but
never really thought about their impact on the closet.

THE COMPANY THEY KEPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
From F.D.R. On 
By John Kenneth Galbraith. Houghton Mifflin. 194 pp. $26. 
 
MEMORIES OF THE GREAT &AMP; THE GOOD 
By Alistair Cooke. Arcade. 277 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the attributes of two aging men of accomplishment and
letters like John Kenneth Galbraith and Alistair Cooke, this may be
the greatest: They look back, but not in anger. Nor in resentment.
Nor in envy.
</P>
<P>
   This publishing season (and this season of the century) brings
an especially happy harvest, twin volumes of reminiscences by
outsiders who became American insiders, and who in time also became
American icons. And in two brisk little volumes, Galbraith and
Cooke speed lightly through lives lived well _ not their own,
though they were lived uncommonly well, but the lives of men and
women who touched them and who helped shape the century.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith was reared in Canada, Cooke in England, but their gift
is their understanding of the United States, and though they are
not strictly American characters, they have enormous insight into
the American character. And so our understanding, for example, of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt (treated in both
volumes), and of Lyndon Johnson (memorably sketched by Galbraith)
and Barry Goldwater (masterfully portrayed by Cooke), is
immeasurably enhanced and enriched.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is our understanding of both Galbraith, the Harvard
economist and popularizer of the phrase ``the affluent society,''
and Cooke, the BBC broadcaster popular for his ``Letter from
America'' that is one of the staples of the century's culture.
(Cooke has filed his ``Letter'' every week for 53 years, a landmark
in radio.) The two men are representatives of a dying breed, the
detached observer from abroad who brushes past the great and the
good of the era (plus a few of the bad and the ugly) and then
paints them in spare but illuminating brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   They are ironists, too. Galbraith points out that he and Ronald
Reagan (``the first wholly uninhibited Keynesian president'') were
both founders of the Americans for Democratic Action, a leading
liberal interest group. Cooke, in a brilliant essay about Winston
Churchill, points out that one of the British prime minister's
virtues was ``the acceptance of humiliating defeats as episodes
natural to the wielding of power.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do these two men have to say for themselves, or about
other people? Let's start with the people they cover in common:
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Roosevelt. First Galbraith: ``The United States he saw
as a vast estate extending out from his family home at Hyde Park,
N.Y. For this he had responsibility, and particularly for the
citizens and workers thereon.'' Then Cooke: ``To a Europe bereft of
notable leaders who were not tyrants, here was a man who, defying
the current totalitarian models and denouncing them, was
reinvigorating the largest democracy by democratic means and with
the enthusiastic consent of the mass of his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt. Galbraith: ``We do not think of her as a
presidential artifact, nor did she so think of herself. She existed
independent of the president.'' Cooke: ``(S)he simply listed in the
`Who's Who' entry only three or four offices she filled on her own
account. She might have recorded the sum of her great life with
nothing more than her vital statistics and the single entry:
`Created the 32nd president of the United States.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In those two paragraphs alone rest four insights capable of
jogging any reader's sense of the Roosevelts, and of history. But,
thankfully, there is more.
</P>
<P>
   General George C. Marshall ``was a man whose inner strength and
secret humor only slowly dripped through the surfaces of life, as a
stalactite hangs stiff and granity for centuries before one sees it
beneath a pool of still water of marvelous purity'' (Cooke). Robert
F. Kennedy ``was the principal moral force both in the White House
inner circle and the larger administration'' (Galbraith).
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frost was ``an outdoor Emily Dickinson'' (Cooke). Lyndon
Johnson ``was accomplished in using fiction as a cover for
plausible fact'' (Galbraith). And: ``Goldwater's flaw as a
practicing politician of high principle was a streak of naivete
which allowed him to embrace as allies shabby people and malicious
people who simply said aloud they were against the things he was
against. He assumed they shared the principles when all they shared
was a gross prejudice'' (Cooke).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there are irresistible anecdotes galore, like the
time Galbraith brought Angie Dickinson to meet Jawaharlal Nehru,
then the prime minister of India, or the time Cooke, at Dwight D.
Eisenhower's farm in Gettysburg for a television interview, tried
to explain to the former supreme allied commander why the camera
crew sometimes took an hour to change the lighting. (Ike's
observation, testimony to his great gift for understatement: ``It's
a weird business.'')
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably but gratifyingly, these books reflect the authors'
respective strengths. Galbraith's is in devising immutable laws of
behavior, whether economic or political: ``In all politics one
needs an enemy and preferably an incompetent, misguided or socially
adverse one.'' President Clinton has profited from that advice
handsomely. Cooke's strength is in the very act of observation:
``It was a splendid day in Vermont when they buried Robert Frost,
the sky without a cloud, the light from the white landscape making
every elm and barn as sharp as a blade, and the people crunching
quietly through the deep snow and squinting in the enormous sun.''
Not even Frost could say it better.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page reminiscence that Cooke wrote about John Nance
Garner, FDR's first vice president, is the single best evocation of
the first four decades of the century in Texas and Washington ever
composed. I read it twice and then, when I finished the book, I
read it yet again _ two more times. Consider this small excerpt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon he was in the Texas legislature and in 1902 he
went to Congress, a small farmer's, railroad-hating Populist who
burrowed his way into power through the channels he knew best: the
back room, the small office, the poker game, the little chat with
worried men. All his life he distrusted orators, `crooners' as he
used to call them. Politics was doing the best you could for the
people you knew best; and that meant wheedling bills through a
reluctant Congress. He was a tireless wheedler, and he once said
that `a snort of bourbon is a better persuader than the Twelve
Apostles.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was a different time. In two different volumes, Cooke and
Galbraith remind us how different it was, and they pass along some
of the richness of it. Their ultimate achievement is to remind us
that some of that richness, of course, is these two themselves.

THE STORY OF A MILLION YEARS 
By David Huddle. Houghton Mifflin. 190 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   However much gentle readers may enjoy being told the way the
world works, the benevolent tyranny of the omniscient narrator has
been under assault for years. Experience is fractured! cried the
moderns, then the postmoderns; Only the interior point of view is
sacrosanct. So there went centuries of now-suspect bird's-eye
narration, too often replaced in contemporary fiction by teensy
insights from myopic visionaries. But the greater point was well
taken in a universe that was, we now had to admit, governed by
relativity. On the personal and literary scale, this meant that if
I looked out the window and saw morning sunshine, you were just as
likely to see smog, traffic, and atmospheric traces of the
emotional tempest you'd borne the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Handled well, this new humility of vision actually opens up the
world a bit, and it's used to beautiful effect in poet and essayist
David Huddle's accomplished first novel. Although its focus is the
intersection of a few primary stories through several connecting
lives, the title of ``The Story of a Million Years'' is both ironic
and just _ capturing the kaleidoscopic infinity of a tale told
twice, or forever and again, by the different people who were there
to witness its unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Huddle has imagined and reimagined his story with understated
precision, and the novel benefits from slow reading: The longer you
spend in the company of each of these narrators, the more deeply
identified you become with each of their dissonant perspectives.
This prismatic richness is cumulative, so that only near the end of
the work does the story expand outward to reveal new insights about
its beginning. Crosscutting among seven voices, ``The Story of a
Million Years'' has the still-life quality of a domestic drama
glimpsed through a picture window _ then explained by each person
you saw weeping, or laughing, in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Crandall, nee Bunkleman, is the obvious focal point of the
novel, and the first chapter (included in ``Best American Short
Stories 1996'') belongs to her, looking back on the affair she hada family friend, a man named Robert Gordon, the summer she was
15 _ and he was 41. It's a weird, Lolita setup waiting to happen,
and yet Huddle mostly pulls it off, in part because Marcy is a
dynamite character who keeps her heart to herself. By the end of
``Past My Future,'' Marcy's first story, we know that she will only
half-love and then leave Gordon, marrying the high-school
sweetheart she had the good sense to prefer. What we realize
immediately in ``Past Perfect,'' her husband Allen's version of
events, is how skewed and circumscribed this chain of events is
going to be _ marked by secrets and interpretations, deceits that
don't matter and private emotions that do.
</P>
<P>
   The overlapping central story of the novel belongs to Marcy and
Allen and their friends Jimmy and Uta Rago, all of whom hung out
together as students at the University of Virginia. Marcy and Uta
went on to nursing school; Allen, the arrogant bigshot who adored
Marcy because she never feared him, started off on a baseball
scholarship and wound up a lobbyist in D.C. Yet another man dazzled
by Marcy's sang-froid, Jimmy never had a chance with her, and so
married her best friend instead. Now an intensive-care nurse, Uta
possesses her own qualities of cool; she also has the unique
advantage of seeing Allen for the frail blowhard he really is.
Together and apart, these people face the usual hurdles of
parenting, aging, coming to terms with memory and reality. Their
collective saga has the feel of James Salter's ``Light Years,'' or
some of Updike's Maples stories _ satiny and sad, inflicted with
wisdom and resurrected only by self-knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the power of ``The Story of a Million Years'' lies in
its disparate revelations, so I won't diminish that punch here. But
the wistfulness of the novel (and its thematic intent) comes from
its tributaries of homage to the form of story itself _ the way it
shapes our lives, organizes our memories, allows us to live with
what we have done or failed to do. Thus Uta has her recollections
about a morning in New York when she had a chance at human
goodness, and took it; Jimmy, remembering his sister's childhood
death, can see the way her life and then absence made him who he
was. Even Robert Gordon _ the dark prince who in some ways has the
most interesting ``role'' in the story _ has a tragic grasp of what
you might call ordinary grace: the translucent quality you may or
may not see if you turn away from darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally this high-gloss literary sheen feels
self-consciously fluent and therefore a bit precious; the novel
veers once or twice toward metaphorical overkill. And Huddle's
empathic imagination, for all its reach, falters in certain
territories: a mother's split consciousness between passion and
parenting; a girl's choices about desire during a perfect
interlude. But these stumbles stand out because most of the novel
is so quietly and generously realized, from Marcy's splendidly
impenetrable life to the equally opaque enigmas of ``Summer
Afternoon.'' Over and over again, the voices of ``The Story of a
Million Years'' inform us of the chiaroscuro of the modern world _
a place of light and shadow and endless possibility, where things
are never, merely, as they seem.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Bedrooms and Hallways'' Lively, mostly gay, and pretty
broadly drawn sex farce that leaves plenty of room for gender
confusion. It represents a sort of backhanded breakthrough: It
makes available to gay characters a form that's pretty moribund,
even on TV. Although slicker than Rose Troche's debut film, ``Go
Fish,'' it's not nearly as personal and endearing. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Happy, Texas'' Winning populist froth, with just enough spin
put on a storyline that might have been lifted from a silent movie
_ two prison escapees are mistaken for beauty-pageant organizers in
a Texas town that's hungering to send its schoolgirls to the state
finals. Flavorful acting, especially from Steve Zahn as the funny
con on the run and William H. Macy as a very proper sheriff whose
heart is on fire. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Limey'' Stylish performances from '60s icons Terence
Stamp and Peter Fonda. Stamp is a British career criminal who comes
to LA after the death of his only daughter, gunning for the sleazy
record producer who's responsible; Fonda is his slick but shallow
target. Director Steven Soderbergh adds snazzy visuals, emphasizing
LA's sunny isolation. But they can do only so much to divert us
from a perilously slight story. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Random Hearts'' A-list soap opera, with Harrison Ford as a
stoical D.C. cop and Kristin Scott Thomas as a poised New Hampshire
congresswoman. They're thrown together when he learns that their
respective spouses, victims in an air crash, were having an affair.
It's dignified, intelligent, and handsomely crafted, but you never
believe the way these two come together. It seems to proceed from
the script's need for a star coupling, rather than from the
characters' natures. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Romance'' This French film about a woman who throws herself
into a round of sexual activity when her self-esteem is shattered
by a lover's rejection could have been the film ``Eyes Wide Shut''
wasn't. But it isn't. Although Catherine Breillat's movie is more
sexually explicit than any other recent film that wants to be more
than porn, it's got the sexual energy of a dead battery. And
because the sex proceeds from the central character's self-directed
anger, it's acted out under a pall of morose self-abasement.
(Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Superstar'' A slender but nevertheless winning one-joke
comedy. Molly Shannon beats the odds by extending her ``Saturday
Night Live'' character _ tightly wound Catholic parochial
schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher _ from skit to movie and making
it work on the strength of her tunnel-visioned intensity. It helps
that her SNL colleague Will Ferrell is on hand to play the dim bulb
she lusts after. (PG-13)

WARRICK' HEISMAN HOPES STOLEN AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Peter Warrick blew it.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy, for all intents and purposes, was his to
lose. The star wide receiver of the No. 1 Florida State Seminoles
had no peer, really, when it came to the Heisman race. He was atop
everyone's list.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Warrick suffered a precipitous fall from grace
when he and teammate Lavernaues Coles were arrested last Thursday
for grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, a recalcitrant receiver already on double-secret
probation, was kicked off the team, and Warrick was suspended
indefinitely after the players, abetted by a star-struck,
19-year-old Dillard's department store clerk, took $412.38 worth of
clothing from the store after plunking down only $21.40.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are due in court Monday, but even if Warrick plea
bargains his felony charge down to a misdemeanor, there is no
minimizing the devastating impact it has had on his teammates,
school, coaches, family, and, quite possibly, his future in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   While Warrick issued a nationally televised apology to the
aforementioned parties during Florida State's 31-21 victory over
Miami Saturday, he should just forget the Heisman. He blew it. Big
time.
</P>
<P>
   That should be _ and probably is _ Bobby Bowden's counsel to his
troubled star player.
</P>
<P>
   If Warrick is given a reprieve _ and there is a strong
possibility he could return in time to help the Seminoles to a
national championship once his matter is adjudicated _ Bowden said
he would advise Warrick ``to take a very back seat, a very back
seat. You go out there and just play the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Bowden wants Warrick back in the fold. But the
Florida State coach needs to make sure Warrick pays a price _ and
not just $21.40 _ for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so a nation of Heisman voters turns its lonely eyes toward
you, Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake _ if Hamilton wins the Heisman, it will not be
by default. So far this season, the Georgia Tech quarterback has
staged an impressive Heisman campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Hamilton led the Yellow Jackets on a game-saving drive
for the fifth time in 12 games in a 31-24 overtime victory against
North Carolina. He completed 14 of 26 passes for 273 yards and had
touchdown passes of 47 and 59 yards while rushing for 77 yards,
including a 14-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leader in passing efficiency (191.24), Hamilton so
far this season has passed for 1,347 yards and 12 touchdowns and
has thrown just four interceptions. He now becomes the leading
contender for the Heisman. Although Wisconsin's Ron Dayne is slowly
gathering steam for consideration after the Dayne Train apparently
was derailed in a loss to Michigan three weeks ago, it is clear the
Heisman is now Hamilton's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do now is avoid going on any shopping sprees with
Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which leapfrogged from No. 11 to No. 5 in the
Associated Press ratings, cracked the Top 5 for the first time in
32 years after its impressive 34-31 victory over archrival
Michigan, which plummeted from No. 3 to No. 10 after dropping to
5-1. The victory was especially sweet for the Spartans, one of
eight undefeated teams remaining in the AP Top 25, who have run
their overall record to 6-0 for the first time since 1966.
Quarterback Bill Burke set a school record with his 400 yards
passing, while junior receiver Plaxico Burress set another school
record with his 10 catches for 255 yards, highlighted by long
receptions of 39, 49, and 68 yards. Burress also had a 15-yard
touchdown pass from Burke. ``We've got 365 days until they get
another chance,'' said Michigan State's Amp Campbell. ``We can go
anywhere we want to and brag about it. We can walk into an Ann
Arbor mall wearing our Michigan State hats and be proud.'' . . .
Notre Dame probably was filming a sequel to ``Rudy'' when coach Bob
Davie inserted sophomore tailback Tim O'Neill, a 5-foot-5-inch
nonscholarship player from Troy, Mich., in the waning moments of
Saturday's 48-17 romp over Arizona State. O'Neill carried twice for
4 yards on consecutive handoffs in Notre Dame's penultimate
possession . . . One supposes Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, coaching
his team from his hospital bed while awaiting knee surgery in a
hospital 75 miles away in Rochester, Minn., must have required
cardiac care after his Badgers had to go into overtime to beat
Minnesota, 20-17, on Vitaly Pisetsky's 31-yard field goal . . .
Division 3 Mount Union won its 47th consecutive game _ a 66-0 rout
over Heidelberg _ to match the nation's longest winning streak, set
by Oklahoma (1953-57). Mount Union has won three consecutive
Division 3 national championships and four this decade . . . We
hate to dogpile on the Huskies, but Northeastern's 77-0 loss at
UMass Saturday ranked as the most lopsided in the country that day.
Only Oberlin's 71-0 loss to Wooster came close. There were only
three other teams who won Saturday by scoring 70 points or more:
Nebraska-Kearney over Fort Lewis, 79-13; Sterling over Ottawa,
Kan., 70-42; and Cortland State over New Jersey City, 73-7.

<P>
   Q: What is the difference between a doctor of osteopathy and a
medical doctor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Osteopathic medicine, developed by an American, Andrew T.
Still (1828-1917), in 1874, originally held that conventional
medicines were poisonous and that manipulation of the
musculoskeletal system could overcome abnormalities that led to
disease, even in organs like the heart and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors of osteopathy (who use D.O. after their names)
still use osteopathic manipulative therapy and while their training
includes up to 300 hours of training in manipulation, they now alsoe techniques of medical doctors, including drugs and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The two kinds of doctors have similar four-year medical schools
with similar accreditation, followed by hospital training, often in
conventional hospitals. All states and the military allow
osteopaths to practice medicine, including prescribing drugs,
delivering babies and performing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The main split between the two schools is now often seen as one
of philosophy; osteopaths, about half of whom are primary-care
physicians, are more likely to use hands-on treatment and see
spinal links to more diseases. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Medical doctors often regard the osteopathic approach as having
been less less rigorously tested than conventional medicine and are
especially skeptical of the efficacy of manipulation for ailments
other than spine problems.

   LONDON _ They're not dead yet.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, one of them is. But the other five men who make
up the Monty Python comedy troupe are feeling much better, well
enough to reassemble this weekend to mark the 30th anniversary of
the first showing on the BBC of ``Monty Python's Flying Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   That television show produced 45 episodes, spawned a cottage
industry of books, recordings, and films, and in the process
redefined British humor, finding an eager audience not just here
but in the United States, where the shows were broadcast on public
television and became cult classics.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the BBC devoted 3 1/2 hours of air time to Monty
Python retrospectives, including a screening of the 1979 film
``Life of Brian,'' a spoof on a Christ-like character that was
denounced by some as blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Python was politically incorrect long before the term was
coined. They sang about cross-dressing lumberjacks, portrayed
Scotsmen as kilt-wearing automatons, and staged a mock Olympics for
the mentally disabled that would never get on the air these days.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Monty Python is part of the establishment. Michael
Palin does a BBC travel show. John Cleese, whose series ``Fawlty
Towers,'' about a bumbling innkeeper, became another cult classic,
does commercials for a British supermarket chain. Eric Idle lives
in California with his American wife and stars in the Brooke
Shields sitcom ``Suddenly Susan.'' Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam,
the American animator who produced the surreal animations for the
show, have directed Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the reasons Monty Python's satire of the British
establishment was so cutting is that the troupe was a product of
that establishment. Cleese and Graham Chapman, a member of the
troupe who died 10 years ago, met at Cambridge University. Idle,
Palin, and Jones appeared in revues at Oxford University together.
</P>
<P>
   All five of them graduated from Britain's two most prestigious
universities and began writing and performing for television and
radio. The BBC threw them together on a lark, a new show to fill a
void. Gilliam, whom Cleese had met in New York, was thrown in for
good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Took, an adviser to the BBC who devised the idea for the
show, said the title came from one of his bosses' dismissing him as
being like ``Baron Von Richthoven and his Flying Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese said that it was initially going to be called ``Gwen
Dibley's Flying Circus'' after Palin found that name in a newspaper
article, but that one of the group _ no one can say for sure who _
suggested Monty Python.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese said they just thought it sounded funny.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC agreed, up to a point. Monty Python had to go to court
on more than one occasion to prevent its skits from being edited.
In one case, one of Gilliam's animations had a voiceover in which
the narrator explained that a young prince found a spot on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foolishly he ignored it,'' the narrator said, ``and three
years later he died of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The BBC changed ``cancer'' to ``gangrene.''
</P>
<P>
   On the TV show, they sang about the virtues of Spam, satirized
randy clerics in ``The Dirty Vicar'' sketch, and routinely dressed
in women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In their first movie, ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail,'' they
made fun of King Arthur, portraying him and his Knights of the
Roundtable as a bunch of morons. In one scene, Idle wheels a cart
through a village during the bubonic plague and calls for people to
``bring out your dead.'' Cleese emerges with an old man flung over
his shoulder and tries to dump him on the cart. But the old man
protests, saying, ``I'm not dead yet. I'm feeling much better.''
After haggling with Idle, who says he can't take the old man alive,
Cleese persuades Idle to wallop the old man on the head and take
him away.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, four of the five remaining members of the troupe
attended a screening of ``Life of Brian'' at the Empire Theatre in
Leicester Square to raise money for cancer research in memory of
Chapman. Idle did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is not playing with us at the moment,'' quipped Jones.
Idle is still smarting over the troupe's decision to cancel a 30th
anniversary touring show.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all that's eating at Idle. He laments that they all
have become part of the establishment they once savaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss people hating us,'' he said.

   &UR; THERAPIES: Hope for the Snorer's Suffering Spouse &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For millennia _ or maybe just sleepless nights that felt that
long _ people with serious snoring problems could rely on only
their spouses for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's referred to as `elbow therapy,''' said Dr. John W.
Shepard Jr., a specialist in sleep disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers have established not only how disruptive serious
snorers (usually men) can be to their partners _ costing them about
an hour's sleep per night _ but have also shown that the problem
can be greatly eased with a special nose mask.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, working at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
had 10 couples sleep in the lab, each wired to the gills with
monitoring equipment, and measured the couples' sleep patterns.
They reported seeing far fewer ``arousals'' when the mask was used.
</P>
<P>
   The study is reported in this month's Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
Shepard, the director of the sleep disorders center at Mayo, said
it showed just how serious a problem snoring can be for the
well-being of the spouses and the health of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, asked him whether it really mattered if a
snorer's partner lost some sleep. He told them, ``Set your clock
one hour earlier than you're used to getting up for the next week,
and call me and let me know how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on couples in which the man was being
evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea, a serious condition in which
the muscles at the back of the throat relax during sleep, briefly
cutting off breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The couples spent one night being studied. Monitors were
attached to the men to assess respiration. Among numerous other
devices, electrodes were placed on the women's scalps to measure
brain activity, letting doctors know when _ and how deeply _ they
were asleep.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the night, the men were given no
treatment. But for the second, they were fitted with
oxygen-mask-like gear known as continuous positive airway pressure
devices. The apnea episodes decreased to an average of 7, from 26.
And the percentage of time the women spent sleeping increased to 87
percent, from 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREVENTION: For Athletes, a Consensus on Concussion &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely to lay a divisive issue to rest (indeed, even
its authors urge much more study), but new guidelines are making
their way to schools around the country with advice on how to
handle head injuries on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been disagreement over when, or whether, to
return a player to the game if the athlete suffers what appears to
be a concussion, a common injury in sports that involve either a
lot of impact or sudden, swift changes in posture.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, published in the current issue of The American
Journal of Sports Medicine, were developed after a 1997 conference
attended by representatives of a wide array of medical and sports
organizations. The recommendations are described as a consensus and
are not endorsed by every group. Some believe they go too far;
others, not far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines recommend that an athlete who appears to have
received a head injury be immediately evaluated on the field. If
there is a loss of consciousness or symptoms that last longer than
15 minutes, or recur, the player should be taken out of a game and
seen by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   When symptoms last less than 15 minutes, the report advises,
athletes can usually return to play, but only after being made to
perform increasingly difficult physical tasks, like sit-ups, to
make sure the symptoms do not return.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being kept out of the game, athletes whose
symptoms take longer than 15 minutes to subside should be gradually
reintroduced to physical activity only over the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   If they ignore the caution, said Dr. Edward M. Wojtys, a surgeon
and associate team physician for the University of Michigan, they
are in danger of seriously reinjuring themselves. For a period of
time after a concussion, the brain remains more susceptible to
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have reported that nearly 63,000 high school
athletes a year suffer mild concussions, and that two or more
significant blows can harm a teen-ager for years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PATTERNS: The Right Place for a Heart Attack &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Having a heart attack in an integrated neighborhood may offer a
better chance of getting cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in this month's Annals of Emergency
Medicine, a team of researchers associated with the University of
Chicago examined 4,379 heart attack cases and found that in
neighborhoods where there were more heart attacks, residents were
most likely to be ready to offer aid.
</P>
<P>
   That was not surprising, but for reasons they were at a loss to
explain, the researchers also made this discovery: People were most
likely to receive CPR in neighborhoods that were integrated. People
were next most likely to receive CPR in neighborhoods that were
predominantly white, and least likely to receive such aid in
neighborhoods that were predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   The researches theorized that the CPR response rate may be
higher in integrated neighborhoods because those communities often
have stronger institutions, like churches, that sometimes offer CPR
training, said Theodore J. Iwashyna, one of the authors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDE EFFECTS: Relax! Stress May Harm the Prostate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Further indication about the health benefits of relaxing: a new
study suggests a link in men between stress and a chemical in their
blood that has been associated, at high levels, with a risk of
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the medical school of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook discovered the link in a study of 318 men.
</P>
<P>
   The men received digital rectal exams and blood tests for
prostate specific antigen, a protein that, when found at elevated
levels, may indicate prostate cancer. (Another recent study
suggested that the protein might not only serve as a marker of
cancer but also might help the body fight cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   The men were also asked to complete standard psychological
screening tests measuring their levels of anger and nervousness,
their ability to cope with daily life and their satisfaction with
their relationships with families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   When they analyzed the results, researchers found that men with
higher stress levels were three times as likely to have high levels
of prostate specific antigen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur A. Stone, the psychologist who led the study, said
the finding might be another example of weakening of the immune
system's ability to fight disease caused by stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what the immune system does is keep things under
control,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said they could not be sure whether stress
caused the higher antigen levels or was simply associated with
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was also possible that the stress was caused by the men's
concern over the possibility of having a medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WITH JUST A SPOONFUL OF LICORICE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If the candy industry is not careful, it may end up having to
contend with a twist on the old temperance movement poster
campaign: ``Lips that touch liquor shall not touch mine.'' For
liquor, substitute licorice.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter in the current issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine, three physicians in Italy contend that licorice root may
impede sexual performance and may even cause loss of sex drive in
men.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors _ Decio Armanini and Guglielmo Bonanni of Padua and
Mario Palermo of Sassari _ gave seven men ages 22 to 24 0.28 ounces
a day of a commercial licorice tablet. The doctors found that the
men's testosterone levels decreased during the period they ate the
licorice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amounts of licorice given to these men are eaten by many
people,'' the doctors wrote. ``Thus, men with decreased libido or
other sexual dysfunction, as well as those with hypertension,
should be questioned about licorice ingestion.''

ANTS PROTECTING THEIR TURF  
 A MOON OF ITS OWN  
 NEW MOONS FOR URANUS

   Suburban home owners know that one way to stay on good terms
with the neighbors is to keep the yard tidy, in particular making
sure to prune overhanging tree branches that could bother the
Joneses next door.
</P>
<P>
   A species of ant on the savannas of East Africa, it turns out,
takes the same approach. But for the ants it's more than just the
right thing to do: it's a question of survival. They have some
pretty tough neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The ant, Crematogaster nigriceps, is one of four species that
live inside bulblike growths in the whistling thorn, a type of
small acacia. Each tree is occupied by a single species, and the
problem for C. nigriceps is that if the branches of the tree it is
living in are in contact with others occupied by a different type
of ant, it will be subject to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not being particularly adept at fighting, C. nigriceps usually
ends up being evicted from its own tree. So the ant, as a research
team led by scientists at the University of California at Davis
shows in a study reported in the journal Nature, has adapted by
becoming the master gardener of the savannah.
</P>
<P>
   A colony carefully prunes its own tree, nipping off new growth
so that the tree does not spread out and contact others. The
researchers noted that the ants are selective pruners: they don't
waste energy trimming a side of the tree that faces open space.
</P>
<P>
   A Moon of Its Own
</P>
<P>
   Moons are generally thought of as a planetary thing. But there's
no reason an asteroid, for example, can't have a moon of its own.
In fact, when the Galileo spacecraft flew by the asteroid Ida in
1993, it detected a small satellite, later named Dactyl.
</P>
<P>
   Now a second asteroid has been found to have a satellite, and it
is the first to be seen from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   An international team of astronomers, using the Canada-France
Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, found the moon orbiting
Eugenia, an asteroid in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter. The
discovery was announced in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia itself is only about 125 miles in diameter, and its
moon, which has not been named, is about 8 miles across. It orbits
Eugenia at a distance of 700 miles once every 4.7 days.
</P>
<P>
   One of the astronomers likened the discovery to being able to
spot a faint firefly next to a candle flame from hundreds of miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering moons should help scientists understand more about
how asteroids were formed and shaped through collisions, and thus
with understanding the history of the solar system itself.
</P>
<P>
   By studying how its satellite is affected by Eugenia's gravity,
the astronomers have determined the asteroid's mass, and have
discovered that it is a lightweight, only about 20 percent denser
than water.
</P>
<P>
   So, the asteroid is either a porous agglomeration of rock, or
consists mostly of frozen water.
</P>
<P>
   New Moons for Uranus?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of moons, Uranus, it appears, is awash in them.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same Mauna Kea telescope, another team of astronomers
has found evidence of three new moons around the planet, the
seventh from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed through additional observations, the discovery
would give Uranus 21 moons and a commanding three-moon lead over
Saturn for most-in-the-solar-system honors.
</P>
<P>
   None of the objects are larger than about 12 miles in diameter.
They would fall into the category of irregular moons, satellites
that are in orbits that are extremely elliptical or highly inclined
(meaning the plane of the orbit intersects the planet at a steep
angle to the equator).
</P>
<P>
   The Mauna Kea telescope uses adaptive optics, a
computer-assisted system that helps to compensate for the
distortion caused by the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems are making discoveries of small, faint objects from
ground-based telescopes increasingly common.

PERSONAL HEALTH: COPING WITH FEAR: KEEPING BREAST CANCER IN

   What descriptions come to mind in connection with breast cancer?
The ones I've heard often include tragic, terrifying, horrific,
devastating, terrible, monstrous and ``a woman's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   But how accurate are these words and phrases for the vast
majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer? And haven't we
induced an unrealistic fear _ indeed, a paralyzing terror _ in many
women in our efforts to stimulate research into this disease and
raise awareness of the need to be vigilant and conscientious about
checkups?
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Ratner, a breast cancer survivor and author of a newly
published book, ``The Feisty Woman's Breast Cancer Book'' (a $14.95
paperback by Hunter House), maintains that all the publicity given
in recent years to this disease has created the impression that it
is far more common and more deadly than it really is, and the
resulting fear has caused many women to avoid rather than seek the
examinations that could save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ratner wrote: ``The fear of breast cancer among American
women has reached epidemic proportions, not because the number of
deaths is on the rise but rather because breast cancer has moved
into the spotlight and is now a public issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negativity and morbidity prevail. In all the talk about breast
cancer you rarely hear the fact that most women who get it deal
with it and go on to live out normal, healthy lives. You also
rarely hear that fear itself, and a pessimistic attitude, can
negatively affect a woman's ability to cope with the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   As a breast cancer survivor myself, I think it's time to replace
fear with facts. Here are some important facts about this disease:
</P>
<P>
   _ The vast majority of women never get breast cancer. The
one-in-eight-women statistic is accurate, but only if you live to
85. And as you get older and remain free of cancer, the
one-in-eight figure starts dropping because you have already lived
out many of the at-risk years. If, for example, you are now 70
years old and still cancer-free, your chances have dropped to 1 in
20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy percent of women who get breast cancer do not die from
it. And the death rate has been dropping steadily throughout this
decade. Furthermore, if more women adhered to current detection
guidelines and cancers were found while still in their earliest
stages, upward of 95 percent could survive this disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ The probability that an American woman who lives to age 90
will die of breast cancer is only 3.8 percent. Fifty percent will
die of heart disease, yet this leading killer does not conjure up
anything like the fear that breast cancer does.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lung cancer, not breast cancer, is the leading cause of cancer
deaths in American women. This year, 68,000 women will die of lung
cancer, 57 percent more than will succumb to breast cancer. Why are
we not more terrified of lung cancer, which has a survival rate of
only 12 percent?
</P>
<P>
   _ While it is true that breast cancer is the leading cause of
death among American women in their 40s, it is also true that only
one woman in 50 contracts breast cancer by age 50. These women are
unusual and their cases are poignant; they are sick in the prime of
life. Yet, with modern treatments, even these younger women are
more likely to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time we turn some of our focus from the losers in the
fight against breast cancer to the winners,'' according to Ms.
Ratner. ``I do not belittle in any way the pain or tragedy of those
who have succumbed. But it is only part of the story. Our
preoccupation with those who die of breast cancer has kept us from
being encouraged and inspired by the many more who live _ long and
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many breast cancer survivors I know, for example,
there is a champion amateur ballroom dancer and artist, an
editor/literary agent, a community volunteer who spearheaded the
redevelopment of downtown Cleveland and a retired educator who
cares for two grandsons when she is not traveling around the world.
And there is me: writer, lecturer, athlete, gardener, cook and
world traveler.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, having survived breast cancer has made every minute
more precious, bringing me even closer to my friends and family and
reminding me daily not to postpone doing anything I've been wanting
to do.
</P>
<P>
   We are alive today because of improved methods of detection and
treatment, combined with a willingness to participate in treatment
decisions, a view that breast cancer was not the most terrible
thing that could happen to us and a determination to beat the
disease and get on with life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ratner, who chose mastectomy over lumpectomy followed by
radiation, put it this way: ``I consider myself fortunate that my
cancer was in my breast. If I had to choose a body part to
sacrifice, a breast would be my first choice. No other body part is
as expendable. A breast doesn't pump your blood or digest your
food. You don't breathe with it or use it to walk or talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with her disease, she wrote, ``I decided that I would
not let cancer take over my life. I decided to concentrate on
continuing to feel fine. Maybe in the end cancer would get me and I
would die, but for as long as I could, I would do everything
possible to extend and enjoy my life.'' Worry, she insists, is a
destructive force that can only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't share Ms. Ratner's views on modern methods of treatment;
her discussions of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and tamoxifen, a
drug that can help to prevent recurrence and second cancers, fail
to give enough weight to the life-saving value of these procedures
for many women. But I heartily endorse her emphasis on the
importance of learning all you can about treatment options and not
allowing doctors to make all the decisions for you.
</P>
<P>
   I agree, too, with Ms. Ratner's plea to share one's breast
cancer experience and concerns with good friends and others who can
provide understanding and support through cancer treatment and
recovery. ``Human contact and emotional support have a great deal
to do with anyone's ability to deal with illness,'' she wrote,
noting that breast cancer strengthened her ties to her family and
close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional support also aids survival. Dr. David Spiegel, a
psychiatrist at Stanford University School of Medicine,
demonstrated that even among women with advanced breast cancer,
those who participated in support groups lived twice as long as
other women with the same prognosis who were not in such groups.
</P>
<P>
   With or without outside support, you can find much comfort as
well as solid practical advice in another new book, ``The
Not-So-Scary Breast Cancer Book'' (a $14.95 paperback from Impact
Publishers) by Carolyn Ingram and Leslie Ingram Gebhart, sisters
who had breast cancer and who found many ways to ease the way
through the experience. They discuss how to handle other people's
reactions, keep the rest of your life going, and find the best ways
to cope.

<P>
   The flu season does not usually start before November, so health
officials in the state of New York were startled last week when the
influenza A virus raced through Monroe Community Hospital, a
chronic-care center in Rochester, N.Y., infecting many elderly
patients before they had received flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   In Great Neck, N.Y., a month-old baby was hospitalized with
influenza A on Sept. 27. (No one died at the care center and the
baby recovered within three days.) And while the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta does not yet have
national statistics for this year, there have been reports of
outbreaks in Alaska, Louisiana, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these early cases, health experts and officials say,
predicting the severity of this year's flu season is about as
reliable as predicting the amount of snow this winter. There are
indications, gathered by monitoring flu epidemics around the world,
but there are no guarantees that the same strains will strike here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot predict how much flu you'll see, the timing or
intensity of the flu season,'' said Lynnette Brammer, an
epidemiologist with the influenza branch at the CDC. ``People
continually look for ways to make predictions, but the flu is
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, early reports have been reassuring. ``The one thing we do
know from the U.S. and international surveillance is that there are
not any influenza viruses that look terribly unusual,'' Ms. Brammer
said. ``All the viruses look like they will be sensitive to the
available vaccines, which is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that complacency is in order, officials say.
The elderly, children with asthma and people with chronic illnesses
should still get flu shots before November. Waiting until the virus
is widespread might be too late because the vaccine takes one to
two weeks to become effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are just gearing up to do their vaccine
programs,'' said Dr. William Barker, a professor of preventive
medicine and gerontology at the University of Rochester School of
Medicine. ``People don't generally anticipate you need protection
this early.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the outbreak at the hospital in Monroe County, Barker said:
``It really is a wake-up call that flu is in the community and you
should not delay getting a vaccine. Seeing an outbreak so early in
the season is a reminder that we could see more like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Influenza is a wily virus that changes frequently, a maneuver
that helps the virus avoid assaults by the body's immune system and
by drugs. It comes in several strains, usually named for the region
where they were first spotted, and three types, A, B and C.
Influenza A, the kind that hit the care center and the Long Island
baby, tends to be the most severe. Influenza B is usually milder
and influenza C has never caused an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   As long as changes from year to year are subtle, the same
vaccine will continue to be effective. Major changes, called
shifts, require new vaccines, but it can take months for a new
vaccine to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for whatever reason, the first few people who get infected
are struck by a very different strain, that would be a signal that
we could be in for an outbreak,'' said Dr. Stephen Friedman,
director of the immunization program at the New York City
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   This year's vaccine is called a trivalent shot because it should
work against the three types of flu that are expected to circulate
this winter: the Sydney and Beijing strains, both influenza A, and
the Yamanashi strain, influenza B.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the common cold, which causes runny nose and sore throat,
the flu affects the entire body, causing coldlike symptoms, high
fever, muscle aches and headaches. Most people recover within seven
to 10 days, but those with chronic illness may suffer complications
that can be severe, if not fatal. Children with asthma are
susceptible to dangerous flare-ups, and pregnant women can also
suffer severe symptoms. Experts recommend the vaccine to pregnant
women during the second and third trimesters, not during the first
12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides flu shots, there are three drugs that are available by
prescription. Symmetrel (amantadine) and Flumadine (rimantadine)
are pills used against influenza A. Relenza (zanamivir) is an
inhaled medicine used to fight both influenza A and B. A fourth
drug, Tamiflu (oseltamivir), has not yet been approved by the drug
administration, but studies have indicated that it may work against
both A and B.
</P>
<P>
   While the vaccine can prevent the flu, the prescription drugs
are intended to ease symptoms after its onset. They are effective
only if taken within the first two days of the illness, health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said the prescription drugs would be most
effective in helping control outbreaks at group centers.  &QL;

STUDY GIVES IDEA TO CURB SIDE EFFECTS OF DRUGS

<P>
   When doctors need information about what dose of medication to
prescribe, they usually consult a fat navy-blue book called the
Physicians' Desk Reference _ PDR for short _ which is an extensive
compilation of data about drugs from their manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the doses recommended in the PDR may be too high for many
people and may cause adverse reactions, ranging from dizziness and
nausea all the way to death, according to an article published last
month in the journal Postgraduate Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   For many drugs _ including Viagra, Prozac and some medicines
used to treat high blood pressure, allergies, insomnia and high
cholesterol _ smaller doses would work just as well as the standard
ones, with far less risk of bad reactions, said the author of the
article, Dr. Jay S. Cohen, an associate professor of psychiatry at
the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side effects drive a lot of people out of treatment that they
need,'' Cohen said, noting that people with chronic conditions like
high blood pressure, headaches and depression often gave up trying
to treat their illnesses when they found that the cure was worse
than the disease. But if doctors were to individualize dosages for
each patient, more people might take their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he became aware of the problem because he encountered
many patients who suffered from side effects even though they had
taken what were supposedly the correct doses of medicine. When
Cohen consulted medical journals and textbooks, he discovered
studies showing that many patients were helped by smaller than
usual amounts of medication. And many of his own patients did
better with reduced doses of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He said his findings helped explain a study published last year
by other researchers, who reported that drug reactions in the
hospital were among the nation's leading causes of death, killing
more than 100,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths that the team studied were not due to medication
errors by doctors or patients: they occurred in people taking doses
thought to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen thinks many of the patients died because they were
taking too much medicine: the ``correct'' doses were too strong for
them. People vary greatly in their sensitivity to drugs, he said,
and one person's remedy may be another's overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Although weight, age and sex help determine how a dose of
medicine will affect someone, it is also possible for two people
who are identical in those traits to react quite differently to the
same dose of the same drug. Dosing guidelines from drug companies
may be right for most people, but too high for ``large subsets of
patients,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Dosing guidelines generally tend to be too high because they are
based on studies conducted in limited numbers of patients by drug
companies when they are seeking approval for new products, Cohen
said. For those studies to run efficiently, doses need to be high
enough to show as quickly as possible that the drug works.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after the drug is approved, far more people take it,
sometimes along with other drugs, and individual differences begin
to show up. That information does not always make it into the PDR,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Honig, deputy director of the office of postmarketing
risk assessment at the Food and Drug Administration, said, ``We
learn a lot about a drug after it's been approved. I think we would
agree with that. I think he makes some good points. Individualized
dosing is the way to go. But it's not well taught in medical
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Bates, an associate professor of medicine at the
Harvard Medical School, called Cohen's idea an interesting
hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the elderly, it's clear that you want to start with lower
doses,'' said Bates, who has written about adverse reactions for
medical journals. ``In them in particular it's quite clear that you
get in trouble if you use a `one size fits all' dosing, which
doctors have tended to do. It may well be for younger people, too,
that there's considerable variability in the way drugs are broken
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates said that doctors are taught to ``start low, go slow''
when prescribing medication for people over 60 or 65, but that the
advice may apply to younger patients as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond Woosley, chairman of the department of pharmacology
at Georgetown University in Washington, called Cohen's article ``an
outstanding paper, and a very important message.''
</P>
<P>
   Woosley named several drugs with recommended doses that he
considered too high, including Viagra and the over-the-counter
allergy medicine Chlortrimeton. In addition, he said, the AIDS drug
AZT was first marketed at doses that turned out to be far too high
and had to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said doctors might identify some people at risk for
reactions by asking patients whether they have ever had an adverse
reaction to a drug and whether they consider themselves unusually
sensitive to medications or prone to side effects. Having a strong
reaction to a little bit of alcohol or caffeine may also be a clue
that a patient will be very sensitive to medication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs that have caused trouble in the past should be avoided, he
said, and people who seem very sensitive to medication can be
started on low doses, which can be gradually increased if
necessary. Some pills can be cut to fine-tune doses, but capsules
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   But Woosley said that in his experience, a bad reaction to one
medicine could not be used to predict how a patient would fare with
others.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen cautioned that patients should not begin tinkering with
doses of prescription drugs on their own. He said they needed to
work with doctors to adjust the doses safely. With some drugs,
doses cannot be changed: for example, antibiotics, antivirals and
other medications used to treat infections must be taken full
strength, according to the directions on the label. And in
emergencies, he said, it is always safest to stick with the
recommended doses.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Medical Economics Inc., publisher of the PDR,
said that the information in the book was supplied by drug
manufacturers and approved by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carl Peck, a former director of the Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research at the federal drug agency, said, ``One
dose fits all is a marketing myth, but it's the holy grail that
every drug company tries to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the drug agency, Peck conducted a study that showed
that some drugs did come to market from 1980 to 1993 with dosing
advice that had to be lowered. But, he said, that is less likely to
occur today because during the last decade drug manufacturers have
begun to study ranges of doses in the trials done before drugs are
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Some newer drugs, like cholesterol lowering agents and a nose
spray for allergies, come with labeling that gives a recommended
dose range and advises doctors to try to find the lowest effective
dose. Peck is now director of the center for drug development
science at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of getting the dose right has become an
important focus for the FDA,'' Peck said, ``and I think the FDA and
the drug companies are making a good-faith effort to do better
these days.''

MEDICINE BALL POPS BACK INTO VOGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif., Ill., Mass., Iowa)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By ANDREA HIGBIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The medicine ball, darling of the trimming and toning crowd
before its exile to six decades of exercise Elba, has bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Embraced in the 1930s as the epitome of exercise chic, the
medicine ball _ shaped like a ball but filled with paper or cotton
and covered in leather _ dropped out of fashion, abandoned for the
next new things to come along: vibrating belts, amphetamines and
``The Jack LaLanne Show.''
</P>
<P>
   So old-fashioned, the medicine ball was even a punch line on
``Seinfeld,'' with Jerry sarcastically asking his very elderly
trainer, played by Lloyd Bridges, if they were going to use a
medicine ball. Had ``Seinfeld'' returned for another season, they
may well have, and happily.
</P>
<P>
   Like the martini and other long-ago icons, the medicine ball is
back, its workout sometimes going under the name ``plyometrics,''
to describe a system of measured increases in an exerciser's
performance. Around the nation, the medicine ball is popping up in
exercise classes and in sessions with personal trainers, winning a
new generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Jason White, a trainer at Equinox in
Manhattan. ``My clients, both men and women, get very excited about
it. Other people are seeing them use it, and they just have to try
it. It's a very explosive workout, a very effective addition to
free weights and cardiovascular work. Because it's weighted, it
makes the body work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the 2- to 20-pound balls are filled with gel,
polyurethane chips, sand and sawdust, or occasionally water, and
covered with polyurethane or rubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fantastic: You can do a million different things with
them and incorporate them into any exercise,'' said Larry Krug,
trainer at Crunch Fitness in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A medicine ball user lies on his back with knees bent and feet
flat on the floor. The ball is positioned just above the head and
the arms are bent. Elbows are pointed up. The ball is pulled over
the top of the head and the exerciser raises his head and shoulders
as the ball is moved to the top of his knees. The exerciser then
returns to the starting position by bringing the ball over his head
and reclining his body.
</P>
<P>
   In another exercise, two exercisers can face each other three
feet apart and toss the ball back and forth, each aiming at a spot
just above the other's head.
</P>
<P>
   Or, an exerciser can kneel six feet from a wall and throw a
medicine ball with both hands by bringing the ball from behind the
head and releasing it in front of her head and catching it
immediately on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   New, true believers contend that the medicine ball is soft, easy
to grip and, dare one say it, fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients completely forget that they're working out,'' Krug
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Alex Meneses, 28, who is starring in ``The
Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' a prequel to ``The Flintstones''
(1994), to be released in May. She won the role of the sexy
secretary, which was played by Halle Berry in the original film,
and had to get in terrific shape. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My costumes are teeny,'' said Ms. Meneses, who lives in West
Hollywood. ``They were so small, I couldn't breathe. Working out
with the medicine ball, I lost 10 pounds since April and I've kept
it off. Even though I'm a runner and good at cardio, this shaped my
body better, sculpting my arms, waist and hips. I've been using it
three or four times a week, and I'm probably in the best shape I've
ever been in.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, ``It's like playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blum, 43, a concert pianist in Manhattan, relies on the
medicine ball ``to play catch and as a weight between my legs and
arms to add stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A pianist has to be as internally strong as a gymnast,'' he
said. ``Emotionally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   As comebacks go, this rebirth is happening quickly. ``I think
it's gaining popularity too because boxing is hot, and medicine
balls have always been used in boxing training,'' Krug said.
``People love boxing, and a lot of women these days are boxing,
which used to be socially unacceptable. So it carries connotations
of self-defense, and that's hot. Everyone at the gym sees the
boxers using it and everyone else using it, and they just have to
try it also because it's new.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tony Swain, personal training coordinator at the East Bank Club
in Chicago, says he is seeing members use the medicine ball ``in
different exercises for different muscle groups, for strength
training and sports-related exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Maeve McCaffrey, a spokeswoman for the International Health,
Racquet and Sports Club Association of Boston, a trade organization
for gyms, has taken note of the ball's return. ``I do think the
medicine ball is experiencing a resurgence,'' Ms. McCaffrey said.
``This might be attributed to the popularity of sports-based
athletic classes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the medicine ball exercise system was prescribed
by doctors to promote health for their patients through exercise.
Athletes began using it to build resistance, and exercisers of the
day soon took to it. But it did not take long for its vogue to
pass: when the ball got wet or full of sweat, as it inevitably
would, the paper and cotton inside grew moldy and smelly.
</P>
<P>
   The ball would change weight easily and unevenly, making it
unstable, and the seams of the leather cover ruptured. The ball's
unpleasant metamorphosis made the notion of exercise even less
appealing than usual.
</P>
<P>
   But the medicine ball found a new champion in Dr. Donald A. Chu.
Chu, a former professor of kinesiology at California State
University at Hayward who is the director of the physical therapist
assistant program at Ohlone College in Newark, Calif., as well as
the strength and conditioning consultant to the United States
synchronized swim team and Olympic team, had observed East European
track and field athletes using the medicine ball with much success
in the late 1960s and early '70s to build speed and movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s he began working with a plastics manufacturer to
build a better ball, he said, which he did, with gel, sand,
sawdust, urethane or rubber shavings inside. He had intended to use
it only with athletes, but then trainers started noticing. Chu, who
lives in Alameda, quietly began building the medicine ball's
return, even naming his Jack Russell Terrier puppy Plyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most machines tend to isolate a joint or area,'' Chu said.
``This does not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sculpts the body, especially the abdomen,'' said Chu, who
added that he exercised with his medicine ball ``but not every
single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Chu owns the trademark Plyoball; his version of the medicine
ball is available through Metapro, at (800) 586-7872 and the Web
site called www.jumpusa.com. The balls cost $30 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   Chu's handbook, ``Plyometric Exercises With the Medicine Ball''
(Bittersweet, 1987), which describes more than 120 movements and
explanations of ways to adapt the plyoball for workouts at home or
in gyms.
</P>
<P>
   Another medicine ball site, www.bodytrends.com, offers the Ooof
ball, ``the medicine ball that bounces,'' and broadcasts the
endorsement of Al Vermeil, strength and conditioning coach for the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>

   The name plyometrics was coined in the 1960s by Fred Wilt, track
coach at the University of of Iowa, to describe the East European
athletes' ``jump training.'' But more recently it has won wider
recognition with the medicine ball's new popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the essence of fashion, whether for clothing,
politics or exercise, is change, and so the medicine ball's
popularity may, yet again, dribble off into the sunset. ``At Crunch
L.A., at least, everyone is in really good shape so they really
love any change that comes along,'' said Krug, the trainer. Next in
line, the vibrating belt?

   For months, the black teen-age boy could enter Little Rock
Central High School only when escorted by federal troops,
sidestepping the angry mobs and ducking their spit. The white girl
driving her '49 Chevrolet to school could only stare incredulously
at the spectacle surrounding her classmate. ``It was all so stupid,
so asinine,'' she remembers thinking. ``I mean, what was the
problem? I had no objection to going to school with blacks.'' It
was autumn of 1957, and although they didn't realize it, the boy
and girl were part of a major flash point in American history that
would foreshadow the end of legal racial segregation. One of a

AN OBSERVATORY IS DEDICATED TO WATCHING THE RIPPLING WAVES OF
SPACE

   A new calculation suggests that dense star clusters, which are
sprinkled throughout galaxies in Earth's cosmic neighborhood, act
as assembly lines for tightly orbiting pairs of black holes, and
then spit them out of the cluster, where they eventually fall
together and merge into one. Next year, if all goes well,
scientists will be able to take the first steps toward testing that
theory with a new, $350 million instrument, a gravity wave
observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, a cataclysmic merger of black holes should throw
off ripples in the fabric of space called gravitational waves or,
more simply, gravity waves. It was to detect those waves for the
first time that physicists designed the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which actually consists of
two separate stations, one in Louisiana and one in Washington
state. LIGO will be dedicated on Nov. 11 and begin a shakedown
period of initial operations in January of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, astrophysicists had assumed black hole pairs were so
rare it would be almost impossible to detect them. The scientists
preparing to work at LIGO assumed that their first capture of
gravity waves will come from less powerful events in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The new calculations, by Simon F. Portegies Zwart of Boston
University and Stephen L.W. McMillan of Drexel University, suggest
that detectable mergers of black holes could be as much as a
thousand times more common than the events LIGO had set its sights
on. As is customary in astrophysics, the calculations have been
posted on a Web site managed by Los Alamos National Laboratory
(www.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9910061) as they are being submitted to
the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge difference,'' McMillan said. ``When you start
making these things in clusters,'' he said, referring to the black
hole pairs, ``the conditions are very favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Barish, a physicist at the California Institute of
Technology who is the director of LIGO, said that if the
calculation was correct, its implications for the observatory's
first five to six years of operation were striking. The LIGO
detectors that will be in place during that time are much less
sensitive than those to come later, and the black hole pairs could
make the difference between seeing gravity waves or not seeing them
at all during that first phase.
</P>
<P>
   If the new calculations prove true, improvements might boost
LIGO's later detection rate from several events a year to as many
as one or two a day, said Stuart Shapiro, an astrophysicist at the
University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign who is involved in
calculating those rates. ``That's when you can do real science,''
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space itself, have
teased physicists for decades, because they have announced their
presence only indirectly. For example, when Joseph Taylor and
Russell Hulse of Princeton University observed a pair of neutron
stars caught in a tight orbit around each other, work for which
they won the Nobel Prize in 1993, they theorized that they should
produce gravity waves. The whirling neutron stars, superdense
cinders that sometimes remain when an ordinary massive star
collapses and explodes as a supernova, slightly stir the
four-dimensional fabric of space and time around them. According to
relativity theory, that stirring action should send out a weak
signal of gravitational waves.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor and Hulse could not measure those waves directly. All
they could do was show, with years of work, that the rotation of
the two-star or binary system was gradually speeding up as the
stars spiraled closer and closer together _ exactly what would be
expected because if energy were being carried away by the gravity
waves.
</P>
<P>
   Even LIGO, which is being built by Caltech and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and will measure the minute stretching and
shrinking of space caused by such disturbances, will not be capable
of picking up such a faint spray of gravity waves. But when a pair
of neutron stars get so close that they crash together and merge,
the resulting burst of gravity waves should be detectable if the
smash-up occurs within one of the thousands of galaxies that are
within about 50 million light years of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   That process relies on ordinary stars occasionally being born in
pairs, exploding as supernovas and leaving behind neutron stars
with masses of about 1.5 times that of the sun. Black holes contain
the mass of ten or more suns and are even more exotic, having
collapsed behind a gravitational shroud called an ``event horizon''
from which nothing can escape _ not even light. The chances that
pairs of black holes could form as neutron star binaries do is
vanishingly small.
</P>
<P>
   So McMillan and Portegies Zwart looked at the possibility that
black hole pairs might, in effect, be manufactured inside the tight
knots of stars called globular clusters. In the clusters, which can
contain millions of stars, individual black holes fall to the
middle because of their great mass, the team realized.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the black holes attract each other gravitationally
and pair off, forming binaries. The binaries carom off other black
holes and eventually pick up enough speed to escape from the
cluster. Out in the dark wasteland of space, the black holes spiral
inward just as neutron stars do, and finally merge in a spectacular
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Because the black holes are more massive than neutron stars,
said Barish of LIGO, more gravity waves are emitted and the events
are easier to see from far away. ``We see something that happened
deeper into the universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The greater range adds up to a much bigger volume of space that
LIGO can monitor, said Barish.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the new work stress that an imperfect knowledge
of clusters and black holes means that their estimates are
uncertain by a factor of ten or so. ``We still have no
guarantees,'' said Dr. Kip Thorne, a LIGO collaborator and a
physicist at Caltech. Still, he thinks the new calculation suggests
`that we are likely to see a very large number of black hole
mergers.`
</P>
<P>
   Because gravity waves are a central prediction of relativity
theory, physicists would hail their detection as a major coup. The
possibility that LIGO will see gravity waves from black holes
brings an additional bonus, said Shapiro. Because of their terrific
gravitational fields, spacetime is warped around black holes more
strongly than anywhere else in the universe, according to
Einstein's equations of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gravitational wave is a direct messenger of that
spacetime,'' Shapiro said. ``The upshot will be the first
confirmation of Einstein's theory of relativity'' where the fabric
of spacetime is twisted almost beyond recognition, he said.

   When you think of Nevada, you probably think of Las Vegas:
Hunter Thompson's Day-Glo metropolis of fear and loathing, Bugsy
Siegel's vision of gangster glamour in the desert sands: that
giddy, glittering gulch of 24-hour slot machines, glitzy floor
shows and miles and miles of neon. As David Thomson points out in
his entertaining new book, however, there is another Nevada as
well, a rapidly vanishing Nevada of deserted desert vistas, rickety
ghost towns and empty roads, a remnant of the old frontier
seemingly forgotten by the modern world, a place so devoid of
habitation that ``you feel the human thing has hardly got a hold.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact the state that emerges from Thomson's book ``In Nevada''
is a place of blatant contradictions, a place where the beautiful
and the grotesque, the primitive and the futuristic dwell side by
side. The state has been a magnet for loners, libertarians and
anarchists, outlaws, gangsters and ``X-Files'' paranoiacs, but it
is also ``a playground of the federal government,'' which has used
its remote desert reaches as a testing ground for nuclear weapons
and secret reconnaissance aircraft. It is a region of extreme
weather and inhospitable conditions, but it is also home to the
Hoover Dam, one of the world's most daunting testaments to man's
mastery of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevada,'' Thomson writes, ``is on the edge, on the wire, off
to one side, in the empty quarter, or even in the rest of the
country's head as an idea, a possibility, an alternative. It is an
experiment, or a kind of theater. Yes, that's somewhere nearer to
the answer, for America has used Nevada as a testing ground, and
not just for weapons and their destructiveness but also for new
social ideas, and their explosiveness. What happens if you allow
divorce, prostitution, gambling? Can there be community and purpose
if you encourage things deep in human nature yet supposedly alien
to order and togetherness?''
</P>
<P>
   To address such questions, Thomson leads the reader on a
rambling, idiosyncratic tour of Nevada, taking us to Las Vegas, of
course, but also to small, abandoned mining towns and the barren
northern outposts of the state, where it is inadvisable to travel
without an extra stash of water and gas. He takes us along on a
government-conducted tour of the Nevada Test Site: a highly
circumscribed tour, it must be said, that nonetheless offers
glimpses of radioactive waste management facilities and the
infamous Sedan Crater, a 320-foot-deep, 1,282-foot-wide hole left
by the 1962 test of a 104,000-ton nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting back and forth between descriptions of the test site
and a history of Las Vegas, Thomson tries to draw parallels between
the sort of gambling that goes on in casinos and the higher-stakes
gambling that has gone on with nuclear weapons. It's not a
particularly profound or well developed point, but the reader
doesn't really care, so engaging is Thomson as a tour guide. He
uses his novelistic powers of description, honed in three works of
fiction, to give the reader a palpable sense of what he sees. He
describes one hotel as having a ballroom ``of cut-rate 1980s
design, attempting to imitate the 1880s,'' a boxing ring as looking
``as poised and sinister as a Magritte painting.'' He also uses his
vast knowledge of movies, honed in half a dozen books about
Hollywood, to show how films like ``The Godfather,''
``Goodfellas,'' ``Casino'' and ``The Misfits'' have shaped and
played upon our preconceptions about Nevada and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   As his quirky, highly opinionated book ``A Biographical
Dictionary of Film'' attests, Thomson is also a master portraitist,
and in this volume he enlivens his narrative with sketches of such
disparate Nevadan figures as the explorer John Charles Fremont, one
of the first white men to see Lake Tahoe, and Steve Wynn, the
creator of the Mirage and Bellagio hotels, the flamboyant
entrepreneur who once quipped that he had tried to produce the sort
of marvel God might have made ``if He'd had the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra is described as a ``split personality standing
astride plenty and pain'': a poet having ``within him some ultimate
sad eloquence,'' a gifted artist but also an ``angry runt,'' who
seemed ashamed, in front of his pals, of the forlorn tenderness in
his voice. Howard Hughes, who bought the Desert Inn after he was
asked to check out of his rooms, is described as ``a Monopoly
player who regarded Las Vegas as a board game he had to cover''
with his own hotels. And Bugsy Siegel, the gangster who became one
of Las Vegas' founding fathers, is described as ``a truly Las Vegan
mix of good and bad luck,'' a man who ``saw the desert and the
great game of transforming it,'' and who ``like the first citizens
of the place,'' knew ``the virtue of moving a little farther out
into the desert and starting again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the 50-odd years since Siegel's Flamingo Hotel
opened in the desert, Las Vegas has been transformed again into
something new. While Siegel helped turn a sleepy collection of
roadhouses into a film noir dream of swanky and slightly
disreputable glamour, today's Vegas moguls, like Wynn, are turning
the city into a family-friendly theme park filled with
world's-fair-like attractions, ``another kind of Disneyland,'' in
the opinion of many old-timers, ``too damn slick and organized for
its own good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the state of Nevada has gone from being one of
the emptiest quarters of the West to being the most rapidly
expanding state in the union. Jet Skis and tourists (about 1
million a year) have invaded Lake Tahoe even as suburbs, malls and
highways have colonized the desert. In 1950, Thomson notes, the
entire state had a population of 160,000, about the number of hotel
beds estimated for Las Vegas by the year 2000.

   In an old Vietnamese myth about how the tiger got its stripes, a
man tries to show the great cat who's boss by lashing it to a tree
and setting the tree on fire. But the tiger is so powerful and so
inured to pain that it strains against the flaming rope until it
breaks free, its brush with extinction evident only in the black
marks seared on its fur.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, it turns out, with the real tiger. As recently as the
early 1990s, researchers were convinced that the largest and most
sumptuously pelted of the world's cats, an animal more feared,
revered, fetishized and lionized than the lion itself, was about to
go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tiger abounded throughout Asia, from eastern Turkey to
the Sea of Japan, from Siberia in the north to Indonesia in the
south. But humanity's expanding numbers, and its lust for land,
tiger body parts and the prey on which the tiger feeds, had taken
such a huge toll that by 2000, many biologists gloomily predicted,
the wild tiger would effectively be extinct.
</P>
<P>
   But now, like a furred phoenix rising from the ashes, or a
creature cognizant of its nine-lifetime warranty, the cat has come
back. Far from disappearing, the tiger in some parts of its range
is practically thriving, its numbers measurably greater today than
just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And though conservationists who have long battled to save the
tiger warn against complacency and emphasize that the tiger is
still endangered, they admit to an unusual sensation these days:
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all encouraged, which is very different from how we felt
five or six years ago,'' said Ginette Hemley, vice president for
species conservation at the World Wildlife Fund. ``We won't be able
to save the tiger everywhere, and we've learned that we cannot ever
drop our guard again, but in some areas there's been some real
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and conservationists from around the world gathered
last month in New York for a three-day conference called ``Saving
the Tiger: Assessing our Success,'' held under the aegis of the
Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the Bronx Zoo. At the
meeting, researchers presented data indicating that tiger
populations are better off now than they were earlier this decade
in eastern Siberia, Nepal and some areas of India.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a forest south of Delhi called Ranthambhore,
popular among ecotourists eager for a glimpse of tiger, a 1993
census found that there were at most only 20 tigers left in the
region's 318 square miles. The latest tally, which has yet to be
officially released, suggests that the figure has since doubled and
is still rising.
</P>
<P>
   Even in countries where biologists feared that the tiger was
doomed, including Sumatra, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia, scientists
at the meeting reported encouraging signs of resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had such a surprise,'' said Dr. John Seidensticker, the
curator of mammals at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Zoological Park in Washington. ``We thought Sumatra was a loss, but
it turns out that even with its enormous political turmoil, which
is often accompanied by increased poaching, there are pockets where
survey data show there are good levels of tigers, more than we
expected to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiger is by no means faring well everywhere. In the mangrove
swamps of Bangladesh, where biologists had thought tiger
populations were relatively healthy, new survey results indicate
fewer than the predicted number of cats. And across its entire
range, the tiger is still quite scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Jackson, the chairman of the Cat Specialist Group of
the World Conservation Union in Switzerland, estimates that there
are 5,000 to 7,000 tigers left in Asia. Nobody knows how many
tigers dwelt on the continent originally, for there were no efforts
to track tiger populations until about 1972, but the number a
century ago was probably at least 10 times greater than today.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, that the mighty tiger is holding its own in many
pockets heartens biologists and offers a refreshing counterpoint to
the dirges in conservation circles, with their bleak refrains of a
world peopled solely by weedy species like squirrels, crows,
roaches, rats and people.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists attribute the tiger's recovery to several
factors. For one thing, many Asian countries have begun cracking
down harshly on poachers, who in the early 1990s were killing
tigers willy-nilly, mostly to obtain tiger bone, a popular
ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
   For another, conservationists have succeeded in gathering
critical information about tiger biology, hunting practices and
reproduction rates to advise governments on how best to save the
great cats. That advice varies from region to region, but one theme
predominates: the best way to save the tiger is to save the tiger's
prey: the deer, wild cattle and wild pigs that tigers eat, said Dr.
K. Ullas Karanth, ``like hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you manage the prey species well, the tigers will take care
of themselves.'' said Karanth, a conservation zoologist for the
Wildlife Conservation Society, who is based in Bangalore, India.
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee that there will be enough prey to support tigers,
he added, a country must set aside some places where humans are not
allowed to hunt, and hence where prey animals can always find haven
to breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it was very popular to talk about `sustainable
use,' the idea that you could have human use of a tiger habitat and
still have tigers,'' Karanth said. ``But our prey data have shown
that we need to have nested within these sustainable use areas some
truly protected places.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was likely that protected areas could be set aside
for the long term in countries as populous as India, Karanth said:
``I'm 51 now. When I first started going into the Indian forest, at
age 18 or 19, I thought soon there would be no more forests. But
there are more protected areas and more tigers now than when I had
given up hope as a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can do it in India,'' he said, ``you can do it anywhere
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do people living in the tiger's range need to be convinced
of the cat's worth, Seidensticker said, or told why saving the
tiger is the right thing to do, morally, ecologically and
economically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember talking to a government official in Bangladesh a
number of years ago, who said to me: `You don't have to tell me
that we should save the tiger. Of course we should save the tiger.
Just tell me how we can do it,''' Seidensticker recalled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In India, he said, the tiger is considered a national treasure,
and not for nothing do other countries in the tiger's domain call
themselves, sometimes wistfully, ``Asian tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   That the tiger hangs on suits its metaphorical heft, which, like
the fortissimo timber of its roar, has carried far, wide and deep.
The powerful Hindu goddess Durga rode a tiger mount, while Siva,
the god of destruction and reproduction, sat on a tiger skin.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chinese calendar, every 12th year is the year of the
tiger, and it is considered a lucky, powerful year to be born (that
means you, 1998 babies). The Romans loved the tiger, identifying
with its deadly might, and brought them from Turkey as mascots. The
Emperor Nero kept an entire stable of them, and Bacchus, the god of
wine, was depicted in mosaics as riding a chariot drawn by tigers.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake mused in a seditious nursery rhyme about the
``tyger, tyger, burning bright, in the forests of the night.'' Many
other tigers have infiltrated children's consciousness, as Winnie
the Pooh's strong, foolish friend Tigger; cartoon Calvin's stuffed
animal, Hobbes; and a well-known spokesbeast for Sugar Frosted
Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic value of the tiger is flamboyant enough that,
several years ago, a shareholder stood up at a corporate meeting
for Exxon, which long urged drivers to put a tiger in their tank.
The tiger has been so accommodating as logo and sound bite, the
shareholder said, that it's time to give something back to the
tiger.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Exxon, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
began a Save the Tiger fund in 1995 that will dispense $9 million
over eight years to various tiger preservation programs, to which
conservationists, ever strapped for cash, responded ``Gr-r-eat!''
</P>
<P>
   For all the tiger's cultural presence, the animal proper is
devilishly difficult to find in the wild. It lives largely in dense
forest underbrush, where its striped pattern keeps it well
camouflaged, so well that at least one renowned tiger researcher
admits he has never seen a tiger in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Other tiger biologists have spotted their subjects repeatedly,
yet they say it always feels as good as the first time. ``Even
finding their tracks is exciting,'' Jackson of the Cat Specialist
Group said. ``And when you see the tiger itself, it's an awesome
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Sunderbans, a swampy forest that straddles India and
Bangladesh on the Bay of Bengal, do people hope not to see tigers.
Living in the Sunderbans are about 250 tigers notorious for being
man-eaters, and every year they kill a dozen or so people who
venture into the forest to collect wood or fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, people have had some success in preventing attacks by
wearing hats with eyes painted on the back, for tigers rely on the
tactic of surprise, ambushing their prey from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Sunderbans, though, tigers have learned, after
centuries of being hunted, to shy away from human beings. They
prefer meatier meals in any event, the better to support their
massive bodies. Tigers vary in size depending on where they live
and what subspecies they are.
</P>
<P>
   The largest tigers are the Siberian males, which may be nine
feet long and weigh more than 500 pounds. The smallest tigers are
the Sumatrans, with males of 250 pounds and females 50 pounds
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Coats also vary from one subspecies to the next. Siberian and
Himalayan tigers live in cold climates and relatively open spaces,
and so they have long, thick, relatively light-colored fur, while
the tigers that live in the tropics have short, dark fur. Every so
often a Bengal tiger is born with almost white fur, the result of a
recessive genetic trait. These rare specimens have an otherworldly
glow and a magician's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the hue, all tigers have an almost magical capacity for
hunting. An adult can pull down a wild bull two or three times its
size, puncturing the prey's throat with canine teeth bigger than
your index fingers. Tigers, which have extraordinarily keen vision,
can hunt by sunlight or darkness, and researchers have been
surprised to find tigers hard on the trail in the heat of
midafternoon, when many creatures are taking siestas.
</P>
<P>
   A tiger is a semisolitary cat, living and hunting alone most of
the time, but not averse to occasional congregations. Young males
disperse at adolescence, but a daughter will often continue to live
near her mother for much of her life, inheriting the mother's
territory when she dies.
</P>
<P>
   Females are not the only doting parents. Recently, males have
been observed eating, playing and traveling with their cubs. They
have reason to look after their young: an interloping male will
often try to kill the resident cubs, his hope being that, by doing
so, he will put the mother tiger back into heat and have a chance
to mate with her. And tigers do mate and breed readily, which is
why, scientists say, they can rebound from near-extermination when
given half a chance.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to allow tigers to take care of themselves,
conservationists have joined forces lately with purveyors of
traditional Chinese medicine. One reason tigers hit bottom in the
early 1990s, researchers said, is that the explosive growth of the
Chinese economy led to an equally strong demand for products used
in traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger bone has long been a staple item in preparations to treat
arthritis, rheumatism and other muscular aches and pains. Rather
than excoriate traditional Chinese medicine as superstitious
hogwash _ an approach doomed to fail, given the enormous popularity
of Chinese medicine _ conservationists have approached experts in
the discipline to see if there were alternatives to tiger bone that
could be promoted. They have discovered, through examining
traditional texts, that one option is to substitute the bones of an
Asian rodent called a sailong, which is common in China.
</P>
<P>
   One way to make sailong bone desirable might be to charge more
for it than tiger bone ever commanded. It worked for fake fur,
didn't it? &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, on Oct. 29, the inaugural message was sent
over the first thin reed of what was to become the Internet. It was
nothing so portentous as ``What hath God wrought,'' the words
christening the telegraph in 1844. It was just the simple word
``login.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only two nodes on what was then known as the Arpanet,
the precursor to the Internet built by the Defense Department's
Advanced Research Projects Agency. As the story has become
enshrined in the folklore, a UCLA student named Charley Kline
tapped out the letters ``l'' and ``o,'' which were dutifully echoed
back by a computer at the Stanford Research Institute, a center
about 300 miles northwest in what was not yet Silicon Valley. When
he typed the third letter, ``g,'' the SRI computer was supposed to
recognize and complete the full command.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letters caused a memory buffer to overflow,
bringing down the system. But it was an exceedingly minor crash,
said Bill Duvall, who was tweaking the connection on the Stanford
end. The buffer size was increased and the first connection was
flawlessly made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I really don't care to be known as `The First Guy
to Crash the Internet,''' Duvall wrote in an e-mail message. What
sticks in his mind is the satisfying feeling of getting the pieces
of the complex system to mesh. The SRI computer had to be fooled
into thinking it was talking to a regular old teletype machine, a
``virtual user,'' which might as well have been in the same room.
Stanford had practiced for the occasion by running simulations of
the network connection. But there is no substitute for the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a bit of thought went into debugging the initial network
connection,'' Duvall recalled. ``When the SRI end came up, I was
pretty happy. I guess that it is a bit like a symphony _ it's the
last note that is remembered, not all of the stuff in between.''
</P>
<P>
   No one apparently thought to take a picture. And no one recalls
what messages followed. ``It seems like it should have been
`Watson, come here! I need you!''' Duvall said, referring to
Alexander Graham Bell's first, urgent telephonic command (he had
just spilled battery acid). ``That would not have been out of
character. But, alas, I really don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the revolution quietly began. With one scarcely noticed
milestone after another, the planetary nervous system envisioned in
the early '60s _ cyber rhetoric is as old as a Beatles tune _
unceremoniously began insinuating itself into society. A strange
amalgam of Defense Department money, engineering expertise, and
even a dab of countercultural idealism, slowly brought on the Net
we know today.
</P>
<P>
   There was no big ribbon-cutting a month later when a third node
was installed at the University of California at Santa Barbara, or
the following month, when the reach extended outside California to
the University of Utah. No golden spike was hammered into the
ground to commemorate the joining of the coasts with a link to
Cambridge, Mass., where a small consulting company called Bolt
Beranek &AMP; Newman had won the contract to build and run the Arpanet.
</P>
<P>
   What was emerging would be barely recognizable today. There were
no dot coms, no World Wide Web, nothing called e-mail. The main
purpose was to let university-based researchers for the Defense
Department agency share computer resources, allowing someone in,
say, California to run a program on a machine in Massachusetts.
Many system administrators were reluctant. Computer power was
scarce. Why should they share it with strangers?
</P>
<P>
   But from very early on, a handful of visionaries realized the
synergistic power that would come from someday putting a computer
on everybody's desk, then gradually weaving them into one great
matrix. In an age when computers were still identified in the
public mind with punch cards and spinning reels of tape, some of
the early fomenters of the information age showed stunning
prescience.
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1945, in The Atlantic Monthly, Dr. Vannevar Bush,
the engineer, educator and government research adviser, came up
with the basic idea of the personal computer, a device he called
the memex _ a mechanical extension of human memory. Never mind that
it was as big as a desk and that it stored all your documents,
including encyclopedias and reference libraries, on
super-fine-grained microfilm shuffled by nimble mechanical fingers
and projected onto translucent screens.
</P>
<P>
   Though embodied in the clunky technologies of the time, the
memex would work something like an associative memory _ or, less
grandiosely, a relational database. A user researching the history
of the bow and arrow might start by calling up an encyclopedia
article. When he found another relevant passage in a book, he would
link the documents with a few keystrokes, encoding them with crude
hyperlinks, and even add his own annotations. ``Thus he builds a
trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to
him,'' Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bush also speculated that going beyond ``dry
photography,'' the data might be stored as magnetized dots on
metallic sheets using the technology that already existed for
recording voices on spools of wire. And for entering data, he even
envisioned the scanner, an outgrowth of the radio facsimile
machines that already existed in his day.
</P>
<P>
   The big thing Bush missed was electronic networking. As he saw
the chain of events, the researcher would meet someone a few years
later who wanted to incorporate the bow-and-arrow material into his
own study on technology. ``He sets a reproducer in action,
photographs the whole trail out and passes it to his friend for
insertion in his own memex,'' he wrote, ``there to be linked into
the more general trail.'' He had invented the World Wide Web with
messengers on bicycles in place of high-speed digital T-3 lines.
</P>
<P>
   A decade and a half later, Dr. J.C.R. Licklider, one of the most
visionary computer scientists of his day, took another leap with
his predictions of a ``Galactic Network'' linking everyone to a
universe of information. In a later paper titled ``The Computer as
a Communication Device,'' he and Robert Taylor, who would go on to
direct the Arpanet project, imagined nothing less than ``a labile
network of networks, ever-changing in both content and
configuration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What will go on inside?'' they asked. ``Eventually, every
informational transaction of sufficient consequence to warrant the
cost. Each secretary's typewriter, each data-gathering instrument,
each dictation machine, will feed into the network.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There would be no need for letters, telegrams, telephone calls
or even business trips. People would simply link their computers to
other people's computers. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, investment
advice, tax counseling, advanced scientific modeling programs _ all
would be available within the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Online communities would form with people selected ``more by
commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of
proximity.'' And, more ominously, the two researchers speculated,
those denied the benefits of this ``intelligence amplification''
might be relegated to an information-deprived underclass. Both the
bright and dark sides of today's Internet were anticipated years
before the first message was sent.
</P>
<P>
   For all the grandiosity of the vision, the Internet developed
haltingly. To make Licklider's Galactic Net a reality, scientists
and engineers had to design a communications system that operated
like none that had come before.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious example to emulate might have been the telephone
network, in which long-distance calls from one small town to
another were routed like airline flights through one or more
central hubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1960s, researchers began to realize that a
computer network would be made much less vulnerable to failure if
it was more widely spread out _ less like the air travel system
than like the network of back roads weaving together every
municipality in the country. Each point is connected to its nearest
neighbors by several redundant paths. If a connecting node between
A and B fails, it is easy to find an alternative route.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an even more radical difference between the
networks of old and the one that was about to take root. In an
ordinary telephone system, two phones were linked by forming a
temporary circuit, a dedicated physical channel through which the
electrified voices flowed. The telegraph used a different
technology called message switching: Each telegram was given an
electronic address, then sent into the Net, where it would be
relayed, node by node, to its destination.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Baran at RAND Corp. and Donald Watts Davies at the British
National Physical Laboratory independently saw the advantages of
taking this ``store and forward'' model a step further. A message
from one computer to another would be chopped up into many little
packets, which would be sent swarming through the network to find
their way. Some would take this route, some would take that. Each
would carry a destination label along with instructions for where
the packet fit inside the overall message. No matter in what
sequence the pieces arrived, they could be reassembled.
</P>
<P>
   In this system, called packet switching, there would be no need
to tie up a circuit for a single transmission. And since the
messages were broken into smaller fragments, the flow would be
smoother. Finally, if a packet got corrupted, one could just resend
it and not the whole transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Dr. Leonard Kleinrock, who would preside
over the establishment of the first node at UCLA, was using a
mathematical tool called queuing theory to understand how data
would flow in a packet-switched network. By 1966, with these and
other basic ideas in place, Lawrence Roberts, recruited by ARPA
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mapped out the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the first transmission, the number of host
computers grew to 23. The (AT) symbol was invented in 1972, and a
year later 75 percent of the Arpanet traffic was e-mail. It was
starting to look like the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, other organizations, like the National Science
Foundation, wanted their own networks. By the late 1970s, Dr.
Robert Kahn and Dr. Vinton Cerf of ARPA were putting the finishing
touches on the lingua franca, inelegantly called TCP/IP, that would
weave the patches into the electronic quilt called the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just a fraction of the contributions. No one stands
in relation to the Internet as Bell to the telephone or Morse to
the telegraph. There was no single moment when it all came
together. From the beginning, it was a continuous collaboration of
many minds. And any attempt to recite the history in less than a
book must be notable for its omissions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1984, when the Net had grown to include 1,000
host computers, that the domain name system was established that
lets Amazon.com be Amazon.com and not 208.216.182.15. And in 1991
came the World Wide Web followed by Mosaic, the first graphical
interface, or browser, that inspired Netscape and Explorer. The
number of Internet hosts quickly exceeded a million, and this year
that number multiplied fiftyfold.
</P>
<P>
   Before long the barbarians were at the gates. Scientists on the
Net were suddenly getting e-mail from journalists, then from their
own parents, and then from schoolchildren asking for help with
their homework. The Pentagon was sharing the Web with pacifist
groups, cyberspace mirroring the conflicts of the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   And what a powerful tool it has become. Simply by typing
``Watson, come here'' into a search engine, one can now find a
scanned image of Bell's original notebook pages at the Library of
Congress. There on the yellowed paper, in his own handwriting, is
what he really said (slightly different from what's often quoted):
``Watson _ come here _ I want to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting up in the futurist's perch, where Licklider put himself
almost half a century ago, today's visionaries talk about the
arrival in the first decades of the coming millennium of
``ubiquitous computing.'' Hand-held computers will merge with cell
phones, talking to computers hidden in the office walls and the
trunks of cars, all linked into a pervasive net. With a spoken
command, a person would have instant access to the invisible ether
of information.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in 1960, Licklider called this kind of technobiological
mind meld ``man-computer symbiosis'' and ventured that bringing it
together might take 15 years. ``The 15 may be 10 or 500,'' he added
more realistically, ``but those years should be intellectually the
most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet inevitably recedes into the background, it can
almost be taken for granted _ the ultimate compliment. It has
become the platform on which its successor will rise. When the 40th
anniversary or the 50th rolls around, it will be even harder to
untangle the individual contributions to something so much bigger
than its inventors.

 By MARY DUFFY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The herb is called ephedra, or ma huang, and it comes from a
shrublike plant grown widely in Asia. It can be found in more than
200 diet supplements, in pills and powders, drinks and diet bars,
for sale in health food stores and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its advocates say it decreases appetite, raises metabolism,
improves concentration, burns fat and even enhances sexual
performance. In thousands of postings on the Internet, users praise
it for raising their energy, helping them lose weight and
sharpening their muscle tone.
</P>
<P>
   But to its critics, ephedra is a potentially dangerous substance
that urgently needs more study and regulation. They point out that
its active ingredient, ephedrine, is a central nervous system
stimulant similar to amphetamine, and they say reactions to it can
vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedrine has been widely studied over the past few years, and
studies suggest that it can produce a wide array of possible side
effects, including anxiety, insomnia, hypertension, tachycardia,
psychosis, kidney damage, dependency, heart attack, stroke and
death. The federal Food and Drug Administration says it has
received hundreds of reports from physicians, health authorities
and others about adverse reactions to ephedrine-based products.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and proponents alike agree on one thing: ephedra is
flying off the shelves. Metabolife International Inc., a 5-year-old
San Diego company that sells an ephedra-based pill called
Metabolife 356, says this year's sales will reach $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   A critic, Dr. Jacqueline Berning, a professor of nutrition at
the University of Colorado, whose clients include many professional
athletes, says the use of ephedrine-based products is ``rampant
among athletes,'' even though they have been banned by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra's active ingredient, ephedrine, has been in
over-the-counter cold and asthma medications since the 1920s, and
the ephedra plant has been used for thousands of years in Chinese
medicine. Still, the combined effects of the herbal potpourri found
in many diet supplements have not been studied. While
over-the-counter drugs are subject to Food and Drug Administration
regulation, herbal supplements are assumed safe unless proved
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a blind spot with the herbals,'' said Dr. Bill
Gurley, of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Arkansas.
``I have a feeling over time enough serious cases of addiction will
pile up and enough adverse events will be reported to change that
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurley has just completed a study suggesting wide variations in
product ingredients and quality. ``Ephedra supplements are derived
from plants that can contain any number of ephedrine-like
alkaloids,'' he said. ``These alkaloids vary not only in
pharmacological activity and potency, but certain combinations may
be additive or synergistieir effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In testing 19 ephedrine-based supplements, Gurley said, he found
wide variations in alkaloid content. Some products contained
significantly less of the active ingredients than listed on the
label, some significantly more.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in response to reports of adverse reactions, the
Food and Drug Administration proposed restricting doses of ephedra
to 8 milligrams at a time and 24 milligrams a day, and prohibiting
the addition of caffeine to ephedrine products. (The American
Herbal Products Association, a trade organization that sets
standards and guidelines for the diet supplement industry,
recommends that dosages not exceed 25 milligrams, or 100 a day; a
Metabolife pill has 12 milligrams, according to the label.)
</P>
<P>
   After a lobbying effort by the diet supplement industry, a
congressional subcommittee asked the General Accounting Office to
investigate the research behind the FDA's proposal. In August, the
accounting office issued a report assailing the agency's findings
as sloppy science. ``The FDA needs to provide stronger evidence on
the relationship between the intake of dietary supplements
containing ephedrine alkaloids and the occurrence of adverse
reactions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, ephedrine-based products have figured
prominently in two widely publicized cases, both involving deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a judge in British Columbia ruled that Julia
Campagna, a 28-year-old woman from Kirkland, Wash., was not
criminally responsible in the deaths of two teen-age girls in a
fiery car crash near the U.S. border in May 1998. Court-appointed
psychiatrists testified that Ms. Campagna had been in a state of
psychosis, a reaction to the ephedrine-based supplement Xendrine,
which she had taken for five days.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Anne Marie Capati, a 37-year-old knitwear designer
from Huntington, N.Y., died after suffering a stroke at a fitness
club in Manhattan. Ms. Capati, who suffered from high blood
pressure, had been taking Thermadrene, an ephedra supplement
manufactured by SportPharma of Concord, Calif. According to her
husband, who has sued the manufacturer, the fitness club and his
wife's personal trainer, she had been taking the recommended dose
for five days, ``to lose the last five pounds and firm up.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning label on Thermadrene (and many other brands,
including Metabolife) makes clear that ephedrine-based products
should not be taken by people with certain medical conditions,
including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michael Ellis, the chief executive of
Metabolife and a board member of the American Herbal Products
Association, strongly defended ephedrine-based supplements. ``I
read about the Long Island woman's death, and it's tragic,'' he
said. ``This case points out why we need consistency in the warning
labels. But let's keep this in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   With millions of people taking ephedrine each year, Ellis
argued, a few cases of adverse effects are to be expected. ``Some
people die from eating peanut butter or strawberries,'' he said.
``Everything carries risk.''
</P>
<P>
   He has urged the FDA to appoint a working group of scientists,
consumers, herbalists and industry representatives to develop new
guidelines for dietary supplements containing ephedra and other
herbs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the purity of Metabolife, he said: ``We believe we are
responsible. We label correctly, and we have a nonprofit third
party give us a certification of good manufacturing practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is at the center of the latest ephedra-related
controversy. After being interviewed for the ABC News program
``20/20,'' and anticipating a hostile report, Ellis took
pre-emptive action last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a $1.5 million advertising campaign Metabolife announced the
creation of a Web site (www.newsinterview.com) posting the unedited
70-minute interview. Commercial spots ran on 1,500 radio stations,
and a number of full-page newspaper advertisements. ABC News says
it expects to broadcast the interview later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, Ellis, a former police officer, was arrested
in San Diego and charged with using ephedrine to produce
methamphetamine, a highly addictive street drug. He pleaded guilty
to using a telephone in the trafficking of drugs and was sentenced
to five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something very wrong, something very much out of
character, and something I am very sorry about,'' he said, and
later added: ``Metabolife has been looked at inside and out. We
have a report from a DEA-approved lab that shows you can't make
methampethamine out of Metabolife. Obviously we are not breaking
any laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he was hopeful that the attention would help him make
a point. ``If this product and industry are going to have
longevity, we have to come out say, `You can't pop supplements like
they are carrots; this is another form of medicine.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is shared by many mainstream physicians. ``The
public should be informed,'' said Gurley, of the University of
Arkansas. ``A drug is a drug whether it's from a natural source or
you make it in laboratory.''

   A new paperback of an old book may not seem like a big deal,
except when its author is arguably the greatest scientist of all
time and the book was first published 312 years ago. So the Dibner
Institute for the History of Science and Technology, on the campus
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is giving Isaac
Newton a book party to celebrate the publication of the first new
translation in 270 years of his landmark work, ``Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia Mathematica,'' first published, in Latin, in
1687.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Principia,'' as the work is commonly calwton
laid out the concepts of space, time, force and motion that defined
physical science for two centuries and established the law of
universal gravitation. The first publication was underwritten by
Edmond Halley, who used Newton's laws to discover the orbit of the
comet that bears his name. The book has seldom been out of print
since.
</P>
<P>
   The new translation, published by the University of California
Press, was done by the Harvard University science historian Dr. I.
Bernard Cohen and by Anne Whitman, with assistance from Julia
Budenz.
</P>
<P>
   The Dibner Institute is taking advantage of the occasion to call
attention to the splendors of its Burndy Library, which holds more
than 40,000 books, scientific instruments, photographs and other
artifacts, including a first edition of Euclid from 1482.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a warm afternoon recently, Dr. Tanya Atwater, professor of
geology at the University of California at Santa Barbara, one of
the few women to be accorded membership in the National Academy of
Sciences, sat at her home computer in Montecito, Calif., creating
an animated film to explain how earthquakes are created along the
San Andreas fault in California.
</P>
<P>
   Using her own drawings, Atwater, 57, was making a film for
children that condensed millions of years of geologic history into
a few seconds of movement and showed how segments of the earth's
crust pushed against one another as parts of California made their
way toward Alaska. ``Isn't it a miracle that computers can do these
kinds of things now?'' Atwater said, laughing warmly. ``It's a
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own time, Tanya Atwater has seen her share of
revolutions. During the 1960s, while still a graduate student at
the University of Southern California, Atwater showed how the
western United States developed.
</P>
<P>
   A paper she wrote in 1970 on the origins and growth of the San
Andreas fault made her a major player in a geologic revolution: the
discovery that the earth's crust is broken into fragments called
tectonic plates whose jostling and rubbing together are constantly
reshaping the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that whenever you hear the rumble of an
earthquake, you get down on the floor to feel it better?
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. When their beds starts moving around, others jump
up, but I lay out real flat to feel it. We study earthquakes
looking at paper copy of a seismographic record of a quake. That's
an intellectual exercise. But if you can really feel the ground,
how it's moving, that's something.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a way to paraphrase ``Dr. Strangelove'' to ``learn
to stop worrying and love the quake?''
</P>
<P>
   A. All the things we find beautiful in landscapes _ mountains,
cliffs _ wouldn't exist, if it weren't for tectonic processes, like
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How close is your home to a fault?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There might be one under the whole coast here. That's a big
debate. We are probably in a situation like Northridge; this is a
subsidiary fault, not the main San Andreas. So we're probably only
going to have earthquakes every 1,000 years. In my lifetime, is it
going to go? I don't know. With the San Andreas, we know it goes
every 100 to 150. Our whole section hasn't moved since 1857, so we
are right in the window. That's why Californians make such a big
deal about The Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What should Californians know about The Big One?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That we live on a plate boundary. The rim of California is
being hauled off to Alaska as we speak. It isn't being hauled off
steadily. Every now and then, it rips and moves another few meters.
The earthquakes are really just showing us that the plates are
going by each other. You're not going to stop the whole Pacific
plate from moving toward Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when we're talking about The Big One, what geologists do is
look at the faults that make up the plate boundaries and ask if
they've moved lately and whether that motion between the two big
plates has been picking up or not. So, there are stresses in the
fault that have not broken in a very long time. For instance, the
one that wraps all around Los Angeles and is kind of inland from
here, hasn't broken since 1857.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you would not buy a house in San Bernardino, Riverside,
that neighborhood because of the faults?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd buy a house anywhere, if it was built well.
</P>
<P>
   You know, earthquakes, they are like weather, and we aren't
afraid of the rain. We make good roofs, good gutters and good
drains. Similarly, we know how to build buildings that don't fall
down in earthquakes. The truth is frame buildings don't fall down.
Their chimneys do, sometimes. Actually, buying a house in an
earthquake zone is much less scary than buying a house on a beach
cliff. Now, people who do  &UR; that  &LR; are crazy!
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you become a geologist?
</P>
<P>
   A. I started out as an undergraduate in physics at MIT in the
early '60s. My mother was a botanist and my father, an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   So I grew up in a scientific family. At MIT, I took geology and
I just loved it. As a kid, my family traveled around the West,
camping, river rafting, exploring. Finding a science that got me
outdoors and explained things I loved was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   However, geology in those days was a lot of facts without a
central template explaining why things were the way they were.
Happily, just at the time I was getting into it, the plate
tectonics revolution was starting with all this new data from the
middle of the ocean floor that showed how the plates moved apart.
</P>
<P>
   So eventually I applied to graduate school at Scripps Institute
of Oceanography. I got there two weeks after Fred Vine, who was the
daddy of this theory about sea floors' spreading. He had all these
magnetic measurements of the ocean floor. It turned out that the
ocean floor has markings on it, magnetic stripes, that with a
magnetometer show you how old it is. The data that you get is so
clear and easy to read that it just changed everybody's idea about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you get from the sea o California?
</P>
<P>
   A. The pattern of stripes off the coast of California was
different from that of other oceans. We concluded that there were
missing stripes, which had slipped under the rim of the North
American continent, bringing the Pacific plate up against the edge
of the continent where it could rub and create the San Andreas
fault. What I did was explain the San Andreas fault in the context
of the larger global scheme _ something that hadn't been done
before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You had big success very young. How does a successful
scientist top herself?
</P>
<P>
   A. Living up to my old self has been very tough. The early
success, it's given me great power: the ability to choose whatever
I want to do. I don't have to make a reputation and this has given
me the choices that a lot of other people don't have. For instance,
I spend a lot of time working with K-12 teachers. I teach
undergraduate geology.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Geology wasn't a field for women when you started. What
obstacles did you run into?
</P>
<P>
   A. Blatant sexism. A lot of institutions didn't allow women onto
research ships because they were considered unlucky. They wouldn't
allow women on off-shore rigs. There were no women in Antarctica; I
applied for that.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I had male mentors who helped me break barriers. When
there were administrators who said I couldn't be on a small ship
because there wasn't a separate bathroom for women, my mentors
would say, ``Well, she could sue you.'' And suddenly, they
discovered they could manage to have a female on board if you
locked the door on the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, women were not allowed in the submarine, and I
needed to go down to the ocean floor. Their main reason was, ``how
is she going to urinate?'' I was there doing spectacular science
and what they were worried about was that!
</P>
<P>
   Q. In John McPhee's book, ``Annals of the Former World,'' which
won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction, he claims that most
geologists go crazy at the sight of a good road cut, a place where
parts of a mountain have been sliced through to make way for a
road. Do you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yes, I almost crash the car when I see a good one. Around
Southern California, since the San Andreas is sort of ripping
through the countryside, the whole rim of California is all just
folded up and the layers that started out as flat sediment are all
contorted and set on their ears. In a lot of the road cuts, you can
see that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have the changes in technology _ high-speed computers,
satellites _ changed the way geologists work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yeah, particularly the information we get from NASA. For
decades, the geologist's job was to go on a ship, go out at 10
miles an hour and run little lines across the ocean to collect
magnetic and photographic data. That's still true for magnetic
data. But the stuff NASA is collecting from up above is just a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a satellite looking at the top of the water can detect the
topography of the ocean floor. The satellite goes around the earth
every four hours and produces maps with incredible detail. It does
a much better job than we'll ever do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Geologists deal with tens of millions of years at a glance.
What do you feel when you're trying to understand events over such
a vast period of time?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very tiny and ephemeral, really humble.

 CLINTON PUSHES NEWS LIMITS ON NATIONAL FORESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Through proposed new regulations and directives,
the Clinton administration is trying to curtail development in
national forests, a move that has heartened many environmental
groups but infuriated commercial timber interests and conservative
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, the U.S. Forest Service unveiled a set of
proposed regulations on how to manage its lands with a new emphasis
on ecological health. The regulations, now open to review and
public comment, would essentially give environmental concerns
priority over economic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman described the plan as a
``fundamental change in policy.'' Mike Anderson, a senior resource
analyst with The Wilderness Society, called the proposed
regulations a ``good step ... toward environmental protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are calling them unfair and shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another step toward turning the national forests into
national parks,'' said Bob Slocum, executive vice president of the
North Carolina Forestry Association in Raleigh. He fears the
Clinton administration wants to eliminate logging and road
construction from the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is also considering a plan to place
millions of acres of national forests off-limits to commercial
development. That initiative has not yet been released, but rumors
of its existence began circulating in Washington in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that next week at some level the Clinton
administration will announce that it is pursuing better protection
for roadless areas of the national forests,'' said Nathaniel
Lawrence, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, which closely follows forestry issues. ``I think it
remains to be seen whether it's more show than substance.'' Some 40
million acres of forest land are expected to be included in the new
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates are pressing the administration to ban
road building and logging in vast swaths of the national forests,
which currently support a variety of activities, including logging,
recreation and wildlife preservation. They also want the
administration to include the Tongass National Forest in the
expected initiative. The Alaska forest is the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   The vast bulk of national forest land is out West. But some
eastern states, including North Carolina, have national forests
that could be affected by the Forest Service's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to hurt the economy and I believe the
environment in the long run,'' said Slocum of the North Carolina
Forestry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, western North Carolina has already seen protests by
loggers upset over a halt in logging in the Nantahala National
Forest because of the presence of a rare bat. Slocum said he
expects that the new initiatives by the White House will only
further galvanize timber interests in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of federal activity has critics charging that the
Clinton administration is trying to revamp federal conservation
policies through executive fiat, without any congressional input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the impression that people in this administration may be
trying to rush things along, fearing that time is running out,''
said W. Henson Moore, president and CEO of the American Forest &AMP;
Paper Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who chairs a key Senate subcommittee
on public lands management, said he supports the notion that
ecological sustainability ought to be a key goal of the U.S. Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how do you achieve better health,'' Craig
said. ``That's where the argument lies.'' The administration is
hostile to the idea that logging can and should be part of an
overall plan for healthy forests, he said. Logging, he said, helps
eliminate diseased trees and cuts down on fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also questioned the administration's recent approach,
saying it appeared unwilling to work with the Republican-controlled
Congress on forestry issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 11th hour of this administration, in the dark of night,
are they going to toss out some regulations?'' Craig asked.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, conservative lawmakers have turned to the annual
spending bills to achieve their goals. For example, the
appropriations bill for the Interior Department includes language
that would give the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management more discretion in deciding whether to conduct wildlife
population surveys before deciding on road-building permits and
logging.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that move would open the door to more road
construction and logging and threaten wildlife. But supporters say
it would simply allow federal agencies to make decisions without
getting bogged down in endless studies.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior appropriations bill still faces votes in the House
and Senate.

SELF MAKES A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Self'' used to be a dirty word. ``The wretch, concentered all
in  &UR; self &LR; ,'' wrote Sir Walter Scott in 1805, might get ``power and
pelf'' but would wind up ``unwept, unhonored and unsung.'' Not so,
said Walt Whitman a half- century later. ``I celebrate myself,'' he
sang in his ``Song of Myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the notion of  &UR; self &LR;  as something to be
celebrated has been taking a beating; Scott's sneer at  &UR; self &LR; 
reverberates through the language. It is bad to be  &UR; selfish &LR; , good
to be  &UR; selfless &LR; . People who are smug are  &UR; self-satisfied &LR; ,
narcissists are  &UR; self-absorbed &LR;  and often  &UR; self-indulgent &LR;  and
braggarts are  &UR; self-serving &LR; . You can find a few uses that reflect
well on  &UR; self &LR;  _ like  &UR; self-reliant &LR;  and  &UR; self-possessed &LR;  _ but
most praise is lavished on the rejection of self, as in
 &UR; self-sacrifice &LR; . And  &UR; selflessness &LR;  is next to godliness.
</P>
<P>
   Then  &UR; self &LR;  made a comeback. Showing some self-confidence, it
became the name of a Conde Nast magazine aimed at women interested
in their own bodies and minds. Its 20th-anniversary issue, out this
month, faces some of the bad  &UR; self &LR; s (``self-love, self-pity,
self-delusion, self-aggrandizement'') but dwells more on the good
 &UR; self &LR; s (``self-help, self-governing, self-made, self-respect,
self-denial'' and, for ovens, ``self-cleaning'').
</P>
<P>
   Though a bit self-conscious about a decline in their
publication's circulation, Self's editors gutsily reprint a Mike
Twohy cartoon showing a timid fellow writing in his diary, ``Dear
Diary, Sorry to bother you again,'' captioned ``Low Self-Esteem.''
In that regard, what to do about  &UR; myself &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   This reflexive pronoun requires reflection.  &UR; Reflexive &LR;  means
``turned back on itself,'' and a reflexive pronoun turns the action
back on its subject: ``I ((pronoun as subject)) perjured ((verb))
 &UR; myself &LR;  ((reflexive pronoun pointing back to the subject `I')).''
</P>
<P>
   The correct use of  &UR; self &LR;  or  &UR; selves &LR;  attached to  &UR; my &LR; ,  &UR; your &LR; ,
 &UR; him &LR; ,  &UR; her &LR; ,  &UR; them &LR;  or  &UR; our &LR;  is to turn the action back on the
other pronoun in the sentence. The subject and the object are the
same thing. But too many writers are using  &UR; myself &LR;  in an orgy of
false modesty, fearing to make the squeakily assertive sound of the
first-person singular accusative and dative  &UR; me &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter did it in his farewell address (a speech
he concluded with the word  &UR; farewell &LR; , which is the proper way to
end a farewell address). He said, ``I will work hard to make sure
that the transition from  &UR; myself &LR;  to the next president is a good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   When I popped him on this, E. Ward Gilman, editor of
Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage _ ``Dr. Roundheels''
himself _ cited the use of  &UR; myself &LR;  instead of  &UR; me &LR;  by
grammar-conscious authors from Dr. Samuel Johnson to E.B. White. He
even found the abomination in a sentence _ ``No longer were Price,
Buchanan and  &UR; myself &LR;  part of the innermost circle'' _ written in
1974 by me, and in no way ``written by myself.'' Even Homer
noodled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Myself &LR;  is being used incorrectly in place of the first-person
singular nominative. (I'm too shy to write  &UR; I &LR; .) The new Uriah
Heeps, wallowing in phony humility, eschew the use of  &UR; I &LR; .
Sometimes, blushing shyly and digging a toe in the dirt, they
substitute  &UR; yours truly &LR; . More often, they replace the
``perpendicular pronoun'' with the horizontal pronoun,  &UR; myself &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, I was astounded when my predecessor as a
conservative New York Times columnist, Arthur Krock, titled his
memoirs about growing up in the 1890s ``Myself When Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until I plunged into the philological scholarship required
for this article did I discover that he bottomed the title on
Edward FitzGerald's translation of a quatrain in the ``Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam'' ( &UR; ruba`i &LR;  means ``quatrain'';  &UR; rubaiyat &LR;  is the
plural): ``Myself when young did eagerly frequent/Doctor and Saint,
and heard great argument/ About it and about: but evermore/Came out
by the same Door wherein I went.'' Poets can get away with
anything,  &UR; myself &LR;  included.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate to begin a sentence with  &UR; myself &LR; , as in `` &UR; Myself &LR; ,
I could not care less,'' try  &UR; as for me &LR;  or  &UR; for my part &LR; . A
reflexive pronoun is fine, however, as an emphasizer. I used one a
moment ago, as ``Dr. Roundheels  &UR; himself &LR; ,'' above.
</P>
<P>
   Americans use  &UR; myself &LR;  to underscore a pronoun as often as the
British use the superfluous  &UR; indeed &LR; , which means ``you bet; hear,
hear,'' and the emphatically reflexive ``If I do say so  &UR; myself &LR; .''
Let us not become the  &UR; Myself &LR;  Generation. If you want to show
submission, sew a large sign on the seat of your pants that reads,
``Kick me.'' Avoid ``Kick  &UR; myself &LR; .'' The latter lacks
 &UR; self-esteem &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy Run-Through
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall the `Music Man'  &UR; gypsy run-through &LR; ,'' writes Stuart
Ostrow in his new book, ``A Producer's Broadway Journey.'' He
defines the phrase as ``a private performance of a new musical
attended by the cast members' family and friends on the last day of
rehearsals before the out-of-town tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Run-through &LR; , or ``hasty rehearsal,'' was coined by P.G.
Wodehouse in his 1923 ``Inimitable Jeeves.'' And  &UR; gypsy &LR;  was
defined in the 1973 ``Language of Show Biz'' as ``a chorus member
in a musical,'' specifically a dancer. But  &UR; gypsy run-through &LR;  was
a new one to me, so I called Ostrow at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the origin of  &UR; gypsy &LR;  _ ``Egyptian'' _ but was gypsy
dancing the metaphoric source of calling members of a chorus line
 &UR; gypsies &LR; ? No. ``Bob Fosse once told me,'' Ostrow said, ``that
dancers are the best soldiers. You tell them to jump into the
orchestra pit and they ask only, `How many counts?' We call dancers
 &UR; gypsies &LR;  because  &UR; gypsies &LR;  are known for always moving from place
to place _ and a dancer has to be constantly on the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Real  &UR; Gypsies &LR;  rightly resent the use of the verb  &UR; to gyp &LR;  as an
ethnic slur, but mobility is no derogation, and I (myself!) wish I
had a dancing relative to invite me to a  &UR; gypsy run-through &LR; .

BRAVOS FOR THE RETURN OF A DIVA: BARCELONA'S OPERA HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ If the destruction of the Gran Teatre del
Liceu by fire on the morning of Jan. 31, 1994, was a nightmare, the
reopening of the legendary opera house at performance
Thursday evening was like awakening to find that nothing had
changed. As the curtain went up on a new production of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' the red-and-gold auditorium looked much as it did
when the Liceu was inaugurated in 1847 and when it was rebuilt
after the last fire in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been otherwise. Such has been the Liceu's
importance in Barcelona's cultural and social life since the
mid-19th century that the idea of replacing the burned-out opera
house with a modern building was never mooted. The only way of
healing the wounds caused by the fire, it seems, was to pretend
that it had not happened. The choice of ``Turandot'' was not
accidental: It was the next opera on the program when the Liceu
(pronounced lee-say-OOH) went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all the emotions stirred by the reopening on
Thursday, attended by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia along with
much of Spain's political and economic elite, the Catalans are ever
practical. Thus, while discreet modern paintings on ceiling panels
are about the only changes in the auditorium, the rest of the opera
house has been transformed, with the addition of new rehearsal
rooms, a new foyer below the orchestra seats and, most
significantly, a state-of-the-art back stage, with extra space to
store production sets.
</P>
<P>
   Complex negotiations were needed for this to happen, though. The
opera house's entrance stands on the elegant tree-lined Paseo de
las Ramblas, but the rest of the Liceu was enclosed by old
apartment and office buildings that had to be acquired from their
private owners before the expansion could go ahead. The area
occupied by the Liceu has now doubled in size.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, while the opera house had been managed by the local
government since 1981, it was still owned by 400 heirs of the
wealthy families that built, and rebuilt, it in the 19th century.
Now, with only $14 million available from insurance, they could not
afford to rebuild it again. In exchange for priority to buy a
limited number of tickets in perpetuity, they therefore ceded the
property to a foundation run by the Spanish, Catalan and Barcelona
governments, which assumed most of the $120 million cost of
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a new Liceu to rise from the ashes in less than six
years is all the more remarkable given the recent troubles of some
other European opera houses. La Fenice in Venice, destroyed by fire
in January 1996, has seen its reconstruction delayed until at least
2002 by judicial investigations and political squabbling. London's
Covent Garden, which reopens in December after a $367 million
expansion, has had its image muddied by charges of mismanagement
and elitism. Madrid's Teatro Real, which reopened in 1997 for the
first time since 1925, has yet to win a place among Europe's top
opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Liceu is in many ways starting afresh. It has a
loyal audience that remembers when Maria Callas sang here and takes
pride in the opera house's role as cradle for such great Spanish
singers as Victoria de los Angeles, Montserrat Caballe and Jose
Carreras. But even before the fire, the Liceu was living more off
its name than the quality of the performers and productions on its
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Liceu's general director, Josep Caminal i Badia, has put
together a new team with a mandate to create a program on a par
with the new building. Joan Matabosch, the house's artistic
director, already has experience in organizing recitals, operas in
concert and occasional full-scale operas in other city theaters
over the last three years. Bertrand de Billy, the 34-year-old
French conductor who was appointed music director last year, has in
turn been holding auditions in order to build the Liceu's orchestra
and chorus back to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   For their first season, apart from ``Turandot,'' they have
scheduled Janacek's ``Makropulos Case,'' Donizetti's ``Lucia di
Lammermoor,'' Verdi's ``Don Carlo,'' Wagner's ``Lohengrin,''
Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro,'' Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's ``Sly'' and
Bellini's ``Beatrice di Tenda'' in concert version. Along with a
full program of concerts and recitals, they will also present the
Frankfurt Ballet, the Compania Nacional de Danza and the Bolshoi
Ballet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The house has already adopted the common European practice of
preferring co-productions to assuming the full cost of new
productions. ``Turandot,'' for instance, will travel to the Theatre
du Capitole in Toulouse, France, while ``Don Carlo'' is being
co-produced with the Teatro Bellini in Catania, Italy, and Robert
Carsen's production of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' will be coming from
the Grand Theatre de Bordeaux in France.
</P>
<P>
   The new Liceu hopes to present as many as 12 operas per season
within a few years, but it is starting cautiously. ``This season is
considered a dress rehearsal every night until next July,'' said
Adela Rocha, the Liceu's spokeswoman, noting that it would take
time to break in the new building, with all its high-tech
equipment. Indeed, teething problems were all too evident at the
final dress rehearsal for ``Turandot'' when de Billy had to stop
the orchestra after a few bars because the curtain did not rise.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's gala, however, everything went off smoothly. The
lavish sets and costumes in Nuria Espert's production of Puccini's
``Chinese opera'' seemed appropriate for the occasion, while the
warm applause for the orchestra and chorus suggested that de Billy
had begun well at the Liceu. Among the singers, Giovanna Casolla as
Turandot and Jan Blinkhof as Calaf performed solidly, although only
the Spanish soprano Maria Bayo as Liu stirred excitement.
</P>
<P>
   No one was in a mood to be critical. The real stars of the
evening were the new building and those who had made it possible.
In time, expectations of excellence onstage will no doubt rise. But
for the moment, it was not arias but the rebirth of a cherished
theater that had many in the audience damp-eyed. For Barcelona's
opera lovers, the nightmare was over: the Liceu was back.

League World Series with Canadian champion Trail, British Columbia.
Hockey may be the dominant sport in Canada, but it isn't a
year-round sport for kids. ``We grew up playing baseball in the

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It was, in some ways, a typical day for John Ridley.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours the other morning at his home in Hollywood Hills,
Ridley worked on a nearly completed novel for Knopf. Then he drove
to Santa Monica to meet with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer on his
film script for a ``Beverly Hills Cop IV'' for Eddie Murphy. By
afternoon, Ridley was driving to Warner Brothers to look at scenes
from ``Third Watch,'' the NBC series about paramedics, firefighters
and the police. He is a top writer on the show.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, he was at home to work on a new film script,
a psychological thriller, for the director Michael Bay
(``Armageddon''). That night, he picked up a yellow note pad to
revise a ``Third Watch'' script in time for a 10 a.m. meeting with
the producers the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of how my day spills out,'' Ridley said. ``I love
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the most prolific writers in Hollywood, Ridley,
34, is credited with the story for the new George Clooney film
``Three Kings,'' a dark comedy about a group of soldiers in search
of a fortune during the Persian Gulf war. Ridley said he had
created the idea and written the initial screenplay, which was
later revamped and credited to the director, David O. Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so uninvolved in that movie,'' he said glumly. ``I read in
the trade papers that I was off the movie. No one called me. You
make good money, but let's just say they don't treat writers well
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley is unusual in numerous ways. He studied East Asian
languages and culture at New York University, worked as a stand-up
comedian at clubs in New York and Los Angeles, is married to a
professional gambler and spends most weekends in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He is also one of the few black television and film writers
whose work is often unrelated to racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a unique voice,'' said Ed Bernero, co-creator of
``Third Watch.'' ``The writing is very lyrical, beautiful to read,
unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernero said that when he had initially discussed the show with
the producer and co-creator, John Wells (``E.R.''), Ridley's name
was almost the first on the list of writers to sign on. ``His voice
was the kind of voice we wanted on this show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ridley began writing for television in 1993 for sitcoms
with largely black casts, like ``Martin'' and ``Fresh Prince of Bel
Air,'' as well as ``The John Laroquette Show,'' he later moved to
series like ``Trinity,'' about an Irish family in New York, and
then ``Third Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Stray Dogs,'' a tale about a drifter on his
way to Las Vegas to pay off a Mafia loan shark, was later turned
into an Oliver Stone film, ``U Turn,'' starring Sean Penn, Nick
Nolte and Jennifer Lopez. His third novel, ``Everybody Smokes in
Hell'' (Knopf), deals with what his favorite writer, Raymond
Chandler, once called the ``degraded community'' of Hollywood,
which includes small-time talent agents, drug dealers, strippers
and some not-so-beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things I do are not what you would expect out of a
young black guy _ and that was part of the problem,'' said Ridley,
a tall, bearded and figure in jeans and a sweatshirt, in the
commissary at the Warner Brothers studio in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the predominantly black television shows he
worked on, like ``Hangin' With Cooper'' and ``Martin,'' left him
somewhat indifferent because of their lack of sophistication.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another level of show that I would have loved to have
been on,'' Ridley said. ``Like `Seinfeld' or `Frasier' or something
like that. I would have loved to have a show like that with a mixed
cast or an all-black cast. Unfortunately, those shows don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley grew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee; his father, John, is
a doctor, and his mother, Terri, a teacher. After being voted the
funniest student in high school, he moved to New York in his late
teens to perform in clubs as a comedian but attended NYU (to please
his parents) and took up Asian studies. After graduation, he lived
and traveled in Japan for a year before returning to New York to
work in clubs like Catch a Rising Star. (He appeared on ``The
Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ridley moved to Los Angeles in 1990 _ ``I needed a
change of pace'' _ he had completed a novel called ``Straight
Odds,'' which helped him get a talent agent. This led to television
work and his first published novel, ``Stray Dogs'' (Ballantine),
which earned strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   His second novel, ``Love Is a Racket'' (Knopf), a gritty drama
about a failed screenwriter turned con man, was also well received
by critics. His writing was called ``smart and edgy and even
moving'' in The New York Times Book Review, and The San Francisco
Examiner has said his fiction ``brings to mind Raymond Chandler and
Elmore Leonard.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Sonny Mehta, president and editor in chief of Knopf,
who is also Ridley's editor, compared him to both Chandler and
Dashiell Hammett.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's voice is both hard and soft, gritty and urbane,'' Mehta
said. ``It's also a very contemporary voice. You see a lot of
Chandler because of the subjects he writes about, and a lot of
Hammett because of the stripped-down nature of the writing, and the
morality of it.'' He added, ``John and his subjects seem to have a
love-hate relationship with Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   What also fascinated Mehta about Ridley, he said, was that his
novels are populated by blacks as well as whites. ``You can read
Ridley for a while before you realize that many of the people he's
writing about are black,'' Mehta said. ``He doesn't wear it on his
sleeve. And what you realize is that he's writing about a black and
white underclass. It makes it kind of original.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley has completed the draft of another novel for Knopf,
tentatively called ``A Conversation With the Mann,'' about a black
man's life from the 1930s to the '90s, set mostly in New York, Los
Angeles and Las Vegas. ( Ridley's favorite writers, besides
Chandler, are Jim Thompson, Chester Himes, Walter Mosley and Norman
Mailer.)
</P>
<P>
   His ability to switch back and forth between projects is
enviable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually carry a note pad with me,'' he said. ``If I'm
waiting for a meeting to start, I'll write. If I'm on an airplane,
I'll write. Whenever there's a second to write the book, I'll do
it. I love it. I usually write in longhand first and then put it in
the computer. It kind of gives you two passes at the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have a problem switching back and forth. I know it
sounds kind of weird, but I write as much as I can, whether it's
the book or a movie, and then I move on to something else. For a
while I had two computers _ I was writing things simultaneously. I
love to write. I could write all day and all night. Ask my wife _
she'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley's wife is Gayle Yoshida, who was a script superviser on
``Martin.'' ``She doesn't like to be called a professional gambler
because she thinks it has a bad connotation, but she makes a living
gambling _ and I love it,'' said Ridley, who acknowledged that,
unlike his wife, he loses more than he wins. The couple are now
looking to buy a house in Las Vegas, a city that fascinates him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I could take you places in Las Vegas that would just
break your heart,'' Ridley said. ``Whatever your addiction is,
there's a place for it. It's so sad to see those 24-hour pawn
shops, people pawning their stereo equipment because they're either
desperate or have stolen it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not all his work has been successful. Ridley's effort to direct
his screenplay ``Cold Heart,'' about a pair of jewelry thieves,
starring David Caruso and Kelly Lynch, flopped, partly because,
Ridley said, the film's financiers kept getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the idea came up for ``Three Kings,'' Ridley gave a
response that was typical of the way he writes. He said he had long
had this idea for a contemporary adventure similar to the classic
John Huston film ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''(1948), about
gold and greed. Ridley decided to set his story during the Persian
Gulf war. In the movie, soldiers secretly hunt for a treasure in
occupied Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote it on the fly,'' Ridley said. ``I took my wife to
Vegas. We were there for a week. We'd gamble for a while, and then
I'd say: `Honey, I'm going up to the room for an hour. I'll be
back.' And that's how I wrote that story.''

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In early January 1998, the outlook seemed dire for
two families trying to regain two Egon Schiele paintings that had
been confiscated from their relatives by the Nazis and later wound
up at an Austrian foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art, which had borrowed the works for an
exhibition, had turned down pleas that it hold onto the paintings
while the families contested ownership. Instead, the museum said,
the works would go back to the Leopold Foundation in Vienna,
Austria, on ``Jan. 8 or shortly thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the afternoon of Jan. 7, the Manhattan district
attorney, Robert Morgenthau, rode to the rescue, obtaining a grand
jury subpoena keeping the works in the city pending his criminal
investigation into their ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 21 months later, the only movement on the ownership
question has come in the last three weeks, after New York state's
highest court invalidated the subpoena and a U.S. attorney and the
U.S. Customs Service started a civil forfeiture proceeding to
determine who owns ``Portrait of Wally.'' (The other painting,
``Dead City,'' has a different history and has been returned to
Vienna.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, too, Morgenthau's strategy is being questioned. As he
moved, federal officials were also preparing legal action to keep
``Wally'' here, and many lawyers believe that the chances of
determining true ownership expeditiously are far greater under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has the power to forfeit the painting, which
seems to be more to the point,'' said Thomas Kline, a Washington
lawyer who has represented other victims of Nazi looting, ``but
federal-state coordination is always a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the forfeiture process, the United States invites potential
claimants to prove their interests, leaving a federal judge to
adjudicate. By contrast, to prosecute a criminal case with
``Wally'' as evidence, Morgenthau first had to get around New
York's 30-year-old Arts and Cultural Affairs Law, which prevents
any seizure of art lent to museums.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kaye, the lawyer for the heirs of Lea Bondi Jaray, a
Jewish art dealer who was forced to leave ``Wally'' behind when she
fled Vienna in 1939, said: ``I would have preferred being at this
point 20 months ago, too, but he moved first. And I also know that
people say these organizations compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers, nodding in agreement, are asking if the politics
of championing a popular cause and Morgenthau's well-known rivalry
with the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, now headed by Mary Jo
White, led him to leap into the case. Why else, they say, would he
try to test the applicability of the New York law instead of
allowing a tried-and-true civil procedure to resolve the dispute?
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Morgenthau said he did not believe
that federal officials were ready to act when he did, and he called
the notion that he wanted to pre-empt Ms. White ``nonsense.'' He
said he ``applauded what the Southern District did,'' and offered
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the state's Court of Appeals, which on Sept. 21 ruled 6-1
against Morgenthau, implicitly faulted his case. During oral
arguments on Aug. 24, the justices inquired about his inquiry and
its lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Their ruling also indicated displeasure, noting that ``an
indictment has not been forthcoming'' despite the passage of time.
This weighed heavily on the court in its determination that the
subpoena was tantamount to a seizure. As one lawyer involved in the
case who would not speak for attribution said, ``They were not
happy with what the DA had not done and with the length of time it
was taking him not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau conceded that the criminal investigation into
``Wally's'' ownership stopped when the Modern moved to quash the
subpoena on Jan. 22, 1998, and that he therefore had no plan to
seek an indictment soon. ``We felt we had to wait until we found
out the court's interpretation of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau declined to comment on the investigation. But he
blamed much of the delay on the courts. While the New York state
Supreme Court decided against Morgenthau in May 1998, it was not
until last March that the Appellate Division of the state Supreme
Court reversed the ruling. That sent the case to the state's
highest court, which had the final word last month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers who handle art claims said they never understood
where the subpoena would lead or whom the district attorney planned
to indict. The Nazi who seized the painting from Mrs. Bondi is long
dead, as are the officials at the Austrian National Gallery who
took it and traded it to Rudolf Leopold of the Leopold Foundation.
Leopold, now in his 70s, lives in Vienna, and if the case were
tried under Austrian law as expected, the statute of limitations
would absolve him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were challenges ahead for Morgenthau, even if he had won
the fight with MOMA,'' said Willi Korte, a stolen-art investigator
who has been retained by the Bondi family. ``I think the U.S.
attorney stayed away from the criminal aspects of this case in
order not to pick a fight that is extremely difficult to win. Even
if there were an indictment, then what? You'd have to spend an
enormous amount of money to win this.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of time, Morgenthau's critics contend, was unnecessary
because other efforts to keep ``Wally'' in New York were proceeding
as its shipment loomed. The Bondis, their representatives and
various Jewish and legal organizations had contacted the State
Department, the Justice Department, Ms. White's office, Customs,
the offices of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Gov. George Pataki, and
others they thought could help.
</P>
<P>
   Customs and Ms. White seemed poised to act. ``It was my
understanding, based on communications that I had on January 7,
1998, with Customs, the U.S. attorney's office and Senator
D'Amato's office, that they were ready to seize `Wally' that day or
the day thereafter,'' Korte said. ``Whether they could have
withstood the heat generated, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, wary of an international contretemps, was
reluctant to intervene, but there was still at least 24 hours for
the agencies to work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   And what would have happened then appears to be happening now.
Shipment of the painting has been halted by a seizure warrant, the
case has been assigned to a judge, the government has invited
interested parties to claim ``Wally,'' and the Leopold Foundation
and the heirs of Mrs. Bondi are doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Sept. 24, the Bondi family sued the Leopold
Foundation in U.S. District Court in Manhattan for the painting.
The suit was assigned to the same judge as the federal case _
Michael Mukasey _ and the cases may well be joined in court. Court
delays are common, of course, but the process, for the first time,
is in motion.

SOFT ON CRIME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anyone remember Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft's
short-lived campaign last year for the 2000 Republican presidential
nomination?
</P>
<P>
   Really inspiring, eh? The senator fashioned himself the voice of
the far right _ tough on pregnant teenagers, tough on church
backsliders, tough on immorality and dishonesty, tough on crime.
But above all, big on defending the Bible Belt's white male
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   That message didn't sell beyond the narrow confines of the
religious right. So in January Ashcroft retreated to seek
re-election to the Senate instead. That's proving to be heavy
lifting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now his focus is on painting his popular rival, Democratic Gov.
Mel Carnahan, as the personification of those moral evils he railed
against as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim of this strategy is not Carnahan but an
appointee of his _ Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White,
whose nomination to the federal bench was defeated by Senate
Republicans last week strictly as a favor to Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial nominations, as with everything else in the nation's
capital, are buffeted by the political winds. But dumping on
Justice White was a particularly crass example of a bunch of
partisans doing a bad thing to help a buddy hang onto his Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   And, aha, there's a catch. This may turn out to have hurt
Ashcroft more than it helps him. It should.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court nomination of White, the first African
American to serve on the Missouri high bench, had been pending for
two years. Ashcroft's state colleague in the Senate, Christopher
Bond, initially urged the Judiciary Committee to approve White, and
three Republicans on the panel voted for him. But when the vote
came to the Senate floor, all three as well as Bond reversed
themselves and joined the GOP stampede against him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 12 years that the full Senate has
rejected a judicial nominee. Normally, controversial nominations
are stopped procedurally before reaching a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft had made a special last-minute plea to his Republican
colleagues to give him this one. He called White ``pro-criminal''
and an ``activist'' jurist, GOP code for a liberal who hands down
decisions they don't like. He accused White of insufficiently
applying the death penalty to bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   White's judicial record does not support such charges, but the
Republican senators didn't care. What Ashcroft wanted, Ashcroft
got. Afterward, several Republican colleagues said they didn't know
anything about White, including the fact that he is black.
Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, campaigning for president on the
grounds he has more wisdom in picking judges than anyone, observed
lamely, ``I don't think I had a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   White's judicial performance was not really the point anyway.
Capitol Hill politics are so unstable that President Clinton has
begun predicting the Republicans will lose the Senate next year as
well as the House _ rather a stretch, but no longer inconceivable.
Ashcroft's seat suddenly matters a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is not an originial thinker, as his doomed presidential
campaign demonstrated. This is a politician behind the curve. His
timing was off regarding the clout of the far right. Now he's
recycling Richard Nixon's old anti-black, law-and-order mantra,
pretty much left in the dust of overt racist politics years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is a minor item on the national agenda. It is
useful mostly as a symbol of those bad old days when liberals
imposed their moral qualms about the state's right to take any
human life on the judicial system. No more. The liberals lost that
one, and capital punishment is now commonly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft claimed that his sole objection was that White is
overly anxious to reverse death sentences against convicted felons.
We are supposed to believe the judge's color had nothing to do with
the senator's hostility.
</P>
<P>
   But White's record shows he upheld the imposition of the death
penalty in 41 of the 59 cases that came before him. In 10 of the 18
cases in which White voted against the death penalty, he was joined
by a unanimous court. Three justices appointed by Ashcroft himself
when he was governor concurred on votes to reverse death penalties
more often than White.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft cites two cases, one involving an accused cop-killer
and another a drug courier, in which White reversed the death
penalty for legal improprieties. That's what judges are supposed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   And so, inevitably, we come back to race. Could Ashcroft have
persuaded his Republican colleagues to make partisan fools of
themselves by doing him such a transparent favor with no
intellectual underpinnings if the nominee being rejected were a
white male? The answer, sadly, is probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is now positioned as the champion of white innocents
against a black judge who would let murderers go free. But once
again he seems behind the political curve.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, although always a concern, is down almost everywhere.
Professional blacks have been moving steadily into prominent public
roles since Ashcroft entered government service some two decades
ago, and they are handling those roles well. Stirring up racial
tension is a nasty game that is now more subtle and uncertain than
in the past days of open confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders are furious at Ashcroft and are vowing to
campaign against him. Revenge is in the air. In an era of rapidly
expanding Hispanic voting rolls and black concerns about a
Republican GOP White House, minorities are likely to be energized
next year in Missouri and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And those in Missouri won't be voting for Ashcroft.

`FRONTLINE': HOCKEY SUSPICIONS AND TIME FANTASIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York and Connecticut; see local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beware! Two provocative-sounding programs from those two premier
PBS documentary series, ``Frontline'' and ``Nova,'' fall flat
Tuesday night. ``Nova,'' says a press release, reveals
``fascinating secrets of time travel,'' but there are no
revelations except that an hourlong program can stall in a wormhole
of theorizing. As for the ``Frontline'' offering, about the
supposed corruption of Russian star players in the National Hockey
League, it doesn't score at all.
</P>
<P>
   To begin on the ice, ``Mafia Power Play'' is an exercise in
suspicion by association. We are told, for example, that one
Vyacheslav Ivankov, a convicted extortionist, is in business with
Slava Fetisov, who helped win the Stanley Cup for the Detroit Red
Wings in 1997 and now coaches for the New Jersey Devils. But has
Fetisov done anything illegal? Inferences are rampant, but evidence
is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the relationship between Anzor Kikalishvili,
billed as a boss of an organized crime organization, and Pavel
Bure, a star of the Florida Panthers? Has Bure been a victim of
extortion of some sort? He says, ``Nyet,'' and no facts are offered
to back up contrary allegations.
</P>
<P>
   And is it a crime for Valery Kamensky of the New York Rangers to
consort with a dubious character named Vyacheslav Sliva? Who knows?
Not the program's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia,'' the narrator says, ``where there's money, there's
mafia.'' That's easy to believe, and perhaps the producers were
counting on the bad reputation of Russian operators to get away
with an hour filled with speculation. The program can't even decide
whether the players are victims of the Russian mafia or
accomplices. Somebody seems to have lost sight of the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will traveling back through time ever be more than just
fantasy?'' asks the ``Nova'' narrator, introducing what began as a
lighthearted though not unserious conversation between Carl Sagan
and his friend Kip Thorne, an expert on black holes. They
confronted a theoretical paradox: in Thorne's words, ``the danger
that I may go into the time machine, go back in time, kill my
grandfather before my mother is conceived so that she can't
conceive me.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to figure out whether time travel can ever be
something more than a popular staple of science fiction, Thorne
invented the notion of a ``wormhole,'' a sort of tunnel in space
through which humans might travel back in time. ``If I now go into
this wormhole mouth today,'' Thorne fantasizes, ``I will come out
of that mouth yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an engaging notion, but his ruminations can be hard to
grasp as the program drifts around in an atmosphere of quantum
foam, negative energy, photons and other concepts troublesome for
the nonphysicist. Finally, Thorne, who was distressed by the
publicity given to his imaginings by overeager reporters, resolved,
``I will talk about anything else but not time travel.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of what begins as an enterprising journey, you may
understand why.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous jet stream will push numerous weak fronts across the
northern part of the country over the next several days. These
fast-moving systems will bring doses of clouds and showers,
followed by brief periods of cooler weather. Sunny skies and cool
air will cover the Middle Atlantic States Tuesday, with afternoon
highs near seasonal levels. In New England, the day will begin
sunny, however, high clouds will spread over the area by the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, the central Plains will have readings near
summertime values as temperatures rise into the 80s ahead of a weak
cool front. On the heels of this front, much of the northern
Rockies and northern Missouri Valley will turn noticeably cooler as
another surge of chilly air pushes southeastward.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeastern states, a stationary front will provide a
focus for showers and thunderstorms to develop from southern
Alabama to South Carolina. Some of the showers will bring heavy
rain, as they will be slow moving. Showers will also develop along
the western Gulf Coast with clouds from the showers spilling into
the southeastern sections of Texas and southern Louisiana. A few
thunderstorms are also possible in southern Florida, although much
of the peninsula will remain dry.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southwest, abundant sunshine will allow temperatures to
rise to well above normal levels. The coast of California will also
remain warm as offshore flow persists. Meanwhile, isolated showers
and a shield of clouds will reach the coasts of Washington and
northwest Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fog Season
</P>
<P>
   The season for fog has arrived. Early on Monday, patches of
dense fog filled many valleys from Missouri to the interior
Southeast. Fog forms when when air near the ground is cooled enough
for the water vapor in the atmosphere to condense into visible
water droplets. In early autumn, the moist air of the summer season
lingers near the surface of the earth. Meanwhile, the lengthening
hours of darkness allow more of the day's heat to dissipate. The
cooled air at the ground is dense and therefore drains into low
spots in the terrain, making valleys prone to fog while nearby
hilltops often remain in the clear. &QL;

NEW CDS FROM THE GOOD (bECK), THE BAD (A SPICE GIRL) AND PRINCE 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music lovers, prepare to be crushed by a landslide of new CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the biggest names in pop music have released or are
on the eve of releasing new records _ just in time, obviously, for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Mariah Carey, Sting, Rage Against the Machine, LeAnn
Rimes, Stone Temple Pilots, Fiona Apple, David Bowie, Beck and The
Artist Whom We Can Now Call Prince Again.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an A-to-B look at the 15 artists who are vying for ink on
your Christmas wish list, how each artist has done thus far and
what you can expect from his or her new effort: ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Fiona Apple
</P>
<P>
   The disc: I didn't want to type this all out, but my editor made
me. The full title _ most people are referring to it by using only
the first four words _ is When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He
Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to
the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'Fore He Enters the Ring
There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You
Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the
Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know
Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, 'Cuz You'll Know
That You're Right... It's a 90-word title. I hate my editor.
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 9
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Has yet to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Young, beautiful and opinionated, Fiona Apple stirred up
quite a bit of commotion with her read-my-diary debut, Tidal, and
the edgy, somewhat erotic video for her hooky single, Criminal,
which earned her a Grammy for Best Rock Performance. She's talented
but annoying.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Theinded title of her second disc _ a
poem Apple wrote _ should give you a good idea: It's gonna be
pompous. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: The Artist
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 2
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Spotty but respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: One of the most prolific voices in pop music, Prince
(we're allowed to call him that again) has released more than 20
records, some of them pure genius, some of them pure nonsense.
Despite not being able to duplicate the success he had in the '80s
any time this decade, he has remained incredibly productive,
releasing the two-CD Mirror Ball set last year while working on his
newest disc, his first one for a major label since settling legal
wrangles with his former record company, Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Fantastic, his debut for Arista, features The
Artist's New Power Generation band, so expect more of the same
funk-laced pop he's been putting out lately. Guest appearances
abound, from Sheryl Crow, Chuck D, Ani DiFranco, Gwen Stefani and
Maceo Parker. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Beck
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Midnite Vultures
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 16
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Not a smudge on it.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: In 1994, Los Angeles transplant Beck Hansen might have
been regarded as a one-cool-hit wonder. But Loser was Page 1 of a
new chapter in pop music's history book. Tongue always millimeters
away from poking through his cheek, Beck has since taken his
slacker poetry and unique fusion of hip-hop and, well, just about
every other genre of music to countless heights, influencing not
only new bands, but also new musical trends. He very well could be
the Dylan of today.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Midnite Vultures promises to be a far more
dance-oriented disc, but with Beck's trademark lacings of country,
folk, punk and, this time around, swing. Of course it'll be
brilliant. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: David Bowie
</P>
<P>
   The disc: `hours ...'
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Out now
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: During the past several decades, Bowie has reinvented
himself not only to change with the times but sometimes to change
the times. If his past few efforts are any example, his days of
furthering pop music's evolution are behind him, but his love for
pushing pop music's envelope _ sometimes way over the edge _ still
result in, at the very least, intriguing records. Which is more
than you can say for the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: A better title for this would have been After
Hours, this is such a low-key affair. Very little of this is rock
'n' rollish. It's more meditative, like Bowie himself is now. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Bush
</P>
<P>
   The disc: The Science of Things
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Oct. 26
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Unfortunately, pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: The first two CDs from this UK Nirvana clone sold
millions, catapulting them to the forefront of Generation MTV _ the
lost generation?
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: At some point, all rock bands dabble in
electronics, except for, like, AC/DC. It's Bush's turn. Science is
the first Bush disc to feature drum loops, samples and other
digital nuances. But this is no surprise: Singer Gavin Rossdale's
girlfriend, No Doubt babe Gwen Stefani, sings backup on a track,
Space Travel. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Mariah Carey
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Rainbow
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 2
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: R&AMP;B singer Mariah Carey sells more records in a year
than most bands do in their entire careers. Unfair, yes. A
surprise, no. For years now, Carey has been making unemotional,
disposable pop songs, the kind of music that has plagued pop radio
for years but is still powerful enough to make people wanna buy it.
A true phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Harmless, inoffensive pop songs united by drum
machines; mechanical, angelic choruses; and thumping R&AMP;B beats. See
ya in line to get one.

<P>
   Who: Counting Crows
</P>
<P>
   The disc: This Desert Life
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 2
</P>
<P>
   Track record: So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Five words have been a plague and payoff for San
Francisco's Counting Crows: ``Gonna be a big star,'' which singer
Adam Duritz mumbles at the end of the band's first hit, 1993's Mr.
Jones. Dreams may come true, but so do nightmares: As they were
selling millions of records, pop music critics were shooting down
the Crows, not for their rustic rock but for Duritz's often
over-the-top comments. Duritz has since mellowed, probably because
he realizes success can leave him as easily as it found him.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Judging from the tag-team production of David
Lowery (front guy of pleasantly loud Cracker) and Dennis Herring
(producer of Lowery's old band, oddball rockers Camper Van
Beethoven), expect the Crows' third studio album to be both
predictable and experimental. It probably won't be their best
record, but it may be their most diverse. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Eurythmics
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Peace
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Oct. 19
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: A walking VH1 ``Where Are They Now?'' special, the
Eurythmics _ singer Annie Lennox and partner/guitarist Dave Stewart
_ vanished as soon as they appeared, torn apart by the success
brought on by a string of '80s singles like Sweet Dreams and Here
Comes the Rain (Again). Peace is their first album in nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Your guess is as good as ours. The band's
publicists clam up and hang up when the subject is brought up. Our
guess: It's kind of like when movie companies won't screen their
flicks for critics _ it's a good sign that it's junk. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Foo Fighters
</P>
<P>
   The disc: There Is Nothing Left to Lose
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 2
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Led by ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, the Foo Fighters
have released two terrific discs of punk-pop gems. Turmoil inside
and outside the band (several players have come and gone; Grohl had
a nasty split with Veruca Salt gal Louise Post) has given Grohl
plenty of Nirvana-type angst to elegantly write and ferociously
scream about.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Like Kurt Cobain, Grohl is torn between two
loves: pop and punk. So don't let Learn to Fly, a midtempo rocker
and the album's first single, fool you. For every Fly, there will
be a noisier tune. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Melanie C.
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Northern Star
</P>
<P>
   Street date: November
</P>
<P>
   Track record: She's a Spice Girl. 'Nuf said.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Mel C. is the latest Solo Spice, although she says she
has not left the band, as did Geri Halliwell _ and, wow, her solo
career sure did take off!
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Tweaked by several producers, including Beastie
Boys cohort Rick Rubin, Northern Star has an innocuous techno-pop
flair. It's Garbage, in both senses of the word. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Rage Against the Machine
</P>
<P>
   The disc: The Battle of Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Nov. 2
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Honorable.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: How appropriate that Rage Against the Machine picked
Nov. 2 as the release date for its latest opus _ it's Election Day.
For the past several years, the California-based act has smartly
blended social/political lyrics with an insanely loud and addicting
hybrid of rock and rap, becoming one of this decade's most
important and influential bands.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Judging from Los Angeles' first single, the
savage Guerrilla Radio, not much has changed in Rage's camp. And we
wouldn't want it to. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: LeAnn Rimes
</P>
<P>
   The disc: LeAnn Rimes
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Oct. 26
</P>
<P>
   Track record: She's Blue, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Local country sensation LeAnn Rimes blew everyone away
with her 1996 debut effort, Blue, which was cut before she was even
old enough to get a driver's permit. As success rushed in, though,
so did image and sound makeovers. Last year, she was wearing
leather pants and singing Prince's Purple Rain. It scared us.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: LeAnn Rimes is a back-to-basics collection of
country covers. The disc features Rimes singing Your Cheatin'
Heart, Me and Bobbie McGee and Crazy, as well as at least one new
track, Big Deal, which she may or may not be anymore. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Sting
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Brand New Day
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Out now
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Hit and miss.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Ever since he cut away from the Police in the mid-'80s,
Sting has released consistently fair solo outings; they're tuneful
but sometimes way too pompous. The multi-instrumentalist should be
commended, though, for slipping hints of jazz and world beat into
his music.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Sting's latest disc is, by far, his most
unpretentious. He still toys with different styles _ from classical
to country _ but he does so naturally, not forcefully. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: Stone Temple Pilots
</P>
<P>
   The disc: No. 4
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Oct. 26
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: STP's problems started way before singer Scott Weiland's
drug problems. In the mid-'90s, the band was ridiculed by critics
for sounding like Pearl Jam, and even when they won a best-new-San
Diego-band award, music fans in San Diego blushed, ashamed that a
band so hated lived right down the street. Weiland's drug problems
have only made matters worse. He'll be in jail until next year,
keeping the band off the road until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: A combination of aggressive and gentle, an
unintentional image of Weiland's chaotic life. ___
</P>
<P>
   Who: 311
</P>
<P>
   The disc: Soundsystem
</P>
<P>
   Street date: Oct. 12
</P>
<P>
   Track record: Strong but underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Primer: Before Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit stole their sound and
ran up the charts with it, 311 was merging rock and rap for a small
but devout following. Even though they had a mild hit in '96 with
Down, they're still overlooked as one of rap/rock's inventors. It's
catch-up time.
</P>
<P>
   What to expect: Hip-hop mixed with ruthlessly loud guitars. But
unlike Limp Bizkit's shallow deafenings, 311's music explores other
genres, such as reggae and R&AMP;B. Too bad it won't sell as well.

HOW FILM EDITING RESCUES A UNHAPPY MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ You'd think with a film called ``Happy, Texas,'' the
hometown connections would be somewhat obvious. But despite the
fact that the story is set in a small Texas town (the real Happy is
in the Panhandle north of Lubbock), it was shot almost entirely in
Piru, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But according to director Mark Illsley and co-screenwriter Ed
Stone, one Fort Worth native had ``an extremely important impact on
the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Buckley _ brother of Betty Lynn, son of Betty Bob and
Illsley's college roommate _ stepped in to re-edit the movie when
``Happy, Texas'' was not so happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already cut the film together with another editor and
the film was in terrible trouble, it was not working at all,''
Illsley says. ``So I fired that editor and hired Norman, and I can
with all honesty say that the only reason we're here today is
because Norman Buckley cut my film. So here we are, in Norman
Buckley country.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the lobby of Dallas' Adolphus Hotel is close enough to
discuss the long, strange journey of this little film about a pair
of escaped cons (Jeremy Northam and Steve Zahn) who pose as gay
pageant planners in a remote Texas town in order to elude police.
``Happy'' opened last week in Dallas and opens Friday in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know this movie was gonna get made,'' Illsley says.
``We were just a couple of unemployed guys sittin' at a kitchen
table writin' a screenplay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then after we shot it, we never knew if anybody was gonna see
it,'' Stone says.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax Pictures' Harvey Weinstein saw it, and his studio
eagerly snatched up the film at Sundance this year. Weinstein
gushed about the movie at ShoWest in March, even offering the
gathered theater owners an unusual advance screening of the film.
</P>
<P>
   But when the picture dropped from the pop radar, Illsley
badgered the studio for edits and reshoots. The difference was
dramatic, with Northam's budding relationship with local bank owner
Ally Walker given the most tweaking. But one element remained
entirely untouched.
</P>
<P>
   (Be warned that reading further may give away important plot
points!)
</P>
<P>
   William H. Macy's turn as the town sheriff, Chappy Dent, remains
the film's strongest character, and Illsley and Stone make no
secret that he's their favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best human being in the movie,'' Stone says. ``And
straight or gay, if Chappy Dent isn't a role model for every person
living, then there aren't any role models at all.''
</P>
<P>
   You can probably guess that Macy's tough-talking, redneck
sheriff has a secret. And when Northam and Zahn show up, he starts
questioning his own feelings, particularly his new-found affection
for Northam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have a political agenda,'' Illsley says. ``I
mean Ed and I are both straight, but we were making a movie about
people wanting to be in love, and you know, I think anybody should
be able to relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy wasn't exactly their first choice for the role, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part was originally written for a 300-pound man,'' Illsley
says. ``His agents called us and there was a moment where we
thought, `Bill Macy's not right for this part, he's so skinny, what
are they thinking?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we were like, `What are WE thinking? It's Bill Macy!'
''
</P>
<P>
   Illsley says that any doubts they may have had disappeared after
meeting with Macy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him, `We're just so flattered that you could read a
script that was describing the character as this big 300-pound man
and that you could see yourself in the part.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And Bill would look at us and say, `Oh no, I'm gonna play it
as a 300-pound man. Now I'm gonna be in my body, but when I walk
into a room, I'm gonna walk into the room like a 300-pound Texas
sheriff.' And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's an American treasure,'' Stone says.
</P>
<P>
   Their giddiness about the film is infectious, and after raving
about almost every cast member, it's clear that Zahn is another
favorite. They already have another script in the works with a
noncomedic role designed, they say, to show off Zahn's acting
chops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a very talented man,'' Illsley says. ``He's got a
little bit of a baby face, though. He's 31, 32?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 67 years old,'' Stone deadpans. ``He's amazing. He worked
with John Huston.''
</P>
<P>
   The two share a belly laugh that turns the heads of several
folks walking through the lobby. No wonder their movie is so
``Happy.''

 &HT;    AFL-CIO PRESIDENT VOWS TO TURN GOP OUT OF HOUSE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With an endorsement of Vice President Al Gore
virtually assured, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney convened his
labor federation's annual convention Monday with a vow to sweep the
Republican majority from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney's battle cry _ ``clean out the House,'' he declared
in his convention keynote address to 700 delegates _ and the
lingering reluctance of key unions to endorse Gore raised the issue
of whether organized labor's top political priority in 2000 is
winning the White House or restoring a Democratic majority in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho, pausing in an endless series
of convention center hallway conferences with labor leaders,
rejected the suggestion that labor could abandon a faltering Gore
in the general election in order to concentrate on targeted House
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand that if we win the White House, we also win
the House of Representatives,'' Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chip Roth, communications director for the Brotherhood of
Teamsters, the key AFL-CIO member still holding out against
endorsing Gore this week, said a Democratic majority isn't
necessarily in the interest of union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about passing legislation that helps working families,''
Roth said. ``And in this era, where you have razor-thin majorities
in the House, you have to have a more bipartisan approach.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Teamsters abstain when the presidential endorsement comes
up for a vote Wednesday, ``it is still a meaningful endorsement,''
Roth added. ``It would be more meaningful, though, in a united
house of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as president of the 68-union federation in
1995, the year after Newt Gingrich led the GOP to a takeover of the
House, Sweeney has made it a priority to restore a pro-labor
majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear Monday that he is committed to building on
recent electoral gains, lashing out at the Republican congressional
majority in unusually harsh terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pounding in the heart of every trade unionist in this
country as our perverted United States Congress continues to boost
those who are up and kick those who are down,'' he said. ``It is
time, way past time, to clean out the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the House is controlled by ``an ugly, anti-poor,
anti-working family majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenthal, the political director of the AFL-CIO, said the
federation's endorsement of Gore will unleash hundreds of campaign
workers for the vice president in the early primary states of Iowa,
New Hampshire, New York, California, Ohio and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to produce a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said the presidential primary effort on behalf of Gore
will piggyback on organizing already under way in some states to
help pro-labor congresssional candidates in next year's general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority is to have a president and a working majority in
the House that stands with workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he is not concerned that Gore could become a drag
on labor's congresssional campaign. Gore continues to trail Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the overwhelming favorite in the Republican
presidential contest, by wide margins in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the early polls mean a heck of a lot,''
Rosenthal said. ``Voters and union members don't know Al Gore and
they don't know George Bush.'' One of the reasons for an early
endorsement of Gore, he added, is ``to begin the education process
to insure that George Bush isn't elected next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, organized labor poured $35 million into a
campaign against GOP members of Congress, about $15 million of it
into expensive TV ads. But the campaign fell far short of its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, labor shifted tactics and went back to the
basics of politics. It spent less than $5 million on TV, but put
$23 million into a ``ground war'' of old-fashioned grass-roots
organizing, door-to-door canvassing, telephone banks and
get-out-the-vote campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an historic off-year gain of House seats by the
incumbent president's party. And it came on the heels of the
impeachment of that president, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO plans to spend about $40 million in next year's
election, most of it, again, at the grass roots. It is assessing
its 13 million members $3 each to pay for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only opponent for
the Democratic nomination, had aggressively lobbied AFL-CIO members
to delay an endorsement until after the primary voting begins next
January.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney, during the three days leading up to the labor
federation's convention, pressured some of reluctant unions for an
endorsement of Gore when the convention ends Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to Bradley, Sweeney noted in his keynote address that
``it is fortunate that we have two candidates from one of the
parties who are right on our issues more than they are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the AFL-CIO had invited the Republican
presidential candidates to meet with the federation's political
committee, but none had accepted. ``Not one of them had five
minutes for working families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Teamster President James Hoffa has cautioned labor
leaders against automatically supporting Democrats, Roth
acknowledged that none of the major GOP candidates had made any
overtures to Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   When the AFL-CIO votes to endorse a presidential candidate, the
Teamsters are likely to abstain.

   ``It's not an anti-Gore thing,'' Roth said. ``It's just too
early in the process. We know a lot about Vice President Gore, but
we don't know enough about candidate Gore and where he stands on
issues.''

 AOL VERSION 5.0 OFFERS MANY NEW FEATURES
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, America Online released a major upgrade to the
program used to connect to the Virginia-based company's computers _
as well as to other users and to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, AOL Version 5.0 was released. AOL users can download
by clicking on the Version 5.0 icon that occasionally pops up on
the welcome screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of new features that subscriberfind
useful. Overall, the new welcome screen is a bit more
commercialized than the Version 4.0 one. It's bigger, and that
provides more space for teasers to AOL partners and sponsors. One
of those is Kodak's ``You've Got Pictures,'' which allows
shutterbugs to drop off their pictures at a local processing
company and have them delivered to their Internet account, where
they can then be forwarded to friends as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to a broader customer base is the ability to have
screen names longer than 10 letters, and to have seven names under
one account as opposed to five. Keep in mind that only one screen
name can be online at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature: Users can enter personal data into an
online calendar to remind them of appointments or recurring events.
If they like, they can indicate their interest in new CD or movie
releases and AOL can add ones selected to the calendar as well.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome screen that pops up initially each time AOL is
called is bigger and contains all the AOL channels _ the term AOL
gives to its various sections ranging from weather to health.
There's a section of the screen called ``My Places'' where users
can put up to five of their most-visited spots on AOL (portfolios,
hobbies, etc.) and then go to that spot with one click of the
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, AOL's chief executive officer, said he believes
users will like the ``all-new, much-improved AOL Search,'' now
offering a comprehensive list of results ranked by relevancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new AOL Search enables you to easily and efficiently
search the entire Internet and all of AOL's exclusive content in
one fell swoop,'' Case said. ``Drawing from more than 675,000
hand-selected listings, AOL Search will deliver a comprehensive,
ranked list of results, including both categories and specific
sites. This is the only search product on the Internet that
includes all of AOL's content and content from the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Wish you had that e-mail back that you sent to the electronic
waste basket? AOL will now store deleted mail for up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the ability of other browsers, AOL now lets users
create personalized signatures that are automatically added to
e-mail messages. The signatures can include contact information, a
personal quote or other information.
</P>
<P>
   Users can now sign on AOL automatically and download e-mail and
newsgroups under multiple screen names without disconnecting and
reconnecting. The new version also makes it easy to save ``favorite
places'' and ``address book'' information for transfer to another
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And if you've ever wondered where the file that you downloaded
wound up, the download manager now has a ``locate'' button.
</P>
<P>
   AOL wants to be everywhere _ not just on computer monitors. Case
said the company is also introducing AOL e-Mail on Palm Pilots. The
software lets users read and respond to e-mail using the popular
organizers from 3Com. Later, AOL-Plus will be available for
high-speed network connections. When it detects high--speed access,
it will automatically load enhanced AOL features, including video,
audio and games.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger welcome screen and the additional features make the
program worth the time it takes to download and the small effort
needed to install it.

BULLET-DODGING TOUGH GUYS SHOOT FIRST, SPEAK LATER ON `STRIP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all its empty-headed glory, the spectacularly
testosterone-filled The Strip has the distinction of being the TV
version of the action-saturated blockbusters we've witnessed in
theaters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the degraded subculture of Las Vegas, a world of crime
and sex nestled within a world of glitzy capitalist, shopping-mall
kitsch, The Strip (8 p.m. CDT Tuesdays, UPN) follows the adventures
of a pair of former Las Vegas cops-turned-undercover security team
for a wealthy casino owner.
</P>
<P>
   Created and produced by Joel Silver, who brought us the Lethal
Weapon and Die Hard franchises, the UPN drama is, as expected,
heavy on car chases, shootouts and fistfights while on a shootout
during a car chase. (In the opening episode, these at least look
nicely choreographed.) I also like the move by one of our heroes,
actually ducking out of the way of a bullet. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   The, uh, story line: Elvis (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Jesse (Guy
Torry) risk their lives only to be made scapegoats for a failed FBI
sting. They storm off, quitting the force and eventually aligning
themselves with casino tycoon Cameron Greene (Joe Viterelli), who
gives them an assignment to retrieve a kidnapping victim. An offer
of full-time employment arrives at episode's end.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we learn about these two guys, although you've
already seen them if you've watched any of Silver's films, or
anything with Chris Tucker attached. From the leads to the
supporting characters, there's nothing new here.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis is the typical shoot-first, speak-second hero, so burned
out and bummed out that he rarely cares about the consequences of
his actions. ``I need a Slurpee,'' he announces seconds after
beating a guy to a pulp. He dresses like he's homeless and throws
half-eaten sandwiches into the back seat of his car.
</P>
<P>
   This unnerves Jesse, who wears suits, has a gorgeous real-estate
agent wife (Stacey Dash), and actually moved to Las Vegas for the
opportunity to better his family. I wouldn't be surprised if we
learn that he's a _ no way _ Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Torry, bless his comedic heart, is a stand-up comedian whose
stylistic aggressions of black urban macho are just what the script
ordered. He skulks, swaggers and spews out lines in a rapid-fire
bluster, except when he's not stretching his mouth into a big,
horsy grin, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse to crook: ``I ought to slap you silly for even saying
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry that I can't recall what was said to him, which shows how
much it matters. Dialogue is kept at a minimum here. Better to see
that bullet coming at your head.

 &HT;    Keys for the Mets to win NLCS
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ 1. Mike Piazza's thumb.
</P>
<P>
   New York expects its All-Star catcher back after a throbbing
thumb knocked him out of the last two Division Series games. But
how effective will he be?
</P>
<P>
   _ 2. Kenny Rogers' pysche.
</P>
<P>
   A huge lift after being obtained at midseason from Oakland,
Rogers continues to struggle in the postseason, a habit he had as a
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3. Run, Rickey, run.
</P>
<P>
   Ripped for indifferent play in the last two series with the
Braves, left fielder Rickey Henderson was hardly a 40-year-old
has-been in the LDS (.400, six stolen bases). The Mets need more of
the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4. Turner Field stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Braves moved into The Ted, they have beaten the Mets
14 times in 18 tries in their new home. New York needs to break
out.
</P>
<P>
   _ 5. 100 Club.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Mets had three players reach 100 RBIs in
the same season _ Piazza, Edgardo Alfonzo and Robin Ventura.
Against Arizona, they drove in seven of the club's 22 runs, but
Alfonzo got all but one of them. The middle of the order needs more
consistency against the Braves.

THE WORLD HAS BECOME OBSESSED WITH BROWS
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanied by EYEBROWS-IN-STYLE-TEX) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a woman who has watched the new ABC show ``Once and
Again,'' you have probably, at some point, attempted to analyze
just what it is about Sela Ward that makes her so inhumanly
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   We here at Spa Telegram believe we have the answer: It's the
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh, you beauty neophytes. The brows have it these days,
and Ward's are truly sublime: narrow and richly hued, arched in
just the right place. Listen as they whisper, ``I am woman. See me
furrow.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe our fixation on Ward's supercilia was prompted less by
their perfection and more by all the fuss over brows these days. At
salons and beauty counters nationwide, the eyebrow biz is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Lancome has a new brow kit on the market; makeup giant Shiseido
sells more than a million of its men's eyebrow-grooming kits in
Japan each year; and top salons are adding high-priced eyebrow
specialists to their roster of higher-priced hairstylists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyebrow is, I think, the biggest thing we can change in
the face,'' says Aki Shiratori, owner of Images by Aki salon in
Dallas. ``It's really the framing of the eyes, so I think it's very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   A messy brow drives Shiratori nuts, so he frequently offers to
pluck the eyebrows of his regular haircut clients before they even
know they need it. He even does it for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand watching that (bad) eyebrow,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shiratori is tweezing more and more men these days, too, fixing
man-brows that are too bushy or ``washed out.'' In Japan, he notes,
young men especially have jumped on the brow bandwagon, prompted by
the example of Nagano gold medalist Kazuyoshi Funaki. Funaki, who
sported a unibrow during his winnin ski jumps, later emerged
publicly with a professionally plucked brow. His fans followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   So who does Ward's eyebrows? We called her public relations guy
in Los Angeles, and he asked us to send our request _ on company
letterhead, no less. This is because, he says, Ward will never in a
million years believe him that a newspaper actually wants to know
the story behind her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Sela, it's true. ___
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in my life when I bore a striking resemblance
to Brooke Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not a ``striking'' resemblance. And maybe not an
``all-over'' resemblance. Just around the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, just above the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the years that I dwelled in the land of the
Big-Browed. A time when a mere furrow might cause a massive
tangle-up. A time when raising my eyebrows could be considered
aerobic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, during my experimental phase, I once attempted
to bleach my dark brown brows into submission and ended up turning
them orange. I bought an at-home electrolysis kit and used it for
approximately 38 seconds before the smell of burning hair and tears
of pain sent me running for the ice tray.
</P>
<P>
   My mom recently recalled my early eyebrow days this way: ``When
you were in your teens, I did notice that they kind of met in the
middle,'' she admitted. ``There was hardly a division. It was like
the one-eyed Cyclops there.''
</P>
<P>
   (It's OK; I asked her to be blunt.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, she thinks I have ``great eyebrows,'' but this is only
after I spent years slowly pruning the midsection of my endearing
unibrow back into two distinct entities. Today, my tweezers meet my
brow hairs almost every morning, and I don't think much about it
(well, I didn't until I started working on this story).
</P>
<P>
   Mom had her own eyebrow traumas, having tweezed hers into
near-oblivion during the '60s, when pencil-thin was in. Her brows
are back, but she's still conscious of being a tad asymmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me about my eyebrows is that one of
them seems to arch a little higher than the other,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Well, even Sela Ward faces that predicament, I noted, with her
left brow jutting slightly higher than her right. (Of course,
nobody's totally symmetrical, but in Hollywood, this could probably
cost an actress her job).
</P>
<P>
   We both felt better after I found this quote from the
17th-century philosopher Francis Bacon: ``There is no excellent
beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a voice of reason. ___
</P>
<P>
   Have you any idea the lengths to which people will go for the
perfect eyebrow?
</P>
<P>
   For years, of course, women have tweezed and waxed and
electrified themselves to achieve the brow of the moment. In the
'30s, Greta Garbo popularized the high, thin arch. In the '50s,
Audrey Hepburn defined eyebrow style with her thick, heavy brows
(accentuated by those super-short bangs). Eyebrows shrunk again in
the '60s (Twiggy) and grew again in the '80s (Brooke), and now the
trend-setters have settled (for this season at least) on ``the
natural look.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the routes to brow bliss are plentiful. Women and men
have never been bombarded with more ways to craft the ``in'' brow.
There are itsy-bitsy razors made especially to shave that hairy
ridge above the eyes. If too few brow hairs are your misfortune,
you can have some tattooed on. Can't see those little suckers
clearly enough to grab 'em? Try the tweezers with the built-in
magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   On the www.shopinprivate.com site, even a pair of ordinary
Revlon tweezers is hawked as ``the official facial hair removal
tool of the rock group Oasis.'' Now there's an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most convenient/bizarre/hilarious/sad (pick your
adjective) solution is to simply stencil on the eyebrow of your
favorite celebrity. At www.eyebrowz.com, Hollywood lowbrows _ er,
eyebrows _ are available at the click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   For $19.95, you can mimic the bedroom brows of Heather Locklear
or the power brows of Tyra Banks. All it takes is a stencil and
Eyebrowz's own ``creamy powder'' to fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you find yourself on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, you can
drop by the John Barrett Salon for a walk-in appointment with one
of the three brow specialists on staff. Before this revolution (the
walk-in appointment, that is), clients were actually scheduling
their hair appointments around the times they could get in to see
Barrett's tweezing guru, Denise Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   A press release for the walk-in service dares consumers to
``Stop the Insanity! Don't Let the Pursuit of Perfect Brows Rule
Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, such things happen in New York.

   Guidelines for the eyebrow challenged:
.MDUL/.MDNM/ 1..MDUL/.MDNM/ Hold a pencil parallel to your nose so
that it intersects the inner corner of your eye. Your brow should
begin where the pencil hits.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hold the pencil on a diagonal so it touches the outer edge of
your nostril and intersects the outer corner of your eye. Your brow
should end where the pencil hits.
</P>
<P>
   3. Want an arch? It should be highest at the point in the brow
that lies straight above the outer edge of the iris.
</P>
<P>
   4. If your want your eyes to look closer together, leave less
space between the brows. Farther apart, leave more.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Skinny brows make your nose look bigger,'' says Marcia
Kilgore, owner of the ultra-hip Bliss salon in Soho, in the October
Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Don't spend lots of money for an eyebrow pencil,'' says Aki
Shiratori, of the Dallas salon Images by Aki. Shiratori says
regular pencils work just as well (and cost gobs less; plus, break
it in half and you've got two). The light-browed can stick with a
plain old No. 2. If you have darker brows, hie thee to the
art-supply store for duskier leads.

TWO RECALL THE HISTORIC DAYS OF THE LITTLE ROCK NINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, the black teen-age boy could enter Little Rock
Central High School only when escorted by federal troops,
sidestepping the angry mobs and ducking their spit.
</P>
<P>
   The white girl driving her '49 Chevrolet to school could only
stare incredulously at the spectacle surrounding her classmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all so stupid, so asinine,'' she remembers thinking.
``I mean, what was the problem? I had no objection to going to
school with blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   It was autumn of 1957, and although they didn't realize it, the
boy and girl were part of a major flash point in American history
that would foreshadow the end of legal racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court order called for the desegregation of Little
Rock Central High School, but Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus snubbed
the order, commanding the National Guard to block senior student
Earnest Green and eight younger black students from entering the
school.
</P>
<P>
   A standoff over the students dubbed the ``Little Rock Nine''
dragged on for weeks with federal authorities. Eventually,
President Eisenhower outmuscled Faubus by sending in the 101st
Airborne Division, wielding bayonets, to ensure the students'
entry. The whole scene riveted a national TV audience as one of the
early chapters of the tumultuous equal rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, just about everything in Little Rock, as in many
Southern cities, came neatly packaged by race: neighborhoods, lunch
counters, restrooms, buses. Blacks and whites rarely spoke to one
another, even at school, said Betty Finley, a Little Rock native
who now is a retired schoolteacher in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was the white girl who watched the actions of her fellow
white citizens in disbelief. The day Green was finally admitted
into Central, she defied the long-standing social taboos, walked up
to him and handed him a bundle of class notes she had kept from the
previous weeks, so he could catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not patting myself on the back, but my thought was, `If I
were in his shoes, I would appreciate anything I could get,' ''
Finley said, adding that she fondly remembers his courage and his
soft voice.
</P>
<P>
   Green did catch up, and in a big way. Despite the profound
barriers to his education, he went on to earn a diploma and two
college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is a successful investment banker with Lehman Brothers
in Washington, D.C., and an outspoken voice for civil rights. He's
a hero to many and is scheduled to receive the Congressional Medal
of Honor during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   He admires Finley and the other fellow students who secretly
extended a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty was one of the students who tried to reach out,'' Green
said. ``The organized resistance really intimidated any white
students that tried to befriend us. They wanted to keep us
isolated. Their view was that we'd all drop out eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine black students who integrated Central High were
passionate about pursuing the best education possible, Green said.
Admission to the campus, which was at that time deemed one of the
top schools in the nation academically, was a crucial step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was early enough in our lives that we all knew that this
(Central High education) was not going to be enough to sustain us
for the rest of our lives,'' Green said. ``We all wanted to go to
Central primarily for the educational content. We wanted to use
that as a building block to do other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, though. It was like going to war every day. We
had guards for the first three months, and then, after the
Christmas break, the Army removed the guards from inside the
school, and we went on our own to our individual classes. That's
when the harassment really increased significantly. It was an
organized, orchestrated group of students who tried to make certain
it was a very unpleasant existence for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Finley went their separate ways after high school. But
both continue to share their stories with friends and students,
educating scores of people about one of America's most rancorous
civil-rights showdowns and about what integration has meant to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that fascinates the kids the most is what it was
like to live in a segregated community, where the restrooms were
marked `white' and `colored,' where there were black porcelain and
white porcelain water fountains,'' Finley said. ``They just can't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Finley describe the experience as almost surreal. They
covet their yearbooks not only for sentimental reasons but as a
record of the history that they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The pages are packed with strange images: shots of the sprawling
brown-brick campus juxtaposed against those of soldiers flashing
bayonets; pictures of the general who boomed to the students during
an assembly, ``We're here for a job, and it's going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Green made an appearance in Little Rock in 1997 for the 40th
anniversary of the standoff. Feelings were mixed about the event
because many blacks at Central still lag whites academically. But
Green and others took the opportunity to dwell on the progress
that's been made.
</P>

   ``If one young person out there has seen the story of the Little
Rock Nine and can take from it a belief that he or she can open a
door, succeed against the odds, dream the impossible dream, turn
`no' into `yes' or navigate uncharted waters,'' Green told the
crowd, ``then the Little Rock Nine become the Little Rock Ten, the
ten hundred, the ten thousand, the ten million.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley didn't make the commemoration, but during recent Central
reunions, she stayed late, keeping her eyes peeled for Green in the
hope of congratulating him on his success. She kept missing him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, she finally reached him by telephone. It was
the first time in 42 years that the two had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really good to talk to him,'' she said. ``I recognized
his voice right away. I think it's appropriate that he's going to
get the Medal of Freedom with the other Little Rock Nine. They're
more deserving than most anybody. They were kids. They faced an
awful lot of hate and anger. It takes a special courage to do what
they did.''

   THE INFIELD
</P>
<P>
   Catcher: MIKE PIAZZA
</P>
<P>
   With 40 home runs and 124 RBI, Piazza was most productive
catcher in the major leagues this season. The Mets just won the two
most critical games of the year with him sitting on the bench.
Thank you, Todd Pratt.

<P>
   JOHN OLERUD
</P>
<P>
   Olerud is a .300 hitter with men in scoring position and will
have a decided advantage against the Braves' three right-handed
starters. Olerud batted .318 against RHP and just .247 against LHP.

<P>
   Second base: EDGARDO ALFONZO
</P>
<P>
   Over the final three games against Arizona, Alfonzo went 2 for
11 with one RBI, but it really didn't matter. His two-homer
performance in Game 1, which including a game-winning grand slam,
not only turned the series in New York's favor but underscored what
he is capable of any night.

</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's last error came on June 13, after which he set the
major league record by playing 100 errorless games; then, he hit
.286 against the Diamondbacks. He is a deceptively tough out in the
No. 8 slot.

   A .335 hitter with runners in scoring position, Ventura had a

</P>
<P>
   Henderson capped out a great comeback season (.314, 37 SB) with
a record-setting Division Series. He stole six bases and scored
five times in the nine times he reached base. His outfield play

IT MUST BE BLACK MAGIC. AFTER 30 YEARS, SANTANA'S HOTTER THAN EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here in the fall of 1999, Santana's most recent CD,
``Supernatural,'' has sold more than 2 million copies, and its
flagship single, ``Smooth,'' is holding steady as the
third-most-popular single in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Are we SURE this isn't 1971? Or 1972?
</P>
<P>
   Back in those days, after all, Mexico-born Carlos Santana and
his buddies were fusing rock, blues and Latin rhythms into a funky
entity that sounded unlike anything else on rock radio. His blazing
guitar work and the band's roiling percussion and ability to jam
made them a hit at Woodstock and with rock audiences worldwide as
Oye Como Va, Black Magic Woman and Evil Ways became FM staples.
</P>
<P>
   The band had gone from obscurity in their home base of San
Francisco to becoming (besides the Grateful Dead) the city's
hottest local act, to arena-filling superstars in less than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   And now Santana's star has risen again. Released this spring,
``Supernatural'' finds Santana paired with a host of young rock and
hip-hop artists, including multiple Grammy winner Lauryn Hill,
Wyclef Jean, Cee-Lo, former House of Pain leader Everlast, Mexican
rock band Mana, matchbox 20 lead singer Rob Thomas (who sings on
``Smooth),'' Eagle-Eye Cherry and jam-rock-goes-pop king Dave
Matthews _ plus Eric Clapton and production on one song by the Dust
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It's this ultra-smart generation- and genre-merging that has
made young rock fans sit up and take notice; after years of steady
but declining sales, Santana is currently outselling Ricky Martin
and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, though both released CDs around the
same time as Supernatural and have received far more press.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Santana is the only active ``veteran'' rock band in the
Top 20 on the Billboard album chart, outselling young metal/hip-hop
acts Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit and sugary popster Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that more than a few times Alex Valentine, music
director for a local rock station, has received phone calls from
teen-agers asking who this Santana guy is, and is this his first
CD, and do you think he'll put out another one? Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger demographic thinks he's a new artist _ he's this
guy that plays guitar and knows all these cool people,'' says
Valentine with a laugh. ``Smooth has been in power rotation for us
since we signed on a month ago, and we've been playing the cuts
with Everlast and Dave Matthews, too. You take a genius like Carlos
Santana _ whose music sounds fresh in any year _ and combine him
with these young, hip artists, and that equals success.''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of Santana, man and band, with the younger artists
is being seen as a stroke of marketing genius, and it rests on the
bald head of Clive Davis, head of Arista Records. Thirty years ago,
it was Davis who signed Santana to Columbia Records, where they
quickly became stars with such LPs as ``Abraxas'' and
``Caravanserai.'' Davis left Columbia, while Santana stayed and
kept on keeping on and putting out numerous CDs.
</P>
<P>
   There were some singles that did OK: A cover of Buddy Holly's
``Well All Right,'' which peaked at No. 69 in 1978, and a Russ
Ballard song, ``Winning,'' which hit the Top 20 in 1981. But in
general Santana was stagnating commercially and, to an extent,
artistically: Subsequent CDs, such as ``Freedom'' and ``Milagro,''
didn't come close to the Top 50, much less the Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Davis founded Arista 25 years ago, and he re-signed Santana in
1997. Both Davis and Santana agreed that they needed to update the
band's sound and image for the '90s, and Davis came up with the
idea of pairing him with younger artists. Phone calls were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely driven by Clive,'' says Adam Sexton,
Arista's vice president of artist development. ``And when we
started contacting people, we were overwhelmed by the response. We
just tapped into something.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fan and local drive-time personality Jon Dillon says
that Santana had received scant support from Columbia in the past
several years, which is often the fate of aging rock acts past
their commercial peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put out a couple albums there that I didn't even know
about,'' says Dillon, a classic rock station DJ who first saw
Santana in 1971. ``He put out some great stuff, but it was
overlooked. He got pushed under the carpet with Columbia. They just
figure he's peaked, and they just work on the newer acts who they
figure will make them the most money.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, outside forces were also shaping Santana's
re-emergence. Santana was elected to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame
in January 1998, and his guitar work graced Lauryn Hill's 5
million-selling ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' which was
peaking in popularity (sold-out shows, Grammy awards) just about
the time Supernatural was released.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the boom in Latin music in general, thanks to Ricky
Martin's success during the spring with Livin' La Vida Loca.
</P>
<P>
   Also, people were looking back at the first Woodstock festival
in preparation for this summer's version _ and, thanks to an
intense rendition of Soul Sacrifice, Santana was one of the
performers who got the most notoriety out of the 1969 show.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, perfect timing, and Arista positioned Santana
just right to be rediscovered.

UNDATED: xxx be rediscovered. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We were looking at three groups _ people who always buy his
stuff, older fans who don't buy his record anymore, and young
fans,'' Sexton says. ``And one of our advantages is that Santana
tours all the time, record or no record.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to get Santana in front of those youngsters
who had never seen him. And so Santana opened seven East Coast
stadium dates for the Dave Matthews Band in late May, playing to
more than 300,000 fans over seven nights.
</P>
<P>
   The CD began to sell, bolstered by Arista offering two tracks
for downloading to both Amazon.com and America Online. That, plus
numerous TV appearances, increased his visibility. Santana
continued to tour and was now drawing more teens and
twentysomethings than ever; pairing him with Ozomatli and Mana also
helped draw the younger fans. As did a ``Hard Rock Live'' special
that has aired on VH1 several times since it debuted in August.
</P>
<P>
   In Santana, younger rock fans found a man who could lead his
band through torrid performances _ and if they dug just a little
deeper, they'd find a spiritual, gentle soul who embraces all types
of music and all cultures and is a serious devotee of highly
regarded jazz artists such as John Coltrane and Miles Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like the Grateful Dead _ older fans came out of
the woodwork to see him,'' says Leo Saenz, leader of Fort Worth's
popular Latin Express, who performs many types of Latin music but
always features Santana songs in the group's sets. ``He stayed true
_ he didn't change his format or go disco like other bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an icon in the Latin community _ I've seen people from
Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico and Tejanos at his shows. He's
world-renowned. Some of the kids in the neighborhood are talking
about the same thing we knew all along.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Santana phenomenon shows no sign of letting up.
According to Sexton, last week was the most successful ever for
Supernatural _ 160,000 copies sold. The video for Smooth was the
most popular on VH1, and Santana's current tour _ sorry, no Texas
shows _ is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to have a vision to put Carlos and Rob Thomas
and Carlos and Everlast together,'' says Dillon. ``You think, `How
is this going to work? How will this sound?' But it works. This is
the BEST album. I think it's a continuation of his talent _ it's a
commercial comeback, but he's just so good.''

IN MARRIAGE, EXCITEMENT IS WHEREVER YOU FIND IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've decided that my husband needs a new woman. We've been
married a long time and as incredible as it seems, I believe he's
getting a little bored with me.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, I've been telling the same corny jokes for the past 10
years, but those are the only ones that I can remember. I can never
remember for more than a couple of days the really good jokes that
make me laugh from way down in my tummy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was reading one of those women's magazines and it said
that men need a little excitement, something spicy and different,
to keep their interest. The article didn't mention what men need to
do in order to keep their women interested, but I guess that's not
a hot topic. I thought I'd save Honey Bunny the trouble of having
to hunt for an exciting new woman by just finding someone suitable
myself.
</P>
<P>
   I looked everywhere, high and low, up and down, hither and yon.
I could not find a single, halfway decent woman anywhere in our
back yard. I gave up my exhaustive search and turned instead to my
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   I can be different, spicy and exciting, I thought. All I need is
a good wig, some bronze lipstick, a pair of spiked heels and a
little duct tape. It took me two weeks and a home equity loan to
acquire everything I needed to make the transformation. (I needed a
lot of duct tape.)
</P>
<P>
   You should have seen my man's face when he arrived home Friday
evening. I greeted him wearing: a long, shimmering gown, the high
heels, false eyelashes, and a wonderful wig that I purchased from a
home shopping infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped his briefcase and his jaw onto the floor, then he
said, ``Don't tell me you're going to be a bridesmaid again. Who's
getting married this time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is getting married. This isn't a bridesmaid's dress.
OK, I did wear it in a wedding last year, but I took the bows off
and cut a split up the side. Don't I look spicy and exciting?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you look great, but why do you have that cane? Are you
injured?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't walk in these shoes. The heels are too high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well let me help you to a chair. You probably can't see either
with all that hair in your face. Is that a wig?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just pulled on my ponytail real hard and my hair grew 12
inches. Of course it's a wig, silly. Don't you like it?''
</P>
<P>
   He tilted his head and examined me closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you have it on the right way? There's something
odd about the way it fits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh that's because it's a reversible wig. Actually, it's five
looks in one. If I put the tag in the back like this, I look like
Gloria Estefan. If I place the tag on the right, I'm Diana Ross. If
I put it here, it's the Connie Chung look and when I turn it 180
degrees, I'm Dr. Ruth. But wait, there's more, check this out! I
can flip it inside-out and I'm Isaac Hayes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac Hayes is a bald, male, rhythm and blues singer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. I thought maybe you could wear it for me sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed uneasily like he was trying to humor me. It was kind
of like the way he laughs at those old jokes of mine. My shoulders
slumped wearily as I conceded defeat. It seemed that I had failed
to move his excitement meter one iota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you like my new look?'' I queried. ``I wanted to be
exciting and mysterious for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a problem with the old look,'' he said.
``Excitement and mystery are highly overrated. Actually, I'm OK if
you're OK. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, thank goodness,'' I said. ``Now get some scissors and help
me with this duct tape. I think I've lost circulation in my legs.''

BULLET-DODGING TOUGH GUYS SHOOT FIRST, SPEAK LATER ON `STRIP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all its empty-headed glory, the spectacularly
testosterone-filled The Strip has the distinction of being the TV
version of the action-saturated blockbusters we've witnessed in
theaters recently.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the degraded subculture of Las Vegas, a world of crime
and sex nestled within a world of glitzy capitalist, shopping-mall
kitsch, The Strip (8 p.m. CDT Tuesdays, UPN) follows the adventures
of a pair of former Las Vegas cops-turned-undercover security team
for a wealthy casino owner.
</P>
<P>
   Created and produced by Joel Silver, who brought us the Lethal
Weapon and Die Hard franchises, the UPN drama is, as expected,
heavy on car chases, shootouts and fistfights while on a shootout
during a car chase. (In the opening episode, these at least look
nicely choreographed.) I also like the move by one of our heroes,
actually ducking out of the way of a bullet. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   The, uh, story line: Elvis (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Jesse (Guy
Torry) risk their lives only to be made scapegoats for a failed FBI
sting. They storm off, quitting the force and eventually aligning
themselves with casino tycoon Cameron Greene (Joe Viterelli), who
gives them an assignment to retrieve a kidnapping victim. An offer
of full-time employment arrives at episode's end.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we learn about these two guys, although you've
already seen them if you've watched any of Silver's films, or
anything with Chris Tucker attached. From the leads to the
supporting characters, there's nothing new here.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis is the typical shoot-first, speak-second hero, so burned
out and bummed out that he rarely cares about the consequences of
his actions. ``I need a Slurpee,'' he announces seconds after
beating a guy to a pulp. He dresses like he's homeless and throws
half-eaten sandwiches into the back seat of his car.
</P>
<P>
   This unnerves Jesse, who wears suits, has a gorgeous real-estate
agent wife (Stacey Dash), and actually moved to Las Vegas for the
opportunity to better his family. I wouldn't be surprised if we
learn that he's a _ no way _ Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Torry, bless his comedic heart, is a stand-up comedian whose
stylistic aggressions of black urban macho are just what the script
ordered. He skulks, swaggers and spews out lines in a rapid-fire
bluster, except when he's not stretching his mouth into a big,
horsy grin, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse to crook: ``I ought to slap you silly for even saying
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry that I can't recall what was said to him, which shows how
much it matters. Dialogue is kept at a minimum here. Better to see
that bullet coming at your head.

 &HT;    Thrashers pull double-duty as baseball fansBy Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Ferraro spent Monday night in front of the
television, rooting for his beloved Boston Red Sox. Tonight, he and
about a half dozen Thrashers teammates will be at Turner Field,
cheering on the Braves against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's always been my favorite sport,'' said Ferraro, who
has 346 goals in a 16-year NHL career. ``It was when I was growing
up, and it still is. I picked hockey when I was about 16 because
that is the sport I thought I had the best future in. But I never
stopped loving baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans are wrong if they think most NHL players from Canada
grew up playing hockey year-round. The summers might be short, but
they do exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us played baseball, too,'' said Nelson Emerson, who
was born in Hamilton, Ontario. ``I've always been a big fan. I had
this little Expos uniform I loved when I was real young. Then I
switched over to the Blue Jays when Toronto got its team. Now I've
got to root for the Braves. They're my home team now. It's amazing
how good they have been in the 1990s. I think it will be the Braves
against the Yankees in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Emerson, 32, loved baseball, he always knew that
hockey was his sport. That wasn't the case with Ferraro, who played
second base and shortstop in the Little League World Series as an
11-year-old.

GOVERNMENT ENDS CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION OF INDONESIA'S FORMER
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The government of President B.J. Habibie
announced Monday that it was dropping an investigation of possible
corruption by former President Suharto, defying public sentiment
days before an assembly is to choose the next president of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that drew an immediate angry response from many
people here, Attorney General Ismudjoko said that in a yearlong
investigation he had failed to find enough evidence to proceed with
a case against Suharto. Ismudjoko's inquiry centered on what had
seemed the most accessible area of investigation, a complex of
seven charitable foundations. Critics said Suharto had laundered
huge payoffs through those foundations as part of a corrupt regime
that earned him many billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie did not comment Monday, which appears to reflect his
continuing allegiance to his longtime mentor. Habibie succeeded
Suharto when he was forced to resign in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the move also reflected worries among Habibie
and other veterans of Suharto's government that they could be
tarred by a genuine and wide-ranging investigation into corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected this,'' said Tenten Masduki, who heads Indonesian
Corruption Watch, an antigraft group. ``No one in this country is
brave enough to put Suharto on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement also sharpened what will be one of
Habibie's crucial liabilities as an electoral assembly makes its
endorsement next week for the next president _ his closeness to
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Most assembly members were elected in a nationwide vote in June.
Habibie's party came in second to the party of Megawati
Sukarnoputri. But both candidates remain strong contenders for the
presidency, which the 700-member assembly is to decide on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy chairman of Ms. Megawati's party, Kwik Kian Gie,
criticized the announcement and the entire investigation. ``It is
very clear that all of this is just a mockery,'' he said. He
promised that Ms. Megawati would reopen the inquiry if she won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A number of assembly members also voiced criticism, including
the Parliamentary representative of the powerful military bloc,
Hari Subarno. He said a review of Suharto's presidential decrees
would be enough to show ``who gets monopoly rights and who is
involved in corruption, collusion and nepotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the party that Habibie inherited from Suharto, Golkar, saw
a backlash on the day before it is to announce whether it will
continue to back Habibie as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, this is a major factor,'' said Marzuki Darusman,
who heads an anti-Habibie faction in Golkar. ``It could damage
Habibie's candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was greeted with shock by many, particularly
those who were active in opposing Suharto and who are struggling to
help shape a more open society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, it's very disappointing,'' said Smita
Notosusanto, who heads a new group, the Center for Electoral
Reform. ``I feel that we should go to the streets and demonstrate
against Habibie right now. And if the students decide to go to the
streets tomorrow, we will have to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, an investigation and trial of Suharto, 78, on
charges of corruption has been a main demand of student
demonstrations, which have often turned violent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Along with his six children _ and one of his grown grandchildren
_ Suharto is believed to have stolen billions of dollars of the
national wealth through a broad network of deals in which his
family made money from virtually all areas of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the children are under separate investigations for
corruption, and his youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, known as
Tommy, is on trial over a multimillion-dollar land deal. A verdict
is expected as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Suharto's wealth has been difficult to gauge, and
estimates have ranged wildly. But particularly in the last decade
of his 32-year rule, Suharto and his children made little effort to
conceal the reach of their financial interests in hundreds of
companies. Family members became indispensable middle men in
virtually all major enterprises, taking 10 percent to 15 percent
shares in contracts for toll roads, power stations and
petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the World Bank in the last year of Suharto's rule
estimated that at least 20 percent to 30 percent of foreign aid for
national development had been diverted through ``informal''
payments to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected scope of corruption went well beyond the
charitable foundations that were the central focus of the attorney
general's investigation, said Jusuf Wanandi, director of the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a policy institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just look at the foundations, as if that is the only
thing he has done,'' Wanandi said. ``It's abuse of power in all the
things he has done _ in forming monopolies, in manipulating state
contracts, in using state enterprises for his own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who is recuperating at home after a stroke, has denied
all allegations of corruption and insisted that he does not own a
single penny abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said Monday that the investigation of his finances
had been politically motivated. ``We knew all along this case would
be dropped,'' one lawyer, Danny Kailimang, said.
</P>
<P>
   A perception that Habibie is protecting his predecessor from a
corruption investigation could sharpen anger over a separate
corruption scandal that is imperiling Habibie's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   That scandal involves a multimillion-dollar fee paid by Bank
Bali to a senior official of Habibie's party, a fee that his
opponents contend was diverted to his election campaign. On Monday,
the police questioned two senior government ministers in that
investigation. Habibie denies the allegations.

BUSH ANNOUNCES $500,000 IN GRANTS IN EFFORT TO HELP POOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, the front-running
presidential candidate who calls himself a ``compassionate
conservative,'' announced nearly $500,000 in grants Monday to
Christian groups that help the poor stay off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced the first five of some 17 grant finalists after
touring a church-run health clinic where a priest lamented a 300
percent spike in demand for services during three years of welfare
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Some 103 organizations around the state have applied for the
state grants, offering various ideas on how to offer practical
support to the poor as they move from welfare to work. The Texas
Legislature has authorized the Texas Department of Human Services
to spend $7 million over two years in Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families on such projects.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who says government should rally the ``armies of
compassion,'' toured a health clinic at El Buen Samaritano
Episcopal Mission in south Austin, where he announced the finalists
for the welfare ``innovation'' grants.
</P>
<P>
   DHS plans to award this year at least 17 such grants to
religious and community organizations offering creative approaches
to help the poor become self-sufficient. The charitable programs
include car repair, drop-in day care, literacy training, help in
obtaining work uniforms, life skills, English classes, computer
training and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``America will be changed because people of faith and good heart
are willing to help people in need,'' Bush said. ``I believe
rallying the armies of compassion, thanking the soldiers in the
armies of compassion, is the next bold step in welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as welfare rolls have dropped 57 percent in Texas since
peaking in 1994 at roughly 800,000, the demand for the church's
services has soared, said the Rev. Jaime Case. The health clinic's
budget, supplied mostly by the Episcopal Church, grew from $250,000
in 1994 to $1 million today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of growth, though, can't be sustained as you can
imagine,'' Case said. ``Facilities are falling down around us. The
load we're carrying is getting a little burdensome.''
</P>
<P>
   Case said he's uncertain whether ever-growing demand for his
church's prenatal and well-baby clinic for the uninsured are partly
a result of welfare reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so, but what do I know? I'm just a priest,'' he said.
``But I would say they seem to be very coincidental timing-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the problems of the poor have likely
been there all along and the clinic's growth is also the result of
outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The church clinic has not applied for one of the welfare
``innovation'' grants, but Case said it might consider doing so.
</P>
<P>
   DHS Commissioner Eric Bost and Bush said the grant finalists
include Methodist churches in Beaumont and Smiley, Lutheran Social
Services in San Antonio, the Good Shepherd Mission in Huntsville
and the Salvation Army in Smith County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the last two years, we have more
faith-based and public sector relationships, I believe, than any
other state in the country,'' Bost said.
</P>
<P>
   DHS spokesman Mike Jones said no needy citizens are forced to
use the government-backed programs offered at churches and other
religious institutions. The agency also insists that participation
in religious activities cannot be a condition of receiving the
help.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``nothing in the contract restricts them from talking
religion,'' he added. ``You're going to a church so obviously
that's a part of their services.''

 &HT;    DEADLY MEXICAN FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES PROMPT CALLS FOR BETTER
PREVENTION
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Bodies are still being unearthed from mud and
thousands are scrambling for food and water.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexicans are already debating whether nature _ or man _ is
most to blame for a week of disastrous floods and mudslides that at
last count have killed at least 344 and left 200,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Although record rainfall has drenched southeastern Mexico,
critics are also blaming alleged government corruption and
negligence for allowing homes and other structures to be built in
flood plains, on steep hills and other potentially dangerous areas.
</P>
<P>
   Infrastructure, especially drainage systems, critics are also
claiming, is woefully inadequate and poorly maintained in
vulnerable regions where hurricanes and tropical rainstorms are
frequent. And efforts to get relief to stranded flood victims have
been slow and disorganized, according to angry victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start making very big changes in Mexico to avoid
these kinds of disasters, or they will only get worse,'' said
Estrella Vasquez, a member of Mexico's federal Chamber of Deputies
who belongs to the center-left opposition Democratic Revolutionary
Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, president of the Chamber's new Committee on Civil
Protection, said Mexico needs better disaster preparedness laws and
programs or the country will continue to suffer more unnecessary
deaths and costly damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge scandal,'' agreed Homero Aridjis, one of Mexico's
leading environmentalists. ``No one is responsible for rain. But we
are responsible for the inefficiency of civil protection in
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested angrily that the government funnel money to the
flood victims from some of the $80 billion it has earmarked for
taking over bad bank loans from the nation's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials fear that the death toll from floods could claim as
many as 600 lives. Parts of the city of Villahermosa in Tabasco
state are so inundated the city's streets look like canals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst tragedies confirmed so far struck in Puebla
state east of Mexico City, where a mudslide engulfed a poor
neighborhood and buried an estimated 100 people alive on Thursday
in the city of Teziutlan.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, which was not established under proper
building codes, consisted of mostly flimsy houses built in a ravine
below a cemetery. As is frequently the case in Mexico, the homes
were slapped up quickly by poor people, some of whom had migrated
to the town for jobs in clothing-assembly factories.
</P>
<P>
   A zoning plan called for the homes to be removed from the
ravine, but the mudslide struck first.
</P>
<P>
   A second village, Acalana, was also believed to have been buried
in mud, perhaps killing as many as 150 to 200 people. Only 30 were
able to escape, area residents said Monday, in what could be the
single deadliest tragedy of a week of flooding and mudslides across
southeastern Mexico. Acalana is a small farming village 90 miles
northeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo visited Teziutlan on Monday and
announced that the government would help families rebuild homes.
The poorest families whose homes were destroyed will receive 88
days in wages, $2,000 in construction material and land. Families
whose homes were damaged will receive $200 to $600 worth of
material, while higher-income families were eligible for subsidized
credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this (disaster) can be blamed on poverty,'' said
Salvador Rivero Laborde, a Mexico City civil engineer who said
building codes are routinely ignored in many cities where the poor
are desperate to find a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Corrupt authorities, too, are to blame, Vasquez claimed, because
they fail to enforce building codes or take bribes to ``give''
people unoccupied land to squat on.
</P>
<P>
   That's what people said happened in the Pacific resort city of
Acapulco, where three years ago a similar landslide killed dozens
of people. Poor residents of the city said local political leaders
told them they could build shacks at the top of a hillside that
later gave way under the rushing waters of a swollen river.
</P>
<P>
   That landslide occurred while Mexico's Pacific coast was under
siege by Hurricane Pauline, which killed at least 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who cancelled a trip to Europe to supervise rescue
efforts, said that the damage from last week's floods may surpass
Hurricane Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, rain continued to fall in some of Mexico's
rain-drenched Gulf states. Tamaulipas state was put on alert for
flooding adents were already complaining that prices for
basic goods were climbing as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flood victims in Veracruz state complained about price gauging
and a slow response for help when Zedillo ventured there last
Friday. He told a man who was interrupting him to ``shut up,'' or
that he might ``have to pay,'' according to a Mexican reporter who
published an account of the confrontation in Reforma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and the man later both apologized. But the president has
been under sharp criticism for his outburst, as well as for his
administration's lack of investment in public works and protecting
Mexico from disasters such as Hurricane Pauline and 1998's
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedies during this administration have underscored
institutional abandonment,'' said Reforma newspaper columnist
Roberto Zamarripa. ``A drastic change in social policies has lead
to a selective and tardy distribution of resources, which has made
some of these communities unable to protect themselves from the
forces of nature.''

 &HT;    Million Family March plans announced
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First he called on black men. Now Minister Louis
Farrakhan is calling on all Americans to take their families to the
nation's capital next year for a Million Family March.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation of Islam announced Monday that it will hold a Million
Family March in Washington, D.C. next year on Oct. 16 to inspire
Americans' commitment to their families and communities.
</P>
<P>
   The march, which will come five years after the Nation's Million
Man March, is open to all races and religions, said Ray Muhammad, a
Nation spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This call for a Million Family March is because the 20th
century has directly focused on the destruction of the family
unit,'' Muhammad said during a press conference. ``Minister
Farrakhan believes that the 21st century must focus on the
restoration of a God-centered family unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Million Family March is scheduled for the fifth anniversary
of the Million Man March, which boosted Farrakhan's national
profile _ though the Nation's leader is still viewed as a demagogue
by many for his fiery rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Including some black clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Many black pastors in Atlanta, such as Bishop Eddie Long of New
Birth Missionary Baptist Church, refused to support the Million Man
March. The Concerned Black Clergy of Atlanta backed it, saying the
issues it raised were larger than Farrakhan or any particular
religious group.
</P>
<P>
   The group is taking the same approach to the new Million Family
March, said its president the Rev. Timothy McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that's about the business of elevating and helping
black men is a friends of ours,'' McDonald said. ``This is not
about the Nation of Islam. It's about God, our nation and our
future.''

 &HT;    Prepackaged lunches gaining in popularity in area schools
 &HT;    By Diane Lore and Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lauren Myrick slowly peeled back the plastic from her
pizza Lunchables and laid the large cracker on top. Then she
squirted tomato sauce on the wafer and meticulously spread it
around. Next, she sprinkled on shredded cheese, and finally, with a
flourish, topped the masterpiece with a pepperoni.
</P>
<P>
   Does it taste good? ``Uh-huh!'' Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The kindergartner is too busy eating to offer a full critic's
review. After all, it's lunch time at Vaughan Elementary School in
Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it should be called Lunchables time.
</P>
<P>
   More children are bringing pre-packaged lunches to school and
going for grab-and-go snacks after school than ever before. For the
kids, the attraction is fun foods in fun packages. For parents,
it's convenience. But for nutritionists, the trend is a measured
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``These products can have a place in children's diets, but not
every day and not all of them,'' said Kathleen Zelman, a Marietta
(Ga.) nutritionist and spokesperson for the American Dietetic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: many of the new pre-packaged foods for kids are
high in sodium, fat and sugar. And health experts say feeding
children processed convenience foods _ instead of nutritious
hand-prepared lunches and fresh fruits and vegetables _ may
shortcut their dietary needs and even promote childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 dietitians, nutrition researchers and
government and industry leaders will gather in Atlanta next week
for the ADA's annual meeting. And one of the key topics will be
childhood nutrition and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Snacks and lunchtime can be trickiest for ensuring children are
eating healthy diets, because parents often aren't there to
actually see what their children eat.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are notoriously picky when it comes to school lunches, and
parents are increasingly pressed for time to pack healthy lunches
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the ready-to-go lunch. ``The pre-packaged lunch meals is a
$660 million annual industry,'' said Lisa McCue, spokesperson for
the Grocery Manufacturers of America. ``This is yet another one of
those items that speaks to the convenience trend.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no question that Oscar Meyer is the all-star here.
Sales for Lunchables totalled more than $500 million in 1998. Since
the product was introduced 10 years ago, 1.6 billion Lunchables
have been sold, with sales steadily increasing by 15 percent each
year.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Lunchables were simply meat, cheese and crackers
packaged together. Now they include mini-pizzas, tacos and hot
dogs, and they come packaged with candy bars and fruit punch.
</P>
<P>
   Grab-and-go snacks also are growing in the industry, McCue said.
Go-Gurts, or tubes of yogurt kids slurp without a spoon, are the
latest hit. Only now being introduced nationally, Go-Gurts have
already earned $37 million in sales in a year of limited
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Other individually-packaged snack and drink products are
Coolcuts carrots and ranch dip, which feature Bugs Bunny on the
package, and cute little chocolate milk jugs called ``chugs'' by
Mayfield. Parents looking for ways to save time are more than
willing to pay for these convenience items. A Lunchables meal, for
example, costs $2.29 at Publix. Compare that to about $1.50 for the
average school lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything wrong with (Lunchables) as an occasional
thing,'' said Jennifer Myrick, Lauren's mother. ``She eats
something substantial; she likes them and I would rather give my
time and attention to her instead of spending it in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrick said she usually sends a sandwich to school with her
5-year-old, but once a week, Lauren takes a pizza Lunchables.
Myrick usually packs sliced apples with it (though Lauren's front
teeth are missing so lately she's been getting pudding instead.)
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the right approach to take, nutritionists said.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting Lunchables or similar products (there are a few generic
brands) to once a week or less is important. So is packing
additional fruits and vegetables with them or making sure the
breakfast and evening meal balance out nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the pre-packaged lunches are loaded with fat and
sugar. It's a lot of cheese, a juice drink that's not really fruit
juice and then a candy bar,'' said Margo Wootan, a senior scientist
at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ``So they've got
a lot of the wrong things in them and they are missing a lot of the
right things.''
</P>
<P>
   For lunches, Zelman suggested going with the smaller snack-size
Lunchables that don't have punch or candy.``Then you can pack the
fruit and carrot sticks and some real juice with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents find their kids often snub the home-packed lunches as
much as cafeteria lunches. At Vaughan, third-grader Danny Borske
was happily eating his pizza Lunchables while his classmate Eric
Dawkins was ignoring his homemade peanut butter and jelly sandwich
because it was ``smooshed.'' Another friend, Jeremiah Dickson,
wasn't eating his sandwich because it had cheese on it, which he
didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's essential parents and kids plan the lunches
together each week, said Chris Rosenbloom, a nutrition professor at
Georgia State University. ``Start by looking at the school menu
each week and seeing which days they'd like to eat there. Kids
usually are willing to eat the cafeteria offerings sometimes, like
on taco day or pizza day.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools, like Vaughan, are now packing meals similar to
Lunchables. One day last week, nearly half of a third-grade class
chose the cafeteria's pre-packaged lunch. The lunch had cheese and
ham cubes, crackers, fruit, a box of raisins, a choice of side
dishes and a low-fat cookie. Everything but the raisins (many boxes
were tossed) seemed to be a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   Next designate a ``Lunchables'' day, and then talk about what
kinds of lunches they would like to pack at home. ``Give them a
voice in what you pack and they'll be more likely to eat it,'' said
Rosenbloom. She also suggested dressing things up a bit _ use
cookie cutters on sandwiches, find whimsical containers and cut up
fruit rather than sending it whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the kids involved in planning, offer a variety and offer
only the best of the convenience foods,'' Rosenbloom said.

 &HT;    Carbon monoxide the silent killer
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every fall, when people fire up their furnaces and fireplaces,
somebody dies. Health officials say fall is the time to check
equipment to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, but many people
don't. About 1,500 people die and another 10,000 are injured
annually through carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon monoxide is odorless, and as it begins to hinder the
blood's ability to carry oxygen to body tissues, including the
heart and brain, people become confused and sleepy. They often pass
out without realizing the cause, and die if help doesn't reach them
in time.
</P>
<P>
   The danger zones to be aware of, and some precautions to take:
</P>
<P>
   1. CO detectors: They work, and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission recommends a detector on every floor of a residence. At
a minimum, you should have a CO detector on each sleeping floor and
another one near any major gas-burning appliance such as a water
heater or furnace.
</P>
<P>
   CO detectors measure the gas concentration being inhaled as
parts per million, or PPM. At 200 PPM over two or three hours, a
person would feel a mild headache, fatigue and nausea. At 800 PPM
over 45 minutes, a person would feel dizzy. After two hours they
would be unconscious, and within three hours they would be dead.
</P>
<P>
   CO detectors cost $30 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chimney: Blockages caused by cracked masonry, nests or soot
can cause CO buildup. Have a chimney sweep inspect and clean it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Fireplace: A common source of CO _ even smoldering ashes are
enough to produce high concentrations of it. Always leave a window
open a few inches to circulate fresh air. Don't burn treated wood,
painted wood or scrap lumber. Always leave the flue open, even if
the fire is almost out. Gas logs and burners produce a lot of CO
because their less efficient yellow flames are desired for a cozy
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   4. Portable heater: Buy one that has a CO sensor that shuts down
the appliance if the atmosphere becomes toxic. Don't use them
inside enclosed structures, such as tents, if they need to be
vented.
</P>
<P>
   5. Kitchen range and stove: Gas stoves and range tops in houses
are common sources of CO, because they're often unvented. Keep in
mind that the exhaust fan over the range is unvented and therefore
does not help dissipate CO. Never warm a house with a natural gas
or propane oven.
</P>
<P>
   6. Gas clothes dryer: Clogged exhaust lines can cause CO to
build up. Clean the lint trap after every load of laundry; inspect
it regularly, because the burner can become dirty or clogged.
</P>
<P>
   7. Attached garage: The greatest danger in a house is a running
car in an attached garage, especially if the door is closed. Never
warm up your car in the garage, even if the door is open. An
outdoor grill used in the garage also is a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   8. Water heater: Dangerous if the appliance is installed
improperly. Basement flooding may cause damage to the heater. Make
sure it's regularly maintained.
</P>
<P>
   9. Furnace: Most often produces CO because of mechanical failure
as a result of a cracked heat exchanger, flue or burner problems.
Inspect annually.
</P>
<P>
   Airtight, energy-efficient homes: Insulation cuts heat loss, but
it also cuts the amount of fresh air into your home. If you have a
tight home, you must be extra careful with maintenance of your
appliances. Crack windows occasionally.

RUSSIAN PARTY LEADER IS BARRED FROM NEXT ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian ultranationalist leader, Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, suffered a setback Monday when his party was barred
from participating in December's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   With his anti-American diatribes, Zhirinovsky has become well
known for his strident nationalism. He reached the height of his
influence in the early 1990s, when he emerged as the
third-most-popular politician in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, his popularity has waned as critics
charged that his Liberal Democratic Party simply sold its votes to
the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   His latest troubles seem to have occurred because his party had
become too much of an embarrassment for Russian authorities, who
insist that they are engaged in a fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Under Russian law, the Central Election Commission must approve
a party's list of candidates. The entire slate must be disqualified
if any of the top three aspirants is rejected.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened Monday, said Artyom Golev, a
spokesman for the commission. The second- and third-ranking
candidates on Zhirinovsky's slate _ Anatoly Bykov, an aluminum
magnate from the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, and Mikhail
Musatov, the deputy head of the parliamentary defense committee _
were rejected for failing to disclose some of their assets.
Specifically, they failed to report the ownership of some cars and
of a house that Bykov owns in Krasnoyarsk, Golev said.
</P>
<P>
   Banning Zhirinovsky's party from the parliamentary race would be
expected to help two key political groups that are vying for places
in the 450-seat Parliament: the coalition between former Prime
Minister Yevgeni Primakov and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, and the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's action, however, may not be the end of the
matter. Zhirinovsky vowed to take the issue to the Supreme Court,
and suggested he might try to get the party back on the ballot by
registering a new and less ostentatious bloc of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the country needs hungry people in ragged clothes who do
not have the money to buy nice suits,'' Zhirinovsky said, ``we
shall find such people.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Zhirinovsky's current list of candidates was anything
but inconspicuous. In addition to Bykov, who has often been accused
of corruption, the party list included Sergei Mikhailov, the
reported leader of one of Russia's most powerful organized-crime
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates on the list included Dmitry Yakubovsky, who
served a four-year prison term for stealing valuable manuscripts,
and Ashot Yegiazaryan. Yegiazaryan's brother owned the apartment
where Russia's former prosecutor, Yury Skuratov, was filmed
cavorting with two prostitutes _ a tape that was then broadcast on
state television.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian analysts assert that Zhirinovsky understood that
his popularity was declining and sought to raise as much money as
he could by selling spots on his party ticket to corrupt
businessmen. Members of the Parliament have immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``His career is coming to an end, so he is just trying to
extract the maximum financial dividend,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky,
a political analyst. ``Everybody knows he is just selling his
name.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky had boasted that his party would receive 20 percent
of the vote, but some analysts questioned whether it would obtain
the 5 percent needed to qualify for a place in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhirinovsky's list of candidates was something of an
embarrassment for Russian authorities _ particularly at a time when
the Kremlin is trying to demonstrate that it is fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhirinovsky went too far,'' said Sergei Markov, the director
of the Institute of Political Studies. ``The Kremlin and the
political elite drew a distinction between appropriate and
inappropriate political behavior. They defined the rules of the
game.''

 &HT;    Market seems to have more than nine lives
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longest bull market in U.S. history starts its 10th year
today on a high note after the NASDAQ technology index set a new
record.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists see no reason to think the fundamental economic and
market forces that started lifting stocks 3,287 days ago will end
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the very length of the bull market and the related economic
expansion _ also approaching a record _ are constant concerns to
analysts who concede that nothing like this has ever happened
before.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average has risen 350 percent
since Oct. 11, 1990, the bottom of the last bear market on Wall
Street _ defined as a drop of 20 percent or more in major indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NASDAQ's 796 percent rise over the same periods
to Monday's record of 2,915.95 supports the ``new paradigm''
argument _ the concept that advanced technology has fueled the
economic boom that made the bull market possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that has driven the economy is the huge advance in
technology, especially in the last five years, including the
adoption of the Internet to restructure business. The economy can
grow without generating inflation,'' said Fred C. Allvine, director
of Georgia Tech's Stock Market Project.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Allvine's long-term stock market model
currently posts a reading of 19.9 on a 100-point scale, where 50 is
a ``buy'' signal and 20 a ``sell.'' This is the same model that has
accurately produced sell signals six times in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, according to Allvine, is that some ``hiccup'' will
occur that would do to the stock market what sand does to the gears
of a smoothly running machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One negative scenario is that wage rates continue to go up and
the Fed gets nervous,'' said Allvine. ``If wages accelerate, the
Fed will act, and that would cause people to have second thoughts
about the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, most mainstream analysts see little reason
to think inflation will get bad enough to frighten the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed declined on Oct. 5 to raise interest rates a third time
this year, adopting instead a tepid ``bias'' toward further
tightening if warranted.
</P>
<P>
   While investors are still skittish as a result of the recent
correction, the Dow has already recovered almost half the 9.8
percent loss it suffered in the month after its Aug. 25 high.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite, which suffered a bigger loss of 13 percent
in July and August, has since rallied 17 percent thanks to recovery
in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be happening, strategists say, is not a flight of
investors from the market but a rotation within the market _
especially in the face of upbeat earnings forecasts for the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the good news and all of the bad news is wrapped up in a
single word, rotation,'' Prudential Securities technical analyst
Ralph Acampora said Monday. ``Former leaders are suffering some
defections while recent laggards are enjoying renewed investor
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the market is still reacting favorably to its recent
``deep oversold condition and the prospects of a brighter earnings
season.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Acampora added, rotation will also act as a restraint on
the upward momentum of major stock averages, which he said makes
``careful stock selection'' more important than in a rapidly rising
market.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are cautious because they think the high-profile
stock averages everybody uses to measure trends don't give an
accurate picture of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One study shows 63 percent of all New York Stock Exchange
stocks are down 20 percent from their 52-week highs, and 83 percent
of all NASDAQ stocks are down 20 percent,'' said Wachovia
Securities analyst Ricky Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   He said this situation can be read two ways: as a sign the
market is overbought and ready for a rebound, or as a condition
that usually prevails just ahead of a major bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington did not make a prediction.
</P>

NEW CHOICES IN TRAVEL INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)  
(lb) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel insurance is entering another period of change. Beth
Godlin, senior vice president of Access America, said companies
like hers were always looking for new products to sell, and one is
an annual policy, which is expected to be widely available early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   These annual policies do not provide reimbursement for trip
cancellation or interruption _ a big source of claims _ which keeps
premiums low. Trip-cancellation policies can still be bought
separately under the usual terms, which are linked to the length
and cost of a trip _ about $6.50 for each $100 for short trips.
</P>
<P>
   The annual policies, with an overall premium of roughly $150 a
year, provide benefits in the event of loss of life or limb _
insurance jargon for this is ``accidental death or dismemberment''
or ``A.D.D.'' _ a minimal amount for lost or delayed baggage, and
treatment costs for illness or injury, all usually for incidents
100 miles or more from home. These are familiar benefits,
frequently provided by regular life insurance or property
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the annual policy probably most important to the
traveler is medical evacuation. Costs for medical evacuation are
steep, and a benefit of $50,000, typical of an annual policy, would
not always be sufficient. But it can help, since costs of $100,000
for evacuation are common. Experts in the field say 20 percent of
travelers who buy insurance want such medevac coverage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. embassy officials say that although many travelers think
the government will get them home if they are injured, this is not
the case. Despite images of the injured being lifted out by
helicopter, evacuations usually involve the purchase of multiple
seats on a scheduled airline for an attendant, casts or medical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Annual policies are worth a look for people who probably will
take more than two trips a year at their own expense. Adventure
travelers, hikers and people who go to remote places by car also
might find one useful, as might those who have little or no regular
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Annual policies are sold by only a couple of companies now, but
the majority of big names, including Access America, say they plan
to introduce such a policy in the first three months of 2000. While
the existing policies are sold to individual travelers, they are
really intended for professionals who travel a lot _ travel agents,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Access America has been selling its annual policy to
professional groups since 1997 and, Ms. Godlin says, will be
selling a similar one to the public early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Access America, Box 90315, Richmond, VA 23286; (800) 284-8300;
www.accessamerica.com.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Directly
</P>
<P>
   Travelex Insurance Services of Omaha, Neb., sells what it calls
Annual Travel Accident Protection, on Land, at Sea, in the Air. It
is not sold through travel agents, but directly to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The company's basic offering costs $149 a year. The package
program _ there are many conditions on all of these specified on
the leaflet _ covers the traveler for up to $50,000 in
medical-evacuation costs or for transportation home of a body;
$25,000 for loss of life, two limbs, both eyes, or a limb and an
eye during a trip, other than in a plane crash; up to $10,000 in
treatment costs for illness or injury; $1,000 for lost baggage, and
$500 for baggage delay, or $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The baggage benefit is never very big, but even a small benefit
like this might help someone whose luggage was stolen or destroyed
in a situation not involving an airline. A benefit of $300,000 is
paid in the event of death, loss of a limb or loss of eyesight in a
plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   This policy, like all of those involving medical treatment or
evacuation, involves the use of an assistance company with an 800
phone line; that company controls when and to where an evacuation
takes place. The underwriter is TIG Insurance Co. in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While this policy is sold to individuals, it is not available in
New York state. Shannon Lofdahl, a Travelex spokeswoman, said the
company had filed an application with the state, and a spokesman
for the state Insurance Department said that it was under review.
The policies are available at self-service boxes in a number of
airports in other states, where the applicant fills out the
brochure, giving a credit-card number, and then folds, stamps and
mails it.
</P>
<P>
   An Important Limitation
</P>
<P>
   The ins and outs of these policies require careful reading.
Although most trip-cancellation policies have provisions that
permit policyholders to apply for benefits when an existing
condition like heart disease or diabetes acts up, the Travelex
annual policy, like other annual policies, has no such provision.
This means that no treatment benefit is available to people who
fall ill from something that they have recently been treated for.
The evacuation portion, however, remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   California tries to keep people from buying duplicate coverage,
and to meet California law, the Travelex leaflet says, ``Note: In
California, the pre-existing conditions limitation is waived for
medical expense.''
</P>
<P>
   But further down, under ``What Is Not Covered,'' is this: ``In
California, benefits are not payable if during the 60 days prior to
the effective date, a legally qualified physician advised you not
to travel due to a sickness or injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelex, 11717 Burt St., Suite 202, Omaha, NB 68154; (888)
407-5404; www.travelex-insurance.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a Group
</P>
<P>
   Globalcare Insurance in Massachusetts is offering a similar
annual plan, with benefits underwritten by American International
Group in New York. Edmund Cocco, the president of Globalcare,
acknowledges that this policy is really designed for a small office
or group: A premium of $500 for each sale is the minimum, meaning
that four people pay $125 each.
</P>
<P>
   This would buy $250,000 benefit for each person in the event of
loss of life or limb. The policy has no medevac component, so it
looks a lot like the travel policies that employers take out on
their workers. But for small companies with no coverage, it has a
value. The addition of a medevac benefit is being discussed, he
added. Cocco's policy is available through travel agents in all
states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Globalcare Insurance Services, 220 Broadway, Suite 201,
Lynnfield, MA 01940; (800) 821-2488.
</P>
<P>
   All but four states _ Alabama, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
_ and the District of Columbia require that travel agents have a
license to sell insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes New York travel agents complain about the state's law,
but Wayne Cotter, a spokesman for the New York State Insurance
Department, said that the fee for travel agents to sell trip
insurance was $40 for two years. Insurance companies may pay the
fee for agents who agree to sell their policies. Commissions to
travel agents are 30 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The companies listed above, and many others, sell regular travel
insurance with a trip-cancellation benefit. But keep in mind that
this coverage must be bought promptly after the initial deposit on
a trip _ seven to 14 days usually _ to include coverage for an
existing condition.

SHORT ITEMS ON WEB TRAVEL  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By L.R. SHANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPPING SOFTWARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget these days, but a computer does more than
connect to the World Wide Web. You can use it to write an actual
letter inquiring about room rates, print it out and, if you
remember how, put it in an envelope, attach a stamp and drop it
into a mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy software with information on destinations,
descriptions of hotels, parks and resorts, or maps that you can
make for yourself. The software, like a printed article, is fixed
in place when it is published, unlike a Web site, which can be
constantly updated (theoretically, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest mapping programs, DeLorme's Street Atlas
USA, came out on CD-ROM in 1991. The seventh version of the program
was published this fall, and it is almost too rich with
possibilities: There are 8 menus across the top of the screen, 19
icons under the menus and 6 additional icons to the right of the
windows where you type in the start and finish of your trip. A full
installation of the Atlas takes up around 256 megabytes of
hard-disk space, and you still must have the CD in its drive.
</P>
<P>
   I punched in New York City as my starting point and the New
Jersey town I live in as my destination. Detailed maps appeared on
the screen, taking me through the Holland Tunnel and along a
reasonable path, though the Lincoln Tunnel would have been my
choice. I had to scroll through many maps on a 15-inch screen
before I got home.
</P>
<P>
   There the town was, with little blue rectangles marking such
points of interest as Dunkin' Donuts. (Version 7.0 adds almost 3
million ``points of interest,'' most of them more interesting than
that.) I entered my address, and a little ``home'' symbol appeared
in what seemed to be the right place, although without the street
name.
</P>
<P>
   Going into one of the icons at the top of the screen, I typed in
the ZIP code of a friend who lives in San Francisco. In a moment, a
map of that part of the city appeared. I typed in his full address
and the ``home'' snapped onto the map on the correct block.
</P>
<P>
   Street Atlas USA 7.0 is compatible with the global positioning
satellites used for navigation systems in cars, and will work out a
new route if the driver goes off track (and is traveling with a
computer). If you have a Palm or Windows CE handheld computer, you
can transfer maps and routes to them. The program works with
Windows 95, 98 or NT 4.0 and should be widely available for less
than $45. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION PLEASE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.gogoinfo.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can go on the Web for travel information without getting
bogged down in making reservations. Gogoinfo has names, phone
numbers and often links to Web sites of airlines, cruise lines,
lodgings, trains and buses, as well as destinations, attractions
and travel publications.
</P>
<P>
   The Attractions section contained casinos, museums, parks and
ski areas. Other sources included phone numbers for the Federal
Aviation Administration consumer hot line and the Thomas Cook
Currency Service. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OFFICIAL SITES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every state, and virtually every city, has an official Web site
that provides the ABC's for travelers. Since I was in gogoinfo
anyway, I linked to several of them from there. The San Diego
Convention and Visitors Bureau, www.sandiego.org, was typical, with
listings of lodgings, shopping, dining spots and maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin, Texas, Convention and Visitors Bureau,
www.austin360.com/acvb, describes the city as the ``live music
capital of the world'' and, appropriately enough, quotes Willie
Nelson as saying ``it's a great place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   All these sites provide an easy entry to trip planning as long
as you bear in mind that their purpose is promotion, not objective
information. &QL;

BIOSPHERE: DESERT GREENHOUSE RISES FROM `ECO-CULT' TO RESEARCH
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORACLE, Ariz. _ It's been a long, strange trip _ from desert
``eco-cult'' to reputable research center.
</P>
<P>
   But in eight years, the massive glass-and-steel pyramid and
eggshell-like buildings of Biosphere 2 have emerged as a genuine
educational and scientific proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very reputable scientist, and I endorse 100 percent
what's going on out there,'' said Wally Broecker, a geochemist at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Broecker has been a driving force behind Columbia's involvement
in Biosphere 2 ever since he was tapped in 1991 to stem the loss of
oxygen inside the once-hermetically sealed structure.
</P>
<P>
   That was nine months into the first experiment, run by the
controversial and now-defunct Space Biosphere Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Four men and four women, known as Biospherians, were cloistered
in the $200 million facility to determine whether they could live
solely off the structure's man-made ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Among the goals was to determine whether Space Biosphere
Ventures ultimately could colonize the moon or even a distant
planet, ``which I thought rather bizarre,'' Broecker said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``You wouldn't transport something the size of the
biosphere to the moon. You size up the weight and forget it; it's
too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, traditional agriculture used inside Biosphere 2
would never work outside the Earth's atmosphere, Broecker said.
Instead, hydroponically grown crops would have been the best hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Broecker disputes reports that Biosphere managers ``were
cheating'' when they pumped oxygen into the vacuum enclosed
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``To their credit, it was extremely well engineered,'' Broecker
said. ``Despite media reports, they were not cheating. They were
too directed. They sacrificed those eight (people) in there to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Biospherians also were charged with conducting experiments
and coping with a ``Gilligan's Island'' existence, marooned inside
the massive structure in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were being starved for oxygen, and they had a lot of
things to do in there,'' Broecker continued. ``Plus, one group of
four didn't get along with the other group of four. They were
skinny, their faces were pocked, they looked unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations also surfaced in published reports that the
Biospherians faced further duress at the hands of Space Biospheres
Ventures co-founder John Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused Allen of running a cult in which he ruled by
fear and intimidation. Allen vehemently denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But they persist even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a religious cult, but an eco-cult,'' Broecker said.
</P>
<P>
   An unpaid consultant, Broecker tried to convince Space Biosphere
Ventures to rethink its experiments. In 1994, halfway through the
living experiment with a second group of Biospherians, the
project's financial backer, Texas billionaire Edward Bass, pulled
the plug entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bass' financial people decided to give the cult the
heave-ho, and it was a cult . . . they then put the Biosphere in
the hands of a management company,'' Broecker recalled. That firm,
he added, spent 1{ years trying to stabilize it and turn it over to
more stable leadership. &QL; 
TAKES OVER FACILITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Columbia came in.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, which formed a science partnership with Biosphere 2 in
1994, expanded its role by taking over the facility two years
later, turning it into a research and teaching facility.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover added a much-need air of legitimacy to Biosphere 2.
</P>
<P>
   Guanghui Lin, an associate scientist who joined Biosphere 2 in
1996, recalled when he submitted his first research paper to a
peer-reviewed scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came back to me like it wasn't worthy research because it
was from Biosphere 2,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent papers were met with far less resistance, and
were soon published in such journals as ``Oecologia and
Biodiversity and Allelopathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's crowning achievement came earlier this year with
the publication of research on how increases in carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is hurting the ocean's coral reefs. The findings
were published in ``Science,'' one of the top scientific journals
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a very nice study there, which is absolutely
scientifically valid,'' said Steven Wofsy, an atmospheric scientist
at Harvard University. ``They didn't answer all the questions, but
you never do in science.'' &QL; 
CLIMATE ZONES STUDIES &QL;

   Most of the research being conducted at the Biosphere 2 is being
done in one of three biomes, or climate zones: an ocean, a rain
forest and a managed forest.
</P>
<P>
   Wofsy, who studies global change, said Biosphere 2 is unique in
its ability to run studies to answer questions, such as what the
ecosystem might look like in 50 or 100 years with the increasing
buildup of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could say you could legitimately criticize it (the
coral reef study) by saying that's just a big pot of water with a
wave machine,'' he said. ``But that will be true with any
environmental study.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the ecosystems in Biosphere 2 is designed to replicate
the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these systems are perfect analogs to the outside
world,'' John Adams of Biosphere 2 said.
</P>
<P>
   But the artificial nature of the glass-dome structure is what
makes the Biosphere 2 a giant lab that allows researchers to tinker
with various aspects of the environment and measure the results
more precisely than in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's valid,'' Wofsy said, ``and in some respects, it's
an elegant place to do these experiments.'' &QL;

<P>
   Here is Anne Stephenson's ``New &AMP; Notable'' column forthe week
of Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   ``PHYSIOGNOMY: THE MARK SELIGER PHOTOGRAPHS'' &QL; 
(Bulfinch, $75) &QL; 
   You have not lived until you've seen Brad Pitt in an evening
gown and goggles. Better yet, look at Drew Barrymore dancing nearly
naked with a sumo wrestler. Or Aerosmith's Steven Tyler with his
lips spread just as wide as they will go (that is to say shockingly
wide _ Tyler can look like a contortionist just by opening his
mouth). Or Keith Richards playing dominoes. Or Howard Stern wearing
a crown of thorns (think about it). On the cover _ the stunned
look, we assume, is from the makeup session _ is Jerry Seinfeld as
the Tin Man. Just inside is a perplexed-looking Tom Hanks
scratching his brow with ape hands. Trust us _ you will look at
this picture for a long, long time. In fact, if you pull this book
out in public, a crowd will gather _ it's that big a draw. Maybe
it's the celebrity factor. Maybe it's Seliger's unpredictable way
with his subjects, who seem willing to do the oddest things at his
request. As chief photographer for ``Rolling Stone,'' he has put
famous faces in the most surreal and unusual circumstances. The
photos go largely unexplained, and we found that to be irritating.
Also, the subjects remain unidentified until the very back of the
book, which makes for some confusion because it's really hard to
tell who some of them are. But those are quibbles. The book is
pricey but fun. With an introduction by Eric Bogosian. &QL; 
``SHE SAID YES'' &QL; 
By Misty Bernall (Plough, $17) &QL; 
It's at issue whether 17-year-old Cassie Bernall said anything at
all before she was shot to death in April at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo. Did Dylan Klebold ask her whether she believed
in God and did she say yes before he pulled the trigger? Her
parents choose to believe she did despite reports to the contrary,
and her mother has now written this book _ proof that grieving
people need to impart some meaning to the death of a child and that
the attention of strangers is oddly comforting. Beyond religious
fervor and parental sorrow, however, Misty Bernall tells another
important story. Three years ago, Cassie was a difficult
ninth-grader whose conversations with friends touched on drugs,
sex, self-mutilation and violence toward teachers and parents.
Misty discovered this when she read letters Cassie had written to a
friend, whereupon the stunned Bernalls did what Misty calls ``the
hardest thing you can ever do as parents: to put your foot down and
say, `This stops right here.' '' They immediately put Cassie into
another school, regularly searched her room, tapped the phone and
forbade her to see her old friends even though they knew it might
backfire and drive Cassie further away. When Cassie's friends
vandalized their house, they moved to another neighborhood to keep
her away from them. Cassie eventually got better, but it's
impossible to read about this troubled girl at war with her
desperate parents and not think of the boys who later murdered her.
What Cassie Bernall said that day is not as important as what two
other parents wrote to the Bernalls a month later: ``We will never
understand why this tragedy happened,'' Sue and Tom Klebold said,
``or what we might have done to prevent it. We apologize for the
role our son had in your Cassie's death. We never saw anger or
hatred in Dylan until the last moments of his life when we watched
in helpless horror with the rest of the world. . . . May God bring
peace and understanding to all of our wounded hearts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WHAT IF?'' &QL; 
Edited by Robert Cowley (Putnam, $27.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What if, in the summer of 1941, Adolph Hitler had made his major
attack not into Soviet Russia but into Syria and Lebanon _ would he
then have won a strategic position that could have brought him
eventual victory? Or what if, early in his invasion of the Persian
empire, the young King Alexander had been dealt a second blow with
an ax (the first had damaged Alexander's helmet and left him
disoriented and unable to defend himself) by a Persian noble named
Spithridates? What if Alexander's bodyguard had not speared
Spithridates before he could strike again and destroy Alexander's
chance of becoming ``great''? If you feel your blood pounding, the
goose bumps rising, your heart soaring with the thrill of it . . .
then you must be a historian. If you dozed off before the first
question mark, you are a civilian and should refrain from looking
at this book lest you asphyxiate on the futility of it all. This is
an expansion of the the 10th anniversary issue of ``MHQ: The
Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' in which the editor asked
historians to write about the most important ``might-have-beens''
of military history. They had so much fun that many came back for
more. Contributors include John Keegan (who explores the
aforementioned Hitler scenario), David McCullough, Stephen E.
Ambrose and James M. McPherson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LONG PROGRAM'' &QL; 
By Peggy Fleming (Pocket, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Figure-skating champion Peggy Fleming is too nice to write a
book. She didn't get angry at her son when his girlfriend turned up
pregnant. She doesn't blame her mother for being a control freak.
She has been married to the same man for a million years. She went
into a depression during her recent treatment for breast cancer,
but that was caused by a drug _ she stopped taking it, and her
sadness disappeared. We ask you: Where's the dirt? Where's the
trouble? The answer is that there is none. Fleming is as nice as
she appears to be and then some (she calls Nancy Kerrigan ``a very
ungracious loser'' for her behavior after Oksana Baiul beat her in
the 1994 Olympics _ for Fleming, that's like hurling obscenities).
This memoir, which covers her career and personal life, is not
exactly scintillating reading, but Fleming is so likable that we
decline to say more. &QL;

PROMISES, PROMISES FROM THE AIRLINES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: (AT) should be replaced with the symbol) 
(af) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Government reports show that fewer planes are arriving on time,
more middle seats are occupied and more bags are arriving late or
damaged. But not to worry: the 14 domestic passenger airlines that
belong to the Air Transport Association announced on Sept. 15 that
within 90 days their policy will become ``customer first.''
</P>
<P>
   The similar policies adopted by the 14 airlines are aimed at
staving off support for a passenger bill of rights in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The new policies include promising to tell customers the lowest
available fare, do a better job of telling people when and why a
flight is delayed or canceled, respond in writing to complaints
within 60 days and clearly explain the limits on the use of
frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines also said they would make ``reasonable'' efforts
when planes are stranded on taxiways to provide passengers with
food, water and restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who co-sponsored legislation for a
passenger bill of rights, called the new airline policies, which
were offered in lieu of the legislation, ``nothing but legalistic
gobbledygook.'' Wyden recently included two amendments to a
Department of Transportation bill that direct the inspector general
of the department to investigate any ``unfair and deceptive''
airline practices regarding information on the lowest fare and the
status of flight overbooking.
</P>
<P>
   One airline promise is intended to help people shop for the best
fare, but it will cost some passengers. Some airlines say that
customers must pay for a ticket to guarantee a quoted price but
that the reservation can be canceled within 24 hours with a full
refund, even on otherwise nonrefundable tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But customers who carry a balance on their credit cards will
have to pay interest on the amount of the fare until the refund is
processed.
</P>
<P>
   While all 14 airlines pledged to tell callers the lowest
available fare, only Alaska Airlines included its Web site in that
promise.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines also said they would devise consistent policies to
determine who gets bumped when a flight is overbooked. They also
promised to pay attention to passengers who are disabled or have
special needs, such as children traveling alone. Some airlines now
charge fees of up to $30 a flight segment for children traveling
alone, even on nonstop flights.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Berger, editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter,
said that she was not impressed with the promises, many of which
she said are vague and all of which lack the teeth that government
regulations would include.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the marketing department's hand in this, but not the
customer service department's,'' Ms. Berger said. ``There is a lot
of hype and marketing speak about how we care about you. Over all
this is same-old same-old.''
</P>
<P>
   One indication of how seriously each airline regards its
promises of improved customer service may be how the policies are
treated on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Aloha, Continental, Northwest, United and TWA put a link on
their home page to their new policies. To find US Airways' plan,
you have to click on ``Travel Information''; on ATA's home page,
you go to ``About ATA,'' and for Delta's you click on ``The
Gateway.''
</P>
<P>
   American and Hawaiian posted their new promises in places where
few passengers are likely to look: on Web pages with corporate
information for shareholders or journalists. Alaska put it on its
employee Web site, www.alaskasworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   America West, Midwest Express and Southwest had not posted their
new customer policies more than a week after the Air Transport
Association announced them.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation
of America, an independent, nonprofit group in Washington, said
that ``some airlines will try harder than others to deliver
improved customer service and some airlines will slip below the
standard thinking that they won't get caught and, if they do, that
the penalties will be insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can file complaints with the government by e-mail at
airconsumer(AT)st.dot.gov, by calling (202) 366-2220 or by writing
to the Aviation Consumer Protection Division, Department of
Transportation, C-75, Room 4107, Washington, D.C. 20590.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints should include a brief description of the problem,
the airline and flight number and the itinerary, as well as
information on how you can be contacted. Don't expect much for your
trouble, though. The Transportation Department just tallies
complaints _ and only about customer service, not safety _ and does
not arbitrate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Brobeck and Ms. Berger said that a customer-service crisis
of the gravity of the one at the Detroit airport last winter, when
Northwest passengers sat for hours on jets mired in snow just a few
hundred feet from the terminal, would determine the value of the
new promises.

U.N. PEACEKEEPER ACCUSES INDONESIAN ARMY OF SABOTAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ The U.N.-backed peacekeeping force in East
Timor Monday accused the Indonesian army of providing support to an
anti-independence militia that fired on peacekeepers over the
weekend, raising fears that the army has decided to try openly to
sabotage the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian general in charge of the 15-nation peacekeeping
mission, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, described the militia attack as
``alarming'' and ``an act of villainy.'' He expressed suspicions
that Indonesian soldiers and police officers joined the militia
members in firing on the Australian peacekeepers with assault
rifles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let people come into East Timor to shoot up my
soldiers _ we didn't shoot first,'' he said in an interview in
Dili, East Timor's capital, which was left in ruins by the
army-supported militias after a referendum in August in which East
Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Australian military officials said, uniformed
Indonesian soldiers and police officers were escorting the militia
on Sunday and did nothing as the militia members opened fire on the
peacekeeping troops in a village along the northern coast of East
Timor, about 800 yards from the border with the
Indonesian-controlled western half of the island.
</P>
<P>
   While the Australian vehicles were struck by bullets, there were
no casualties among the Australian soldiers. Australian military
spokesmen said it appeared that two of the militia members might
have been wounded in the attack, although that could not be
confirmed since the militia rushed back across the border into West
Timor. Indonesia contended that an Indonesian police officer had
also been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred less than a week after two Australian
soldiers were seriously wounded in a separate gun battle with the
militias. It has alarmed peacekeeping commanders since Indonesia
had agreed to allow the peacekeeping force in East Timor. Open
exchangese between Indonesian troops and peacekeepers would
create both a military and a diplomatic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The ties between the Indonesian military and the militias are
well known. Many of the militias were in fact established by the
Indonesian army over the 24 years since Indonesia invaded the
former Portuguese colony. Western diplomats and U.N. observers have
contended that the army directed the militia's rampage across East
Timor after the August referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was either brazen or foolhardy,'' Cosgrove said of the
actions of the Indonesian soldiers and police officers who
accompanied the militia group on Sunday. ``I hope that this was an
isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had asked for a formal explanation from the
Indonesian army _ ``It was between asking and demanding'' _ of
whether Indonesian soldiers or police officers had fired some of
the shots. ``I put it to them: Who shot at my soldiers?'' he said.
``This was a totally senseless act.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feared a larger confrontation between
Indonesian troops and the peacekeeping soldiers, he replied,
alluding to dealing with the Indonesian military, ``Not if we
manage this properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government initially said that the Australian
soldiers had crossed illegally into West Timor, and that that may
have prompted the firefight.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian military spokesman here said Monday that
Indonesian government maps and satellite navigation equipment
proved that the attack had occurred in East Timor, in a border area
where the Australian soldiers have been clearing away brush. ``It
was well and truly inside East Timor,'' said Col. Mark Kelly, chief
of staff of the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   While the peacekeeping soldiers struggled Monday with a possible
increase in violence by the militias, the international effort to
rebuild the territory after the violence and looting of the
militias has yet to begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups have been providing emergency food and other
services. But East Timor's most important religious leader, the
Roman Catholic Bishop of Dili, said Monday that he had so far
received no contributions of money from abroad to begin the
reconstruction of East Timor's capital. Few buildings were left
intact here, and thousands of people have taken to living on
streets choked with rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, the co-winner of the
1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said the Catholic Church had no money
whatsoever to help its parishioners to re-establish some semblance
of a municipal government _ ``zero dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   While foreign leaders and charitable groups have promised to
help pay for the reconstruction of the territory, ``so far it's
just been blah-blah-blah,'' said Belo. ``We've received nothing.''
The bishop's own seaside home was looted and then burned down by
the militias early last month. He is living in a small guest house
near the charred remains of his residence.

 &HT;    Campaign 2000: Keyes serves as headliner
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An auditorium full of conservative
Republicans had laughed at Steve Forbes' jokes, applauded Gary
Bauer's sentiments, and risen to its feet in passionate support for
the beleaguered Pat Buchanan. Then it was time for Alan Keyes to
fulfill a familiar role: show stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as the only speaker who could follow Buchanan at
Saturday's National Federation of Republican Assemblies straw poll,
the 49-year-old former Reagan administration official and radio
commentator did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Unpacking a tool kit full of rhetorical devices, Keyes first
praised Buchanan as ``a man of courage and integrity,'' then
painted Forbes as a socialist for his support of NAFTA and GATT.
</P>
<P>
   His hands flashing in quick, precise gestures, Keyes called for
the end of the income tax and the federal Education Department in
words that reached back to the abolitionist speeches of the last
century. His voice rising in disdain, he warned against those he
said are selling out their party's principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You focus on victory and you will be manipulated into
defeat,'' he said, drawing a regular cadence of applause from an
audience hostile to their party's frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I'm supposed to talk about voting for me and
stuff,'' he continued, his voice lowering by degrees into a stage
whisper as he asked listeners merely to search their beliefs and
see if they concur with his.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes finished third in the straw poll, ahead of Bauer, but the
results don't seem very relevant to his campaign. He has become
familiar with getting some of the biggest applause lines at
Republican gatherings, while gaining few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes actually won a straw poll last August in Birmingham, after
being only one of two candidates to show up (Orrin Hatch was the
other). He delivered a thunderous anti-Clinton, anti-abortion
message to the Alabama GOP, but he left the convention before the
vote was announced and has made little of the victory since.
</P>
<P>
   This nonchalance about his standing has caused some to question
why Keyes is mounting his second bid for the Republican nomination,
if he isn't running to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the question. I know there are people who
hire their pollsters and consultants and hold their focus groups to
figure out what people want to hear. And then they stand before
audiences with jury-rigged speeches that have tag lines to make
people think that they believe what they do whether they do or not
... and if that's what it means to run in order to win then of
course, I won't do that,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation away from the speaker's rostrum, Keyes doesn't
attain the same ringing decibel level, but retains a mixture of
dapperness and intensity. A practicing Roman Catholic, he wears a
crucifix on a gold chain underneath his tie.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed as ``nonsense'' the charge that he's running just
to raise the money, saying he has passed over more lucrative
ventures to be involved in politics. What he wants to do, he said,
is to present his view about the moral decline of the nation ``with
dignity'' and let audiences respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Americans now being pushed into a condition of slavery.
It'll be of a different kind in its outer manifestations than the
slavery my ancestors suffered but it will be slavery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to nearly all-white audiences, Keyes often evokes the
black experience of slavery, whether denouncing abortion or calling
for the end of the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not free people, we're a people on parole,'' he told the
Kansas City audience.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Army sergeant, Keyes said he has ``vague
memories'' of being marched to the back of a bus when the family
was stationed near Augusta, Ga., but was insulated from the worst
aspects of racism by a protective family and the integrated life of
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, he was struck with the ``emotional truth'' that
he was descended from slaves. He remembers reading Lerone Bennett
Jr.'s ``Before the Mayflower,'' a history of Africans in America,
with tears in his eyes. But from that point he diverged sharply
from those black liberals, such as Jesse Jackson, of whom he would
later be so critical.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes got his undergraduate and doctorate degrees at Harvard,
where he was influenced by the late Allan Bloom, author of ``The
Closing of the American Mind.'' He formed a philosophy, later
expounded in two books, which blends deeply conservative social
views with the belief that slavery has given African Americans a
special moral vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I fight the same battle when I speak on behalf of
the unborn that Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr. were
fighting,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes served in the State Department seven years, including a
stint in India where he met his wife and a posting as ambassador to
the United National Economic and Cultural Council. Later, he was an
interim president at Alabama State University, ran an unsuccessful
race for the U.S. Senate in Maryland and became host of the
syndicated radio program, ``America's Wake-Up Call.''
</P>
<P>
   The first suggestion that he run for president in 1996, Keyes
said, came from Georgians who heard him speak for former Waycross,
Ga., Mayor John Knox in the 1994 governor's race. Knox today
praises him as the best speaker in the Republican Party, and ``the
most intelligent man I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   The most bizarre moment of the 1996 race for Keyes came when he
was detained by police for trying to gain entry at a candidates
debate in Atlanta. Keyes was led out to the street, then picked up
by Mayor Bill Campbell and driven to his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird, but you know what else it was? Proof of how
frightening the truth is for some people,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his first campaign as a kind of ``pickup basketball
game,'' with supporters working as long as they could, then passing
the ball to others. The current campaign has tried to be more
systematic, he said, without losing its grassroots connections.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has no campaign or finance chairs, and no headquarters.
The candidate's home base is the Washington area, his campaign
manager, Dan Godzich, works out of Phoenix, Ariz., and his
scheduler, Carla Michele, directs traffic from her home in a Dallas
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grassroots. We're true grassroots,'' Michele said of the
small organization which supports Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer at Keyes' booth outside the convention in Kansas
City, Barbara Betterman, said his identification of moral decay as
the fundamental problem afflicting the country was what attracted
her to his campaign. And also, the way in which he delivers his
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes me jump to my feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said a steady stream of small contributions will enable
him to continue his current campaign, if not in the high style of
Forbes or Texas Gov. George W. Bush. And while he can't expect to
win many straw polls, he takes satisfaction in the influence he
believes his fiery speeches have had on the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare their speeches last time, and their speeches this
time, and see if there isn't Alan Keyes in almost all of them,'' he
said.

CALIFORNIA LAW WILL REGULATE HOSPITAL STAFFING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the objections of the state's health-care
industry, Gov. Gray Davis has signed a bill backed by the state
nurses union that will make California the first state to require
hospitals to meet fixed nurse-to-patient ratios, in an effort to
force higher-quality care and combat cost-cutting measures in the
place where managed care was born.
</P>
<P>
   Davis signed the new law over the weekend as part of a last
batch of bills from this year's legislative session, which also
produced a package of measures that the Democratic governor signed
last month, expanding patients' access to mental health care and
their rights to sue their health insurers for punitive damages and
seek outside reviews of decisions denying coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Heath care has been a major political issue in California, given
the prominence of health-maintenance organizations and for-profit
hospitals here, and the hospital industry and business groups had
lobbied hard against the nurses staffing bill. Davis' Republican
predecessor, former Gov. Pete Wilson, vetoed a similar measure two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At times this year, Davis himself has complained that the
Legislature was sending him too many bills on health care, and he
has generally taken a cautious approach to this and other issues
since his election last year. Even as he signed the nurses staffing
bill, he vetoed another measure aimed at overhauling the state's
nursing-home system, saying it was too costly.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill on nurse staffing levels _ which covers all
``licensed nurses,'' including both registered and licensed
practical nurses _ does not specify minimum nurse-to-patient
ratios, but instead requires the state Department of Health
Services to set such standards.
</P>
<P>
   In order to secure Davis' support, the measure's sponsor,
Assemblywoman Sheila James Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, agreed to sponsor
a follow-up bill next year, delaying the implementation by at least
a year, until 2002, to allow the state enough time to work out the
desired ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse staffing levels have been a hot-button issue among
health-care consumers in recent years as hospitals have sought to
save money by laying off registered nurses and consolidating a
range of typical nursing functions in the hands of less qualified
workers. Ms. Kuehl first sponsored the bill at the urging of the
nurses union two years ago, and it passed the Legislature but was
vetoed by Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most significant days in the history of
nursing,'' Kay McVay, the president of the California Nurses
Association said in a statement after Davis signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will also bar hospitals from assigning unlicensed
workers to perform certain medical procedures, including
administering drugs and assessing a patient's condition, and it
will prohibit hospitals from shifting nurses trained in one unit to
duty in another without adequate preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The state's health-care industry had opposed the measure on the
grounds that it would impose overly specific requirements on
hospitals and increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are being put under tremendous pressure to lower
costs by the managed-care companies, which are under pressure from
the government and employers, and ultimately, the public,'' said
Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health
Plans, which represents HMOs statewide and opposed the bill.``If
they can avoid it, they would prefer not to have the government
mandate a certain rigid standard. Not that the government is always
wrong, but rigidity is rigidity. It's easier for the industry to
function if it has to meet outcome goals, rather than specific
means of achieving them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rose Ann DeMaro, executive director of the California Nurses
Association, which represents 200,000 nurses, said the new
regulations were necessary to address severe gaps in care that have
resulted from the combination of cutbacks in nursing staffs and the
fact that hospital patients in general are sicker than in the past,
because HMOs resist putting patients in the hospital, if they can
avoid it, to save money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A new research report commissioned by the nurses union,
analyzing 18.2 million patient discharge records and other data,
found a nearly 9 percent increase in the average number of patients
for which each full-time registered nurse was responsible in the
period 1994-1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, patient acuity levels _ which measure the
severity of illness of patients at the point of discharge from the
hospital _ increased by more than 3 percent for the categories of
``major acuity'' and ``extreme acuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been significant downsizing in the nursing staff of
virtually every private hospital in the state,'' said the bill's
sponsor, Ms. Kuehl. ``And because of managed care, patients are
much more seriously ill before they're even checked in. The
dreadful result of the intersection of these two things is that
nurses were caring for more and sicker patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Current California regulations require hospitals to assess the
illness of patients for every shift, on every floor in every
hospital, and then set their nurse staffing levels accordingly, Ms.
Kuehl said. But she said that makes it effectively impossible for
the state to enforce any uniform standard.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of
Commerce, which opposed the bill, said it had done so ``because we
thought it would add to health-care costs and be costly to the
overall economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed relief that Davis had gone out of his way to
find a flexible approach that would not unduly increase costs or
require nurses to perform tasks that could be done by others. He
also expressed satisfaction that the bill was the only one among
those that the chamber had most opposed that Davis had not vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, consumer groups and the American Association of
Retired Persons expressed dismay that Davis vetoed the nursing-home
measure, which would have made a major effort to overhaul care by
gradually increasing the training, number and pay of certified
nurse assistants, and doubling fines for violating state
nursing-home law to a maximum of $50,000 for a patient's death.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, Davis said the bill contained ``many
well-intentioned, commendable features,'' but placed too great a
burden on the state budget, with a five-year cost of over $500
million. He noted that he had already supported including $72
million in the budget passed this summer to increase the minimum
nursing-home staff-to-patient ratio and provide a wage increase to
patient-care staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's let that happen first,'' said the governor's press
secretary, Michael Bustamante. ``Let's let those positions be
filled and then let's take a look at what's going on. This bill
would have cost taxpayers a half a billion dollars. And the
governor has made clear throughout this entire year that he is
hard-pressed to spend money today that we may not have tomorrow.''

 &HT;    AFL-CIO PRESIDENT VOWS TO TURN GOP OUT OF HOUSE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With an endorsement of Vice President Al Gore
virtually assured, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney convened his
labor federation's annual convention Monday with a vow to sweep the
Republican majority from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney's battle cry _ ``clean out the House,'' he declared
in his convention keynote address to 700 delegates _ and the
lingering reluctance of key unions to endorse Gore raised the issue
of whether organized labor's top political priority in 2000 is
winning the White House or restoring a Democratic majority in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho, pausing in an endless series
of convention center hallway conferences with labor leaders,
rejected the suggestion that labor could abandon a faltering Gore
in the general election in order to concentrate on targeted House
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand that if we win the White House, we also win
the House of Representatives,'' Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chip Roth, communications director for the Brotherhood of
Teamsters, the key AFL-CIO member still holding out against
endorsing Gore this week, said a Democratic majority isn't
necessarily in the interest of union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about passing legislation that helps working families,''
Roth said. ``And in this era, where you have razor-thin majorities
in the House, you have to have a more bipartisan approach.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Teamsters abstain when the presidential endorsement comes
up for a vote Wednesday, ``it is still a meaningful endorsement,''
Roth added. ``It would be more meaningful, though, in a united
house of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over as president of the 68-union federation in
1995, the year after Newt Gingrich led the GOP to a takeover of the
House, Sweeney has made it a priority to restore a pro-labor
majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear Monday that he is committed to building on
recent electoral gains, lashing out at the Republican congressional
majority in unusually harsh terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pounding in the heart of every trade unionist in this
country as our perverted United States Congress continues to boost
those who are up and kick those who are down,'' he said. ``It is
time, way past time, to clean out the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the House is controlled by ``an ugly, anti-poor,
anti-working family majority.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, in an afternoon address
to the convention, said a united labor front would help Democrats
reclaim the House and retain the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And later, at a news conference, Gephardt insisted that Gore's
struggling campaign has not jeopardized his chances of becoming
speaker in a Democratic-controlled House. ``The vice president is
running a strong campaign,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenthal, the political director of the AFL-CIO, said the
federation's endorsement of Gore will unleash hundreds of campaign
workers for the vice president in the early primary states of Iowa,
New Hampshire, New York, California, Ohio and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to produce a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said the presidential primary effort on behalf of Gore
will piggyback on organizing already under way in some states to
help pro-labor congresssional candidates in next year's general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority is to have a president and a working majority in
the House that stands with workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he is not concerned that Gore could become a drag
on labor's congresssional campaign. Gore continues to trail Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the overwhelming favorite in the Republican
presidential contest, by wide margins in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the early polls mean a heck of a lot,''
Rosenthal said. ``Voters and union members don't know Al Gore and
they don't know George Bush.'' One of the reasons for an early
endorsement of Gore, he added, is ``to begin the education process
to insure that George Bush isn't elected next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, organized labor poured $35 million into a
campaign against GOP members of Congress, about $15 million of it
into expensive TV ads. But the campaign fell far short of its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, labor shifted tactics and went back to the
basics of politics. It spent less than $5 million on TV, but put
$23 million into a ``ground war'' of old-fashioned grass-roots
organizing, door-to-door canvassing, telephone banks and
get-out-the-vote campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an historic off-year gain of House seats by the
incumbent president's party. And it came on the heels of the
impeachment of that president, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO plans to spend about $40 million in next year's
election, most of it, again, at the grass roots. It is assessing
its 13 million members $3 each to pay for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only opponent for
the Democratic nomination, had aggressively lobbied AFL-CIO members
to delay an endorsement until after the primary voting begins next
January.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney, during the three days leading up to the labor
federation's convention, pressured some of reluctant unions for an
endorsement of Gore when the convention ends Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to Bradley, Sweeney noted in his keynote address that
``it is fortunate that we have two candidates from one of the
parties who are right on our issues more than they are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the AFL-CIO had invited the Republican
presidential candidates to meet with the federation's political
committee, but none had accepted. ``Not one of them had five
minutes for working families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Teamster President James Hoffa has cautioned labor
leaders against automatically supporting Democrats, Roth
acknowledged that none of the major GOP candidates had made any
overtures to Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   When the AFL-CIO votes to endorse a presidential candidate, the
Teamsters are likely to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an anti-Gore thing,'' Roth said. ``It's just too
early in the process. We know a lot about Vice President Gore, but
we don't know enough about candidate Gore and where he stands on
issues.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ASKS SENATE TO PULL NUCLEAR TREATY
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Senate Republicans girded for
a high-stakes showdown Tuesday over the fate of an international
treaty banning nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to salvage the accord from a looming defeat on the Senate
floor, Clinton bowed to Republican demands and formally asked
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on Monday to withdraw
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proceeding to a vote under these circumstances,'' Clinton
wrote, ``would severely harm the national security of the United
States, damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our
historic leadership over 40 years, through administrations
Republican and Democratic, in reducing the nuclear threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stopped short of pledging not to resubmit the accord
for the duration of his term, as some Republicans have demanded,
and the issue of how to move forward remained unresolved late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This withdrawal request is merely a first step,'' said Lott's
press spokesman, John Czwartacki. ``Not only must the treaty be
withheld from consideration at this time, agreement must be reached
that it not come up again at any time this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded that any such promise amounted to
undue constraints on the president's ability to conduct foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't put a sign on our door that says 'closed for
business' during an election year,'' said National Security Council
spokesman David Leavy. ``Who knows what the international
environment will be like over the next 18 months?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the contentious rhetoric, moderate senators from both
parties were quietly seeking a way to put off the vote with an
agreement to delay further consideration of the treaty until after
the 106th Congress adjourns late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement needn't involve Clinton, Czwartacki said, but
could be reached among Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the president to reverse himself,'' said Czwartacki.
``Now it's up to the Senate _ D's and R's _ to agree that it not
come up again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, such an arrangement could be the best
Clinton could hope for at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a decision for those guys to make,'' said Leavy. ``But
the president has made clear that he wouldn't bring this treaty up
unless he had the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Tuesday's outcome appeared to rest with a handful of
the treaty's most outspoken critics, particularly Lott, Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate procedures, canceling the treaty's scheduled vote
Tuesday would require the unanimous consent of the Senate. A single
dissident could force a vote, even if Lott decides he wants it
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the treaty, which calls for the United States and
153 other countries to renounce nuclear weapons tests, could be
delayed until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate doesn't return from its Columbus Day break until
midday Tuesday, and both parties have caucus meetings scheduled
into the afternoon. An important agriculture spending bill is up
for a floor vote late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several hours of debate remain on the Senate time
clock before the treaty vote can take place.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who became the first national leader to sign the treaty
in 1996 and asked the Senate to approve it two years ago, was
unhappy when the Senate scheduled a vote less than two weeks ago.
He claimed the schedule didn't allow sufficient time to discuss the
treaty and work out assurances for the accord's Senate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the votes needed for treaty approval and the time
required to overcome objections, however, Clinton was forced to
plead Monday for the treaty's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   His five-sentence letter was silent, however, on a demand set
forth last week by Helms. He had insisted that the only way the
treaty would be withdrawn would be if Clinton vowed not to seek
Senate approval of the measure until after next year's
congressional and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   That left open the question of whether the Senate would take the
treaty off the table for now, as Clinton requested, or plough ahead
with a vote expected to kill the accord.

MOWLAM LEAVES NORTHERN IRELAND POST IN CABINET SHUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair shuffled his Cabinet
on Monday, replacing Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam with
Peter Mandelson, the mastermind of the 1997 Labor Party landslide
who resigned from the Cabinet in disgrace last December.
</P>
<P>
   The move, while designed to reward Blair loyalists, may have a
distinct impact on the sluggish Irish peace talks by making the
Protestant unionists more willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam, the first woman to hold the job as Britain's top
official in Northern Ireland, was given what is ostensibly a
promotion, to chief of the Cabinet, a position known as ``Cabinet
enforcer.'' But the move comes just three months after Mowlam
persuaded Blair not to make her take a new job similar to the one
given to her Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffle served two key purposes for Blair, who wanted to
give Mowlam, the most popular member of his Cabinet, a more
high-profile position in Britain, and to get Mandelson back in his
inner circle. Mandelson, 45, is given the most credit for helping
Blair seize power by moving the traditionally left-wing Labor Party
to the center, ending 18 years of Conservative government and
giving Labor the biggest parliamentary majority in nearly two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Blair also moved three close aides into the defense, health, and
treasury ministries, firming up the presence of ``New Labor''
advocates in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In her new position, Mowlam, who consistently tops polls as the
most popular Cabinet member, will be in the British public eye more
regularly, appearing on television and radio to defend the
government's policies. Mandelson, meanwhile, appears to be
politically rehabilitated just 10 months after resigning as trade
secretary for failing to disclose he took a $615,000 loan from the
government paymaster general whose office he was investigating.
Mandelson used the money to buy a home in the trendy Notting Hill
section of London.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ancram, chairman of the opposition Conservative Party,
criticized Mandelson's relatively swift return to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only resigned 10 months ago in disgrace. This shows that as
long as you're a crony of Tony Blair, it doesn't matter what you've
done,'' said Ancram.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his top aides, meanwhile, hope that moving Mowlam out
of Belfast will make the Ulster Unionists, the biggest party in
Northern Ireland, more willing to compromise in the ongoing dispute
that has prevented the creation of a local government and stalled
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble suggested that
Mowlam be replaced by Mandelson, and there were senior aides to
Blair who wanted him to make the move in August. But Mowlam
resisted the suggestion that she be made the Labor Party's
chairwoman or the government's chief whip, the first time anyone
could remember a Cabinet member refusing a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Mowlam told friends and associates that she was not
totally opposed to changing of jobs, but was uncomfortable with the
vague leadership jobs on offer and wanted something ``more
hands-on.'' She was also reluctant to leave when some unionists
were crowing that they were forcing her out. Unionists accused
Mowlam of being biased toward nationalists, a charge she rejected.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Blair at Downing Street on Monday, Mowlam appeared
alongside Mandelson, telling reporters, ``It's never an easy time
to go, but everyone has to go some time.'' But, she insisted, ``I'm
very pleased with the job I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said there was ``nothing more important'' to finding a
solution to the current impasse, in which unionists refuse to form
a local government with Sinn Fein, the political allies of the
Irish Republican Army, until the IRA begins turning in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who had bristled at Mowlam's informal style, said he
welcomed Mandelson's appointment. Nationalists were less
enthusiastic, but said the appointment of one of Blair's closest
advisers underscores the prime minister's commitment to
implementing the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the political
settlement aimed at resolving the Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's reshuffle was the first major change that Blair has
made in his Cabinet since his landslide election in May 1997. It
was prompted by the departure of Defense Secretary George Robertson
to become the general secretary of NATO, and the decision last week
by Health Minister Frank Dobson to resign to run for mayor of
London. Robertson was replaced by Geoffrey Hoon, a junior foreign
minister, while Dobson was replaced by Alan Milburn, who was chief
secretary to the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cunningham, the most senior member of Blair's Cabinet,
resigned as the Cabinet enforcer, opening the job for Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   Besides giving Mowlam a higher profile in Britain and getting
Mandelson back inside 10 Downing St., Blair has succeeded in
bringing in more of his New Labor peers, according to political
observers. Cunningham was an old hand who served in the last Labor
government 20 years ago, while Hoon and Milburn are known as
``Blairites'' who helped modernize the party.

   &UR; WHERE CLOTHESHORSES STRUT THEIR STUFF &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sophia Loren &LR; , often seen in the front row of leading
designers' fashion shows, has been accused of being paid big bucks
to be there. Her going rate is $50,000 per show, reports
 &UR; Neil Travis &LR;  of the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Travis says many young actresses not particularly ``noted for
their love of high style'' pick up extra change and/or extra
clothes by showing up for the their &LR;  shows.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at a  &UR; Tommy Hilfiger &LR;  fashion show last week,
 &UR; Debbie Harry  &LR; was in the audience and the grunge rock group  &UR; Bush &LR; 
provided very loud music. According to fashionwiredaily.com, Harry
``started ripping pages from her Hilfiger program and stuffing them
into her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Her representative denied that this meant she didn't like the
music. ``She thought Bush was great. I don't know why she stuffed
paper in her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FASHION STATEMENTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - South Korea-based LG Fashion makes scented men's suits,
reports GQ magazine. A Los Angeles outlet for the company's Maestro
line sells scented golf shirts, and &LR;  as well as formal and casual
suits with lavender and pine aromas.
</P>
<P>
   The technology employs microcapsules that pop on contact. The
scent is said to last through 20 dry cleanings and/or three years.
The first shipment of the suits, which cost $400, sold out in a
month, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - Vogue reports on uniforms newly designed by Viktor &AMP; Rolf for
the staff of the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, Holland, featuring
Levi's jeans, a shirt and a sash worn diagonally across the chest,
embroidered with the wearer's name and job. ``They are embroidered
in Holland by the same firm that makes vestments for the pope,''
says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - The last word in tattoos is not ``Mom'' or ``Death Before
Dishonor''; it's the color white. Details magazine says that
tattoos filled with white, so-called ``ghost tattoos,'' appear
lighter than skin, and eventually fade when the skin's natural
pigment take over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE POWER OF SLACKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, two San Diego schoolteachers,  &UR; Constance Bowman  &LR; and
 &UR; Clara Marie Allen &LR; , spent their summer vacation on a B-24
production line at a bomber plant. Their book about the experience,
``Slacks and Calluses,'' was published the following year;
Smithsonian Institution Press has just reissued it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think there's a difference'' between women who
work in slacks and women who work in skirts, wrote the authors,
``just put on a Consolidated uniform and try to get service in your
favorite store, make a reservation at a ticket office or get
information at the post office. Either the clerks have no concept
of the position of a customer in a buying and selling economy _ or
they don't consider aircraft workers customers.''
</P>
<P>
   As to men, ``we were not women at all, as far as they were
concerned., &LR; '' Making their way to and from work in slacks every
day, the women stood in crowded buses while men sat. ``Two women in
skirts who got on at the same time we did were always offered
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   On their first Sunday off, the authors got dressed up and went
for a bus ride, ``just to reassure ourselves that it was the slacks
and not us.'' Seven men gallantly rose.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who later married and became writer  &UR; Constance Reid &LR; ,
lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - ``Do you still feel like you're fighting for respect in the
industry?'' the Cable Guide asked  &UR; Melissa Etheridge &LR; . ``No,'' she
said. ``I feel a lot of respect. It's funny; I've been gone for a
couple of years and I've come back and I kind of feel even more
respect. It's kind of disconcerting. I'm not that old; don't
respect me too much. I don't feel a problem for being a woman or
being gay. I think music has gone further than that.''
</P>
<P>
   - Meanwhile, MSNBC says that in the middle of taping a
`` &UR; Roseanne &LR; '' episode last week, the star started screaming and
cursing and using four-letter words in front of a live audience.
She was led off the set, and the rest of the week's shows were
canceled. A spokeswoman said Roseanne ``was ill.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever see those stools? You haven't been on a chair that
high since you were 2. Seventy-three-year-old Jews are climbing and
climbing to get to the top of the chair. And when they get to the
top of the chair, they can't even drink the coffee because there's
12 people around one little table.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Jackie Mason  &LR; on seating at Starbuck's, quoted in a Wall
Street Journal story about restaurants with high chairs.
Restaurateurs think sitting high ``cranks up'' the dining
experience and makes it easier for strangers to meet; restaurant
analysts say sitting high makes for rapid customer turnover.

High-tech money revives South of Market district 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The woman had the bearing and speech of a
broker. She sat in the lobby of the new W San Francisco Hotel,
across from two young men in open-collar shirts, neither of whom
looked old enough to shave.
</P>
<P>
   A snippet of her remarks, overheard: ``Now, what we're going to
be doing next is seeing if we can take that $28 million figure down
to something a little more reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, this scene was played out recently in the area of
the city known as South of Market.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime visitors to San Francisco probably won't recognize the
place today. A neighborhood that for so many years had been a tired
warehouse district, overrun with hard-luck stories and the people
who tell them, has undergone a startling transformation.
</P>
<P>
   SoMa _ as San Franciscans call it _ is now sprouting hotels,
restaurants, gourmet coffee shops and entertainment options in new
or dramatically renovated buildings, and tourists and business
people are rediscovering an area that they formerly approached with
combat-zone trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization is being fueled by Internet commerce _ newly
launched dot-com companies, as they are called. They are
predominantly owned and operated by 20-somethings who prefer the
city to the boondocks but don't want to be creamed by the
legendarily high rents in other parts of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Software Gulch,'' said cab driver Gary Teele as he
wheeled south on Fourth Street one recent weekday afternoon.
``Property is gold down here. My daughter bought a condo here two
years ago. Less than 1,000 square feet. Paid $198,000. She just
sold it the other day for $320,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of high-tech cash has spawned numerous businesses
seeking to capture some of it, but this is not your parents' urban
renewal. These new tenants are right out of college, where they
learned that you can sit at a computer in a dorm room and be
enormously productive while attired in T-shirt, sweat pants, socks,
sandals and green hair. They brazenly reject the traditional
standards of business decorum.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets at rush hour, you see them streaming to their
places of employ, riding bikes, lugging backpacks or soft
briefcases, talking on cell phones or getting lost in whatever is
pouring out of their portable CD-player headphones. It's all
loose-fitting clothing and sensible shoes. A tie or a dress is a
rarity, a suit unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   And the SoMa world that has sprung up around them appears to be
tapped directly into this.
</P>
<P>
   At the W Hotel, which sits catty-corner to the Moscone
Convention Center, the staff members are attired entirely in black
(no ties, of course) and wear wireless headsets to remain in
constant communication with one another _ as if that is critically
important. (``Ash tray needs cleaning at fifth-floor elevator.
Over.'')
</P>
<P>
   The guest rooms are equipped with Web TV (Internet access $9.95
per day), wireless keyboards, cordless phones and data ports. A
button on the phone reads ``Whatever Whenever,'' and if you punch
it up, you don't hear some stuffy adult say, ``Guest Services''; a
young voice actually says, ``Whatever Whenever.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no do-not-disturb sign on the door. Instead, the card
says, ``Leave Me Alone (Please).''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional names are rejected, such that the lobby is not
called the lobby. It's the living room, and it kind of feels like
one _ an extremely modern one. It's done in black and chrome and
frosted glass and track lighting and Star Trek-style furniture.
Music throbs through the scene at all hours, a curious amalgam of
techno pop, fusion jazz, dance mix.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if someone has attempted to obliterate the mold of the
traditional downtown hotel. No brass and country-club furnishings.
No stuffiness. No doorman out front in a funny fuzzy hat.
</P>
<P>
   And it's refreshing, really. This is an extremely stylish hotel,
with the kind of room furnishings and appointments you might choose
for your own home (given a great deal of latitude in the budget).
Most of the items are, in fact, for sale. (Chenille bed cover, $55.
Tree in container, $90. Soap dish, $10.)
</P>
<P>
   Head out onto the street, duck west through immaculate Yerba
Buena Gardens, and you'll find where SoMa's new devotees go to let
off steam in techie bliss.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sony Metreon, a four-level, 350,000-square-foot enterprise
that opened in June at Mission and Fourth streets. Not really a
mall, though it feels like one. Not really a theme park, though it
feels like one of those, too. The preferred description is urban
entertainment center, and this one puts a fine hone on the term
cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everything here is interactive, it seems, and you can
hardly turn a corner without being confronted by some sort of Sony
product _ all combining to prompt a singular response: Hmm, maybe
I'm due for an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   And why just look when you can touch? Microsoft, following the
direct-retail lead of Nike and other companies, has a store in
which customers can take software out of the box and try it at any
number of handy PCs. There are also Internet stations available.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation has a store in which various new titles can be tried
out on one of 30 gaming stations. Sony, not surprisingly, has its
own direct-retail outlet. The Discovery Channel has a store that
includes exhibits both educational and, of course, interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The complex breaks from mall tradition in that it is not
anchored by department stores but by movie theaters _ 15 screens
featuring nearly 4,000 stadium-style seats, plus a 600-seat IMAX
theater that features some films in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   There are also eight bistro-style restaurants, several intended
to provide a taste of San Francisco: Firewood Cafe, LongLife Noodle
Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the real lure of Metreon can be found in its fun and games,
which on a recent visit seemed to be appealing not only to young
adults and children, but to baby boomers who find no shame in an
occasional lapse into regressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of Metreon were convinced that sophisticated San
Franciscans abhor cheesy entertainment themes and characters, so
two of the playgrounds were inspired by the works of writers.
</P>
<P>
   The best such example is a fourth-floor attraction called Where
the Wild Things Are, based on the work of acclaimed children's
author and artist Maurice Sendak.
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff of sweet dreamland for the age 3-to-7 set, and
the best part is that you get to participate, not just watch. Pull
a lever near a balcony railing and a fuzzy bird descends rapidly
toward the startled people below, halting at the last instant as it
reaches the end of its leash. Swing on a rope and manipulate the
facial features of an enormous wild-eyed character. Step on a
footprint in a narrow, dark passage and hear a voice exclaim
overhead _ or, better yet, hear one of those bodily noises your
parents tell you you're not supposed to laugh at.
</P>
<P>
   Climb on stuff. Crawl through things. Build structures with big,
soft blocks. Stomp on characters' heads as they pop up from holes
in the floor. The beauty of this place _ and perhaps the reason
it's so popular with the youngsters _ is that unlike at home, kids
are actually encouraged to touch, pull, climb and kick.
</P>
<P>
   At the exit, it's not unusual to hear hysterical screaming _
from some tyke being led away from this place far too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Try to calm things down in the gift store. Wow, what a concept:
This shop trades almost exclusively in books. Here is an exhaustive
selection of Sendak's works, plus the excellent children's
literature of such authors as H.A. Rey and Robert McCloskey.
</P>
<P>
   Kids a little older, who may have found Wild Things a bit on the
dumb side, might be more drawn to The Way Things Work, an
attraction on the second floor based on David Macaulay's best
seller of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   In a reception area, a robot interacts directly with the
audience, to the delight of kids. Then it's into an auditorium
where a 3-D film provides Macaulay's clever take on the technology
of everyday life: levers, wedges, pulleys, zippers.
</P>
<P>
   Kids giggle as they follow the exploits of a hapless woolly
mammoth, and they squeal as animated items ``fly'' into the
audience. This could be the sensory theater of the future. As an
internal-combustion engine rumbles to life, there is vibration in
the seats. As the mammoth sprays the audience with his trunk, mist
descends from above.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the shortened attention spans of the day, the
program is over in a flash. And the audience, yet again, exits
through a gift store hawking books, CD-ROMs, erector sets, silly
toys.
</P>
<P>
   For the next age bracket _ teens to young 20s _ there is
Airtight Garage, an enormous video arcade (Metreon prefers the term
adventure zone), also on the second floor, which delves into the
world of French graphic novelist Jean ``Moebius'' Giraud.
</P>
<P>
   Quaternia? Badlands? They're here. So is Savage Quest. The
concept: You're in control of an on-screen tyrannosaur, which is
alternately attacked by smaller dinosaurs, cave men with spears and
one dastardly triceratops. Get this: Your charge has to eat meat to
maintain strength, which means repeatedly devouring critters and
the cave men _ also their terrified, fleeing women. A few minutes
into the game, and the entire scene is a bloody mess. Here's hoping
no maladjusted teen-agers are hooked on this one.
</P>
<P>
   A less gruesome alternative might be HyperBowl, which seems to
have particular appeal to older customers _ the
joystick-challenged, if you will. As a scene plays out on an
enormous screen, participants manipulate a large, bowling-ball-like
control and knock down pins in any number of unlikely locales: the
streets of San Francisco, the heaving deck of a sailing ship,
ancient Rome. (Watch out for that priceless urn ... too late.)
</P>
<P>
   For $17 _ $13 for kids under 12 and seniors _ you can gain
admission to Where the Wild Things Are and The Way Things Work and
also get a number of credit points for Airtight Garage. Each
attraction can also be purchased separately.
</P>
<P>
   At Metreon, you won't see a lot of cash changing hands. That's
kind of passe for this crowd. Here, the magnetic strip reigns
supreme. Swipe your credit card to buy a pass to an attraction, and
you'll be issued a card that you'll then swipe at a different
machine to gain entry. Use your credit card at Airtight Garage to
get a video game card, and feed that into the machine to play; the
machine will keep track of your credit points. Avoid the lines at
the movie theater ticket counter by feeding your credit card into
an ATM-like machine and specifying how many tickets you want, for
which movie, at which time.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, no scanning device is used to exit the place.
</P>
<P>
   After the nonstop sensory assault that is Metreon, you'll
probably welcome the fresh air and serenity of Yerba Buena Gardens,
which lies directly east of the Sony monstrosity. It is neatly
clipped grass, fountains, shady trees, benches and no bums.
</P>
<P>
   If your kids are still wired, check out the Rooftop at the
Moscone Center, which includes Zeum, an interactive arts and
technology museum for young people. There's a glassed-in carousel
up there, too.
</P>
<P>
   For a clean break from things that celebrate noise and motion,
however, there is the Museum of Modern Art, next door to the W
Hotel on Third. The museum presents a serene environment for
contemplation _ contemplation of what qualifies for art in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   You can gaze at three panels painted solid white, by Robert
Rauschenberg, praised by a contemporary as ``airports for lights,
shadows and particles.'' OK.
</P>
<P>
   In another exhibition room is a urinal lying on its side on a
pedestal, a work created by Marcel Duchamp. An explanatory placard
reads: ``By removing the urinal from its everyday context, Duchamp
created a new thought and a new identity for it.'' Right.
</P>
<P>
   The placards on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art actually
do a commendable job of tracing the emergence of modern art, from
the first tentative forays of Henri Matisse and Andre Derain in the
early 1900s _ they were labeled ``wild beasts'' by critics _ to a

   The boom of San Francisco's South of Market district is likely
to continue. Pacific Bell Park, to be the new home of baseball's
Giants and targeted to open with the 2000 season in April, will
help see to that. It is currently taking shape in red-brick
splendor at Third and King streets. Already, bar-and-grill
establishments with leafy patio areas are springing up nearby.

<P>
   What happened to the old SoMa? It simply moved slightly west.
Wander down Folsom and you'll find a transition zone after you
cross Fifth Street. Here, renovation projects muscle for dominance
with auto-repair shops, X-rated businesses and tattered gospel
missions. A bit farther on, walls are scarred with graffiti, air is
acrid with urine.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, this blight engulfed the Moscone Center and its
neighborhood. In fact, local business people would warn their
convention colleagues to catch a cab at the door, beat it back to
their city-center hotels and not risk even a half-block walk in the
perilous zone that was South of Market.
</P>
<P>
   No more, though. Not since the tech crowd arrived and began
infusing the area with its money, its energy, its perspective.

<P>
   &UR; WHERE CLOTHESHORSES STRUT THEIR STUFF &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sophia Loren &LR; , often seen in the front row of leading
designers' fashion shows, has been accused of being paid big bucks
to be there. Her going rate is $50,000 per show, reports
 &UR; Neil Travis &LR;  of the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Travis says many young actresses not particularly ``noted for
their love of high style'' pick up extra change and/or extra
clothes by showing up for the their &LR;  shows.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at a  &UR; Tommy Hilfiger &LR;  fashion show last week,
 &UR; Debbie Harry  &LR; was in the audience and the grunge rock group  &UR; Bush &LR; 
provided very loud music. According to fashionwiredaily.com, Harry
``started ripping pages from her Hilfiger program and stuffing them
into her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Her representative denied that this meant she didn't like the
music. ``She thought Bush was great. I don't know why she stuffed
paper in her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FASHION STATEMENTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - South Korea-based LG Fashion makes scented men's suits,
reports GQ magazine. A Los Angeles outlet for the company's Maestro
line sells scented golf shirts, and &LR;  as well as formal and casual
suits with lavender and pine aromas.
</P>
<P>
   The technology employs microcapsules that pop on contact. The
scent is said to last through 20 dry cleanings and/or three years.
The first shipment of the suits, which cost $400, sold out in a
month, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - Vogue reports on uniforms newly designed by Viktor &AMP; Rolf for
the staff of the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, Holland, featuring
Levi's jeans, a shirt and a sash worn diagonally across the chest,
embroidered with the wearer's name and job. ``They are embroidered
in Holland by the same firm that makes vestments for the pope,''
says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - The last word in tattoos is not ``Mom'' or ``Death Before
Dishonor''; it's the color white. Details magazine says that
tattoos filled with white, so-called ``ghost tattoos,'' appear
lighter than skin, and eventually fade when the skin's natural
pigment take over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE POWER OF SLACKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, two San Diego schoolteachers,  &UR; Constance Bowman  &LR; and
 &UR; Clara Marie Allen &LR; , spent their summer vacation on a B-24
production line at a bomber plant. Their book about the experience,
``Slacks and Calluses,'' was published the following year;
Smithsonian Institution Press has just reissued it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think there's a difference'' between women who
work in slacks and women who work in skirts, wrote the authors,
``just put on a Consolidated uniform and try to get service in your
favorite store, make a reservation at a ticket office or get
information at the post office. Either the clerks have no concept
of the position of a customer in a buying and selling economy _ or
they don't consider aircraft workers customers.''
</P>
<P>
   As to men, ``we were not women at all, as far as they were
concerned., &LR; '' Making their way to and from work in slacks every
day, the women stood in crowded buses while men sat. ``Two women in
skirts who got on at the same time we did were always offered
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   On their first Sunday off, the authors got dressed up and went
for a bus ride, ``just to reassure ourselves that it was the slacks
and not us.'' Seven men gallantly rose.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who later married and became writer  &UR; Constance Reid &LR; ,
lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - ``Do you still feel like you're fighting for respect in the
industry?'' the Cable Guide asked  &UR; Melissa Etheridge &LR; . ``No,'' she
said. ``I feel a lot of respect. It's funny; I've been gone for a
couple of years and I've come back and I kind of feel even more
respect. It's kind of disconcerting. I'm not that old; don't
respect me too much. I don't feel a problem for being a woman or
being gay. I think music has gone further than that.''
</P>
<P>
   - Meanwhile, MSNBC says that in the middle of taping a
`` &UR; Roseanne &LR; '' episode last week, the star started screaming and
cursing and using four-letter words in front of a live audience.
She was led off the set, and the rest of the week's shows were
canceled. A spokeswoman said Roseanne ``was ill.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever see those stools? You haven't been on a chair that
high since you were 2. Seventy-three-year-old Jews are climbing and
climbing to get to the top of the chair. And when they get to the
top of the chair, they can't even drink the coffee because there's
12 people around one little table.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Jackie Mason  &LR; on seating at Starbuck's, quoted in a Wall
Street Journal story about restaurants with high chairs.
Restaurateurs think sitting high ``cranks up'' the dining
experience and makes it easier for strangers to meet; restaurant
analysts say sitting high makes for rapid customer turnover.

   GETTING THERE: Pave paradise, put up a parking lot ... then tear
out the parking lot, put up a building. The South of Market
redevelopment boom is gobbling up open space fast, such that
parking availability is shriveling and rates are soaring. It might
be best to come in from the airport by taxi or, better yet,
Caltrain: (800) 736-2008; Web: www.transitinfo.org/Caltrain. If you
must drive in, there is a 2,585-space parking garage directly west
of Sony Metreon; it takes up an entire block of Mission Street
between Fourth and Fifth streets (fees graduated to a daily maximum
of $13).
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: At Sony Metreon, you can gain admission to Where the Wild
Things Are and The Way Things Work and get some play time on the
video games of Airtight Garage for $17 for adults, $13 for seniors
and children under 12. Wild Things and Way Things Work can be
bought separately. Admission for each is $7 for adults, $5 for
seniors and kids. Admission to the IMAX features is $9.75. For
Zeum, at the Moscone Convention Center, admission is $7 for adults,
$6 for seniors and students, $5 for kids ages 5 to 18. The carousel
costs $1 to ride. Admission for the Museum of Modern Art is $9 for
adults, $6 for seniors, $5 for students with ID (children 12 and
under free).
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The W San Francisco, a trendy, high-tech hotel at Third
and Howard streets, shatters the mold of the conventional downtown
business hotel. The Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide property is
impeccably appointed throughout, however, and has some terrific
views of the Bay Bridge. Standard rates: $289 to $319. Phone: (415)
626-0777. Web: www.whotels.com. Another option in the South of
Market area is the just-opened Palomar Hotel at Fourth and Market,
(877) 294-9711 or (415) 348-1111. There is a Marriott at Fourth and
Mission, (800) 944-5941 or (415) 896-1600. A Four Seasons is under
construction on Market between Third and Fourth, due for completion
in 2003. The city's visitors' bureau maintains a hotel referral
line: (888) 782-9673.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: In this city of great eats, why confine yourself to a
particular neighborhood? In the South of Market area, XYZ, at the W
Hotel, offers nine starter courses and six entrees (the usuals:
fish, lamb, beef), but a recent dinner was not found to be
particularly memorable. A better idea might be to jump in a cab and
head across town to PlumpJack Cafe, 3127 Fillmore St., (415)
563-4755. For lunch, it's tough to beat the shellfish at the
delightfully casual and friendly Swan Oyster Depot, 1517 Polk St.,
(415) 673-2757.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: Contact the San Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau at (800) 220-5747 or (415) 974-6900. Web: www.sfvisitor.org.
For Sony Metreon information, call (415) 537-3400. Web:

High-tech money revives South of Market district 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The woman had the bearing and speech of a
broker. She sat in the lobby of the new W San Francisco Hotel,
across from two young men in open-collar shirts, neither of whom
looked old enough to shave.
</P>
<P>
   A snippet of her remarks, overheard: ``Now, what we're going to
be doing next is seeing if we can take that $28 million figure down
to something a little more reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, this scene was played out recently in the area of
the city known as South of Market.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime visitors to San Francisco probably won't recognize the
place today. A neighborhood that for so many years had been a tired
warehouse district, overrun with hard-luck stories and the people
who tell them, has undergone a startling transformation.
</P>
<P>
   SoMa _ as San Franciscans call it _ is now sprouting hotels,
restaurants, gourmet coffee shops and entertainment options in new
or dramatically renovated buildings, and tourists and business
people are rediscovering an area that they formerly approached with
combat-zone trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization is being fueled by Internet commerce _ newly
launched dot-com companies, as they are called. They are
predominantly owned and operated by 20-somethings who prefer the
city to the boondocks but don't want to be creamed by the
legendarily high rents in other parts of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Software Gulch,'' said cab driver Gary Teele as he
wheeled south on Fourth Street one recent weekday afternoon.
``Property is gold down here. My daughter bought a condo here two
years ago. Less than 1,000 square feet. Paid $198,000. She just
sold it the other day for $320,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of high-tech cash has spawned numerous businesses
seeking to capture some of it, but this is not your parents' urban
renewal. These new tenants are right out of college, where they
learned that you can sit at a computer in a dorm room and be
enormously productive while attired in T-shirt, sweat pants, socks,
sandals and green hair. They brazenly reject the traditional
standards of business decorum.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets at rush hour, you see them streaming to their
places of employ, riding bikes, lugging backpacks or soft
briefcases, talking on cell phones or getting lost in whatever is
pouring out of their portable CD-player headphones. It's all
loose-fitting clothing and sensible shoes. A tie or a dress is a
rarity, a suit unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   And the SoMa world that has sprung up around them appears to be
tapped directly into this.
</P>
<P>
   At the W Hotel, which sits catty-corner to the Moscone
Convention Center, the staff members are attired entirely in black
(no ties, of course) and wear wireless headsets to remain in
constant communication with one another _ as if that is critically
important. (``Ash tray needs cleaning at fifth-floor elevator.
Over.'')
</P>
<P>
   The guest rooms are equipped with Web TV (Internet access $9.95
per day), wireless keyboards, cordless phones and data ports. A
button on the phone reads ``Whatever Whenever,'' and if you punch
it up, you don't hear some stuffy adult say, ``Guest Services''; a
young voice actually says, ``Whatever Whenever.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no do-not-disturb sign on the door. Instead, the card
says, ``Leave Me Alone (Please).''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional names are rejected, such that the lobby is not
called the lobby. It's the living room, and it kind of feels like
one _ an extremely modern one. It's done in black and chrome and
frosted glass and track lighting and Star Trek-style furniture.
Music throbs through the scene at all hours, a curious amalgam of
techno pop, fusion jazz, dance mix.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if someone has attempted to obliterate the mold of the
traditional downtown hotel. No brass and country-club furnishings.
No stuffiness. No doorman out front in a funny fuzzy hat.
</P>
<P>
   And it's refreshing, really. This is an extremely stylish hotel,
with the kind of room furnishings and appointments you might choose
for your own home (given a great deal of latitude in the budget).
Most of the items are, in fact, for sale. (Chenille bed cover, $55.
Tree in container, $90. Soap dish, $10.)
</P>
<P>
   Head out onto the street, duck west through immaculate Yerba
Buena Gardens, and you'll find where SoMa's new devotees go to let
off steam in techie bliss.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sony Metreon, a four-level, 350,000-square-foot enterprise
that opened in June at Mission and Fourth streets. Not really a
mall, though it feels like one. Not really a theme park, though it
feels like one of those, too. The preferred description is urban
entertainment center, and this one puts a fine hone on the term
cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everything here is interactive, it seems, and you can
hardly turn a corner without being confronted by some sort of Sony
product _ all combining to prompt a singular response: Hmm, maybe
I'm due for an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   And why just look when you can touch? Microsoft, following the
direct-retail lead of Nike and other companies, has a store in
which customers can take software out of the box and try it at any
number of handy PCs. There are also Internet stations available.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation has a store in which various new titles can be tried
out on one of 30 gaming stations. Sony, not surprisingly, has its
own direct-retail outlet. The Discovery Channel has a store that
includes exhibits both educational and, of course, interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The complex breaks from mall tradition in that it is not
anchored by department stores but by movie theaters _ 15 screens
featuring nearly 4,000 stadium-style seats, plus a 600-seat IMAX
theater that features some films in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   There are also eight bistro-style restaurants, several intended
to provide a taste of San Francisco: Firewood Cafe, LongLife Noodle
Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the real lure of Metreon can be found in its fun and games,
which on a recent visit seemed to be appealing not only to young
adults and children, but to baby boomers who find no shame in an
occasional lapse into regressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of Metreon were convinced that sophisticated San
Franciscans abhor cheesy entertainment themes and characters, so
two of the playgrounds were inspired by the works of writers.
</P>
<P>
   The best such example is a fourth-floor attraction called Where
the Wild Things Are, based on the work of acclaimed children's
author and artist Maurice Sendak.
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff of sweet dreamland for the age 3-to-7 set, and
the best part is that you get to participate, not just watch. Pull
a lever near a balcony railing and a fuzzy bird descends rapidly
toward the startled people below, halting at the last instant as it
reaches the end of its leash. Swing on a rope and manipulate the
facial features of an enormous wild-eyed character. Step on a
footprint in a narrow, dark passage and hear a voice exclaim
overhead _ or, better yet, hear one of those bodily noises your
parents tell you you're not supposed to laugh at.
</P>
<P>
   Climb on stuff. Crawl through things. Build structures with big,
soft blocks. Stomp on characters' heads as they pop up from holes
in the floor. The beauty of this place _ and perhaps the reason
it's so popular with the youngsters _ is that unlike at home, kids
are actually encouraged to touch, pull, climb and kick.
</P>
<P>
   At the exit, it's not unusual to hear hysterical screaming _
from some tyke being led away from this place far too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Try to calm things down in the gift store. Wow, what a concept:
This shop trades almost exclusively in books. Here is an exhaustive
selection of Sendak's works, plus the excellent children's
literature of such authors as H.A. Rey and Robert McCloskey.
</P>
<P>
   Kids a little older, who may have found Wild Things a bit on the
dumb side, might be more drawn to The Way Things Work, an
attraction on the second floor based on David Macaulay's best
seller of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   In a reception area, a robot interacts directly with the
audience, to the delight of kids. Then it's into an auditorium
where a 3-D film provides Macaulay's clever take on the technology
of everyday life: levers, wedges, pulleys, zippers.
</P>
<P>
   Kids giggle as they follow the exploits of a hapless woolly
mammoth, and they squeal as animated items ``fly'' into the
audience. This could be the sensory theater of the future. As an
internal-combustion engine rumbles to life, there is vibration in
the seats. As the mammoth sprays the audience with his trunk, mist
descends from above.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the shortened attention spans of the day, the
program is over in a flash. And the audience, yet again, exits
through a gift store hawking books, CD-ROMs, erector sets, silly
toys.
</P>
<P>
   For the next age bracket _ teens to young 20s _ there is
Airtight Garage, an enormous video arcade (Metreon prefers the term
adventure zone), also on the second floor, which delves into the
world of French graphic novelist Jean ``Moebius'' Giraud.
</P>
<P>
   Quaternia? Badlands? They're here. So is Savage Quest. The
concept: You're in control of an on-screen tyrannosaur, which is
alternately attacked by smaller dinosaurs, cave men with spears and
one dastardly triceratops. Get this: Your charge has to eat meat to
maintain strength, which means repeatedly devouring critters and
the cave men _ also their terrified, fleeing women. A few minutes
into the game, and the entire scene is a bloody mess. Here's hoping
no maladjusted teen-agers are hooked on this one.
</P>
<P>
   A less gruesome alternative might be HyperBowl, which seems to
have particular appeal to older customers _ the
joystick-challenged, if you will. As a scene plays out on an
enormous screen, participants manipulate a large, bowling-ball-like
control and knock down pins in any number of unlikely locales: the
streets of San Francisco, the heaving deck of a sailing ship,
ancient Rome. (Watch out for that priceless urn ... too late.)
</P>
<P>
   For $17 _ $13 for kids under 12 and seniors _ you can gain
admission to Where the Wild Things Are and The Way Things Work and
also get a number of credit points for Airtight Garage. Each
attraction can also be purchased separately.
</P>
<P>
   At Metreon, you won't see a lot of cash changing hands. That's
kind of passe for this crowd. Here, the magnetic strip reigns
supreme. Swipe your credit card to buy a pass to an attraction, and
you'll be issued a card that you'll then swipe at a different
machine to gain entry. Use your credit card at Airtight Garage to
get a video game card, and feed that into the machine to play; the
machine will keep track of your credit points. Avoid the lines at
the movie theater ticket counter by feeding your credit card into
an ATM-like machine and specifying how many tickets you want, for
which movie, at which time.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, no scanning device is used to exit the place.
</P>
<P>
   After the nonstop sensory assault that is Metreon, you'll
probably welcome the fresh air and serenity of Yerba Buena Gardens,
which lies directly east of the Sony monstrosity. It is neatly
clipped grass, fountains, shady trees, benches and no bums.
</P>
<P>
   If your kids are still wired, check out the Rooftop at the
Moscone Center, which includes Zeum, an interactive arts and
technology museum for young people. There's a glassed-in carousel
up there, too.
</P>
<P>
   For a clean break from things that celebrate noise and motion,
however, there is the Museum of Modern Art, next door to the W
Hotel on Third. The museum presents a serene environment for
contemplation _ contemplation of what qualifies for art in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   You can gaze at three panels painted solid white, by Robert
Rauschenberg, praised by a contemporary as ``airports for lights,
shadows and particles.'' OK.
</P>
<P>
   In another exhibition room is a urinal lying on its side on a
pedestal, a work created by Marcel Duchamp. An explanatory placard
reads: ``By removing the urinal from its everyday context, Duchamp
created a new thought and a new identity for it.'' Right.
</P>
<P>
   The placards on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art actually
do a commendable job of tracing the emergence of modern art, from
the first tentative forays of Henri Matisse and Andre Derain in the
early 1900s _ they were labeled ``wild beasts'' by critics _ to a
Max Beckmann oil from 1938, ``Woman at Her Toilette With Red and
White,'' a work that resulted in his being labeled a
``degenerate'' by Nazis who were coming to power in prewar Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The boom of San Francisco's South of Market district is likely
to continue. Pacific Bell Park, to be the new home of baseball's
Giants and targeted to open with the 2000 season in April, will
help see to that. It is currently taking shape in red-brick
splendor at Third and King streets. Already, bar-and-grill
establishments with leafy patio areas are springing up nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the old SoMa? It simply moved slightly west.
Wander down Folsom and you'll find a transition zone after you
cross Fifth Street. Here, renovation projects muscle for dominance
with auto-repair shops, X-rated businesses and tattered gospel
missions. A bit farther on, walls are scarred with graffiti, air is
acrid with urine.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, this blight engulfed the Moscone Center and its
neighborhood. In fact, local business people would warn their
convention colleagues to catch a cab at the door, beat it back to
their city-center hotels and not risk even a half-block walk in the
perilous zone that was South of Market.
</P>
<P>
   No more, though. Not since the tech crowd arrived and began
infusing the area with its money, its energy, its perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Not since SoMa became so different.

BRUINS TIE, BUT LOOK MORE LIKE A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You might not know it from looking at the standings
_the 0-3-2 start does look woeful on paper doesn't it? _ but the
Bruins are worlds better than they were a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   They have tied their last two games _ 3-3 Monday with Colorado
after a 1-1 deadlock Saturday with Philadelphia _ but the
difference between the Bruins who started the season and the Bruins
now is startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a real bad first two games, a good half a game in
Ottawa and the last two have been good,'' said center Jason
Allison, who was one of the Bruins' best players against the
Avalanche at the FleetCenter. ``(Monday) I thought we played
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins peppered young Avalanche netminder Marc Denis with 47
shots and the acrobatic goalie made some mindboggling stops. And
that didn't count the half-dozen posts the Bruins hit or the 21
shots blocked by Colorado that never even made it to Denis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we deserved better than what we got,'' said coach
Pat Burns. ``It was certainly a good effort from all four lines.
You have to stay positive and hope we're going to get out of it. I
thought the last game we had a pretty good effort, too. It's a
question of things have to go our way someday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins skated better, were more polished offensively, and
more reliable defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche took the lead at 10:58 of the first period on the
first of two goals by right wing Milan Hejduk. But 15 seconds
later, Boston tied it. New addition Sean Pronger, called up from
Providence, forced defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh to give up the puck
behind the net and right wing Rob DiMaio beat Denis with a shot
from the slot at 11:13.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado went ahead at 16:44 when Chris Drury scored on the
power play. Adam Deadmarsh fired a pass from the left circle that
glanced off Ray Bourque and went right on the stick of Drury, who
tipped it past goalie John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made it 2-2 on a Steve Heinze goal at 1:47 of the
third and then went ahead, 3-2, at 5:36 on a strike by Dave
Andreychuk. Allison set it up by beating defenseman Martin Skoula
behind the net. He skated the puck left to right and when Aaron
Miller came over to challenge, Allison backhanded it between his
legs and right to Andreychuk, who popped it past Denis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how open he was but I knew he'd at least get a
good shot off,'' said Allison of Andreychuk. ``It's good for me if
(Miller) comes because it leaves him alone in front. If I see
(Miller) come, I can look for an opening maybe between his legs or
maybe between his stick but he reached out and there was a big hole
through his legs.''
</P>
<P>
   A miscue by Grahame led to the third Colorado tally, which
Hejduk scored at 11:56. After a pileup in the crease, Grahame
punched Drury in the head and was called for roughing, leading to
the power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, there was far more positive to look at Monday than
negative. One of the biggest pluses for Boston the last two games
has been the terrific play of Allison. There was plenty of worry a
week ago about the health of the center's ailing right forearm.
Allison said all is well now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more confident in my shot even though I flubbed a
couple,'' he said. ``I feel good and I'm feeling better. My
strength isn't 100 percent but I'm not thinking about it and it's
not hindering regular play.''
</P>
<P>
   He said part of the problem was being unable to play any
exhibition games in camp because of a bad ankle and not practicing
with the team for four weeks. ``I'm kind of disappointed in no
goals yet but the last couple of games, I've felt good,'' he said.
``I could've had a couple tonight so I'm feeling pretty
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strong game across the board. Another standout was Kyle
McLaren, who hit a couple of posts and did everything but score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laughing out there,'' said McLaren. ``An inch this way
or an inch that way and I have two goals. Those are the breaks
sometimes. We were shooting the puck Tuesday so that was a
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns put center Joe Thornton back on an offensive line and
Pronger gave a good account of himself on the checking line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked (assistant general manager Mike O'Connell) to bring
him back so we could free up Joe a little bit and put him into an
offensive role a little bit more with Anson Carter and Steve
Heinze,'' said Burns. ``Anybody you put between those two guys
usually plays well. Joe had a good week there and Tim Taylor did
for a couple of years. It's a good opportunity for Sean.''
</P>
<P>
   As bleak as things looked a week ago, even though the Bruins are
still looking for their first win, there is light at the end of the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting there, we're getting to the net, we're getting
shots,'' said Burns. ``I see much better things now.''

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Today when city voters cast their ballots for
mayor, Richard Arrington won't be one of the choices for the first
time in 20 years. The first black mayor in city history retired
this summer, saying he had done all he could, had exhausted all
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say his administration won't live on.
</P>
<P>
   The top candidate in a field of 14 is City Council President
William Bell, a faithful supporter of the mayor through the years.
Arrington left office early and appointed Bell as the interim
mayor, giving the council veteran the chance to run as a
pseudo-incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The move helped solidify the black constituency that kept
Arrington in power so long. But it's also troubled some black
professionals, who say two decades under Arrington helped little in
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Former Birmingham Municipal Judge Emory Anthony, a black man
appointed to his judicial post, ran strongly in the past against
Arrington, drawing from some of the same people who put Arrington
in office.
</P>
<P>
   After running against Arrington, Anthony lost his judicial
appointment. Today, he works in private practice and supports city
council member Bernard Kincaid for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bell leading Kincaid 2-1 with nearly 40 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is among those fearful that an extension of Arrington's
power would be bad for the city as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good at playing the race card,'' Anthony said. ``That
was a good card for him to play because he could say you're just
trying to keep a black mayor down'' to white council members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything became a black-white issue. But you can't divide
the people one day then come back the next day and try and put the
city back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cleage runs the Five Points Ace Hardware in the city's
chief entertainment district. The city's cultivation of growth
outside of downtown, which won Arrington's approval, has worn thin
with him.
</P>
<P>
   He said the vitality that once made downtown merchants jealous
of Five Points South has peaked because of developments on the edge
of town like the city-conceived Summitt, a $100 million mix of
hotels, offices, shops and apartments. Such projects also are seen
as development that leaves out blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburban town of Hoover, shoppers flock to the Riverchase
Galleria, an area that gives rise to a haven of strip malls next to
the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's never going to get anywhere economically because
all of it is going to the suburbs,'' Cleage said.
</P>
<P>
   John's Restaurant once stayed open till 10 p.m. But the inner
city is so deserted after dark that closing time was moved back an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The brick building where the city's power lawyers lunch at a
round table with a split white laminate top sits downtown on
Richard Arrington Jr. Boulevard. By nightfall, the locals are gone.
They need incentive to come downtown, which means businesses need a
reason to set up shop, said Jodie Stanfield, the general manager at
John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone who's going to bring Birmingham back,'' said
Stanfield.
</P>
<P>
   All around the financial and legal district that dominates
downtown, vacant buildings abound. Plate glass windows display For
Sale signs. Loft apartments are beginning to move in but
businessmen like Stanfield are waiting to see if they really take
root.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the convention people drive through here to get to some
of the livelier spots, they see a ghost town,'' Stanfield said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Arrington never accomplished was moving Birmingham
forward as a region, not a conglomeration of satellite communities
moving at cross-purposes to a municipal behemoth. Like Atlanta,
Birmingham as a region is faced with the complex issue of
delivering services and expanding business in a managed fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Arrington was just never able to be a mobilizer in
that,'' said Edward LaMonte, a political scientist at Birmingham
Southern College and formerly the senior staff member of
Arrington's administration the first two terms. ``The next mayor
has to be a more skillful metro area leader.''

<P>
   NISHIO, Japan _ Insulated by the innocence of her 16 years,
Hanae Nagatani had never taken seriously the threats against her.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks before she was killed there had been anonymous letters
and menacing phone calls. There had been sightings of a young male
figure lurking around her house. There had even been disturbing
face-to-face encounters with the former middle school classmate who
was fixated on her and eventually stabbed her to death.
</P>
<P>
   In many other places, such behavior would be called stalking,
and the suspect arrested, or at least called in for questioning.
But in this quiet town, which is regarded, just like Japan itself,
as overwhelmingly safe, the threats never seemed worthy of a call
to the police, or more than a brief word with a teacher and an
occasional change of route in walking to school.
</P>
<P>
   Then the killer struck. Hanae was brave, according to the
official report, snatching a knife away from the boy and throwing
it away. What she did not count on was that he carried a second
blade in his bicycle basket. In the end, this was the weapon he
used to stab her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I shouted at the boy on the telephone to just stop
calling,'' said Hanae's mother, Keiko, as she mourned at the shrine
to her elder child in the small living room, where incense and
candles burned. ``Maybe if I had spoken up more strongly all this
would have turned out differently.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Nagatani family did not realize until it was too late
was that youth crime is one of the fastest-growing criminal
categories in the country. As schools across Japan, and towns large
and small, increasingly become the theaters for attacks by gangs,
sexual crimes and theft, Japanese authorities are sounding the
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   According to national police figures, violence and crime by
school-age youth _ defined here as people 19 and younger _ has been
rising fast both in and outside of school for several years now.
For the third consecutive year, the number of juveniles arrested in
connection with serious crimes like murder, rape and robbery pushed
above 1,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yearly arrests of minors for serious crimes has more than
doubled in this decade, rising to 2,197 cases in 1998 from 1,078 in
1990, according to National Police statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The number of juveniles interned in the nation's refools,
meanwhile, has risen sharply, to about 5,500 last year from 3,800
in 1995. Authorities say violent crimes are replacing theft as the
most common reasons for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say violent crimes are replacing theft as the most
common reasons for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The case that grabbed the most attention was the strangling
death, in April, of a 23-year-old housewife and her 11-month-old
baby during a botched robbery attempt by an 18-year-old in the
southern Japanese prefecture of Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's national rates of crime by youth pale in comparison with
what Americans have become accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Japan, whose conservative, nearly mono-ethnic society
sometimes conveys the feel of an immense village, where elaborate
social codes are universally recognized and respected by nearly
all, the spread of criminal behavior among young people represents
a dramatic departure from the norm. And if the phenomenon goes
unchecked, many here fear, it will destroy one of the features that
contributes most to Japan's sense of uniqueness: unquestioned
security.
</P>
<P>
   For Japanese experts who are attempting to understand the rise
of youth crime, the central irony behind the problem is that it
appears to be not so much an expression of social deviance but a
byproduct of the single-minded industriousness that has propelled
Japan toward economic success. The dark flip-side of the country's
economic power, many experts say, has been the gutting of family
life and playtime in the name of workplace performance and school
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus is emerging that the long work hours of many
Japanese, followed by long commutes, and job-related social
engagements has stripped many children of almost any meaningful
contact with their parents, and particularly their fathers.
Children, meanwhile, face intense competitive academic pressures
from early elementary school, and typically finish day school only
to go to afternoon school in order not to fall behind their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Even for many pre-teens, this means quickly dropping their bags
off and picking up a packaged dinner at home immediately after
school and hurrying off to the ubiquitous juku, or private cram
school, where their studies will often continue until 10 or 11 p.m.
Young children returning home from the juku at night are a common
sight in Tokyo's subways.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 17-year-old boy who killed Hanae, the father
was a long-distance truck driver who was often absent, and the
mother worked too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many children in Japan who cannot get any kind of
interest from their parents, and are really desperate for some
involvement with them,'' said Toshiko Toriyama, a former elementary
school teacher who has written books about the problems of youth.
``After a time, we see the children's spirits sort of dry up. This
is a form of child abuse, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids want positive attention, but if they can't get that,
they will seek other kinds of attention. This includes robbery or
committing real acts of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other reasons are invoked to explain crime, and other
problems associated with Japan's youth. A perennial culprit is the
intensely competitive educational system, whose heavy emphasis on
testing, starting at a young age, has not changed, even as the
country as a whole has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of most parents, of course, is to see their
child admitted into one of less than a handful of super elite
colleges. In Japan's tightly hierarchical educational system, which
college a person attends determines, far more than in most
countries, what he or she can achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not rated so highly by the standards that are used,
you are regarded as valueless by adults and by teachers,'' said
Hideo Takayama, who has studied childhood development for 35 years.
``In such a system, the kids themselves lose sight of any greater
purpose in life, or of their own personal worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, being admitted to a top school has virtually
guaranteed a prestigious job and a good life. But a perverse effect
of Japan's extraordinary economic rise has meant that the intense
sense of national purpose that drove the last generation to study
long and work hard in order to rebuild a nation destroyed by war
has given way for many to meaninglessness and apathy.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, after 10 years of unprecedented economic
stagnation, record unemployment has begun to shatter the implicit
social compact that seemed to justify so much of the self-sacrifice
that this society demands. Suddenly, at the end of an educational
rainbow built of cram schools and scant social life for teens,
people have discovered there may not be a job at all.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he made of the recent murder of young Hanae, in
Nishio, Shiro Miyamoto, director of the Tama Juvenile Training
School, a reform school for boys an hour west of Tokyo by train,
merely shrugged. ``I missed that case,'' he said with a touch of
weariness. ``There are so many like that these days.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Tama school, for juveniles 14 to 19 who have generally
committed serious crimes, involves many of the same rigors that
characterize ordinary Japanese society, only in larger doses:
discipline, repetitive tasks, respect for the group and for
hierarchy. The boys rise by 7:00 a.m. every morning, scrub their
spartan dorms, sing in chorus and then do group exercises, driven
throughout by a drill-master.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, there are vocational classes, counseling, and
a brief spell of private time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here because I used to try to force people to do things
according to my will,'' said one student, an 18-year-old with bushy
hair, lively eyes and a straightforward manner. ``When people would
answer me back, I couldn't stand it. Sometimes I would respond by
trying to scare people, or even hurting them.''
</P>
<P>
   The school would not allow the students to be identified, or
permit questions about the specific details of their crimes. But
experts say problems like these, related by students in their
confessional tone, reflected a less often acknowledged price
exacted by Japan's highly driven school system: a lack of
opportunities for youthful recreation and the relationship building
that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children have no time to play, they have no kids to play
with, and they have no place to play when they are growing up,''
said Takayama, the childhood development expert said. ``The result
is that kids play alone, and this lack of socialization has a lot
to do with the rise in crime by youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming more and more difficult for kids to live
socially, understanding the feelings of others, so they turn
inwards. At some point, though, society makes it impossible for
them to preserve their isolation, and the result is a sudden show
of emotion and eruptions of violence, either verbal or physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Using different words, the reform school student told much the
same story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to reject contact with my family,'' he said. ``I
never used to express my true feelings to other people. Until I got
in trouble I would either keep them to myself or tell
straight-faced lies. It wasn't until after I came in here that I
realized how self-centered I had become.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Alabama polls open as state lottery hangs in balance
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Whether Alabama voters today approve a
statewide lottery referendum may depend on Chevy church vans and
BellSouth phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're suggesting our churches run their vans and pick up
people that want to vote,'' Joe Bob Mizzell, director of Christian
ethics for the Alabama Baptist Convention, said Monday. He then
joined a prayer vigil on the steps of the state Capitol to oppose
the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The key for both sides is voter turnout, forecast at a
remarkable 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking church members to divide their rolls and call 10
people each and remind them to vote,'' Mizzell said. ``I don't have
any polling that supports this, but my gut feeling is that it's
dead-even _ we may even be ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently have shown voters favor the lottery in
Alabama, a state surrounded by lotteries. Don Siegelman was elected
governor last November on the promise of starting an education
lottery that would fund HOPE scholarships similar to Georgia's.
</P>
<P>
   Barraged by advertising for and against the lottery, more
election-eve poll respondents are saying they haven't made up their
minds. In a survey Thursday by the Alabama Education Association,
which favors the lottery, 49 percent said they'd vote for the
lottery, 35 percent said they are against and 15 percent said they
are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Johnson, pollster for the AEA, reasoned the undecided
numbers have climbed because of the advertising deluge. He said
``undecideds'' typically drop by election eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really tells me that some folks are just hopping on
`Don't Know' because they don't want to say,'' Johnson said. ``They
don't want to be verbally punched by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   For lottery advocates, black voters may be the most critical
group. The anti-lottery faction will be relying on white,
Protestant churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Johnson there is strong pro-lottery sentiment
across gender, race, party and income lines. Alabamians who said
they go, those who went to church frequently represented the only
demographic group that opposed the lottery.,.
</P>
<P>
   In AEA polling last week, 30 percent of those surveyed said they
went to church more than once a week. Of that group, 51 percent
opposed the lottery while 44 percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an upset if the lottery lost,'' Johnson said.

SERB OPPOSITION BOYCOTTS EUROPEAN UNION SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Leaders of the Serbian opposition to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia found themselves
criticized on two fronts Monday. They angered the European Union by
boycotting a meeting to protest its demand to extradite Milosevic
for war crimes, while Milosevic himself called them cowards,
sycophants and traitors.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, already facing dwindling turnouts at its nightly
rallies, is used to harsh criticism from the Milosevic government.
But some opposition leaders said privately Monday night that they
were upset that the European Union had put them in such a difficult
political position by demanding that they support a resolution that
would call for the extradition of Milosevic, who has been indicted
for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leaders say they want to concentrate on trying to
oust Milosevic rather than being asked to hand him over like a war
trophy to the countries that bombed Serbia less than six months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for the Hague tribunal issue to be imposed as
a priority,'' said a leader of the Alliance for Change, Vladan
Batic. ``This nation still cares about its national identity.
Milosevic should be tried in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   But discussions with European Union diplomats in Belgrade on
Sunday night did not achieve an acceptable compromise, so leaders
of the main Serbian opposition parties refused to go to a meeting
Monday in Luxembourg. Officials from Serbia's sister republic,
Montenegro, attended, as did Vuk Obradovic, head of the small
opposition Social Democracy Party, and Nenad Canak, who runs an
opposition party in Vojvodina, the northern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In Luxembourg, European Union foreign ministers hoped to make
``a new beginning'' with Serbia by providing about $5 million in
heating oil, despite American reservations. The first shipment
would be to two opposition-run towns in southern Serbia, Nis and
Pirot.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of this ``Energy for Democracy'' program is to try to
show Serbs that the West is opposed to the Milosevic government but
not to ordinary citizens, who face a very cold winter with few
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration fears, though, that Milosevic will
siphon off the aid or claim credit for it. Privately, some U.S.
officials say a cold and hungry population is more likely to try to
overthrow Milosevic, which remains the United States' top policy
goal in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But European leaders think that the U.S. approach is too crude
and that a faltering opposition here needs to show voters that it
can provide the fuel and food they need with Western support _
benefits that the isolated Milosevic cannot match.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders helped come up with the Energy for Democracy
plan to demonstrate that they are likely to be able to deliver
prosperity if Milosevic is removed from power. The opposition
favors a wider lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia, arguing
that Milosevic uses them as an alibi for the increasing poverty and
desperation of ordinary life here.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Milosevic did Monday in a rare speech in Leskovac,
as he presided over the reopening of a railway station on a line
badly damaged by NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the last decade was refugees, sanctions,
earthquakes and floods,'' Milosevic said in a speech shown often on
Monday on national television. ``Still, we remained on our feet and
showed the whole world how to defend the fatherland, how the
country can be defended and rebuilt.''
</P>
<P>
   His government has contrasted its efforts to reconstruct the
country with the rallies by the opposition, which state media call
``the Alliance for NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are mainly cowards, blackmailers and
sycophants,'' Milosevic said. ``They do not take part in the
reconstruction, but with rocks in their hands and with words they
learned in the offices of our murderers, threaten to destroy what
we have defended from NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic accused the opposition of wanting ``civil war'' in an
effort to create a pro-Western colony led by ``a local traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   And he challenged the opposition to prove its support in federal
and local elections that are to be held next year _ elections that
would not affect his own position.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, with its rallies faltering, is moving toward a
demand for early elections in the next three months, but under
conditions that would include international supervision and open
access to television and radio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The European Union meeting was something of an embarrassment
because of the boycott of the opposition leaders the Europeans were
trying to help. The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said,
``The decision, as I understand it, is not theirs but imposed on
them by Milosevic, who has told them they will be guilty of treason
to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Batic and other opposition leaders, including representatives of
the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic and the Serbian Renewal
Movement of Vuk Draskovic, had objected to the draft European Union
declaration in the meetings over two days, saying it would be
politically damaging to agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats here suggested that it was at the United
States' insistence that the European Union made such a point, in
the draft declaration, of cooperation with the International
Tribunal in The Hague. This was a way of getting the United States
to go along, however grudgingly, with the Energy for Democracy
program, one diplomat suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also trying to press the democratic
opposition in Serbia to be bolder and more outspoken in its
resistance to Milosevic _ ``to prove that they really are a
democratic opposition,'' a NATO-country diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But another Western diplomat here, not from a NATO country,
said: ``The demand to commit to extradition puts the opposition in
a totally false position, especially when they are so divided and
weak. They have a lot of other problems to worry about, without
being made to seem unpatriotic or craven.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Zivkovic, mayor of Nis and a vice president of the
Democratic Party, said: ``Thirty hours before the meeting, a
document is circulated which is supposed to be the result of a
meeting with us. This is a principle which is unacceptable.''
Zivkovic is considered one of the opposition's most effective
leaders, and his city, Nis, would be one of the first beneficiaries
of the oil deliveries.

 &HT;    Vanity Fair puts new spin on Rockwell
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks of the Saturday Evening Post illustrator as a
portrayer of corny Americana may see him in a new light after
reading the Vanity Fair ($3.95) excerpt from ``Norman Rockwell:
Pictures for the American People.'' Published to coincide with the
touring Rockwell exhibit that opens at Atlanta's High Museum in
November, writer Dave Hickey explains that Rockwell was a more
important and complex artist than his detractors will admit. His
paintings were not intended to be nostalgic, Hickey notes, but
rather moments captured in time before they faded. ``The kids in
Norman Rockwell's America always grow up,'' Hickey writes. ``I
imagine the `Girl With Black Eye,' who sits grinning outside the
principal's office, a decade later burning her bra. I imagine the
kids in `After the Prom' sitting around the campfire in some
commune in New Mexico trying to recapture the golden glow of that
night at the soda fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other articles of note are Judith Newman's insightful profile of
Viacom chief Sumner Redstone, who took a handful of movie theaters
and turned them into a media empire; Tom Hanks' tribute to Gary
Cooper; Steve Daly's attempt to get inside Jim Carrey's head; and
Annie Leibovitz's photographs of four decades of Bond girls.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kid stuff: They're too old for sandboxes but too young to be
called teens. Newsweek ($3.50) labels them Tweens in an interesting
cover story about the generation of kids ages 8 to 14. A retailer's
dream, these are the repeat moviegoers who kept ``Titanic'' afloat
for months, snap up CDs by the Backstreet Boys and Ricky Martin,
and spend 300 percent more than their group did a decade ago. A
helpful sidebar explains how parents can cope with mounting
pressures on their Tweens.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More kid stuff: Some Tweens and former Tweens are wildly
successful before their time. In its Next Generation issue, The New
Yorker ($3) profiles 29-year-old Tennessee congressman Harold Ford
Jr., 11-year-old soccer prodigy Vincenzo Sarno, 8-year-old chess
whiz David Howell, 19-year-old golf sensation Sergio Garcia and six
other up-and-comers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Terminator talks: Part of the reason for Tina Brown's
success at Vanity Fair and The New Yorker was her ability to mix
celebrities and politics with culture and gossip in the same
magazine. She's attempting the same formula at Talk ($3.50) with
some degree of success. The November issue features a lengthy cover
story on Arnold Schwarzenegger, in which the action film star hints
at a political future; an assessment of John McCain that praises
him as a man and damns him as a candidate; and a conversation with
Oliver Stone about his new film, ``Any Given Sunday.'' The most
shameless piece of puffery in the magazine is Douglas Brinkley's
profile of Al Gore. Lauding the vice president for his decision to
go to Vietnam, Brinkley attempts to make Gore's stint as a
journalist seem as dangerous as being a helicopter tail-gunner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  True hominy: Grits, that ubiquitous Southern breakfast staple,
have gone uptown. In a tasty history of grits, Smithsonian ($3)
writer Tim Warren found them served with spicy shrimp and tasso
gravy at elegant restaurants such as Magnolias in Charleston, S.C.
Warren, however, prefers his the old-fashioned way _ mixed with
bits of over-easy eggs and sausage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Influence List: In compiling a list of the most powerful
people in the media, the editors of Brill's Content ($3.95) make an
interesting point: Three decades ago, when there was no CNN and no
Internet, such a list would have included the editors of a few
major newspapers, Time and Newsweek, and perhaps the editor of
Vogue or Cosmopolitan. So who's on the list this year? Not
surprisingly, CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, New York Times
executive editor Joseph Lelyveld, and talk-show host Oprah Winfrey
are among the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His Bradness: No, Brad Pitt is not in drag in the new Rolling
Stone ($3). He's just, well, wearing dresses. It was Pitt's idea to
do the photo shoot as a contrast to his shaved head and
chipped-tooth appearance in his film ``The Fight Club.'' Says
photographer Mark Seliger: ``With Brad, you can't get strange
enough.''

 &HT;    Authorities, media waits for Ramsey grand jury decision
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The JonBenet Ramsey grand jury reconvenes
today, and with expectations high that a decision could come at any
time, a media storm is blowing into this place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scrambling,'' said CNN producer Betty Anderson,
predicting that when the eight women and four more walk into the
Boulder Justice Center today, they will pass through a gauntlet of
more than 100 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not happen today, she said, but speculation says
this time will be remembered as ``The Week That Was.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking is backed by the fact that the grand jury that has
met for over a year on a nearly three-year-old murder, ends its
term Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are filling up with news crews; reporters who arrived in
town Monday had to find rooms outside the city. The networks have
had crews stationed here for months, but now they've set up
elaborate command centers in the local Marriott Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   NBC-NET is hold up in the top of a bank building. ABC, NBC, FOX
have all been ``wiring'' the place for some time, finding the best
sites for live shots, building sources - all for the murder of one
little blond girl in an otherwise small, quiet hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   The mass popularity and undying attention to the story confounds
many residents of the town. Many want to put the whole thing behind
Boulder, believing it has not portrayed the city in a good, or even
accurate light.
</P>
<P>
   ``JonBenet put Boulder on the map, but it's a sad way to be put
on the map,'' said Julia Wrapp, who works in a small book store on
Pearl Street, a quaint stretch of shops and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety may well peak today with a grand jury decision.
Talk around Media Town is that the grand jury may not wait until
the last day to issue its verdict. It can either chose to indict
one or more people, chose not to and issue a report on their probe,
or simply do nothing, say nothing and walk away from the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous, to spend all this time on a story about these
wealthy people,'' said John Putnam, 39, who owns a local car
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the media has rarely strayed from its coverage of the
JonBenet murder mystery. It has defined a new kind of story that
appeals both to the tabloids as well as the mainstream media. If
the O.J. Simpson story was the first block buster of this kind,
then JonBenet is its steam roller.
</P>
<P>
   The news has sometimes made Boulder look bad. The accusations of
blunders in the cases, as well as the well-publicized infighting
between the police and the District attorneys office, have been
harsh. Meanwhile, the media has noted that since Dec. 26, 1996
murder, the leadership level of the Boulder Police Department has
turned into a black whole. The police chief and several top
investigators on the case have left the department.
</P>
<P>
   The slightest hiccup of news has drawn media out of the Boulder
woodwork. JonBenet has been on scores of tabloid magazine covers,
and four times the story has appeared on the cover of People
magazine. The 6-year-old with the China Doll face and the cascades
of blond curls, a former Miss Colorado, has fueled debates on child
abuse, the controversy over tiny-tot beauty pageants, and the
treatment of the wealthy when they come under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention will flare again today in Boulder, a
community tucked between the Rocky Mountains and the yellow plains
where little grows, between a rock and a hard place.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are bracing for a wave of reporters and satellite
trucks. Even Monday, a holiday when the jury stayed at home, CNN
made sure to have one crew in front of the Justice Center and
another outside the front door, just in case. This morning, the
yellow tape will go up to mark off the parking spots for the grand
jurors and security staff will remind the camera crews to stay at
least 25 feet away from the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's disgusting,'' said longtime Boulder resident Ed
Amarant, 54. ``The media these days. They blow everything out of
proportion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At Hamilton High School, a grand old building in a
gritty slice of West Los Angeles, Ruth J. Simmons surveyed a
roomful of 35 black and brown female faces and saw her own.
</P>
<P>
   Striding through the Hamilton library, with its posters of Oprah
Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg announcing ``Reading is Power'' in
Spanish and English, Simmons shook each hand and introduced herself
as the president of Smith College. ``You're the president?'' one
girl asked, incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Jackie Robinson of higher education when she became
the first black woman to head a top-tier college or university in
1995, Simmons has embarked upon what she calls a ``personal
crusade'' to bring more disadvantaged students to her campus and
similar institutions nationwide. The 12th child of a sharecropper
turned factory worker who grew up in a Houston home with neither
books nor desk, Simmons is stepping out of the ivory tower to
recruit personally at vast urban public schools like Hamilton, a
rarity for a college president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in the door, I thought, `This is home,' I
recognized where I was,'' she said of Hamilton, a place with bars
on the windows and where SAT scores average 944 (Smith students'
are typically in the 1200s). ``One of the reasons I talk to
students is because I want them to know a president looks like
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies suggest that graduates of elite universities like
Smith have formed the backbone of the black and Hispanic middle
class, but administrators at such schools have largely hit a wall
in their efforts to lure more minorities. Now, even as the legal
and political attacks on race-based admission have intensified,
leaders of private colleges and universities are seeking innovative
ways to attract not only the most successful minority students but
also those from low-performing schools who lack the traditional
preparation for competitive campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a struggle,'' said Gregory S. Prince Jr., the president
of Hampshire College and the head of a five-college coalition in
Western Massachusetts that includes Smith. ``What you have to do is
find ways to make them aware that you exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of African-American and Hispanic students
pursuing higher education has swelled in recent years, their
presence in selective schools has remained flat. At Smith, about 4
percent of the 2,800 undergraduates are black, 4 percent Hispanic,
and 12 percent Asian-American. The faculty is even less racially
mixed, with just seven Asian-Americans, nine African-Americans and
three Hispanics among 244 full-time instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are trying, but it just hasn't worked so far,''
said Tory Shelley, 19, a sophomore who is one of two Hamilton High
graduates enrolled at Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Still trying to overcome a reputation as a finishing school for
the future wives of the rich and powerful, Smith, founded in 1871,
faces multiple barriers to recruiting minority students. Many are
put off by the notion of a single-sex school (someone at Hamilton
used the word ``convent''). Tuition, room and board total $30,442
(56 percent of students get financial aid). Its pristine campus is
nestled in Northampton, Mass., a tiny town where black churches _
or hairstylists who know how to care for African-American hair _
are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   So Smith has tried to sell itself to minority applicants with
special campus visits, it has started a scholarship for inner-city
students in Springfield, Mass., and it has admitted a dozen
first-year students with lower-than-normal grades and test scores,
bringing them to campus a month early for extra help. To prime the
pump, it has also established partnerships with the Harlem School
for Girls and with community colleges in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Other top-flight schools are taking similar steps. Princeton
University has replaced student loans with extra grants for
families whose incomes hover below the national average (this year,
$42,000). Hampshire created the James Baldwin scholarships for high
school dropouts who have earned their GED. The former president of
Dartmouth College, James O. Freedman, said he tried to send a
message by giving honorary degrees to prominent black and Hispanic
scholars _ one recent recipient was Ruth Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   At Smith, students and professors say the president's presence
is as effective as any program. The class of 2003 has 32
African-American women, up from about 20 in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have to be speaking about diversity,'' said
Katrina Gardner, 22, the president of the Smith student government.
``You look at her, and it's like, wow, that's who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisha Smith, a 20-year-old junior from Tupelo, Miss., who is
president of the Black Student Alliance, said it could be
uncomfortable being the only nonwhite person in a class, ``and you
try to answer questions, and people automatically think you're
wrong, or act like they didn't hear you.''
</P>
<P>
   The small cadre of black students often feels pressured to
educate the white majority on issues of race, she said, but many
have sought refuge in Simmons' weekly office hours, and have become
frequent dinner guests in her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is a matter of national interest, a matter of
national salvation,'' Simmons said of her efforts, which include
convening a conference on race this fall and starting a journal,
Meridians, focusing on minority women. ``Bringing poor people from
the margin into the mainstream is what we're best at, what we're
known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said she focused on fund-raising and pure academic
programs during her first four years at Smith to win over alumnae
who were quietly skeptical of the prospect of a black president.
She has garnered national attention by establishing the first-ever
engineering program at a women's college, instituting a
curriculum-wide focus ic speaking and providing a paid
internship for every undergraduate. In March, she spoke at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's profile has swelled alongside Simmons', as has its
endowment, to $862 million from $507 million. Now, with her smart
suits and fat Smithie pearls, Simmons skates seamlessly through a
sea of white faces at alumnae events, receiving kudos from
well-coiffed older women and tattooed young feminists alike.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception at the Jonathan Club here, whose wood-paneled
walls are as much an Ivy League atmosphere as Los Angeles has to
offer, a woman from the class of '38 exulted that the college
president back then had a white beard, and ``now we have this
beautiful woman.'' A 1990 graduate said she was thrilled with
Simmons' appointment because she, too, had been a scholarship
student. A member of the class of 1998 embraced her like a favorite
aunt, then proudly said she was working at the Rancho Santiago
Community College District in Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send us some students,'' Simmons replied.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   At Hamilton, where about 60 percent of the 2,850 students pursue
higher education, the vast majority at two-year schools, Simmons
spoke of the glories of a liberal arts education, urging the girls
to seek exotic opportunities rather than staying close to home and
taking classes at a community college.
</P>
<P>
   She told them that when she was their age, she did not see
herself as college material. She acknowledged that she had been
terrified to leave her family when she went to Dillard University
in New Orleans (and later to Harvard).
</P>
<P>
   She told the students they were beautiful, and she begged them
not to be afraid to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize in them what I was as a child,'' she said later.
``Somebody comes along and says to you one day, `Guess what, I see
something in you.' I remember when that happened for me as if it
were yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls, who are enrolled in a program called College
Pathways, which helps students less likely to go to college chart a
course to higher education, responded with a mix of wide-eyed hope
and new confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a colored woman,'' Tia Smith, 15, said simply, ``and I
can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the bell had rung and the school buses pulled away,
Aleshia Williams remained in the library, pondering her prospects
for attending Smith, a leafy campus 3,000 miles away that she had
not even heard of an hour before.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old sophomore had exchanged phone numbers with the
president and vowed to keep in touch. They were two black women
whose parents never finished high school, one dreaming of becoming
what the other was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to go to college. I want to go, I want to
make a change,'' Aleshia said. ``Maybe I can be president of a
college one day. Maybe I can take her place.'' &QL;

FUGITIVE MOGUL WHO HEADED MGM IS ARRESTED IN ITALY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Calif., Conn., Italy, France, Germany)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Giancarlo Parretti, a flamboyant former Hollywood mogul
with longstanding international arrest warrants hanging over him
for convictions on perjury and other frauds, was arrested Monday
near Orvieto, a medieval hilltop town about 70 miles north of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Parretti, 58, an Italian financier who engineered a $1.3 billion
takeover of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. in 1990 and was later accused
of nearly driving it into financial ruin, was taken into custody by
Italian police while at a weight-loss farm outside Orvieto, his
Italian lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Orvieto police, who arrested Parretti on a request for
extradition from the United States, said a court in Orvieto must
decide within the next 96 hours whether Parretti may be detained
until a hearing can be held on the merits of the extradition
request.
</P>
<P>
   Manlio Morcella, Parretti's lawyer, said by telephone that the
court could order Parretti held if it suspected he might flee, a
suspicion he said would be ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   The police had first rung the bell of Parretti's home in
Orvieto, where he had been living apparently unnoticed in Italy's
olive-growing region, before they were alerted to his exact
whereabouts. Their relatively easy apprehension of the fugitive
financier, Morcella said, made it ``absurd'' to believe he would
seek flight.
</P>
<P>
   Parretti's arrest comes about one month after German police
arrested Martin Frankel, a secretive Connecticut money manager whom
the American authorities have accused of embezzling large sums of
money from insurance companies. Frankel is in a Hamburg jail
awaiting possible extradition.
</P>
<P>
   But while Frankel had been the target of a four-month
trans-Atlantic manhunt, Parretti had been on the run for almost
three years. He fled the United States for Italy before he could be
sentenced on a conviction of perjury and tampering with evidence in
a Delaware court.
</P>
<P>
   Parretti is also sought for extradition by the French, after a
court in Paris convicted him in March on corruption charges and
sentenced him in absentia to four years in prison and a $165,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how Parretti fled the United States remains a mystery.
It also was still unclear Monday night how long Italian police had
been hunting for Parretti or when the United States had sought his
extradition. But by skipping the country, he joined a band of rogue
financiers like Marc D. Rich and Robert Vesco.
</P>
<P>
   The ins and outs of Parretti's legal scuffles on both sides of
the Atlantic could provide grist for a John Grisham novel. For one
thing is certain: Parretti left behind legal battles in several
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1990, Parretti had acquired MGM, with help from
loans raised by the big French bank, Credit Lyonnais, which was
later crushed by billions of dollars of bad debt and had to be
bailed out by the French government. Within months of Parretti's
purchase of MGM, its creditors went to court complaining that they
were not getting paid.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Credit Lyonnais removed Parretti from
MGM's board, accusing him of gross mismanagement, and had its
action validated by a state court in Delaware, where MGM is
incorporated. After a litany of lawsuits and countersuits Parretti
was convicted in 1996 in Delaware of perjury and tampering with
evidence in the court trial in which Credit Lyonnais asserted its
control of MGM. But before Parretti could be sentenced, he fled the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in a case before a federal court in California,
Parretti had been seeking to avoid extradition to France to face
criminal charges there that he had looted Credit Lyonnais. In
seeking to avoid extradition to France, Parretti had posted bail in
California.
</P>
<P>
   One condition of the bail agreement was that if Parretti jumped
bail, he could be ruled in default in yet a third lawsuit, a civil
case inyet another California court. In that suit, Parretti and
Credit Lyonnais were suing each other over his dismissal from MGM's
board. In 1997, the judge in that case ruled for Credit Lyonnais,
citing the bail condition and Parretti's fugitive status. It
ordered Parretti to pay Credit Lyonnais damages totaling $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jay M. Coggan, an attorney in Beverly Hills, who represented
Parretti in the Delaware case, said the court in Delaware was
``extremely interested in his return.''
</P>
<P>
   Coggan said he received inquiries from the court about every
three months regarding Parretti's whereabouts. He said that, by
court order, he remained Parretti's attorney in Delaware.

 &HT;    Crowded world for No. 6 billion
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the 6 billionth inhabitant of planet Earth, born today
according to U.N. estimates, a hearty welcome to our world, and
good luck!
</P>
<P>
   You will need lots of the latter. U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan symbolically picked a baby in Sarajevo to be No. 6 billion,
but you could have just as easily been born in any one of scores of
impoverished nations, since that's where population growth remains
most explosive. That puts you at a disadvantage from Moment One of
your life.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be born in Sierra Leone, your life expectancy
will be less than 40 years. If you start life as an Afghan, you
will be vulnerable to disease from a lack of safe drinking water
and sanitation. If you're a girl in Yemen, you probably will get no
schooling. If you're a Bolivian, you're likely to grow up
malnourished. In fact, 3 billion people get less protein in their
daily diet than the average American house cat.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for scarce resources will be keener as you grow up.
Demographers worry that today's billion-plus crop of young people
ages 15-24, the largest of its kind in history, could make past
baby booms pale by comparison, and your group, ages 0-15, is larger
still, numbering 1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   You and your brothers and sisters have to strike a balance with
nature. More and more of you are competing for freshwater supplies
that have remained relatively constant for the last 5,000 years.
Most land that is suitable for farming is under cultivation. All
the world's fisheries are being exploited at or beyond sustainable
levels. Every 20 minutes, another species of plant or animal
becomes extinct.
</P>
<P>
   What's to be done if you and your generation are to have a
chance at a decent life? Today's adults have to make wise
decisions. Make family planning information and materials more
widely available. Invest more in economic development and public
health. Give girls the same chance at education as boys. All of
these are proven methods to promote population stability.
</P>
<P>
   You should know the richest, most powerful country in the world
is frittering away its leadership on this crucial issue because
many in its Congress don't think spending public funds for family
planning overseas is a priority matter. Oh, Congress did pass a
scaled-down $25 million contribution to the U.N. Population Fund
for that purpose, but even that could be lost in end-of-session
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   Pray, little one, that the world's decision-makers come to
understand the gravity of your plight, and please scoot over a bit
to make way for No. 6,000,000,001.

   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ A British man with a crisp accent, loafers,
khakis, Oxford shirt, and navy crewneck sweater stood questioning a
Wampanoag Indian accessorized with animal skins, bear claw
necklace, and soapstone pipe. The British man fingered the other's
necklace and posed such questions about tribal life as ``how common
is intermarriage?''
</P>
<P>
   Although he appeared to be just another European tourist
strolling blithely through an American historical site Monday,
Winston S. Churchill was on an oddly personal journey when he
peppered Native American staff with questions at Plimoth
Plantation. The grandson of the great prime minister was peering
into dark huts and ship cabins in search of clues to his own family
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Sir Winston Churchill before him, Churchill clings to
an old family belief that the clan has Native American ancestry.
Churchill has also recently concluded that his family tree boasts
three ancestors who sailed on the Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   Historians cast a skeptical eye on both notions, but Churchill's
quest on ``this side of the pond,'' as he put it, offers insight
into a colorful trans-Atlantic family and the question of how it
produced one of the century's most influential men.
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, the 59-year-old former Conservative Party
member of Parliament has an attachment to the United States that is
both pragmatic and romantic. Sir Winston, who lived from 1874 to
1965, needed American help to fight Nazi Germany. Young Winston, as
the British press still calls him, wants to sell copies of ``The
Great Republic: A History of America,'' his just-published
compilation of the prime minister's writings about America.
</P>
<P>
   The two Churchills have both loved the United States for its
youthful vitality, the spirit that arguably saved the world from
tyranny in World War II. The elder Churchill, historians say,
cherished his American heritage as much as his British blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather would have been enormously proud to think he
had in his veins the blood of those who founded America,''
Churchill said. ``The whole theme of his life was the unity of the
Anglo-American peoples.g as we stand shoulder-to-shoulder
together, there's no trial we can't survive and overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill scholar Scott Steward suggests that, ultimately, the
Winston who is alive today is seeking to explain Sir Winston's
genius as genetic destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elder Winston Churchill felt he'd gotten a tremendous
boost from the mixture of his American and English ancestry,'' said
Steward, editor of NEXUS, a journal published by the New England
Historic Genealogical Society. ``There was this idea that tired,
old Europe could use a boost from these American heiresses who were
coming over to Europe to produce a new race of stronger, better
Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill belongs to a noble line of Englishmen descended from
the first duke of Marlborough, an 18th century war hero. Sir
Winston's mother, the glamorous and beautiful Jennie Jerome, came
not from nobility but from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``On his father's side, Winston Churchill is from a very grand
family, so it's interesting that they are quite enthusiastic about
the American ancestry,'' Steward said. ``The reason has to be that
they are finding in it an explanation for the achievements of
Winston Churchill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Winston still inspires awe: indefatigable, Cassandra-like in
his warnings to a complacent Britain about the danger posed by the
Nazis, able to unite the free world in wartime with his graceful
words and bold vision.
</P>
<P>
   Was Sir Winston's greatness an accident of birth or just a
function of his time? It is tempting for his family, Steward said,
to believe his mixed-up genes coded for genius, just as
horsebreeders believe that crossing breeds creates a special horse.
</P>
<P>
   The theory ``is a very simple way to lay claim to, if not
destiny, then sense,'' Steward said. ``It's coherent. It's hardly
surprising that there's always a search for meaning and the simpler
and more elegant, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   That Jennie Jerome had Iroquois blood is ``a long and deeply
entrenched family tradition,'' Churchill said Monday. Her mother
and grandmother had dark, exotic features, and the younger
Churchill offers a portrait of Sir Winston's grandmother as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got red Indian written all over her face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill is ignoring birth records, tombstones, and other
documents that discount the theory, said historian Elizabeth Snell,
author of ``The Churchills: Pioneers and Politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These ideas are romantic, and, I think, politically correct,''
Snell said.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not historically verifiable, she said. ``It's
timely to believe in this Native American connection. What young
Winston is trying to do here, he's trying to make every American
connection there is. Any author would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill traces his family lineage back to the Mayflower
through Elizabeth Cooke, granddaughter of a Mayflower voyager, who
married Daniel Wilcox, one of Jennie Jerome's ancestors. According
to Snell and Steward, however, Cooke was Wilcox's second wife,
while the Jeromes descend from his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Jerome-Churchills come to the Mayflower, Snell
said, is probably through an ancestor, Arthur Howland, whose
brother is recorded as a passenger. Howland himself is not known to
have been on board that famous vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It is known when the great prime minister himself first crossed
the Atlantic. It was 1895, and a 21-year-old Churchill developed an
instant admiration for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great, crude, strong, young people are the Americans, like a
boisterous healthy boy among enervated but well-bred ladies and
gentlemen,'' he wrote in a letter, according to William
Manchester's biography, ``The Last Lion.'' ``What an extraordinary
people the Americans are! . . . They make you feel at home and at
ease in a way that I have never before experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Winston shares his grandfather's enthusiasm,
remarking in his memoirs, ``It is one of the nicest qualities of an
American, that he is easy to make friends with.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, the younger Churchill has been a
journalist, writer, and politician. He served as a Tory member of
Parliament from 1970 to 1997, though he never achieved high office.
Both had to contend with famous, if remote, parents. Young
Winston's were Randolph Churchill, a tempestuous alcoholic, and
Pamela Harriman, former US ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, by all accounts, lacks his grandfather's spark of
genius. Politically, he is best known for embarrassing his party in
1993 when he called for a halt to ``the relentless flow of
immigrants to this country'' and contended, erroneously, that some
British cities had a minority population greater than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his concerns about immigration, Winston S. Churchill
believes, like his grandfather, that America can only enrich his
own country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, President John F. Kennedy awarded Sir Winston Churchill
the rare distinction of an honorary American citizenship. In reply,
Churchill wrote of his great satisfaction with ``the interwoven and
upward progress of our peoples,'' even ``in this century of storm
and tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood together,'' Churchill continued, ``and because of
that fact the free world now stands.''

JURY'S OUT: `JUDGING AMY' OR `ONCE AND AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Networks view a downward trend in the ratings with the sort of
sweaty-browed dread reserved for a plague of addled critics or a
complaint from the NAACP. And after only two ratings periods in
this new season, ``Once and Again,'' the sterling drama about
divorced parents, ABC was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In its first week, ``Once and Again'' finished in the Nielsen
top 10. The second week, it dropped to No. 21. Meanwhile, CBS's
``Judging Amy,'' which goes head to head with ``Once and Again'' on
Tuesdays nights, is causing ABC execs to pop a few Zantacs. After a
very strong preview showing on Sunday, Sept. 19, ``Judging Amy''
got clobbered in its first head-to-head matchup with ``Once and
Again'' on Sept. 21. But just the reverse happened the next week.
While the Sept. 28 episode of ``Once and Again'' slipped out of the
top 20, ``Judging Amy'' rebounded all the way to No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The results of week three won't be known till later Tuesday, but
the trendlet presented by just two weeks of airings was sufficient
to have an ABC publicist call last week and suggest that ``Once and
Again'' could use my help.
</P>
<P>
   Moi? I'm not disposed to treating ABC generously, given how it
has treated good shows such as ``Nothing Sacred,'' ``Relativity''
and ``Sports Night.'' But if there's a chance that my mentioning it
will keep ``Once and Again'' on the schedule for a few years _ or
another week _ then call me Mr. Shill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' is the sort of TV show that makes a viewer
forget it's on TV. The writing _ not artificially writerly like
Kevin Williamson's, not eagerly precocious like David E. Kelley's _
connects without resorting to coyness and pretension. And the
acting of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell makes one appreciate
television as theater-in-a-box, not mindless entertainment to
accompany one's folding of the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's episode is the strongest to date, with Rick
Sammler (Campbell) and Lily Manning (Ward) coming to understand
that their blossoming romance, which they continue to pursue like
adolescents in heat, is having an impact well beyond the mussed
sheets of each passionate rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Where all this takes them is part of the appeal of the stories
spun so realistically by creators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward
Zwick, who kept ``thirtysomething'' going for four seasons. But
therein may lie a problem if America is indeed forsaking the
reality of ``Once and Again'' for the feel-goodness of ``Judging
Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans stung by divorce, ``Once and Again'' may be
too real. ``Judging Amy,'' also about a woman coping with single
parenthood, is sappier and less jarring. But if that relegates
``Once and Again'' to a lower (but still comfy) rung on the Nielsen
ladder, ABC owes it to us and the industry to worry less about
ratings and more about keeping such quality on the air.

 &HT;    Let the banter begin! Braves, Mets talk it up
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been three years since the Braves had their
hearts stomped on in New York City. They surrendered the World
Series to the Yankees in 1996 after taking a 2-0 lead as commanding
as they come.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't been back to the World Series since. And they won't
this time, if this other team from New York fresh from the point of
no return has anything to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets blaze into town for the start of the National League
Championship series tonight on the momentum of their wild-card
revival and the bravado of their manager.
</P>
<P>
   The latest from Bobby Valentine is that the Braves haven't shown
the Mets the proper respect.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox, for one, considers Valentine's
contention to be ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke, the lack-of-respect angle,'' Cox said. ``Of
course they are a great team. Of course they've got our respect.
They're good guys. I like them _ I don't post anything on our
board. You either come to play baseball or you come to talk. And
you better come to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have done that against the Mets all season, winning
nine of the 12 meetings. By beating them in five of six games in
the final 10 days of the season, the Braves broke open an otherwise
tight NL East race and left the Mets scrambling for a wild-card
berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets came back from two games down with three to play in the
season by sweeping the Pirates. Then they beat the Reds in a
one-game playoff and took the Arizona Diamondbacks in the Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   They're back.
</P>
<P>
   But so are the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   They have made eight consecutive trips to the National League
Championship Series. They have met seven different teams there.
Asked what they had learned from back-to-back NLCS losses to the
Marlins and the Padres, Chipper Jones responded, ``It (stinks) to
lose that early.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been hearing a lot from the Mets' fans, who have been
blistering him with off-color language every trip to the plate.
They had grown to hate Jones those three days in Atlanta when he
homered four times during the Braves' sweep to nearly ended the
Mets' division title hopes single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of Shea Stadium after the Braves won two out of
three in New York a week later, Jones shot some parting words back
at the Mets fans. He suggested that they go home and put on their
Yankees gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a very mature statement,'' Valentine said
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of a shot at the fans than it was their ball
club,'' Jones said. ``Bobby can turn it around any way he wants.
The last thing I want is to get in a newspaper-reading war with
Bobby Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's what Valentine is looking for, maybe he's going after
the wrong guy. Young Braves closer John Rocker already had some
words he thought were said privately _ that he hated the Mets _ run
across the top of a New York tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a news conference Monday about his thoughts on the
Mets, Rocker said: ``There are a few. Which ones I should voice,
I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   So he began politically with talk of the seven .300 hitters in
the Mets lineup. Then he covered their overall talent, how he
thought it was superior to the Braves and how he was surprised the
Mets had to squeak into the playoffs. And then it seeped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat them nine out of 12 games,'' Rocker said. ``I don't
see how Valentine can say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rocker had something to say about respect as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for the Mets,'' Rocker said. ``All
the games were hard fought games, 2-1, 3-2. I think just as we have
respect for them, I don't think Bobby Valentine has much respect
for us. You may not like us, you might think you can beat us, but
at least have respect for the other team. I don't see that kind of
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in all of the talking are the usual October questions for
the Braves about pressure, about going to eight National League
Championship Series in a row and winning only one World Series
ring. Ironically, it might be just the mental diversion the Braves
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any pressure,'' Jones said. ``The way I see it,
we've been playing the role of underdogs all year, since all the
injuries came up. People expect us to be here, but they don't
expect us to win. So we'll go out, play hard, keep our mouths shut
and play baseball.''

WALKING TOURS OF BERLIN  
 RENTING A WARDROBE TRUNK  
 QUANTAS OF MADEIRA  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: (AT) should be replaced with the symbol)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I expect to be in Berlin this fall and would like to find a
walking tour that focuses on architecture. It could be in a group
or self guided, but must be in English. _ Marjory A. Simon, Rye
Brook, N.Y. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A: There are at least a couple of ways to get a tour of the
architecture of Berlin, where building has been booming since the
nation's reunification and the city's designation as the new German
capital.
</P>
<P>
   One way to see much of this change is with Berlin Walks, a
company run by an expatriate Briton, Nick Gay. He uses a team of
seven guides, he said, all of whom are native English speakers who
have been living in Berlin for some time. Berlin Walks offers four
regular tours, and Gay said the one that would probably best suit
you is ``Discover Berlin.''  &UR;  &LR;  This three-hour tour visits sites of
historical importance, Gay said, but it also takes note of new
development. Among the stops are the New Synagogue, the TV tower on
Alexanderplatz, Museum Island, Unter den Linden, the War Memorial,
the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Wall and the Museum at
Checkpoint Charlie. The tour takes public trains twice and covers
about two and a half miles on foot, Gay said.
</P>
<P>
   This tour is offered daily at 10 a.m. and, from April through
October, again at 2:30 p.m. It leaves from the taxi stand at the
Zoo Station; look for the sign over the taxi stand and the guides
wearing Berlin Walks badges. The cost is $10, or $7.75 for ages 25
and under, at the rate of 1.8 marks to the dollar. The train
tickets _ about $2.15 _ can be bought from the guide. Reservations
are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   The other standard tours offered by Berlin Walks are ``Infamous
Third Reich Sites,'' ``Jewish Life in Berlin'' and ``Discover
Potsdam.'' The company also will put together custom tours, on foot
or by car. Contact Gay at (49-30) 301-0104 or at
berlinwalks(AT)berlin.de.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a customized tour by Culture Trip, which
designs tours and outings, mainly for museum or university groups,
primarily from the United States. Virginia G. Shulte, a former New
Yorker who runs Culture Trip, said she uses specialists in the
pertinent subjects, not traditional guides. She could arrange to
hire an architect to lead a small group or an individual on an
architectural tour of the city. The cost is $135 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Culture Trip at 56 Mommsenstrasse, 10629 Berlin,
Germany; (49-30) 305-3890, fax (49-30) 345-1596. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a company on Long Island that rents cruise wardrobes
and delivers them to the ship? _ Susan Niego, Nesconset, N.Y. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: A company that has provided this service for years is Liberty
Moving and Storage, 17 Central Ave., Hauppauge, N.Y. 11788.
</P>
<P>
   According to Christina Squicciarini, a spokeswoman for Liberty,
the company can deliver what is properly called a wardrobe trunk _
essentially a portable closet and chest of drawers _ to your home
and pick it up locked after you have packed. It will be delivered
directly to the ship so you can board without most (or any) of your
luggage in tow. When you return, the company will return it to your
home and pick it up after you unpack.
</P>
<P>
   The fee for this service depends on the length of the cruise,
Ms. Squicciarini said, but it is generally $300 to $500. She
suggested reserving a wardrobe at least two weeks ahead of sailing.
To do so, call Liberty at (516) 234-3000 or (212) 223-6440. Ask for
Mary Zuliani, extension 232. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning a trip to Madeira and are looking for
recommendations for moderate nonchain hotels in Funchal. Also how
can we find out about tours of wineries? _ Susan Gish,
Philadelphia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The island of Madeira is known for wine, but tourism is the
major industry of this popular vacation destination. So there are
no shortage of hotels on the island, especially in the capital,
Funchal, but most of them are conventional chainlike
establishments, travel agents acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   A comfortable yet more authentic Madeiran experience is probably
best found at one of several quintas _ former manor estates _
according to Maria Joao Ramires, a spokeswoman for the Portuguese
National Tourist Office in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known is the Quinta da Bela Vista, about two
miles west of downtown Funchal. It has 67 rooms and suites in three
buildings set amid 37 acres of gardens; some have sea views, and
all are individually decorated with antiques. There is a pool and a
restaurant. Rates, which include full breakfast and tax, range from
$170 to $225, at 185 escudos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The quinta is represented in the United States by Marketing
Ahead, 433 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y 10016, (800) 223-1356, and
Pinto Basto Tours, 24 South Main Street, New City, N.Y. 10956,
(800) 526-8539.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto Basto also represents the Penha da Franca, a quinta within
easy walking distance of downtown Funchal, according to Margaret
McGlade, the agency's manager. This inn has 40 rooms costing $80 to
$160, depending on size and season (high season starts around the
end of November), including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are in small Madeiran-style two- and three-story
houses, with red tile roofs and green shutters, set amid lawns and
gardens. They are individually decorated and have a variety of
views. There is a heated pool.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a bed-and-breakfast like Quintinha Dalia, 54
Rua dos Ilheus, 9000 Funchal, Madeira. About a mile from the city
center, it offers six rooms with private baths, a terrace and
garden, a sitting room with TV and free parking. The house is
behind Quinta Magnolia, now a school with public recreation
facilities, including jogging paths, squash and tennis courts and a
large pool. Rates are $38 to $65 a night; reservations and
information from (351-91) 774-844 or at www.madeira-island.com
(which includes photos).
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Ramires, all the wine houses on the island _
including four in Funchal _ have regular visiting hours, and you
don't have to visit in a large tour group. You can obtain
inforon these at hotels, or contact the Instituto do Vinho
da Madeira, 78 Rua de 5 Outobro, 9000 Funchal, Madeira; (351-91)
204-600, fax (351-91) 228-685.
</P>
<P>
   Booklets listing hotels and wine houses and other information
about Madeira are available from the Portuguese National Tourist
Office, 300 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 767-8842, fax
(212) 764-6137.

NL MATCHUPS-BRAVES VS. METS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAVES
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are playing in the NL championship series for the
eighth consecutive time, and it's no secret that their pitching is
the reason. Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz are the
veterans, but the most consistent starter has been the least
experienced, Kevin Millwood. All he did in the division series
against Houston was pitch a one-hitter in Game 2 and pitch the 12th
inning for the save in Game 3. John Rocker, with one full season in
the majors, has become a top-flight closer. He gained saves with
ninth-inning appearances in each of the team's three victories over
the Mets at Turner Field last month.
</P>
<P>
   HITTING
</P>
<P>
   The lineup doesn't have Andres Galarraga and Javier Lopez, but
Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan have shown remarkable ability to
dominate a series. Jones did it against the Mets last month,
hitting four home runs and driving in seven of the Braves' 13 runs
in a three-game series sweep. Jordan did it against the Astros the
past week, hitting .471 and driving in 7 of the team's 18 runs. The
Mets kept pitching to Jones, and he kept beating them. The Astros
pitched around Jones, and Jordan beat them. The danger both present
grows in proportion to the number of times Gerald Williams and Bret
Boone get on base ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   FIELDING
</P>
<P>
   Errors and resulting unearned runs led to critical losses in
each of the past two league series, reasons why the Braves haven't
advanced to the World Series since 1996. But the two errors they
committed against the Astros didn't hurt them. They won't match the
Mets in defensive ability, but they have to avoid mistakes like the
ones the Mets took advantage of against Arizona. Center fielder
Andruw Jones is simply the best and patrols a large area inn the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE BASES
</P>
<P>
   Their best basestealer, Otis Nixon, seldom gets into games,
usually pinch-running in key late-inning situations. Otherwise,
Chipper Jones and Gerald Williams are the biggest threats. They
each had four steals in four tries against the Mets this season.
Against everyone else, Williams was successful only 15 of 26 times.
Andruw Jones also steals, and al can scoot around the bases at a
good clip.
</P>
<P>
   X FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The mind game can work for and against the Braves. They have
dominated the Mets this season, winning 9 of 12 games over-all and
5 of 6 in a 10-day period last month, giving them reason to think
they can handle the Mets easily in this series. However, the Braves
have lived with the record of having won only one World Series in
the 90s despite compiling the best won-lost record in the major
leagues. The desire to close out the 90s with their second
championship could motivate them, or it could bury them under their
own pressure.
</P>
<P>
   METS
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING
</P>
<P>
   They can't match the Braves' vaunted starting rotation, but the
Mets' veteran corps has performed quite capably, even heroically,
the past couple of weeks, which shows good timing if nothing else.
Al Leiter has made three outstanding starts and Rick Reed two.
Masato Yoshii, the Game 1 starter, has pitched effectively for two
months. The relief corps, however, will most likely hold the key to
the Mets' chances of reaching the World Series. The starters often
disappear before the seventh inning is over, meaning Turk Wendell,
Dennis Cook, Pat Mahomes and John Franco will have to get the game
to Armando Benitez, the closer.
</P>
<P>
   HITTING
</P>
<P>
   The lineup is loaded with six or seven .300 hitters at any given
time, and the big hits can come from any number of them. Mike
Piazza, when his left thumb is healthy, is the biggest of the big
hitters, but Edgardo Alfonzo's power display against the
Diamondbacks was no fluke. He is one of three players (Piazza and
Robin Ventura being the others) who drove in more than 100 runs
this year. The only time the Mets encountered trouble scoring in
the last two-thirds of the season was when the Braves' pitchers
shut down the hitters wholesale last month, and the slump became
extended. But they recovered in time to power the team into the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   FIELDING
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers thank their blessings every night, their blessings
being the Mets' defense. Led by an airtight infield, which opposing
players say is the best they have ever seen, the Mets made only 68
errors that led to an absurdly low total of 20 unearned runs. The
league's other 15 teams averaged 123 errors and 73 unearned runs.
In the infield, John Olerud committed 9 errors, Edgardo Alfonzo 5,
Rey Ordonez 4 (none since June 13) and Robin Ventura 9. If there
are defensive weaknesses, one is Rickey Henderson's poor throwing
arm and the inconsistent play of Shawon Dunston in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE BASES
</P>
<P>
   See Rickey run. See Rickey confound pitchers and catchers alike.
See Rickey create havoc. With six stolen bases in the division
series, Henderson showed he can still dominate the basepaths
despite his 40 years of age. The post-season, he says, is Rickey
time. With the possibility of low-scoring games, his steals and any
others the Mets can get from Roger Cedeno and Shawon Dunston could
be a critical factor.
</P>
<P>
   X FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The Braves don't need any more motivation than they already have
in their desire to win another World Series and silence their
critics, but some teams play harder against the Mets because they
don't like their manager. Bobby Valentine gave the Braves reason to
dislike him even more with his comments about them this week. On
the other hand, the fact that they survived their late-season
collapse and still made it to the post-season could motivate the
Mets.

   With expensive production and cool (read: barely intelligible)
movie-style dialogue, ``The Strip'' is UPN's latest attempt to
attract males who aren't likely to be watching ``Party of Five,''
``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' or ``Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   To do it, the network got filmmaker Joel Silver (``The Matrix,''
``Lethal Weapon'') to produce this slick homage to ``Vega$,''
featuring a pair of wisecracking cops name Elvis and Jesse (Sean
Patrick Flanery and Guy Torry), who trade in their badges to work
as outside security men for a casino owner. The plot is standard
private-eye genre, the stunts nothing we haven't seen before, and
the women are lacking the usual amount of apparel and meaningful
lines. The saving grace ``The Strip'' is high-gloss production, but
a ``Baywatch'' made by a pro is still a ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strip. Hourlong drama series about two former police

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREDON, France _ At home here in his 500-year-old stone
farmhouse, Jose Bove seems pretty relaxed for someone out on
$17,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   He moves around in his slippers and turns off his cell phone so
he can answer questions without being interrupted. His antique
dining-room table is covered with stacks of paper, mostly faxes and
printouts from Internet sites. Outside his windows, tucked among
the trees, are the other five houses of this village and, beyond
them, hundreds of Bove's sheep leisurely picking over the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was arrested in August on charges of vandalizing a
nearby McDonald's building site _ though his principal complaint is
about American tariffs on luxury food _ this wiry, 46-year-old
union leader and sheep farmer has become something of a national
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a day goes by that French newspapers fail to mention him,
lauding him for his refusal to bow to globalization, running photos
of him with his hands clenched above his head and his wrists
cuffed, and suggesting that he may be the only man left in France
willing to go to jail for the republic.
</P>
<P>
   He has been praised by France's highest officials, including
President Jacques Chirac, who has declared that he, too, ``detests
McDonald's food.'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has also weighed
in, comparing Bove with other noted leaders who have emerged from
grass-roots movements in recent years: ``Here again is a strong,
vigorous personality,'' Jospin said admiringly.
</P>
<P>
   At home, however, Bove hardly looks militant. His eyes twinkle
over his handlebar mustache when he is asked about all the
attention he is getting. ``There was some luck in it,'' he
confides. ``The judge threw me into jail. People didn't like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove, who lives in one of France's best-known gastronomic
regions, organized the destruction of the McDonald's in nearby
Millau _ using tractors to tear down half the roof _ to highlight
what he sees as the unfairness of the U.S. decision to impose high
tariffs on Roquefort cheese, pate de foie gras and other luxury
imported foods. Washington acted in retaliation for the European
Union's decision to ban America's hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been three totalitarian forces in our lifetime,''
said Bove, who supplies sheep milk to cheese makers. ``The
totalitarianism of Fascism, of Communism and now of capitalism. How
can people try and tell us that we must import hormone-enhanced
beef? What is that?''
</P>
<P>
   But some say that Bove's crusade has tapped into far larger
issues gnawing at the French lately, including a general annoyance
with the power of the American economy and a nostalgia for a way of
life, including long lunches, that is disappearing yet still held
in high regard. Every year, new McDonald's franchises open and
flourish in France.
</P>
<P>
   However, few people admit to indulging in those
quarter-pounders. ``Spotted under the golden arches, the French
often behave as if they just got caught leaving an X-rated movie''
said Jean-Pierre Poulain, a sociologist at the University of
Toulouse recently quoted in the newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   Having recovered from Bove's attack in August, the Millau
McDonald's was doing brisk business the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here only once in a great while,'' said one customer,
Laurent Jeniez, who was getting back into his car alone. ``I do it
only with my children,'' he added, though none could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Millau is awash in pro-Bove graffiti. ``End McDomination''
and ``Free Bove'' are scrawled all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Bove himself favors a rhyming slogan that uses the French
nickname for McDonald's: ``McDo Dehors, Gardons le Roquefort''
(McDonald's Get Out, Let's Keep the Roquefort). That is what he
painted on the McDonald's construction site on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He considers his actions that day to be rather ordinary, hardly
worth more than a shrug.  after all, is a country where
protesting is a national pastime. The development that really
shocked Bove, who heads a small farmers' union called the
Confederation Paysanne, was being put in jail five days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never do that,'' he said. ``But there was a young judge
and they are independent and they just saw property damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove clinched his moment of fame when he refused to be freed on
bail, a stand that lasted only three weeks. He smiles when asked
about his change of heart. ``The conditions in there were really
bad,'' he said. ``And the food was inedible. And I said to myself,
`If all these people are trying to help me by raising the money,
why should I refuse to come out?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bove said his actions had been carefully planned and announced
in the paper the day before. ``There was nothing menacing about
it,'' he said. ``The children were there. There was singing. It had
a festival atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the McDonald's, Marc Dehani, sees it a bit
diff. He says $120,000 worth of damage was done. Still,
McDonald's has chosen not to take any civil action against Bove.
The restaurant chain has lately tried to calm protests by issuing
statements pointing out that the franchises in France are owned by
the French, employ French workers and almost exclusively sell food
grown in France.
</P>
<P>
   In the press, Bove is often described as the last holdout
against creeping American imperialism. But he is eager to say that
he likes Americans. His parents were researchers who spent years at
the University of California at Berkeley studying diseases that
attacked citrus trees. Bove lived there until he was 7 and still
speaks English.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that at the time he was playing on the northern
California beaches, Jack Kerouac might have been nearby. It is an
idea that obviously pleases him.
</P>
<P>
   But his contempt for American food habits is also obvious. He
offers statistics on the rate of obesity in America _ about three
times that of the French _ and disdains Americans for eating all
day long. He says America has no right to force its
hormone-enhanced food down French throats.
</P>
<P>
   Bove said his spell in prison had not lessened his outrage at
the luxury-food tariffs, and he intends to travel to Seattle in
November, when the World Trade Organization is expected to meet
there and consider the issue again. The U.S. actions were
authorized by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Bove is actually a protester from way back. He first came to the
region in the late 1960s, when the government was talking about
enlarging a military installation and the farmers were in an
uproar. Bove helped them lead the protest and then accepted their
invitation to settle here at the end of a quiet country road.
</P>
<P>
   With four other farmers, he owns about 500 sheep. About half are
raised to produce milk for Roquefort cheese. The rest are sold as
meat in local farmers' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bove says he has never eaten at McDonald's, not even once. No,
he insists, he is not curious. He does, however, like hamburgers
made on a grill, with sliced tomatoes and onions from the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``And mayonnaise,'' he added. ``But only the homemade kind.''

 &HT;    Keys for the Braves to win
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. No Micro-Chip this time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chipper Jones could match his mid-September madness
here, when he hit four home runs in a three-game sweep of the Mets.
But with the resurgent Brian Jordan back hitting cleanup, Jones
must carry another big stick and talk, well, softly.
</P>
<P>
   2. On his Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker was dominant against Houston, escaping that no-out,
bases-loaded jam in Game 3 and saving Game 4. He must keep
dominating and, with help from his fellow relievers, offset one of
the Mets' strengths, their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rotate this.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a decided edge in their starting rotation. Use
it. You make the call: Maddux-Millwood-Glavine-Smoltz or
Yoshii-Leiter-Reed-Rogers?
</P>
<P>
   4. Get to the heart of the matter. Again.
</P>
<P>
   In winning five of six from the Mets last month, Atlanta cut out
three of the four chambers of the heart of the Mets lineup. Edgardo
Alfonzo was 4-for-25 (.160), John Olerud 3-for-26 (.115) and Robin
Ventura 4-for-23 (.174), a combined 11-for-74 (.149). And cleanup
man Mike Piazza (7-for-23, .304) is still nursing a sore thumb.
</P>
<P>
   5. First things first
</P>
<P>
   Win tonight. Since the Braves lost the NL Championship Series
opener in 1991, every Game 1 winner since '92 has gone on to win
the NLCS.

INQUIRY INTO SUHARTO CORRUPTION IS HALTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ Indonesia's acting attorney general announced Monday
that he was halting a yearlong investigation into alleged
corruption by former president Suharto, saying there was not enough
evidence to prosecute the longtime autocrat whose wealth is
estimated in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is likely to undermine the credibility of Suharto's
successor, B.J. Habibie, as a reformer, just nine days before
Indonesia's National Assembly decides whether to retain Habibie as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's move to shelve the investigation into alleged misuse of
public monies by two Suharto-run charitites outraged many
Indonesians who had raised a rallying cry last year against 32
years of ``corruption, cronyism, and nepotism,'' sparking riots
that forced Asia's longest-serving leader from power.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, Suharto's vice president and protege, had vowed to
stamp out corruption and promised to spare no one. Suharto's
fortune dwarfed his $1,764-a-month presidential salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people forget that this government is really an
extension of the previous regime,'' said political commentator
Wimar Witoelar. Prosecuting Suharto would be ``like a snake trying
to eat its tail. . . . Habibie has paid lip service to popular
demands (for justice), but it's been a stalling game.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's reputation has already suffered from a banking scandal
that implicates him and his party in siphoning funds for campaign
use and from the crisis in East Timor _ two issues, along with the
Suharto probe, that he will have to address in his accountability
speech before parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the ruling Golkar Party is expected to announce
whether it will continue to back the beleaguered Habibie for
presidnext week's race, and the Suharto decision will hurt
his standing among party reformers, said Marzuki Darusman, deputy
chairman of Golkar and leader of the anti-Habibie faction.
</P>
<P>
   The unpopular decision could also spark public unrest and
possible violence in the lead-up to the volatile race for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the nail in the coffin for Habibie,'' predicted
Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies. ``By doing this a few days before his
accountability speech, he is waving a red flag in front of students
and other protesters. They're going to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrevian, a 37-year-old driver who like many Indonesians uses
only one name, said he was disappointed and surprised by the
decision, ``because we had 32 years of Suharto and many of us know
he is very corrupt. Indonesian people want Suharto and his family
in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrevian echoed the popular view that Suharto bought his way
out of prosecution, but even Suharto's political opponents
acknowledge they have no evidence to support that accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Former General Suharto, 78, and his six children were estimated
last year to have amassed $30 billion in assets across some 260
companies, much of which was allegedly acquired through kickbacks
and sweetheart deals. Suharto _ who recently suffered a stroke,
bringing to a halt his questioning by investigators _ has denied
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Wanandi said the investigation made a mockery of public demands
for accountability. ``You cannot go over the evidence for 15 months
and then interrogate him for a couple of days and then he becomes
sick and it's over. In 15 months, they've had time to conceal
everything and take their money abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanandi asserted the investigation by the Habibie government _
which includes many former Suharto loyalists _ was ``half-hearted,
because Suharto said, `If you do it to me, I'll do it to you.'
They're all in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyer Monday praised the recommendation to drop
charges, saying the charges were politically motivated. ``The case
of former President Suharto has more of a political nuance than the
legal aspects,'' Juan Felix Tampubolon said in a television
interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the investigation was a scheme that required
state-owned banks to donate 5 percent of profits to charities
linked to Suharto. Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko said his
investigation uncovered irregularities, but no evidence that
Suharto had broken the law to enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ismudjoko said investigators found the charities had lent money
to commercial enterprises, but that the money was ultimately
returned to the charities. Suharto critics say the funds were
tapped by Suharto's children as free lines of credit to fund their
commercial empires.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not declare Suharto completely innocent,
however, saying that if corruption exists in other cases, the
public should come forward with proof. Witoelar called this a
hypocritical strategy by the Habibie regime to ``cover themselves''
from criticism that they are protecting Suharto's family.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's children are estimated to be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars each, though many of their assets are being
held by the national debt restructuring agency for non-payment of
debts. The only criminal proceedings launched so far are against
Suharto's youngest son, Tommy Hutomo Mandala Putra.
</P>
<P>
   A verdict on a multimillion dollar land deal that the
prosecution alleges cost the government $10.8 million could be
issued as early as this week. If found guilty, Suharto's son could
be imprisoned for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ismudjoko said the results of a separate investigation into a
controversial national car project that exempted Suharto's youngest
son from taxes would be announced by another minister, but he did
not say when.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, police questioned two senior ministers over the PT
Bank Bali scandal, in which the bank paid a $77 million fee to a
firm run by a senior ruling party official _ money that opponents
charge was funnelled into Habibie's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have delayed
critically-needed bailout loans to Indonesia until the issue is
resolved.

</P>
<P>
   Catcher: EDDIE PEREZ
</P>
<P>
   Perez played every inning of the Division Series and handled the
Braves pitching well throug-out from Millwood's one-hitter in Game
2 to Rocker's 10th inning heroics in Game 3. He also hit .250 (4
for 16), including a critical two-run single in Game 4.

   First base: RYAN KLESKO
</P>
<P>
   Klesko bounced back from an 0 for 4 start to the Division Series
to go 4 for his next 8, driving in only one run but scoring three
times. Brian Hunter went 0 for 4 in the series, but made a couple
good digs at first.

   Boone had the hottest bat in the lineup by the end of the
Division Series with a .474 average (9 for 19) and played well
defensively. This will be his second NLCS appearance after hitting
.214 for the Reds against the Braves in 1995.

<P>
   Hernandez struggled offensively against Houston, going 1 for 11,
which could mean Walt Weiss gets more playing time in the NLCS.
Weiss became one of the heroes of the NLDS when he made the
unbelievable diving stop of a Tony Eusebio grounder to help the
Braves out of the 10th inning bases-loaded jam in Game 3.

   THIRD BASE: CHIPPER JONES
</P>
<P>
   Jones has lost his offensive rhythm since teams quit pitching to
him and hit only .231 in the Division Series. It'll be interesting
to see how the Mets handle him after he spent this season hitting
.400 with seven homers off them, including four in that three-game
sweep in Atlanta.

<P>
   Jones ended an 0-for-20 Division Series slump with couple of
hits in Game 2, but was largely overmatched by Astros pitching as
he went 2 for 10 the rest of the way. With the Mets wary of Chipper
Jones and now Brian Jordan, Andruw Jones needs to produce.

</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the offensive hero of the Division Series driving in
seven runs, including all five in the Braves 5-3 win in Game 3, and
hitting .471. With pitchers unwilling to give in to Chipper Jones,
Jordan really toyed with their thinking by coming up big time and
again.

Mets, the most biggest on a John Olerud grand slam.

 &HT;    Dream team: Gordon crew two-for-two
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Jeff Gordon was rewarded with a lifetime
contract last week. Maybe Hendrick Motorsports should do the same
for the No. 24 team's new crew chief, Brian Whitesell.
</P>
<P>
   The tandem has been together for two races and has won both.
Gordon took the checkered flag at Monday's UAW-GM Quality 500 to
become the first driver to post back-to-back victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are really supporting Brian, they're supporting me
and they're supporting one another,'' Gordon said. ``The chemistry
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really should consider retiring now,'' joked Whitesell, who
is 2-0 after taking over for long-time crew chief Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon leads all drivers with seven victories, and moved from
fourth to sixth in the Winston Cup points standings after Monday's
race, which was postponed on Sunday because of rainy weather.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte finished second and gained 29 points on Dale
Jarrett, who now leads the points standings by 222 with five races
remaining. Mike Skinner was third, tying his career-best finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray helped built that organization to where it's at and
(Whitesell) obviously got a great team,'' Labonte said. ``I think
to carry on like they have really isn't surprising in (a) way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dale Earnhardt, ``Ray must've forgotten his notebook (when
he left Hendrick). That 24 team looked really good today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's win was not in his usual dominating fashion. He
struggled in qualifying, and was forced to start in the 22nd
position, which later helped Gordon tied an event record for
rallying up from the most spots to win.
</P>
<P>
   For most of race, Gordon simply hung around the top of the pack.
He patiently waited for his opportunity to pass Labonte, and saw it
with eight laps remaining. Gordon ended up leading only 16 of 334
laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an amazing week,'' Gordon said. ``There were times
we were great in practice and there were times we were horrible.
When we were at or worse, I was still having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enjoying it more than I ever had before just because I
felt like I'm more part of this team today than I have ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   By guiding Gordon to victories at Martinsville and Charlotte,
Whitesell has become the sport's newest celebrity. He signed a
three-year contract with Hendrick about a month before his
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm breaking even becamuch pressure as it
(victories) takes off, it puts it right back on,'' Whitesell said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome allowed owner Rick Hendrick and Gordon to be
reunited in victory lane for the first time since the '96 season.
Hendrick, who has been battling with luekemia for three years, has
attended only two races this season.

IN MIDEAST, 2 RED SOX FANS KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ David Forman and Nadim Khoury are among the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Forman, a rabbi born in Belmont, Mass., and Khoury, a
Palestinian brewer of beer who lived in Brookline, Mass., count
themselves part of a community of believers who see Fenway Park as
a holy place and who believe in the Red Sox' promise of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   They may come from different religions and opposing sides of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but they both proclaim allegiance to
Red Sox Nation. And they are part of its diaspora _ countless
thousands worldwide with connections to Boston who understand the
longing and the suffering that comes with another autumn and
another shot at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, these two men found themselves in the predawn
darkness following the game on the World Wide Web, hoping that this
year might be different.
</P>
<P>
   Forman, a 55-year-old pillar of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations and a founder of the group Rabbis for Peace, was born
into the Fenway tribe. He grew up in Belmont and remembers the
first game he attended, in 1950, when he sat in the bleachers and
watched in awe the signature swing of Ted Williams and the pitching
of Mel Parnell. He is now an ``orthodox Red Sox fan'' and a
``Reform rabbi'' who immigrated to Israel in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that time of year again,'' said Forman. ``I can feel it.
The tension is rising, the nervousness. Through it all, you keep
the faith somehow. I guess that is what defines being a Red Sox
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Khoury, the 40-year-old Christian Palestinian owner and general
manager of Taybeh Brewing Co., became a Sox fan, like many others,
as a college student. In 1979, he moved from the West Bank to
Brookline to take business courses at Boston University and to work
at Foley's Liquors, a store owned by his family that sits in the
Whiskey Point section of Brookline, within sight of the Fenway Park
light towers. Waves of Fenway faithful would sweep down the streets
on their way to the games, and soon he was caught up in a tidal
pull toward the great American game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand it for a long time. But then you get it,
and it makes its way into your soul,'' said Khoury. ``We were
fairly warned about what we were in for as Red Sox fans. But for
us, the Red Sox were about more than baseball. They are our
connection to Boston, and because of that very important to our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges as a fan living in the Middle East is
keeping up on the games in a region where ESPN is harder to find
than water in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Since Forman came in 1972, he has tried desparately to stay
abreast of the scores and the standings. Through the 1970s and
1980s, he got his baseball news from the International Herald
Tribune, which publishes scores a day late. Sometimes he'd call his
brother in Framingham for updates. He said there were many
occasions late at night when he would resort to calling directory
assistance in Boston and asking operators if they had the game on.
The arrival of CNN changed that. And now he even finds himself
surfing various Web sites for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Khoury returned to his hometown in the West Bank in 1994 after
the signing of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and
founded a very successful brewery. His 8-year-old, Brookline-born
son has inherited a passion for the Red Sox that he shares with a
group of cousins from the family's village of Taybeh. Their rooms
are covered with Red Sox banners and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Forman and Khoury don't know each other. But they share a common
language and a family of patriarchs with names like Williams,
Yastrzemski, and Martinez. They measure history in a timetable
marked by 1967, 1975, and 1986. They share a hope in the future.
And both see in the Red Sox a reflection of their ethnic
identities.
</P>
<P>
   Forman discusses the Red Sox in terms of his Jewish faith and
the ``olam haba,'' which is Hebrew for ``the world to come.'' He is
painfully aware that the idea of Red Sox victory in the World
Series anytime soon is a wish not grounded in reality. As a rabbi
and Talmudic scholar, he said, ``There is too much reality with the
Red Sox to believe that it will come in this world. But I hope for
another place, a transcendent place where a World Series title
could happen. And that belief has to sustain us.''
</P>
<P>
   Khoury compares the resiliency of Red Sox fans to that of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox story is like the Palestinian story,'' said
Khoury. ``It is taking too long, and there are a lot of
frustrations along the way. But the point is to keep trying, to
never give up. And then it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Insh'allah,'' he said in Arabic. ``God willing.''

 &HT;    Gimmick leads to win for Duke to build upon
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The play that's making all the highlight shows allowed
Duke coach Carl Franks to get his first career victory after four
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 17-10 with time running out against Virginia on
Saturday, the Blue Devils were at the Cavaliers' 9. The call was
for tailback Letavious Wilks to pitch to receiver Scottie
Montgomery, who would pass to quarterback Spencer Romine.
</P>
<P>
   Got that? The Blue Devils didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks was hit and fumbled, but the ball bounced to Montgomery,
who threw a desperation pass across the field that Richmond Flowers
grabbed for a touchdown with six seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Duke scored a touchdown in the second overtime, Virginia
had one nullified when the officials ruled the receiver caught the
ball out of bounds. TV replays appeared to show otherwise. The Blue
Devils improbably won 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screwed up every way we could,'' Franks said. ``But I guess
four wrongs makes a right.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the wrongs mattered to Franks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``An exciting win for our team,'' said Franks, a former Duke
player and assistant. He was Florida's offensive coordinator for
Steve Spurrier the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was very excited in the locker room,'' he said.
``Now we need to make sure we continue to build upon that just like
we had talked about building from the second half of the Florida
State game.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks arrived in Durham to inherit a program that returned 20
starters, including both kickers. But the Blue Devils were 4-7 in
Fred Goldsmith's last year as coach, after seasons of 2-9 and 0-11.
</P>
<P>
   Having been groomed under Spurrier, first at Duke and then at
Florida, Franks brought all the nuances of the Gators' ``Fun `n'
Gun'' fancy passing attack with him to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for him, the Duke players spent their Goldsmith
years running the ball more than throwing it.
</P>
<P>
   The transition was hampered by a first-game shoulder injury to
Romine, who missed three games before the breakthrough at Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really played a lot better than I expected,'' Franks said.
Romine completed 16 of 35 passes for 246 yards, two interceptions
and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what his confidence level would be, how well he
would be able to make audibles, but he changed plays very well,''
Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gutsy guy. He took some shots. I think now he'll
continue to get better. Hopefully, we can keep him healthy.''

building her burgeoning but still unprofitable Internet business,
with guidance from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the Silicon
Valley venture capital firm, which has a 5 percent stake in Ms.
Stewart's company. Together, merchandising _ through Kmart and
other outlets including her ``Martha by Mail'' catalog _ and online
commerce accounted for 22.5 percent of the company's six-month
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, she got a salary and bonus of slightly less than
$4.7 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her company is taking no chances that she will suddenly decide
on a life of quiet contemplation in the Maine woods: employment and
licensing agreements give the company the exclusive right to use
her image and services, and even her private residences, for as
long she is associated with the business.
</P>
<P>
   Her new employment contract guarantees her a salary and bonus of
at least $1.2 million. The company will also pay her $2 million a
year for the use of her colonial estate in Westport, Conn. and her
two vacation homes: one in East Hampton, one on the coast of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stewart's most crucial role in the new public company
will be as controlling stockholder. After the offering, the Martha
Stewart Family Limited Partnership _ Ms. Stewart is the only
partner listed in the prospectus _ will control 96 percent of the
company's voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this famously attentive _ some say ``controlling'' _
entrepreneur will be able to determine the outcome of any matter
that comes before shareholders, from takeover bids to the selection
of the company's accountants. Even the stock certificate is being
designed in-house, one of her advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Her control is rooted in the two-class stock structure her
underwriters and lawyers designed for her.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to sell 7.2 million to 8.28 million shares of
class A common stock to the public. It will distribute an
additional 7.1 million class A shares to the company's current
investors. Besides Ms. Stewart, those investors include Time
Warner's Time Publishing Ventures unit, which acquired its stake as
part of the agreement that gave Ms. Stewart control of her domain
in 1997. Of the $91.7 million Ms. Stewart hopes to raise with the
stock offering, she hopes to use $41.7 million to buy out Time's
remaining stake.
</P>
<P>
   But the company will also issue roughly 34.1 million class B
shares, each of which can cast 10 votes, compared with a single
vote for each class A share, and all of which will be owned by Ms.
Stewart's family partnership.
</P>
<P>
   If the initial offering fetches the estimated $13 to $15 a
share, as the underwriters expect, the company would have a value
of about $680 million and Ms. Stewart's partnership would control
stock theoretically worth more than $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Given the company's current dependence on Ms. Stewart, however,
those millions may be ephemeral: the moment she tried to sell any
substantial part of her shares, they would plunge in value in
response to fears of life without Martha.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that risk, several experts said, Ms. Stewart has the
biggest stake in reducing her dominance at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, she has some strong directors who could make sure she
yields a bit of the limelight: L. John Doerr, a partner with
Kleiner Perkins; Charlotte L. Beers, the chairwoman of J. Walter
Thompson Worldwide and chairwoman emeritus of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide; and Naomi O. Seligman, a co-founder of the Research
Board, a prominent information technology research group.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stewart herself must be an active and willing
participant in the effort to confer stardom on her potential
successors, warned Mark Rubin of the Metropolitan Group, a
consulting firm in Leonia, N.J., that specializes in closely held
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got some very talented people in that company,'' Rubin
said. ``What is key is having her participate in developing the
succession, or there could be a backlash or resistance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, of Lippincott &AMP; Margulies, said Ms. Stewart was on her
way to becoming a brand, rather than a person: ``If she's not all
the way there, she is still more than just an individual _ she has
come to represent a way of life, a specific vision, a level taste.
The question is, how well can that be institutionalized?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``That's a very fair question _ and I'm not sure I
would be rushing to be the first investor to find out the answer.''

REAGAN BOOK ENTERS LISTS AS NONFICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Dutch,'' the biography of Ronald Reagan whose
author, Edmund Morris, inserts a fictional version of himself in
the narrative, jumped onto the best-seller lists last eekend _ in
the nonfiction category.
</P>
<P>
   And, although there was little debate over how to classify the
work, its unusual and heavily debated blending of fact and fiction
did make some book review editors pause before including it in the
nonfiction category.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGrath, the editor of The New York Times Book Review,
said the Morris biography would make its debut at No. 2 on the list
Sunday. ``No matter what you did people would complain,'' he said.
``It is a big can of worms. There have been other things on the
nonfiction list that have been, in retrospect, as least as
fictional as this.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' by John
Berendt, who has said that he simply ``rounded the corners'' in
inventing dialogue and stretching the facts surrounding a murder in
Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said that in the best-seller list, the customary
one-line description is used to flag the fact-versus-fiction
controversy surrounding ``Dutch.'' The line reads, ``The authorized
biography of Ronald Reagan, bedecked with fictional passages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times' book review, where ``Dutch'' also ranks
No. 2 on the nonfiction list, chose a similar approach, using a
one-line description that reads, ``This long-anticipated official
biography of President Reagan features a fictionalized narrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wasserman, the book editor at the Los Angeles newspaper,
said: ``It does disturb that the boundaries between the realm of
the fact and the republic of the nonfact are increasingly blurred.
For much of the public, this may be a distinction without a
difference.'' But, he added, for journalists, they matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch'' was also classified as nonfiction on Amazon.com's
list, where it ranked No. 1. The book is published by Random House,
a division of Bertelsmann AG.

COMMENTARY: MY BOY SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite Ronald Reagan story involves the false Lassie. Once
when he was president, Reagan invited the White House press corps
to his ranch in California. One of the reporters noticed the family
collie and, in an effort to make conversation, asked what the dog's
name was.
</P>
<P>
   After an almost imperceptible pause, the president smiled and
said ``Lassie.'' Later an aide on the press plane explained that
Reagan had, as they say, misspoken. He didn't remember his dog's
name, and had simply come up with something that sounded
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of ways you can interpret this anecdote _ as
a hint of the Alzheimer's disease that was to come, or an example
of Reagan's tendency to recast reality with characters from
Hollywood movies. I suspect, though, the real moral was simple. The
president didn't care enough about the dog to bother to learn its
name. If he returned to the ranch one weekend and found an Irish
setter waiting for him at the gate, he would probably never have
noticed the switch.
</P>
<P>
   This easygoing indifference to the world around him extended
beyond the animal kingdom. Reagan had trouble identifying his
children too. His son Michael once recounted a blood-curdling story
of his boarding school graduation, at which his father failed to
recognize him and genially stuck out his hand and introduced
himself. When Maureen Reagan discovered that her 7-year-old
half-sister, Patti, had not been told they were siblings, Reagan
hedged: ``Well, we just haven't gotten that far yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend both Patti and her brother, Ron, went public with
their defenses of Edmund Morris' controversial biography of their
father. Patti, writing in The Washington Post, said it was a relief
to read that Reagan had not shut just her out of his inner life,
but also the entire universe. Ron told ``60 Minutes'' that his
father treated ``everybody the same way,'' whether you happened to
be his gardener or his child.
</P>
<P>
   In middle age, the Reagan offspring are still the walking
wounded, yearning for an emotional acknowledgment they're doomed
never to receive. Ron Reagan laughed nervously, in a stab at
easygoing indifference, as he explained that he could tell Reagan
had himself written that letter to the nation announcing that he
had Alzheimer's, ``because there's no mention of his children.''
(Actually, the former president offered a generic reference to
``family.'')
</P>
<P>
   As a group, presidents have never been particularly successful
at parenting _too busy, maybe, or too large. John Quincy Adams,
whose children called him ``The Iron Mask,'' raised a couple of
suicidal alcoholics, but so did the hyper-attentive Theodore
Roosevelt. On the other hand Bill Clinton, who has set records for
unsatisfactory private performance as president, seems to have done
a great job with Chelsea. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's strange to be listening to the Reagan
children bare their wounds while so many Republican presidential
candidates who wrap themselves in the Reagan mantle are sniping at
the opposition for less-than-pristine personal behavior. ``People
love Ronald Reagan because he was a strong family man with Nancy,''
said Charles Jarvis, who deserted the Gary Bauer campaign for Steve
Forbes because Bauer had been having unchaperoned meetings with a
young female aide.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that no American voter, even those of the Christian
right, actually picks a candidate according to private conduct.
Most of them understand that they're lucky to find a candidate
whose policies they agree with, let alone someone whose behavior
they'd want to emulate. ``It would be different if they discovered
somebody had committed murder,'' said Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, the
twice-divorced champion of the Defense of Marriage Act. Barr, who
once licked whipped cream off two women's breasts at a charity
fund-raiser, has good reason to set the bar somewhere around
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   If social conservatives actually tried to choose candidates by
the state of their souls, Jimmy Carter, that born-again family man,
would have had two terms. Ronald Reagan, the divorced
non-churchgoer and remote parent, might, as his son suggested over
the weekend in a different context, have ended his career as the
host of ``Unsolved Mysteries.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ASKS SENATE TO PULL NUCLEAR TREATY
 &HT;    Eds: New throughout with Helms reaction.
 &HT;    710&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Senate Republicans girded for
a high-stakes showdown Tuesday over the fate of an international
treaty banning nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to Republican demands, Clinton formally asked Monday that
the treaty be withdrawn from a scheduled Tuesday vote in the
Senate, aiming to salvage the accord from certain defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proceeding to a vote under these circumstances,'' Clinton
wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
``would severely harm the national security of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea was immediately rejected, though, by one of the
treaty's most powerful opponents. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said he would block any
effort to delay the Senate vote unless Clinton gives up entirely on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
   ``His letter, while a step in the right direction, was still
insufficient to avert a vote on the CTBT tomorrow,'' Helms said in
a statement late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be made clear that this CTBT is dead and that the next
president will not be bound by its terms,'' said Helms. ``Without
such concrete assurances, I will insist that the Senate proceed as
planned and vote down this treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratification of a treaty requires a two-thirds majority vote
in the Senate. Members of both parties estimate that only half of
the Senate, and perhaps less, supports the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and other foes of the treaty said last week that a vote
could be avoided only if Clinton asked Lott to pull it from
consideration and agree not to bring it back up for the duration of
his term.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's five-sentence letter to Lott was silent on the second
condition, however, and the issue of how to move forward remained
unresolved late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This withdrawal request is merely a first step,'' said Lott's
press spokesman, John Czwartacki. ``Not only must the treaty be
withheld from consideration at this time, agreement must be reached
that it not come up again at any time this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded that any such promise amounted to
undue constraints on the president's ability to conduct foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't put a sign on our door that says 'closed for
business' during an election year,'' said National Security Council
spokesman David Leavy. ``Who knows what the international
environment will be like over the next 18 months?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the contentious rhetoric, moderate senators from both
parties were quietly seeking a way to put off the vote with an
agreement to delay further consideration of the treaty until after
the 106th Congress adjourns late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement needn't involve Clinton, Czwartacki said, but
could be reached among Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the president to reverse himself,'' said Czwartacki.
``Now it's up to the Senate _ D's and R's _ to agree that it not
come up again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, such an arrangement could be the best
Clinton could hope for at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a decision for those guys to make,'' said Leavy. ``But
the president has made clear that he wouldn't bring this treaty up
unless he had the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Tuesday's outcome, however, appeared to rest with a
handful of the treaty's most outspoken critics, particularly Lott,
Helms, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Helms's objections could prove lethal.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, under Senate procedures, canceling the treaty's
scheduled vote Tuesday would require the unanimous consent of the
senators. A single dissident could force a vote, even if Lott
decides he wants it pulled.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the treaty, which calls for the United States and
153 other countries to renounce nuclear weapons tests, could be
delayed until Wednesday, however, due to scheduling matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate doesn't return from its Columbus Day break until
midday Tuesday, and both parties have caucus meetings scheduled
into the afternoon. An important agriculture spending bill is up
for a floor vote late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several hours of debate remain on the Senate time
clock before the treaty vote can take place.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who became the first national leader to sign the treaty
in 1996 and asked the Senate to approve it two years ago, was
unhappy when the Senate scheduled a vote less than two weeks ago.
He claimed the schedule didn't allow sufficient time to discuss the
treaty and work out assurances for the accord's Senate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says the treaty would help reduce the threat of nuclear
weapons proliferation by prohibiting signatories from conducting
tests essential to the development of such arms.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents such as Helms argue, however, that the ban would tie
the hands of U.S. weapons developers, potentially undermining the
U.S. nuclear arsenal. Further, critics allege, the provisions of
the treaty would be impossible to verify, and that would enable
some nations to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States stopped conducting nuclear test explosions in
September 1992, under the Bush administration.

BLAIR GIVES ULSTER JOB TO AIDE BRUSHED BY SCANDAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair brought his closest political
confidant, Peter Mandelson, back into government Monday, putting
him in the strategically crucial position of Northern Ireland
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, 45, who was forced to leave the Cabinet in a
financial scandal last December, replaced Mo Mowlam, 50, who became
head of the Cabinet Office, the so-called ``government enforcer''
responsible for keeping programs on track and officials in line.
Jack Cunningham, 60, resigned from the job.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Cabinet changes, Geoff Hoon, 45, a deputy foreign
secretary, succeeded Defense Secretary George Robertson, 53, who is
becoming secretary general of NATO, and Alan Milburn, 41, a
treasury minister, replaced health secretary Frank Dobson, 59.
Dobson resigned to fight for the Labor nomination for the position
of London's first elected mayor against the Conservative candidate,
Jeffrey Archer, the millionaire novelist.
</P>
<P>
   In her two and half years in the high-profile position of
Northern Ireland secretary, Ms. Mowlam muscled the strong-willed
politicians of the conflicted province into dealing with one other
while she herself was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. She
earned approval ratings even higher than those of Blair, 46, the
most popular British prime minister in history.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, however, with progress in the Northern Ireland
peace settlement stalled, she had come under criticism from the
Ulster Unionists, the province's largest party, which has become
increasingly divided over whether to continue to support the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's decision to replace her and name his most trusted aide
to the post will be seen as an indication of his persistence in
driving home a solution at a time of deepening gloom in Ulster.
George Mitchell, the former American senator, is conducting a
formal review, now in its sixth week, to try to salvage the April
1998 accord he helped broker as chairman of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the feeling of the Ulster Unionists that Ms. Mowlam
had become unsympathetic to their cause, Ken Maginnis, the party's
security spokesman, said Monday, ``There will be huge relief,
particularly among unionists, that there is a change in secretary
of state at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the head of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, praised her
for the ``superb work she had done, particularly in these difficult
times.'' He said the people of Northern Ireland owed her a ``deep
debt of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionist is the term used to describe those people, largely
members of the province's Protestant majority, who want to see
Northern Ireland remain British. Opposing them are those people,
called nationalists or republicans, and predominantly Catholic, who
are interested in seeing the province become closer to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the terms of the accord into place has become deadlocked
over the unwillingness of the Irish Republican Army to begin
disarming and the refusal of the Ulster Unionists to let the
members of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, take their seats in
a new Northern Ireland government until weapons are turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, a shrewd political strategist, is credited with
having planned the modernization of the Labor Party that saw it
shed its socialist past, overcome the distrust of the business
class and get back into power after 18 years of Conservative rule.
In the first year of the Blair government, he was regularly
demonized by the Tories and by large parts of the press as a
shadowy behind-the-scenes figure in his job as minister without
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Blair named him trade and industry secretary, a
post he invigorated by championing greater investment in
information technologies, praising American entrepreneurship and
furthering Labor's new attentiveness to the leaders of British
business and finance.
</P>
<P>
   In a development that rocked British political life last
December, he was forced to quit when it emerged that he had failed
to disclose he had received a $625,000 low-interest home loan from
a millionaire colleague in government whose finances had come under
investigation by his department.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's farewell letter to his close colleague suggested the
likelihood, if not the speeded-up timing, of what took place
Monday. ``I want you to know that you have my profound thanks for
all you have done,'' the prime minister wrote in December, ``and my
belief that, in the future, you will achieve much, much more with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party chairman, Michael Ancram, deplored the
appointment, saying, ``It is wrong to bring back a disgraced
minister who was forced to resign only 10 months ago.'' He said it
``shows how arrogant this prime minister has become.''

 &HT;    Maxim Group loss at $19.2 million
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maxim Group Inc. on Monday restated its loss for
fiscal 1999 to $19.2 million, or $1.08 a share, before items. The
company originally reported a loss before items of $2.6 million, or
15 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, the company reported a profit before items of
$16.2 million, or $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The downward revision results from vendor support revenues,
expense accruals and asset write-downs that were incorrectly
recorded last year, said Tom Leahey, executive vice president of
finance. They will be booked in future quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The company originally reported revenue of $684.4 million for
fiscal 1999. The restated figure is $664.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   In its press release, the Kennsaw, Ga.-based flooring retailer
also said it expects auditors to question the company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The auditors' concern relates to a
previously announced default. The default was triggered when the
company exceeded limits on the repurchase of stock in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim said it is negotiating a waiver to the default.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has been conducting an
``informal inquiry'' of the company's financial records, but it is
unclear whether the commission is considering formal action. The
SEC does not comment on informal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim plans to file its annual report with the SEC on Monday and
quarterly reports for the first two quarters of 2000 within several
weeks, Leahey said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at $7.18 3/4 Monday, up 25 cents.

   NEW YORK _ The NASDAQ composite index rose to a record high
Monday, propelled by a handful of telecommunications and
semiconductor stocks. However, with banks closed many traders were
off for Columbus Day, leaving most stocks little changed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, traders and analysts said the run-up in the NASDAQ
index, its sixth straight daily advance, should be viewed with some
caution.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was trading volume light, but the bond market, which
often acts as a governor on stock prices _ particularly high-priced
technology issues _ was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of a few stocks in the technology sector,
it was a lackluster, listless day,'' said Bill Allyn, head of
listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``With the bond market being
closed, I would not put too much stock in the NASDAQ hitting a
record. Tuesday will be a much better barometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by big gains in Qualcomm and MCI/Worldcom, the NASDAQ
composite index rose 29.38, or 1 percent, to 2,915.95. The gain
eclipsed the index's previous record of 2,887.86 set on Sept. 10.
Since the start of the year, the NASDAQ composite is up 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most other major market averages barely budged.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 1.58, or 0.01 percent,
and closed at 10,648.18. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dipped
0.81, or 0.1 percent, to 1,335.21. But the Russell 2000 index of
small company stocks rose 2.48, or 0.6 percent, to 430.19.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was light, reflecting the holiday conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 655.4 million shares changed
hands. On the NASDAQ, volume was 862.3 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about upcoming earnings reports helped to move big
semiconductor stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, a component of the S&AMP;P 500, gained 3 5/8, to 96 5/8.
Intel, a NASDAQ component, gained 13/16, to 76 1/2. Both companies
are expected to announce their third-quarter results after the
market closes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm posted the biggest point gain among NASDAQ stocks. It
was up 8 9/16, at 222 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of cellular phones and semiconductors said it expects
Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd., the satellite telephone
operator that it is supplying with equipment, to have 600,000
customers by the end of its first year in business.
</P>
<P>
   Of the NASDAQ composite stocks, Yahoo! was the biggest loser.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Internet directory company fell 10 3/4 to 181 3/8
after restrictions on certain of its executives expired, freeing
them to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, bank and airline stocks retreated Monday following a
few sessions of solid gains.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan dropped 1 3/4 to 73 13/16. J.P. Morgan, a Dow
stock, fell 2 9/16 to 115 9/16. And Bank of America dropped 1
11/16, to 54 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Among airline stocks, UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines,
slipped 1 3/4, to 68. AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, lost
2 7/16, to 60 7/16. And Delta Airlines fell 1 11/16, to 52 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. gained 7/8 to 53 after the automaker reached a
tentative agreement on a new four-year contract with the United
Auto Workers. The agreement averted what could have been the first
nationwide UAW strike at Ford in more than two decades.

COMMENTARY: SOMETHING RICH AND STRANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What a contradictory country this is. More than any
other, it has always been open to new ideas, to change. Looking to
the future instead of the past, it has made itself a great force,
not just in world markets but in the world of ideas. Yet there is
also an America locked in rigid certainties and shibboleths.
</P>
<P>
   That other part of our divided national character, the second
America, is displayed in the effort to put the Bible ahead of
science in schools. The advocates speak of ``creation science,''
replacing the Darwinian theory that life forms evolved over
millions of years with the biblical account that God created the
earth and its creatures in six days.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us thought the attempt to stifle the teaching of
evolution was a fringe phenomenon. Hadn't it been effectively
disabled by the Scopes trial three-quarters of a century ago?
</P>
<P>
   Then, in August, the Kansas Board of Education voted to
downgrade the teaching of evolution in public schools. A new
curriculum it approved removed evolution from the state tests that
students have to take.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas board also took aim at the science of the cosmos,
voting to delete from its standards the Big Bang theory of how the
universe originated around 15 billion years ago. James Glanz of The
New York Times, in an article this week, called attention to the
even more sweeping effects of that aspect of the board's action.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists argue that the earth is only a few thousand years
old. That view calls into question many fundamentals of science
today, such as radiocarbon dating _ which shows that rocks on our
planet are millions of years old. Indeed, the whole scientific
understanding of the universe would have to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The creationist position is certainly not a fringe belief
nowadays. A Gallup poll taken in June for CNN and USA Today found
that 68 percent of those surveyed favored teaching creationism
along with evolution in public schools; 40 percent favored dropping
evolution altogether and teaching children only the biblical
version of creation.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking American politicians have taken to condemning the
idea of evolution. After the massacre in Columbine High School in
Colorado in April, Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, put the
blame on the teaching of children ``that they are nothing but
glorified apes who are evolutionized out of some primordial soup of
mud.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument made against teaching evolution, in Kansas and
elsewhere, is that no one was there to see how life began _ and
students should be given only firsthand evidence. In Alabama,
consistent with that view, all students are warned: ``No one was
present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement
about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course evolution is a theory. The whole ethos of science is
that any explanation for the myriad mysteries in our universe is a
theory, subject to challenge and experiment. That is the scientific
method.
</P>
<P>
   Those who take the biblical account of creation literally reject
the scientific method, offering instead a doctrine of faith. There
are ``creation scientists'' who argue that the Bible can be squared
with scientific observations of, for example, the age of the
universe. But they are not taken seriously by most scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting question is why a large body of opinion in the
United States supports a view at such odds with contemporary
scientific understanding. No other Western country has anything
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Religious fundamentalists have played an important part in
America from the earliest settlements. And religious belief is much
stronger in the United States today than in other Western
societies. But belief does not usually, elsewhere, lead to opposing
the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps rejection of the scientific method reflects a turning
away from unhappy aspects of our contemporary society _ greed,
vulgarity and the like. Some Americans think we are, as the title
of Robert Bork's book puts it, ``Slouching Towards Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about aspects of American life is fair enough. But
depriving children of the great ideas of science cannot make things
better. We thought we had advanced since Galileo was silenced for
advancing the theory that the earth revolves around the sun.  &QL;

IN MIDEAST, 2 RED SOX FANS KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ David Forman and Nadim Khoury are among the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Forman, a rabbi born in Belmont, Mass., and Khoury, a
Palestinian brewer of beer who lived in Brookline, Mass., count
themselves part of a community of believers who see Fenway Park as
a holy place and who believe in the Red Sox' promise of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   They may come from different religions and opposing sides of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but they both proclaim allegiance to
Red Sox Nation. And they are part of its diaspora _ countless
thousands worldwide with connections to Boston who understand the
longing and the suffering that comes with another autumn and
another shot at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, these two men found themselves in the predawn
darkness following the game on the World Wide Web, hoping that this
year might be different.
</P>
<P>
   Forman, a 55-year-old pillar of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations and a founder of the group Rabbis for Peace, was born
into the Fenway tribe. He grew up in Belmont and remembers the
first game he attended, in 1950, when he sat in the bleachers and
watched in awe the signature swing of Ted Williams and the pitching
of Mel Parnell. He is now an ``orthodox Red Sox fan'' and a
``Reform rabbi'' who immigrated to Israel in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that time of year again,'' said Forman. ``I can feel it.
The tension is rising, the nervousness. Through it all, you keep
the faith somehow. I guess that is what defines being a Red Sox
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Khoury, the 40-year-old Christian Palestinian owner and general
manager of Taybeh Brewing Co., became a Sox fan, like many others,
as a college student. In 1979, he moved from the West Bank to
Brookline to take business courses at Boston University and to work
at Foley's Liquors, a store owned by his family that sits in the
Whiskey Point section of Brookline, within sight of the Fenway Park
light towers. Waves of Fenway faithful would sweep down the streets
on their way to the games, and soon he was caught up in a tidal
pull toward the great American game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand it for a long time. But then you get it,
and it makes its way into your soul,'' said Khoury. ``We were
fairly warned about what we were in for as Red Sox fans. But for
us, the Red Sox were about more than baseball. They are our
connection to Boston, and because of that very important to our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges as a fan living in the Middle East is
keeping up on the games in a region where ESPN is harder to find
than water in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Since Forman came in 1972, he has tried desparately to stay
abreast of the scores and the standings. Through the 1970s and
1980s, he got his baseball news from the International Herald
Tribune, which publishes scores a day late. Sometimes he'd call his
brother in Framingham for updates. He said there were many
occasions late at night when he would resort to calling directory
assistance in Boston and asking operators if they had the game on.
The arrival of CNN changed that. And now he even finds himself
surfing various Web sites for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Khoury returned to his hometown in the West Bank in 1994 after
the signing of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and
founded a very successful brewery. His 8-year-old, Brookline-born
son has inherited a passion for the Red Sox that he shares with a
group of cousins from the family's village of Taybeh. Their rooms
are covered with Red Sox banners and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Forman and Khoury don't know each other. But they share a common
language and a family of patriarchs with names like Williams,
Yastrzemski, and Martinez. They measure history in a timetable
marked by 1967, 1975, and 1986. They share a hope in the future.
And both see in the Red Sox a reflection of their ethnic
identities.
</P>
<P>
   Forman discusses the Red Sox in terms of his Jewish faith and
the ``olam haba,'' which is Hebrew for ``the world to come.'' He is
painfully aware that the idea of Red Sox victory in the World
Series anytime soon is a wish not grounded in reality. As a rabbi
and Talmudic scholar, he said, ``There is too much reality with the
Red Sox to believe that it will come in this world. But I hope for
another place, a transcendent place where a World Series title
could happen. And that belief has to sustain us.''
</P>
<P>
   Khoury compares the resiliency of Red Sox fans to that of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox story is like the Palestinian story,'' said
Khoury. ``It is taking too long, and there are a lot of
frustrations along the way. But the point is to keep trying, to
never give up. And then it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Insh'allah,'' he said in Arabic. ``God willing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Gunter Blobel, a cellular and molecular biologist
at Rockefeller University in New York City, won the 1999 Nobel
Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering that proteins carry
signals that act as ZIP codes, helping them find their correct
locations within the cell.
</P>
<P>
   The research that Blobel has conducted for 30 years has had an
``immense impact'' on studies of the cell and helps explain the
molecular mechanisms behind diseases like cystic fibrosis, a
condition that creates a certain type of kidney stone in young
children, and other hereditary illnesses, the Nobel Assembly of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm announced.
</P>
<P>
   There are a billion protein molecules in an average human cell.
Cells are constantly dividing or being repaired to replace those
damaged or lost to everyday wear and tear. The mystery that Blobel
helped solve was learning how the cells regulate internal traffic
so the protein molecules ``go to the right address,'' he said in an
interview in his office at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Klausner, the head of the National Cancer Institute,
said many advances in recent decades, including his own research,
was in some way derived from Blobel's findings. ``Gunter's work in
many ways initiated the whole modern era of what we call molecular
cell biology,'' Klausner said in an interview. ``It began to merge
the observational approaches of cell biology, looking, describing
structure'' and so scientists could ``figure out how molecular
information underlies the structure and functioning of the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20th Nobel Prize awarded to scientists associated
with Rockefeller University, reflecting its strength in basic
science.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel, who recalled witnessing the bombing of Dresden as a
child, said he was donating most of the $960,000 in prize money to
the Friends of Dresden, an independent American group that supports
the reconstruction, restoration and preservation of Dresden's
artistic and architectural legacy. The group is helping rebuild the
Frauenkirche, a bell-shaped church that was a fixture in pre-war
Dresden. Blobel, who is not Jewish, said he is also donating part
of the award to reconstruction of a synagogue in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the firebombing destruction of Dresden from very near,''
Blobel said, ``only a few kilometers away; for an eight and a half
year old, this was all very impressive. The bombing was so bright
that you could read the newspaper by the red sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three days earlier, Blobel's mother had shown him the
architectural beauty of Dresden, a scene that stimulated Brobel's
life-long interest in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel's father was a veterinarian who had one of the few
functioning cars in the area, which the family used to pass through
the rubble. In the last days of the war, one of his sisters was
killed, and the seven surviving siblings were left under Russian
occupation in the East German state of Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   Young Gunter graduated from high school ``with highest grades,
although he never studied very much,'' his oldest brother, Dr. Hans
Blobel, said in a telephone interview from his home in Geissen,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he couldn't continue to study because he didn't want _
none of us wanted _ to join the Communist youth parties,'' he said.
In the early 1950s, Blobel escaped to the West through Berlin. He
became a U.S. citizen in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel is a tall, kindly man with an impressive shock of white
hair, an appearance that ``has lent an air of authority to his
lectures,'' Klausner said.
</P>
<P>
   It was among the reasons that colleagues had long told him that
he deserved the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. Initially,
Blobel said he believed them. ``But as the years passed and I
didn't get a phone call, I didn't believe it anymore,'' Blobel said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel learned of his Nobel award shortly before 5 a.m. on
Monday. His wife, Laura Maioglio, who is accustomed to the phone
ringing at odd hours as the owner of Barbetta's restaurant in
midtown Manhattan, said she told the caller: ``Dr. Blobel is
sleeping.'' The caller responded: ``We have to speak to him. Wake
hi
</P>
<P>
   Blobel knew the award was being announced on Monday, and when he
took the call, he first thought it was a prank. Then he realized
none of the many foreign scientists in his laboratory was Swedish
or could mimic a Swedish accent well. He quickly recognized the
voice of Nils Ringertz, the secretary of the Nobel Committee, and
knew the award was real, recognition of his three decades of
doggedly pursuing a line of research that many scientists,
including colleagues at Rockefeller University, told him was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel was born in 1936 in Waltersdorf, Silesia, Germany, now
part of Poland. After earning a medical degree from the University
of Tubingen, he interned at a small hospital where he said he
``realized that treatment of disease was irrational and not based
on profound knowledge'' and that his interest was in research.

PLAN TO SELL GHANA MINE IS IN LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Every silver lining has a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   A recent surge in gold prices has tarnished Pioneer Group Inc.'s
plan to sell its loss-making African mine, after a wrong-way bet on
bullion left the would-be buyer short of cash for the deal, sources
familiar with the matter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana had teamed up with Gold Fields Ltd.,
a leading South African miner, to bid jointly for Pioneer's
Teberebie Goldfields operations, also in Ghana. Industry analysts
have said the once-profitable mine is worth from $50 million to
$100 million, even with the $40 million or so in debt it carries.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said talks, near completion last month, had come to
naught, as a troubled Ashanti sold itself Monday to a competitor,
Britain's Lonmin PLC. Ashanti's struggle to meet creditors' demands
following a surprise spike in gold prices made it vulnerable to a
takeover and in no shape to finance an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of the Teberebie sale is a blow to troubled
Pioneer, which has struggled for years to get rid of its
money-losing mine and has frustrated investors in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a setback,'' said Michael S. Beall, who
covers the Boston-based investment management company for Davenport
&AMP; Co. ``But things are not over yet.'' He said Pioneer could sell
Teberebie to a joint venture grouping Ashanti-Lonmin and
Gold-fields in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   A Pioneer spokesman, Timothy Frost, declined to comment. Hours
after questions from The Boston Globe, Pioneer issued a statement
saying it would wind down its operations at Teberebie, cutting back
mining in coming months and ceasing gold-processing entirely in the
first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The moves would cause Pioneer to report ``a substantial
write-down of its investment'' in the mine for the third quarter,
the statement said. Pioneer said it was still in negotiations to
sell the mine. It expects to report third-quarter earnings in early
November.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer is an eclectic mutual fund company with an unusual
collection of other operations, including a Siberian timber farm,
Moscow real estate, and fund operations in Eastern Europe, India,
and Taiwan. In the past, Pioneer's nonfund businesses made a lot of
money, but they have since become a major drag on the company's
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Once a high-flier, Pioneer has upset investors by posting losses
for several straight quarters. Pioneer lost $25.2 million in the
second quarter, most of it from the gold mine, and has all but
closed down its Russian investment operations. The company lost
$41.2 million in 1998, half from the mine, which has been plagued
by production glitches and low commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under president John F. Cogan Jr., 72, Pioneer has undergone
several management shakeups and restructurings in recent months and
has vowed to be more selective about its noninvestment operations.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors have conspired against the company. Mirroring
an industrywide trend, Pioneer's assets under management shrank to
just under $21 billion at the end of August, according to Financial
Research Corp. Pioneer had net redemptions, or withdrawals, from
its mutual funds of $114 million in August.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer shares surged briefly last month when precious metal
prices rose, but they have since fallen back. The company, one of
about two dozen publicly traded investment management firms, is
down 26.6 percent so far this year. It now trades at around 14 1/2,
barely one-third of its August 1997 high.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti had staked its immediate financial future on a flat gold
market, taking out contracts betting that prices would stay low.
The agreements, some written earlier this year when gold was at a
20-year low, were designed to protect against losses and ensure the
firm made money even in a limp market.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, gold suddenly soared to a two-year high of $338
an ounce as central banks across Europe promised to limit sales to
boost prices. The surge left Ashanti vulnerable to banks' requests
that it put up cash as collateral for the contracts. The demands,
known as margin calls, left Ashanti struggling to find more than
$250 million to pay creditors and led to its takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer has been trying to get rid of part or all of its gold
mine for nearly five years. A 1995 plan to float shares in the
operation on exchanges in London and Ghana collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Beall said Pioneer's board was keen to see results improve
quickly. ``It's kind of sad to say,'' he said, ``but they ought to
just think about selling the whole company.''

 NEW YORK: in research. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the time, his brother, Hans, was on the faculty of the
University of Wisconsin on a Fulbright Scholarship. Hans advised
Gunter that his medical training was insufficient to do research,
that American universities were ahead of their German counterparts
because of the war, and that he should come to Madison. Gunter
Blobel did, and earned a Ph.D. there in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Blobel moved to Rockefeller University as a
post-doctoral fellow largely because he wanted to work with Dr.
George E. Palade, a pioneering cell biologist. ``My work was a
direct extension of the work Dr. Palade had started at
Rockefeller,'' Blobel said of Palade, who went on to win a Nobel
Prize in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, scientists had used the electron microscope and
other techniques to describe the structure of the cell, Blober
recalled. They learned that a cell contains many different
structures known as organelles that carry out different functions.
Each organelle is surrounded by a membrane.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists did not know how the cell worked. A particular
mystery was how large proteins could get through the tightly sealed
membranes surrounding the organelles.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel reasoned that proteins have to be transported either out
of the cell, or to the different organelles. Such transport had to
be highly regulated, or the cell would be wide open to damage from
things entering from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Blobel and Dr. David D. Sabatini, who now heads cell
biology at New York University School of Medicine, proposed a bold
idea known as the signal hypothesis. It was that ``proteins
secreted out of a cell contain an intrinsic signal that governs
them to and across membranes,'' the Nobel Assembly said in its
citation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years, with support from the National
Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
Blobel and his team have conducted experiments to prove the
existence of programmed steps that allow molecules to move from one
part of the cell to another, and directed to their proper location.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prize was awarded not for a single major discovery,
but for the series of findings in the decades that it took to prove
the hypothesis, Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Blobel's team found the intrinsic signal they were
seeking, in a protein found in one organelle known as the
endoplasmic reticulum.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel found that each newly made protein has an
organelle-specific address, a stretch of the protein called a
signal sequence, that is recognized by receptors on an organelle's
surface. His team showed that in the endoplasmic reticulum, the
binding of the signal sequence to its receptor opens a watery
channel in the membrane through which the protein can travel.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel also characterized in detail the molecular mechanisms
underlying the processes and showed that they were universal,
operating similarly in yeast, plant and animal cells.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Rockefeller University on Monday, Blobel
said there were many disappointments in the 30 years of research
``such as when your grants and papers are rejected because some
stupid reviewer rejected them for dogmatic adherence to old
ideas.'' His remarks drew thunderous applause from sympathetic
colleagues and younger scientists who packed the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps you going are the little blips of excitement every
three to four years,'' Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists know that the cell works because it sorts its
proteins and directs them to the right places to carry out various
functions. Some proteins become building blocks for constructing
the cell. Others function as enzymes catalyzing thousands of
specific chemical reactions. Without the little signals Blobel
hypothesized, the cell would cease to function. Scientists alw that a number of hereditary diseases are caused by errors in
these signals and transport mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel is still working, trying to unravel the trafficking of
signals between the cell's nucleus and cytoplasm. A knowledge of
how such communication goes on in normal cells is necessary to
understand what goes awry in cancerous cells, Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   His research has contributed to the development of a more
effective use of cells as ``protein factories'' for the production
of important drugs such as erythropoeitin. It helps stimulate the
production of red blood cells in the bone marrow and is used widely
in many kidney and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel said that with more research he expected that scientists
would unravel the mysteries of how brain cells are damaged by
Alzheimer's disease, blood cells are destroyed by the AIDS virus
and other infections, and normal cells become malignant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As long as we do not know how the cell works we don't know the
kind of havoc the AIDS virus creates in the cell,'' Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel said his work has not found any cures and that there will
not be specific treatments for many cancers and other diseases
until scientists gain that fundamental understanding. ``We are very
far from it,'' Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel credited Rockefeller University's focus on basic research
for the last century in providing him the teaching and work
environment to make his discoveries. He thanked his his wife, Laura
Maioglio, for ``tolerating my long hours in the lab.'' ``Our
schedules meshed because she worked late at the restaurant and that
gave me the opportunity to come home late from the lab.''

 &HT;    Browns-Bengals matchup played second fiddle to Couch-Smith drama
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio_ Sounding defiant but looking a bit shellshocked,
Tim Couch returned to work Monday winless as a starting quarterback
after Sunday's bitterly disappointing 18-17 loss to the Cincinnati
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Couch did not play horribly, but against the backdrop of draft
classmate Akili Smith's heroics and subequent theatrics, he
definitely played second fiddle in his own stadium _ and it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks ago, the expansion Browns, not to mention their fans,
identified the Bengals as a team that easily could become their
first victim. And if Smith, a rookie, were to make his first NFL
start, then so much the better, many thought. They didn't count on
Smith doing his best John Elway impersonation and marching the
Bengals 80 yards in the last two minutes for the winning score, a
two-yard TD pass to Carl Pickens. They didn't count on being 0-5
going into Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to tough it out,'' said Couch, at the helm of an
offense that has scored 43 points this season. ``I feel like I'm
learning a lot, but just not getting a lot of results. I'm not
shaken. I'm not going to just give up. I knew it was going to be a
tough deal and I'm just going to go out and prepare like I always
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, motivated by what he regards as a draft-day injustice
committed by the Browns, completed 25 of 41 passes for 221 yards
and two touchdowns. Couch, selected two spots ahead of Smith with
the No. 1 overall pick, connected on 15 of 27 for 164 yards and was
intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Not wasting an opportuity to pour salt into any wound he could
find, Smith danced around and gestured toward the Browns' bench
afterward, infuriating Couch, who all week had made a point of
staying above the fray as others built up the rookie quarterbacks'
first encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. You want to fire back at him for the little things
that he's said and done,'' Couch said. ``But you've just got to
stay out of it. I don't think he means anything personal toward me
or anything. I don't really care about it, to be honest with you.
He can do all he wants and say all he wants. I'm just going to keep
playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Couch benefit from sitting out a game? He doesn't think
so. More importantly, neither does head coach Chris Palmer. Nor,
for that matter, does Ty Detmer, the man Couch supplanted as the
starter in Week 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel they need to stick with Tim,'' Detmer said. ``He's your
guy. He needs to learn. You can't beat game experience as a
learning tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns moved the ball well at times Sunday. Then there were
those other times. Count Couch among those baffled by the offense's
inability to convert on third down, especially in short-yardage
situations. ``I don't know what the deal is with that,'' he said.
Three times Sunday they failed on 3rd-and-1. The last and most
devastating of these directly preceded Cincinnati's winning score
as running back George Jones went off tackle for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no specific problem,'' fullback Marc Edwards said. ``It's
one guy breaking down here, one guy there. It's extremely
frustrating. Tim didn't have a bad day. It was the offense in
general. It makes you sick to your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the offense needs to adopt a ``more vicious''
attitude on third down. ``If you need one yard, you've got to get
the damn thing,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter if they have 20 guys
trying to stop us, it's up to us to get that accomplished. It's one
damn yard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Browns' case, the longest yard.

 &HT;    Ohio legislation aims to improve foster care system
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Children languishing in unsafe, dirty or
dilapidated foster homes may finally get help from state lawmakers
who have littered the General Assembly with legislation that
targets the flawed foster system.
</P>
<P>
   Five foster care bills have already been introduced, and now a
state lawmaker has vowed to create additional legislation that
would force state or local governments to conduct random
inspections of both private and county-run foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tolerated abysmal conditions that no child should be
living in, just because they are foster kids doesn't make them
throw-aways in society,'' said state Rep. Jeff Jacobson,
R-Phillipsburg. ``The government needs to make sure those foster
homes are being inspected, it's something we should have been doing
all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal follows a series of articles in The Dayton Daily
News detailing problems in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, for instance, no public body inspects foster homes
offered through private placement agencies. The state doesn't
conduct random inspections. And counties that place a child through
a private agency will typically follow up on a placement, but do so
by appointment and concentrate on the care of the child, not the
living environment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the New York-based Council on Accreditation, the
principal accrediting organization for foster care agencies, does
not normally also does not perform routine inspect ions of homes as
part of the accreditation process. Council officials, however, say
they are now considering new standards for accrediation that would
include random foster home inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said his legislation would require the Ohio Department
of Human Services to create a system that ensures both private and
county-sponsored foster homes are being checked randomly. The
actual inspections would be conducted by either state or county
social workers or private inspectors depending on which system the
state chooses. Under Jacobson's plan, private agencies would pay
for the inspections of their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government needs to be accountable for these kids and
where they are living,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson has also introduced legislation that would force
non-profit agencies, including private foster care agencies, to
separate their public and private funds. All records of public
funds would be considered public records and open to inspection.
The bill would also increase penalties for the misuse of public
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Problems in foster care have also caught the attention of Ohio
Gov. Bob Taft who called for the state to do more for foster
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area that has been ignored for a long time and the
state needs to do much more than it's doing now,'' Taft said in a
recent meeting with Daily News reporters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   Taft cited the current efforts of the Department of Human
Services and state Auditor Jim Petro to crack down on and monitor
the operations of private agencies. Some of the state initiatives
include:
</P>
<P>
   Auditing about 25 private foster care agencies, which account
for about 80 percent of all children placed with private agencies
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a Shareholders Group, which includes nine
subcommittees that, with the Department of Human Services, will
lead a sweeping review of the current foster home licensing system.
Department officials estimate that more than 400 people are
currently working on correcting the state's foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a foster care tracking system that's designed to better
monitor complaints about foster care providers and what is being
done to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of kids and the severity of their problems are
overwhelming us,'' Taft said. ``That's not an (excuse) for thestate. It's more proof that much of this goes back to the break
down of families.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he supports one proposed law introduced by Ohio House
Minority Leader Jack Ford, D-Toledo, that would require criminal
background checks of foster parents and increase trair
family foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Other pending bills would establish a team that reviews the
death of any Ohio foster child; require case workers to make at
least one unannounced visit every six months in protective
supervision cases; and set up a system for regular state audits of
private agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is one of many states scrambling to reform foster care
systems in desperate need of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News found that private foster care agencies across
the country operate with little government oversight and have
little financial incentive to run quality homes. With a nationwide
shortage of foster homes, children may be taken from abusive or
neglectful families only to be moved from foster home to foster
home, or placed in filthy homes in run-down neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foster care systems are a mess all over the country, I don't
think there is a single state that does this well,'' said Ben Wolf,
an ACLU attorney in Chicago, who represented the state's foster
children in a lawsuit against Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are voicless and often helpless to tell the right
people when they are living in rat holes.''

 &HT;    Galileo gets past tricky time in Jupiter orbit
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ Launched a decade ago, the Galileo spacecraft
and its locally built nuclear generators survived their riskiest
moment yet Monday in the spacecraft's mission around Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo passed within 380 miles of Io, Jupiter's innermost large
moon, just after 1 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time Monday, braving a
region of such intense radiation that mission controllers feared
the craft might not survive.
</P>
<P>
   No problems were reported, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was good news for Gary Morris, project manager for isotope
power systems at the Mound plant in Miamisburg. The Department of
Energy Plant, operated by contractor Babcock and Wilcox of Ohio, is
where Galileo's nuclear generators were assembled, fueled and
tested in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said his program's work on Galileo is long since
finished, but he and others still follow the mission on the
Internet and in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're getting pictures and signals back, it says
the RTGs (radioisotopic thermoelectric generators) are doing their
jobs,'' Morris said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   RTGs convert the heat from decaying plutonium fuel into
electricity. Space probes to the outer solar system use RTGs
because their missions are too long for batteries and are too far
from the sun for solar cells to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion spacecraft was launched in 1989 and reached
Jupiter in 1995. It completed its primary mission in 1997, but the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., has been operating
it for NASA on an extended mission that runs out in January.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, JPL spokeswoman Jane Platt said the spacecraft
was still functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still talking to (mission controllers,)'' she said.
``They worked around the radiation and made some science
observations.''
</P>
<P>
   Io interests scientists because it is the most volcanically
active body in the solar system, but Jupiter's powerful magnetic
fields bathe the satellite in radiation that can interfere with
sensors and damage electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Back on earth, Morris' program at Mound has survived periodic
attempts by the Energy Department to relocate it from the Mound,
which is being converted to a high-tech industry park.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the Energy Department recently decided to keep the
RTG program at Mound and plans to build new RTG facilities there.
NASA is working on plans for space probes to Pluto and one to study
Jupiter's moon Europa. Morris said both would use RTGs.

   WASHINGTON _ Anyone trying to understand who holds power in the
nation's capital need only look in one place: the owner's box at
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, home of the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as anyone can remember, the owner's-box guest list
has been dominated by prominent government officials and media
stars.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Redskins played the archrival Dallas Cowboys last
month, a new figure joined the Washington elite, reflecting a
cultural sea change for this city.
</P>
<P>
   Seated next to the team owner, Dan Snyder, was the leader of a
local business, Stephen Case, the billionaire chief executive of
America Online, which has its headquarters in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For its entire history, Washington has been viewed by most
Americans as a swampy den of political intrigue. The capital's
culture, sometimes derisively called inside-the-Beltway, is seen as
a narrow world of bureaucrats and politicians, lawyers and
lobbyists, all feeding off the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But quietly over the last several years a new,
outside-the-Beltway culture has grown up in and around this city _
so quietly, in fact, that even longtime residents are generally
unaware of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Now Washington and its suburbs are home to far more
entrepreneurs and other business people than federal workers and
the assorted private companies and institutions connected to the
government. In fact, by at least one measure, Washington is now the
technological capital of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, vast high-tech corridors with
thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of employees have
grown up in the city and its Virginia and Maryland suburbs. Now
these Internet, computer services, telecommunications, aerospace
and biotechnology companies employ more than 470,000 people, easily
outnumbering the roughly 350,000 people employed by the federal
government, for two centuries the base of this city's work force.
</P>
<P>
   Several local and national studies have also shown that these
rapidly growing high-tech companies employ more technology workers
_ engineers, scientists and other technical employees _ than the
companies in California's Silicon Valley or Boston's Route 128
technology corridor. These two areas have long been regarded as the
most important technological centers of the United States. And by
other significant measures, including manufacturing and industry
profits, they remain so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Washington area, with more than 9,000 technology
companies, has come to be an important and growing national player
_ easily outdistancing, by most measures, other technology clusters
including those in New York City; Austin, Texas; and Research
Triangle in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area is exploding; we have some of the best talent in the
industry right here,'' effused Lou Scanlon, chief executive of
UUCom Inc., one of the many small Internet engineering companies in
suburban Virginia that have experienced growth in revenue of
several hundred percent a year for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Annual studies by Washington Technology magazine show that the
area's 50 fastest-growing high-tech companies, most of them quite
small, earned $55 million in 1993 and $1.32 billion last year, a
24-fold increase.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The challenge, and the potential to grow rich, is tempting even
some senior government officials _ who normally would walk through
the revolving door to a comfortable position as an industry
lobbyist _ to become local entrepreneurs instead. In a city where
the goal has always been to acquire political power, the
acquisition of capital and the entrepreneurial spirit have been
permeating and changing the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Moss, for example, held senior positions in politics and
government for 20 years. Her jobs included finance director for the
Democratic National Committee and director of the Office of
Business Liaison at the Commerce Department. But when she left
government three years ago, she decided to start a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted finally to run something of my own,'' Ms. Moss
explained. So she started the Women's Consumer Network, which
offers advice and special deals to its members, primarily through a
Web site. Her company is small, with just 12 full-time employees,
but CBS recently announced it would invest $50 million in the
company. Ms. Moss said that she often receives calls from friends
still in politics and government who want to follow her path into
business and that she does not miss their world a bit.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online, the largest and most important technology
company in the region, most members of the public relations staff,
among others, are emigres from politics or government. One, Andrew
Weinstein, had worked for Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich. But his new
job, Weinstein noted, felt eerily familiar. ``Like a campaign, it's
long hours with an incredibly fast pace,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   The transformation of this area has not changed downtown
Washington much, if at all. There, clearly, government remains the
dominant force. And Washington's poor residents have benefited
little, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who takes the time to turn off the Dulles Airport
toll road in suburban Virginia, or Interstate 270 just over the
city line in Maryland, the change is obvious. Unassuming low-slung
office buildings line the roads for mile after mile, with names
like Proxicom, PSInet and Digital Fusion Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the assorted cars and trucks in the parking garages is a
healthy sprinkling of late-model, 500-series BMWs and similar cars,
along with an occasional Corvette _ visible fruits of recent
initial public offerings of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Construction cranes dot the horizon. And local newspapers list
page after page of help-wanted ads for computer programmers,
systems analysts and software engineers. Personnel executives at
several of these companies estimate that the area has 30,000 to
50,000 unfilled new positions for technology workers, while federal
government employment has remained stagnant for years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Amazon.com, the Internet retailer based in Seattle,
confirmed that it would build a second national data center, in
suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Washington denizens are not aware that the character
of their city has changed.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, founded here 11 years ago, is now the United
States' largest Internet service provider. The company, with 18
million subscribers and 12,500 employees, is continuing to grow at
an astounding pace, endowing its workers with stock options that
have made thousands of them quite wealthy. Local real estate agents
and auto dealers say they wait and pray for an ``AOL millionaire''
to walk in.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when George Vradenburg III, a senior vice president for
AOL, drives downtown for meetings, quite often he is asked, ``So,
when did you fly in?''
</P>
<P>
   The Seeds
</P>
<P>
   Computer Networks Began in Government
</P>
<P>
   Although most of these companies do little if any business with
the federal government, many of them acknowledge that without the
government, a high-technology center might never have grown up
here.
</P>
<P>
   Many years before the term ``Internet'' was coined, the Defense
Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency was creating a
national computer network enabling computers at the Pentagon to
communicate with others across the country. From this, the Internet
evolved, meaning that many industry pioneers were here.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington has long been home to a large
concentration of defense contractors, like Lockheed Martin and
General Dynamics Corp., as well as aerospace companies, including
Comsat and Orbital Sciences Corp. They located here to be close to
their customers, the Defense Department, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and the National Security Agency, among
other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a rich concentration of biomedical research
institutions grew up around the National Institutes of Health and
the Food and Drug Administration labs in suburban Maryland. When
human genome research grew to be a cutting-edge topic in the 1980s,
many of these companies took up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As for telecommunications, MCI, now the nation's second-largest
long-distance phone company, opened here in 1969 to be close to the
Federal Communications Commission and other government agencies
that were managing the deregulation of the telephone industry. As
MCI expanded, a cluster of smaller companies grew up around it.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the government grew ever more dependent on
computerization, and a large network of computer-service companies
known as system integrators evolved to install and service the
agencies' vast computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   So the seeds were here, thousands of engineers and scientists
working in the Washington area, principally on government contract.
Then, early in this decade, events conspired to roil this mix. The
Cold War ended, forcing the defense and aerospace companies to
scale back. Through the early 1990s, government employment stopped
growing, and the number of government contracts began to shrink in
number and size.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, just as the Internet started to become a commercial
phenomenon, thousands of engineers with vast experience in related
technologies began looking for new work.
</P>
<P>
   From their early ventures a larger concentration of technology
businesses gradually began to grow, because metropolitan
Washington, with nearly 5 million people, had the character and
infrastructure to support it.
</P>
<P>
   As an overwhelmingly white-collar town, Washington has a higher
percentage of college and graduate-school graduates than any other
city, according to census figures. It has long had among the
highest per capita incomes of any major metropolitan area; eight
local universities, and excellent public school systems in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the early days, sustaining a technology business here
was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Foothold
</P>
<P>
   Luring Workers Proves Slow
</P>
<P>
   Raul Fernandez was an aide to Rep. Jack Kemp in the mid-1980s.
He helped research tax legislation and got involved in debates on
financing for the rebels in Nicaragua. At the same time, he worked
on the office's computers, just because he was interested, allowing
him to meet workers from some of the local system-integration
companies that served the government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he left Kemp for a job with a local system integrator,
and in 1991 Fernandez used money he had saved for a house to open
his own system-integration company, Proxima, looking for government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, he opened his business in suburban Virginia
because office rents were low and ``it was easy to get to because
it was counter-traffic. Rush hour was going the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But hiring was tough. ``Who wanted to move here?'' he asked. For
most technology workers then, Washington was not even on the map.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Fernandez decided to change the focus of his
business to Internet consulting and engineering. He renamed it
Proxicom, and quickly the company began to grow.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, hundreds of other companies had opened or moved nearby.
As a result, he said, echoing statements from other local
executives, ``there's now a critical mass. People are no longer
reluctant to move here, because they know they'll have flexibility
in job options. They can hop around.''
</P>
<P>
   Proxicom had 250 employees last year but now has almost 600 in
offices around the world. The company made an initial public
offering of stock last spring. It opened at $18.88 on April 20 and
closed Monday evening at $67.25, giving Proxicom a market
capitalization in excess of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what percentage of his business now is government
contracts, Fernandez smiled and said, ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Full Circle
</P>
<P>
   Banding Together for Political Clout
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, five or six network camera crews are stationed in
front of the Capitol and White House,'' noted Thomas Morr, managing
director of the Greater Washington Initiative, an arm of the board
of trade. ``People here and around the country think that's what
all the news from Washington is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But in subtler ways, Washington is beginning to feel the change.
</P>
<P>
   Case's invitation to the Redskins owner's box last month is just
one indication.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the technology companies are beginning to throw their
political weight around with the view that they, unlike their
counterparts on the West Coast, understand and appreciate politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I happen to be in Washington is lucky, because I came to
this job already knowing the power of organizing constituent
groups,'' said Ms. Moss, the former Democratic National Committee
official who recently entertained President Clinton at her
Georgetown home at a get-together with high-tech executives.
</P>
<P>
   And Vradenburg, who worked for CBS in New York and Fox
Television in Los Angeles before joining AOL in 1997, said:
``Washington, as it turns out, happens to be good place to
be. There's a very interesting mix of government, business and
media people here that produces much more interesting
conversations. And the policy-makers are here, the ones who need to
be informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of members of Congress make the 40-minute trip out to
AOL's campus just beyond Dulles Airport every week or two. They are
given a presentation on AOL's political issues and then each is
seated in front of a computer with a personal trainer, who explains
and demonstrates the Internet. Some of the members had never used
the Internet before.
</P>
<P>
   One, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the Commerce
Committee, is an aficionado of bow ties. When he made a trip to AOL
a few weeks ago, his trainer demonstrated the Internet and showed
the congressman several bow-tie Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, several of the area's largest technology
companies formed their own political action committee, called
Capnet. Vradenburg, who is co-chairman, said Capnet had 30 members
so far. All have made the maximum allowable contribution, $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's a total of $150,000, hardly a menacing war chest. But
``we're picking up steam at an amazing rate,'' said William Lecos,
a senior vice president with the Washington Board of Trade. Capnet
will contribute to national candidates who favor positions of
interest to the companies on issues like Internet privacy and
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The technology community is also trying to flex its political
muscle in local development debates, particularly on schools and
roads. A consortium of the companies is working to build support
for a new freeway, called the Techway, that would link the
technology corridors in Virginia and Maryland and reduce the
serious traffic problems that have grown up in the Dulles Airport
area along with all the new businesses. But the proposal has not
moved very far.
</P>
<P>
   Even with their growing political savvy, sometimes the
technology companies lose sight of the political realities
surrounding them. And so it was in August, when several thousand of
the Virginia companies formed a business coalition called Region.
It promptly called for, among other things, a sales-tax increase in
Northern Virginia of 1 percent to pay for new roads and schools.
The proposal crashed.
</P>
<P>
   With a shake of the head, Vradenburg ruefully acknowledged, ``It
was not well received.''

REVOLUTION MAY TAP GULATI FOR FRONT OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Revolution are on the verge of announcing the appointment of
Sunil Gulati as director of soccer operations. Gulati, 40, was
deputy commissioner of the MLS and was in charge of acquiring most
of the league's players from 1995 until he was fired before this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution owner Jonathan Kraft would not confirm Gulati's name
but said a decision will be made soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fix our soccer operation and to do that we want to
get the best soccer people we can,'' Kraft said Monday. ``We always
thought we were hiring the right people but it hasn't worked out
that way and it hasn't been fair to the fans. The fan support
proves there is a market for the product. We have had four years of
losing teams but if you look at the crowd (21,335) for our last
game, there is a real interest out there, and it is incumbent upon
us to get it right. Whoever we bring in will have international
ties and the ability to do deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution concluded their fourth season with a 1-1
regulation-time tie and shootout win at D.C. United Saturday night.
They have failed to advance to the playoffs in three of four
seasons and have an all-time record of 36-75-17. Walter Zenga was
fired as player-coach after 30 games this season and Steve Nicol
was interim coach the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in final discussions,'' general manager Brian O'Donovan
said. ``This person would make soccer decisions. The coach would be
like a general manager and would set the tone for the team, make
personnel decisions, travel plans, be responsible for how the team
looks _ basically like it happens in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid to make moves that will put us in the best
position to accomplish what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulati would hire the coach and be involved in personnel
decisions. Gulati, a former financial planner for the World Bank
and economics professor at Columbia University, likely would retain
his New York residency.
</P>
<P>
   As a US Soccer Federation executive, Gulati was a prime mover in
the US Cup competitions and was a member of the 1994 World Cup
Organizing Committee. When the MLS began, Gulati recruited players
such as Leonel Alvarez, Jorge Campos, Roberto Donadoni, Marco
Antonio Etcheverry, Giuseppe Galderisi, Doctor Khumalo, Hugo
Sanchez, Carlos Valderrama, and helped arrange for most of the top
American players to return to the US. Through contacts with agents
such as Giovanni Branchini, Gulati brought in young players such as
Brazilian forward Welton.
</P>
<P>
   Gulati has negotiated contracts for most of the players in the
league. But he was dismissed after a conflict with MetroStars'
investor Stuart Subotnick in February after signing Tab Ramos to a
contract extension at maximum salary.
</P>
<P>
   But Gulati also clashed with coaches and reporters in being
essentially player personnel director for 10 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution players will meet Tuesday, then return to training
camp in January. A preseason visit to Trinidad is likely before
camp opens Feb. 6-20 in Florida.

ITALIANS RELEASE NAMES OF 261 SOVIET `SPIES,' BUT THE DISCLOSURE
BACKFIRES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain)   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Hoping to stanch a growing spy scandal, an Italian
parliamentary committee made public a dossier Monday identifying
261 politicians, bureaucrats and journalists as having cooperated,
in some cases unwittingly, with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, however, mainly backfired on committee members, who
released the documents and then expressed regret for not having
first checked their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Cossuta, an Italian Communist leader whose party
supports the governing center-left coalition, was the most
prominent figure to appear in the documents, copied from Soviet
files by a KGB archivist and smuggled to British intelligence in
1992. The Italian government received a copy from Britain four
years ago, but did not act upon it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Cossuta scoffed at the spying charge, saying, ``Let's not be
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who had been badgered by
political opponents and some members of his own coalition to
release the information, declined last week and turned the files
over to magistrates to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   But, yielding to the pressure, Monday he gave a copy to a
parliamentary committee that investigates security matters, which
immediately decided to make the 650-page document public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we have not verified the authenticity and veracity
of the information contained in the documents,'' Giovanni
Pellegrino, head of the committee, said in a statement, ``the need
to inform public opinion prevailed over the individual right to
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the dossier was released, however, committee members
expressed regret. ``We should have verified the dossier first''
Pellegrino said, adding, ``I do not think we are doing a great
service in the name of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members warned that some reported KGB informants were
identified only by code names while still others were listed as
potential sources ``to be cultivated.'' Some were listed as
``unknowing informants.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called spy network included generals, a nuclear
physicist, foreign ministry typists and even a Roman Catholic monk.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco De Martino, 92, a professor and lifetime senator from
the Italian Socialist Party, was described in the dossier as
someone who could influence public opinion, but not as a KGB agent.
His name was nevertheless leaked by the committee a few hours
before the dossier was released. De Martino called the spy charge
``pure fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cossuta, 73, who now heads a splinter faction of the Communist
party known as the Party of Italian Communists, denied he ever
leaked state secrets to Moscow, but he did not deny contacts with
Soviet leaders, or charges that the Communist Party received money
from Moscow as late as 1987. Instead, he acidly recalled ``the
financial contributions received by many Italian political parties
from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The names were taken from files that a former KGB archivist,
Vasily Mitrokhin, handed to British intelligence in 1992 and that
formed the basis for a recently published book written by Mitrokhin
and a British scholar, Christopher Andrew, ``The Mitrokhin Archive:
The KGB in Europe and the West.'' The book identifies Italian
agents only by code names, but says that the KGB found Italy second
only to France as a source of information because of the popularity
of the Italian Communist Party after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrokhin's revelations caused a sensation in Britain, where an
87-year-old suburban grandmother was one of eight former government
employees, academics and journalists who gave away secrets to
Communist agents. None of the British informants were still in
government service and none had the kind of access likely to
seriously compromise British security.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, it was not immediately clear whether any of the people
identified as informants disclosed vital secrets, but the fact that
the investigating magistrates declined to keep the files secret
suggested that national security was not severely breached.
</P>
<P>
   Italians of all political stripes were mentioned in the files,
but overall the scandal was mostly dangerous for D'Alema, a former
Communist, who was accused by right-wing opposition leaders of
seeking to protect political allies. His predecessor, Romano Prodi,
who was prime minister from April 1996 to October 1998, said last
week that he had not known about the spy list, and repeated that
statement Monday. But Prodi's former defense secretary, Beniamino
Andreatta, said he had known of the documents as early as October
1996 and had passed the information on to Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a center-right
opposition leader who has been convicted three times of accounting
fraud, demanded last week that D'Alema reveal the names.
</P>
<P>
   But even Berlusconi was indirectly affected by the revelations:
His former spokesman, Jas Gawronski, was listed in the KGB dossier
as a desirable source ``to be cultivated.'' Gawronski, a
Polish-born journalist who is now an Italian senator, expressed
amusement at the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't wanted to cultivate me I would feel
discriminated against,'' he said. ``The KGB were criminals but they
were not stupid. They didn't want leftists, they wanted to use
people who were against them.''

CHIEFS REVEALED PATRIOTS' WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The blueprint for beating the New England Patriots
has been drawn and future opponents surely will try to follow it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a Frank Lloyd Wright creation. There is nothing fancy
or exotic about it. You run the ball and you run over their
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Do that and you may not win but you will have a chance to win. A
very good chance, in fact, if the Patriots play the next 11 games
the way they've played the first five. If you can rush the ball and
you can rush Drew Bledsoe like the Kansas City Chiefs did, you can
give these Patriots the bum's rush or at least be in position to,
and that may be the only way to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   You don't beat Bledsoe very often any more in shootouts. His arm
and his arsenal of weapons are too lethal. To beat him you must
engage in guerilla warfare. You must avoid direct confrontation
with New England's air force. You must keep its top gun grounded or
on the ground, both of which the Chiefs succeeded in doing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will do the rest. They will commit the penalties or
the crucial turnover or be unable to run the ball consistently or
find some odd way to make their lives difficult.
</P>
<P>
   These are failures they got away with for a month but kept
publicly acknowledging. They admitted they had not played
consistently very often during their 4-0 run to start the season.
They said this could not go on and then duplicated it the very next
Sunday until they finally ran into a team that could reduce 60
minutes of football to less than half that by pounding a weak
defensive front until it wore out. After it did, the Chiefs kept
pounding away, controlling the ball and limiting Bledsoe to seven
minutes and 12 seconds of offense in the final 30 minutes of a
tight game.
</P>
<P>
   When he did get the ball, the Chiefs went after Bledsoe hard and
got to him too often for him to play as well as he had in the four
victories. Not that he played poorly Sunday because he did not. He
played well enough to give his team a chance to win again at the
final gun as it had done three times this year. But the Patriots
are 19-1 in games in which Bledsoe has a rating of 100 or better
and Sunday it was 71.8, which was good but not good enough to
overcome Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Patriots were still in position to win on the
road with four seconds to play after committing six false starts,
turning the ball over four times, and allowing their quarterback to
get mugged spoke volumes about the team's abilities in general and
Bledsoe's in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Patriots lost on a missed field goal with four
seconds on the clock on a day when they could have won speaks
volumes as well, however, and they need to recognize that or they
will face the same fate whenever they engage teams that are their
equal or nearly so.
</P>
<P>
   The way to beat the Patriots is to not get into a beef with
Bledsoe. If you do, you lose, unless your quarterback is someone
like Brett Favre, in which case you still might lose but at least
you have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   If your quarterback is a mortal, say a Kent Graham or a Rick
Mirer or an Elvis Grbac or a Tim Couch, you almost always will
lose. That's true even for young Peyton Manning, the future fastest
gun in town, who lost a close one to Bledsoe this year after
playing about as well as a quarterback could.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye understood this and did
not try to buck it. He chose to run and his defense allowed him to
get away with it by doing the only thing you can to keep Bledsoe at
bay. It knocked him down.
</P>
<P>
   Sacked three times and bowled over 10 times three, Bledsoe's
effectiveness and accuracy slipped slightly. He had completed 70
percent of his second-half passes in the previous four games. In
this one he completed 50 percent. His team could not survive that.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he missed Shawn Jefferson open deep because he had to
unload the ball before he wanted or was less than comfortable when
he did because he was about to be decapitated. Had he hit those
plays instead of been hit, the Patriots lead by two or three
touchdowns and the Chiefs cannot run the ball 43 times and hence
they become the fifth victim of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't hit them because the Chiefs hit him. When they
finally stopped, Bledsoe hit back. After a second-half start in
which New England's first nine passes resulted in seven
incompletions, an interception, and a penalty, the Chiefs unwisely
decided to go soft for a time, dropping men into coverage and
rushing only four linemen. The result was Bledsoe completed nine of
his last 11 passes and led his team to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep somebody in his face at all times,'' said
Chiefs free safety Jerome Woods. ``Safety, linebackers, everybody,
so he wasn't able to see his target.''
</P>
<P>
   This worked. Not by much but by the 4-inch width of an upright,
which is what Adam Vinatieri hit with his 32-yard field goal
attempt with four seconds to play. It was the thinnest of victory
margins but it was enough for the Chiefs. Their strategy had
succeeded. They had limited Bledsoe's chances and hence the
Patriots' by running over their defense with 43 rushes and running
over Bledsoe with an assortment of blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rushing for only 32 yards in the first half, the Chiefs
were able to persist in their approach because they had gotten
after Bledsoe just enough that he missed those two bombs to
Jefferson that would have forced Kansas City out of its strategy.
Had Bledsoe hit them or had Terry Allen not fumbled at the 12-yard
line, the score easily could have been 14-3 or even 21-3 by
halftime, a situation that would have destroyed the Chiefs' plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots so consistently have given themselves no margin
for error this season that with just one or two miscues they were
undone. In large part that was because the massive Chiefs offensive
line and powerful four-pronged rushing attack destroyed New
England's defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were on offense for only 7:12 in the second half
but perhaps the most significant stat was one other teams now will
try to duplicate. New England's four starting defensive backs made
24 tackles against a team that completed only 18 passes. Worse, the
starting defensive line made only nine tackles against an opponent
that rushed 43 times. Even in a defense designed for linebackers to
make plays, too often the Chiefs' big backs got into the secondary
with a full head of steam. What resulted was 140 yards rushing,
more than 35 minutes of Chiefs' offense, control of the clock and
of the game's tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision at halftime to play defense and run it
right at the heart of their defense,'' Chiefs coach Gunther
Cunningham said. ``They wilted in the third quarter when we marched
downfield and set the tone for what we were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, brutal blueprint for victory. The Patriots can
expect to see a lot more of it.

 &HT;    NBA HEAT OVERPOWERS MACCABI TEL AVIV IN TRANSATLANTIC HOOPS
CELEBRATION
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ The Miami Heat used superior speed, power and
size Monday to overwhelm Israel's best basketball team 126 to 91,
but the game still looked good from where Ovi(CQ) Ben-Chaim sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, it's great,'' Ben-Chaim said from his
courtside wheelchair. He was shot in the head by a sniper during
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Now, with his legs paralyzed, he
plays wheelchair basketball for Israel's Wounded Soldiers' House.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a team like this in Israel, it's great. It's like
someone says, OK, now you are good . . . not equals, but good
enough to play with,'' said Ben-Chaim, 38. ``The Americans are like
brothers, family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat came for an exhibition game against Maccabi Elite Tel
Aviv, which they agreed to play three years ago in order to win the
rights from Tel Aviv for 1996 draft pick Martin Muursapp, now
playing in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time an NBA team played here in 21 years and it
melded NBA glitz with distinctly Israeli elements.
</P>
<P>
   There were extra spot lights installed for pre-game
introductions, an appearance at courtside by celebrity sportscaster
Ahmad Rashad and the presence of league Commissioner David Stern,
watching from a seat beside U.S. Ambassador to Israel Ned Walker.
</P>
<P>
   There were also security guards posted by Heat huddles during
time-outs, war veterans at courtside and in-your-face crowds that
sent cheers and heckles toward both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans kind of reminded me of NBA fans on the road, hostile,
chanting,'' said Heat star center Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   While he said it was ``flattering'' to see many fans wearing
jerseys with his name and number (33), he noted that they also
taunted the team with chants of ``first round knockout'' in
reference to the Heat's play-off departure last season.
</P>
<P>
   But, with a sampling of dunks, ally-oops that brought the
raucous crowd to standing ovations and just overall dominance, the
Heat's premier players fulfilled their roles. Guard Tim Hardaway
lead scoring with 24 points. Heat coach Pat Riley pointed out that
the Heat were ahead 23-5 when he gave Hardaway a rest and saw Tel
Aviv tie the score in the second quarter at 36. Hardaway re-entered
the game and the Heat were leading by 23 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning lead the Heat with 11 rebounds and forward Mark
Strickland had 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tel Aviv coach Pinhas Gershon said he should have forced the
game to end when it was tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' he said. ``Not everything in life is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat appeared to have periodic trouble figuring out the Tel
Aviv's zone defense _ prohibited in the NBA. And, two fellow
Americans playing for Tel Aviv _ foreign players are allowed on
Israeli teams _ gave them problems in streaks. Former Stetson and
Continental Basketball Association guard Mark Brisker had 19 points
and former University of Minnesota guard Arriel(CQ) McDonald had
14.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and Hardaway agreed after the game that Tel Aviv center
Nat Huffman, who had 14 points, is probably NBA caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Tel Aviv has won Israel's championship for six straight years
and also frequently plays European teams. Basketball is the No. 2
sport here, after soccer, but the top players only make about
$400,000 a year _ cheap by NBA standards.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the fourth quarter Monday, Hardaway and
guard-forward Dan Majerle were resting on the bench and pointing in
mock anger at fans calling their names.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,700 attended, short of selling out the 10,000 seat Yad
Eliyahu(CQ) Sports Palace, Israel's largest arena. Games often
sell-out for Tel Aviv's European League games, but ticket prices
for the exhibition _ ranging from about $15 to $80 _ were double
the normal cost.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, the Heat headed for the airport and back
to Miami, after spending less than three days here. The trip
allowed time for just a short tour of Jerusalem Sunday between
practices and meetings. Riley said he was haunted by stories of the
Washington Bullets, who lost to Tel Aviv in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one game, anybody can beat you,'' Riley said. ``It was
really a business trip. We were concerned.''

WHITE HOUSE INDICATES IT WILL ACCEPT DELAY ON TEST BAN TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House signaled on Monday that it would
accept in principle a deal to delay a Senate vote on a nuclear test
ban treaty until after President Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Since it became clear that treaty supporters lacked the
two-thirds majority to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House have been locked
in a high-stakes, three-way struggle over the terms of postponing
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday satisfied one demand made by the Senate
Republican leader, Trent Lott, when he put in writing a request to
delay action.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the president has resisted the other demand, that he
agree to delay any further action until the next administration.
White House officials have argued that this would weaken his
ability to persuade Pakistan and India not to conduct more testing
of nuclear explosives.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton refused to publicly forswear a vote while he is
president, his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, suggested
that the White House could live with terms guaranteeing that the
Senate would not act on the treaty until the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a matter for the Senate, in terms of their schedule and
preferences,'' Berger said in an interview. ``It's not something
the president felt would be responsible for him to say.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication as to whether Lott or other
senators would now agree to postpone a vote, and the brinkmanship
was expected to go to the wire. A vote could take place as early as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leading senators of both parties have pushed for at least a
15-month postponement of a vote on the treaty, which was signed in
September 1996, but has yet to gather the required ratifications to
go into force. To implement the treaty, ratifications by 44
countries believed to have a nuclear capacity are needed. Countries
that have not ratified the treaty include Russia and China, both of
which have signaled that they will take their lead from the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In their debates, the lawmakers have appeared to address the
question of timing without overt involvement from the White House.
Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., were
drafting a letter to Lott and his Democratic counterpart, Tom
Daschle, requesting that Senate action on the treaty be delayed
until the 107th Congress convenes in 2001, and after a new
administration is in place.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott, John Czwartacki, suggested the seeds for a
deal were in hand, but many details needed to be worked out.
``Clearly, the president's letter is a first step,'' he said. ``Now
it's up to the Senate to see if the agreement can be reached that
the treaty not come up again this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Senate Republican and Democratic leaders
requesting that action be delayed, Clinton wrote: ``I believe that
proceeding to a vote under these circumstances would severely harm
the national security of the United States, damage our relationship
with our allies, and undermine our historic leadership over 40
years, through administrations Republican and Democratic, in
reducing the nuclear threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, as he did on Friday, refused to concede that the
pact would not be enacted during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that it is inappropriate for him to say
to the world that the United States is out of the non-proliferation
business during an election year,'' Berger said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top aides insisted on Monday that giving tacit
approval to a Senate plan to postpone a vote until he is out of
office did not foreclose the administration's ability to raise the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delay is better than defeat,'' said Berger. ``This is not a
question of taking a U-turn, but taking a side road that I believe
will get us back to the main road.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political reality is that Clinton does not control the
Senate calendar, and if Republicans and Democrats agree not to
bring up the issue, it is effectively dead for the remainder of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has the advantage in dealing with the president,
Lott is tiptoeing through a political minefield on this issue. A
majority of the 55 Senate Republicans are believed to support a
move to delay action on the treaty to avoid dealing the United
States a political and diplomatic setback.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott is also under pressure from Republican hard-liners, who
want to kill the treaty no matter what the political or
international fallout, to extract concessions from Clinton and
Senate Democrats after their demands for more than two years that
Republicans bring up the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president appears to be playing poker with the Senate, but
he does not have a winning hand,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
who heads the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides said Helms favors going ahead with the vote, but is open
to a last-minute deal if Republican assurances are met.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's ranks are not totally united either. While most of the
45 Senate Democrats want to put off the vote, a minority sees
political advantage in having the treaty defeated, only to be
revived again, perhaps next year, as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Warner and Moynihan, who both spoke eloquently
from the Senate floor on Friday about the perils of defeating the
treaty, faces scrutiny from both sides. Top Republicans aides, for
example, are insisting that the guarantees be airtight and signed
by top Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and Carl Levin of Michigan, the
ranking Democrats on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services
Committee, have both voiced reluctance to bring up the treaty again
next year, but are opposed to putting that in writing. ``Biden
doesn't believe in putting any conditions on the delay,'' said the
senator's spokesman, Chris Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point for Democrats is whether the letter
allows senators to break their vow in the event of an international
crisis, such as resumption of nuclear testing by India and
Pakistan. Warner said no such phrasing existed in the latest draft,
but that it was implicit in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the treaty debate require that all 100 senators
agree before a vote on the ill-fated accord can be postponed. But
four hard-line Republicans have vowed they will not give in.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, Daschle has said the Democrats would introduce a
motion to remove the treaty from the Senate's ``executive
calendar,'' a move that requires only a majority vote. But it is
unclear whether Democrats could persuade at least six Republicans,
for a total of 51 senators, to join them in a procedural vote that
is usually a test of party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said he might take such a step because
the consequences of killing the treaty were even greater. ``We've
got to get this thing pulled down,'' he said.

WHITE HOUSE WORKS BEHIND SCENES TO GET LABOR ENDORSEMENT FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the AFL-CIO's endorsement hanging in the
balance, President Clinton did his vice president a big favor
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Dority, president of the Food and
Commercial Workers Union, Clinton telephoned a friend of Dority's
to make one last nudge to assure that Dority's union would provide
the crucial swing vote needed to secure the labor federation's
important endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called John Sweeney, the labor federation
president, over the weekend. While it is unclear how much Clinton's
calls ultimately affected the outcome, they were the final steps in
an intense effort by the Gore campaign _ and the White House itself
_ to win labor's support for the vice president with an endorsement
that the AFL-CIO is expected to approve on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To line up labor's support, Clinton appeared at a dinner last
Thursday honoring the Teamsters' president, James Hoffa. And in
recent weeks the White House has moved to limit imports of
low-priced steel, part of an effort to placate the powerful United
Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Clinton and four Cabinet members traveled to Chicago
to address the concerns of eight union presidents worried about the
loss of factory jobs. Clinton told them that on the recommendation
of Gore he was setting up a task force to determine how to save
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's full-court press is one of several factors
that have put Gore on the verge of grabbing the the biggest plum so
far in the early months of the 2000 presidential campaign. Equally
critical, many labor leaders said Monday, were the vice president's
record on labor issues as well as the need for Sweeney to prove
that he could unite the federation around Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore and his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, have battled
over the labor endorsement, with Bradley urging union leaders not
to rush to make an endorsement so early.
</P>
<P>
   The labor endorsement is a boon to candidates because the
AFL-CIO has 13 million members, prints millions of leaflets and
mobilizes thousands of union members to get out the vote and
operate phone banks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Dority said the Food and Commercial
Workers' Union decided to back Gore for a reason that was haunting
many of Gore's labor supporters: If Gore did not gain an
endorsement from the labor federation it would be construed as a
devastating setback to the vice president at a time when Bradley's
strength seems to be growing each day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most outspoken supporter in labor, Gerald McEntee,
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, said, ``There was a real fear that if we didn't have an
endorsement here for Gore, it would have cut him off at the
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of endorsing Gore at the AFL-CIO convention this week,
some union leaders were pushing for a delay, in hopes of wresting
more concessions from Gore and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last week, Sweeney was so discouraged that he told
aides he might not put an endorsement up to a vote at the
convention because several pivotal unions weren't making the
movement toward Gore that he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime early on Friday, AFL-CIO officials said, Sweeney
decided to stick his neck out and push hard for an endorsement even
though he was uncertain he could muster the needed two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sweeney said he decided to work hard to line up
backing for the vice president because he believed that Gore has
been a good and loyal friend to American workers and that Gore was
going to be the Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, union officials said, saw that Gore nearly had the
two-thirds needed, and he was confident that if he pushed for an
endorsement, that would move several fence-sitting unions toward
backing Gore, enabling the vice president to clinch the two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Sweeney spoke out for an endorsement on Friday,
several fence-sitting unions other than the Food and Commercial
Workers announced that they would back an AFL-CIO endorsement of
Gore. Those unions were the Office and Professional Employees
International Union, the Laborers International Union of North
America and the National Treasury Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO, the
Service Employees International Union, gave Sweeney assurances this
past weekend that it would back an endorsement if its vote was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   For many union leaders, there was another big concern, that the
AFL-CIO and Sweeney would be weakened and embarrassed if the labor
federation did not endorse Gore at the convention, when Sweeney was
such an outspoken supporter of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there wasn't an endorsement, it would have hurt John,''
McEntee said. ``The guy worked so hard for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders interviewed said that the question always was
not whether they were going to endorse Gore, but when. Several
opposed an early endorsement because they said their members were
not yet paying attention to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members weren't mentally prepared to talk about the
presidential election,'' said Dority of the Food and Commercial
Workers' Union. ``We thought it would be better to wait until
closer to the election. But we saw that not endorsing at this time
might send a message that we're against Gore, and we didn't want to
be seen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up involvement from the White House and the Gore
campaign came only after many labor leaders had complained that
Gore had not given them enough one-on-one attention. At the same
time, Bradley was calling the leaders two or three times a day,
union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials said that they were receptive to the
argument Gore has been making recently that he has fought for union
issues for a long time while Bradley quit the Senate in 1996 and
has been viewed as doing little for labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's been out of the Senate now for how long?'' asked
William Burga, president of the Ohio affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
``Gore stayed in there. I think that means something.''
</P>
<P>
   But several union officials, most notably the presidents of the
Teamsters and the autoworkers, said there should be no rush for the
AFL-CIO to make an endorsement because they thought holding off
might wrest more concessions from candidates. Other union officials
argued against an early endorsement because the Gore campaign was
in disarray and Bradley was coming on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, the Sweeney aide, said, ``Because it was early, because of
the atmosphere _ is the Gore campaign falling flat? _ because
Bradley was doing a good job of reaching out, people got into this,
maybe we should just hang back. Why rush? Nobody was saying we
prefer Bradley over Gore. John's reaction was: That's not a
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   For labor officials like Sweeney, loyalty is an important
factor, and they have seen Gore speak out for years on labor's
issues, ranging from the minimum wage to a patients' bill of
rights. At two recent meetings of the AFL-CIO's executive
committee, the vice president won rave reviews for defending
workers' right to organize and for condemning corporations that
violate the law by firing workers who support unionization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been very much in the fray with us, on education,
on health, on children's issues'' said Sandra Feldman, president of
the American Federation of Teachers. ``Over the years he's been
with us very steadfastly.''

WHAT IS A MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS? SOME SAY 51 PERCENT OWNERSHIP.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla., N.Y., Ariz.)   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long united in the struggle to maintain special
breaks for nonwhite entrepreneurs, some civil rights leaders and
minority business groups have become divided over a basic concept:
what is a minority-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Many black and Hispanic owners of large businesses are arguing
that the traditional definition _ a company in which members of
minority groups own 51 percent _ limits their ability to raise
capital by selling stock. But leaders of large civil rights groups
and minority small-business owners say that changing the definition
will further erode the whole idea of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a proposal by the National Minority Supplier
Development Council to relax the definition of what would be
considered a minority company. The council, based in New York, is a
private organization that certifies whether companies can be
considered owned by minorities. Many large corporations rely on the
council's evaluation process to determine whether companies they
are contracting with are, in fact, owned by African-American,
Hispanic or Asian-American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 26 in Phoenix the council's 80-member board will vote on
a resolution that would allow minority companies to sell stock and,
in some cases, retain the council's certification, even if the
stock sale results in minorities owning as little as 30 percent of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the change say it is needed to allow minority
companies to grow and to compete against larger white-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our commitment is to assist the development of minority
business,'' said Harriet Michel, president of the council, which is
made up of Fortune 500 corporations. ``Minority firms must be
allowed the same opportunity to grow in this global economy, to be
competitive and not to be continually defeated because they don't
have access to capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Larger minority-owned companies say they need access to capital
without losing the council's certification, without which they
might not be eligible for a company's minority contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you an introduction,'' said Joe Arriola, who is
Cuban-American and chairman and chief executive of Avanti-Case
Hoyt, a graphics arts company that does nearly $160 million worth
of business and has offices in Miami, Chicago and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Arriola said he would like to expand his business by buying a
small graphics arts company. But while his competitors could do
that by selling stock, ``I got to pay with cash and, for me, cash
only comes from borrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of some civil rights groups, including the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National
Urban League and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, say the
change will open the door to so-called front companies, in which
minority executives have prominent positions but the companies are
owned and controlled by whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as there has been black enterprise, when you said
black ownership that has always meant 51 percent,'' said Earl G.
Graves Sr., publisher of Black Enterprise Magazine, who has led the
opposition to the proposal. ``If you have 51 percent, you have
control; less than 51 percent, it is not control, you have an
ownership stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents worry that any increase in front companies would
discredit the concept of special breaks for minority companies at a
time when affirmative action programs are under assault. They are
also concerned that a change by the council might prompt the
federal government to re-examine its definition of what constitutes
a small ``disadvantaged'' company _ currently 51 percent ownership
by minorities or some whites _ that are given breaks in bidding for
government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the change say they understand the concerns of
civil rights leaders given the setbacks in the courts and the
passage of ballot initiatives like Proposition 209 in California,
which outlawed government programs that extend ``preferences''
based on race and sex in employment, college admissions and
contracting. But they say the proposal has a number of safeguards
built in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, companies must already be 51 percent owned by
minorities and have a stock deal with a venture capitalist worked
out before they can apply for a waiver of the 51 percent rule. The
council will also examine the future makeup of the board, the issue
of who holds voting stock as opposed to common stock, and who will
be in charge day to day.
</P>
<P>
   The change is being pushed by several large corporations,
particularly the Big Three automakers. In recent years, General
Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler have been consolidating
their supply operations, buying more from larger and larger
suppliers and scaling back contracts with small suppliers. In the
process, the car companies and several minority suppliers say that
unless minority suppliers grow, they will soon be shut out of the
industry.

U.S. STUDY FINDS LACK OF CONTROL IN U.N. FOOD AID TO NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A report prepared for Congress by the General
Accounting Office in Washington has found that the U.N. World Food
Program is not able to monitor adequately what happens to food aid
donated by the United States to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. policy is that no food aid will be provided to North
Korea if it cannot be adequately monitored,'' the report, to the
House Committee on International Relations, said. The report,
issued last week, contends that the World Food Program itself
estimates that 90 percent of North Korean institutions that receive
food aid, including hospitals, orphanages and schools, have not
been visited and says its own monitors had ``rarely been allowed to
observe the actual distribution of food to beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   A renewed debate over whether food donations, most of which are
from the United States, are siphoned off by officials or the
military in the world's most isolated and totalitarian nation
occurs as Congress begins hearings on the Clinton administration
policy of easing some sanctions against North Korea in the hopes of
deterring its nuclear and missile programs. The policy has met
strong Republican criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Malnutrition and starvation have been a cause for concern in
North Korea for more than five years, as the effects of the
country's complete economic collapse have been worsened by floods
and other disasters. Experts disagree on the death toll from the
years of famine, but estimates range from 500,000 to 2 million or
more. North Korea has 24 million people, and most famine victims
were the youngest and oldest citizens, international experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the World Food Program, Trevor Rowe, said in an
interview from Washington that ``for us, there is nothing new in
this report.'' He said there had always been questions about access
to North Korean people and institutions. The GAO team was itself
denied visas.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said access for his program had in fact expanded
considerably in North Korea in recent years.

BUFFETT COMPANY BUYS NEW ENGLAND FURNITURE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Eliot and Barry Tatelman, known to New England shoppers
for their goofy yet memorable television ads for Jordan's Furniture
Co., said Monday they have agreed to sell their business to
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive,
Warren Buffett, the brothers said they would continue to have free
rein in running the four-store furniture chain founded by their
grandfather in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Jordan's Furniture was unexpected. The Tatelmans had
had no thoughts of selling, they said. But after being contacted by
Buffett, the second richest man in the world, the brothers
negotiated a deal that would allow them to run Jordan's. And by
selling, the brothers said, they can give their children the
freedom to choose any career _ not necessarily the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Each brother has two children, all of whom are either in college
or recently graduated. Eliot's oldest son, Josh, is the only one,
so far, who has been attracted to the furniture business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have family businesses and force their kids to
go into it,'' Barry Tatelman said in an interview. ``Mine and
Eliot's goal is to have happy kids who can do exactly what they
want to do when they want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither party involved in the deal would disclose the sale
price, analysts said furniture stores typically sell for at least
one year's revenues. Jordan's expects to sell about $250 million
worth of furniture this year, putting the sale price at $250
million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who in May flew all their employees to Bermuda for
a day, plan to share the sale proceeds with the company's 1,200
workers. Each employee will be paid 50 cents for every hour worked
at Jordan's _ for long-time employees, that could mean bonuses of
up to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   It remains a mystery why the store was named Jordan's when it
was incorporated in 1928 by Samuel Tatelman. In 1973, Barry and
Eliot Tatelman took over the family business from their father, who
had taken it over from his father.
</P>
<P>
   There are now four Jordan's stores, in Avon, Waltham, Natick,
Mass., and Nashua, N.H. While rooted in tradition, the stores are
anything but conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its acres of furniture, the Avon store has a
flight-simulated ride that might be found at Disney World. The main
floor of the Natick store has a recreation of New Orleans' Bourbon
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers have expanded carefully. The Natick store is the
newest and biggest Jordan's, covering 130,000 square feet. Opened
in April 1998, it was the first Jordan's to open in 11 years. With
backing from Berkshire Hathaway, the brothers said they hope to
have more freedom to open more of the ambitious _ and expensive _
theme stores. The first planned is on the North Shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ability to expand and do unique things, and it's not
personal investments anymore _ that's a nice feeling,'' Eliot
Tatelman said.
</P>
<P>
   For Berkshire Hathaway, the Jordan's deal follows other
purchases of small or family-owned furniture stores. Buffett's
investment company in 1992 purchased 55-year-old Nebraska Furniture
Mart after a family rift. Berkshire Hathaway also owns
Houston-based Star Furniture Co., and R.C. Willey in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett started his company in 1965 and transformed it from a
textile firm into an investment holding company now estimated to
have nearly $60 billion in investment assets. On the strength of
his world-renown financial savvy, Buffett has amassed a personal
fortune worth $36 billion, making him second only to Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates on Forbes magazine's list of the world's
wealthiest individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaways' holdings include insurance giants Geico and
General RE Corp., as well as a quirky mix of small firms ranging
from the Buffalo News to a candy company and shoe maker Dexter Shoe
Co. Buffett's company has also purchased large stakes in such
corporate giants as Coca-Cola Co., Gillette Co., and American
Express.
</P>
<P>
   The Tatelmans said Monday they were approached by Berkshire
Hathaway about doing a deal through mutual friends at Nebraska
Furniture Mart. ``We took him (Buffett) through our Natick store,
and he loved it,'' Eliot Tatelman said. Prior to that, the brothers
said, they had turned down numerous offers to take their company
public, a move that would have meant a loss of control.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers said Buffett has given them a free hand in
overseeing Jordan's _ ``as co-presidents or something,'' Barry
Tatelman said. They said they didn't feel the need to get that in
writing, because they trust Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with Warren and his company, and the way he does
things, is exactly in line with what we want,'' Eliot Tatelman
said. ``We're going to run the company tomorrow exactly as we have
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Berkshire Hathaway did not return telephone calls
and referred questions to Jordan's. Buffett, in a press statement,
called Jordan's ``unique'' and a ``gem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's advertisements are distinctive. Featuring the Tatelman
brothers, they are typically silly and sometimes spoof ads for
other products. In one, for example, the brothers dropped a ball
bearing on a couch to mimick a Lexus ad that did the same to
highlight the luxury car's sleek lines and precision engineering. A
newer Jordan's ad featured a woman sitting on a couch, spewing
uncomplimentary remarks _ in Swedish _ about the two brothers, who
were clueless about what she was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Among furniture retailers, Jordan's is known for moving huge
amounts of merchandise rapidly. Though Jordan's never has sales,
its revenues per square foot of showroom far exceed the industry
average. In a rare criticism, the company was charged with
exercising a virtual monopoly on some furniture lines provided
solely to Jordan's by distributors.

 &HT;    Baylor's Steele finds fault with Bears' mistakes vs. A&AMP;M
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Kevin Steele has sounded like a broken record,
constantly reiterating ``the long process'' he and his staff are
going through to establish credibility for the Baylor football
program they inherited this season.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the rookie head coach has preached patience and
positive thinking. Practicing those traits, though, becomes
increasingly difficult when he keeps seeing the kinds of mistakes
that the Bears made Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, even if it had played a perfect game, undermanned
Baylor would have had a difficult time attempting to derail No. 13
Texas A&AMP;M in College Station. But Steele, for all his positivism,
was peeved at the mistakes the Bears made en route to the Aggies'
45-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for starters, sophomore Andra Fuller's decision to
drift back from his 10-yard line to catch Shane Lechler's 62-yard
punt at the 2. Fuller got back to only the 10, and three plays
later quarterback Jermaine Alfred threw a pass that A&AMP;M safety
Michael Jameson intercepted and returned 20 yards for a touchdown
to put A&AMP;M up 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ever do that,'' Steele said of Fuller's decision to
retreat to the 2 to field the punt. ``You just don't do it. You put
your heels on the 10-yard line and you never back up. Never. That's
something we'll have to settle this week. But I know this: I bet
you nobody catches the ball inside the 10 again.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was the blocked punt off the foot of Kyle Atteberry,
leading to A&AMP;M's first offensive touchdown in three games;
cornerback Daniel Wilturner's failure to reach the end zone after
an interception, getting knocked out of bounds by quarterback Randy
McCown, who chased him down; Atteberry'smiss on a 27-yard gimmee on
the final play of the half after the interception, which would have
swung momentum back to the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a good enough football team to be doing some of the
things we did,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think he's still not accentuating the positive despite
the Bears' league-worst 1-5 record (0-3 in the South).
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to paint the picture for the best, whether you
know in your own heart that, hey, long-term, it's going to be a
dogfight,'' Steele said. ``But you want to pump things up and
breathe life into it as fast as you can. People say, 'That's not
right, because it's false.' But when things have been down you need
to give people hope. When reality does strike, you assess it and
keep on plugging. This thing's going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Block that kick
</P>
<P>
   When Texas was sunk by three blocked punts in its opener against
North Carolina State, many coaches had an explanation _ or they
thought they did.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams are always ragged early in the season, the coaches
noted, because it's difficult to simulate full speed special-teams
action in practice. But at the midpoint of the season, they are
being forced to re-evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Kicks are being blocked at an astonishing pace in games
involving Big 12 teams. Already this season, league teams have been
a part of 12 blocked punts, six blocked field goals and three
blocked extra points. By comparison, for all of last season, league
teams were involved in 13 blocked punts, six blocked field goals
and six blocked PATs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very interesting year in that regard,'' Nebraska
Coach Frank Solich said. ``Why it is, I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich speculated that the rash of blocked punts might be
because many teams have gone to a spread formation, with players
split out to get downfield coverage rather than staying in to
block.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of pluses to that formation, but it takes
tremendous coordination,'' Solich said. ``All it takes is one guy
not doing his responsibility to get the ball blocked. I don't
really have an answer for it, though. All I know is most coaches
just hold their breath when it comes time to kick the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Game within the game
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is a 32 1/2-point underdog going into Saturday's game at
No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M, but Coach Terry Allen knows a good showing could
reflect more than on the Kyle Field scoreboard. It could show up in
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks heavily recruit in Texas, with 22 Texans on their
roster, including star running back David Winbush of Killeen
Ellison. There currently are four Killeen products at Kansas,
including standout freshman RB Reggie Duncan of Ellison, who is
redshirting after picking the Jayhawks over A&AMP;M. Part of the reason
for that might be that KU assistant head coach Darrell Wyatt is a
Killeen native.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question a good performance on Saturday would be a
real bright spot for us,'' Allen said. ``We'll be fanning out
Friday night to go to high school games, and we know there are a
lot of kids we're anxious to recruit who will be at the game
Saturday, so a good performance could really help.''
</P>
<P>
   Flag day
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State led the league last year in both penalties (118)
and penalty yards (993), so it's not like the Wildcats aren't used
to seeing flags fly in their direction. But Coach Bill Snyder isn't
so sure someone wasn't overdoing it Saturday, and it wasn't
necessarily his players.
</P>
<P>
   K-State was whistled 18 times for 162 yards in penalties in its
50-9 victory over Kansas, both school records. Snyder, though,
wasn't sure all the penalties were valid, especially some of the
five infractions for pass interference _ three on backup cornerback
DeRon Tyler and two on starting corner Dyshod Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, not eager to incur a Big 12 fine for criticizing
officials, danced around the subject Monday. But he did hint that
he didn't agree with some of the pass interference calls.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the calls came despite Tyler and Carter playing
coverage the way they had been taught, Snyder responded, ``By and
large, that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a major concern for me,'' he added. ``Nobody is
ever going to be pleased with penalties to any degree. When you end
up with 18 of them, it can put you over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the league
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's victory over Missouri last week was its first
overtime game ever, and the four-hour affair also was the longest
game in Buffs' history.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Davis' 107 rushing yards against Nebraska marked his
sixth straight 100-yard game, second-most in Iowa State history. He
has a long way to go before reaching the school mark for
consecutive 100-yard games, held by his brother Troy Davis (17).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody should be surprised Texas Tech lost at Oklahoma State
last week. In the games immediately following their encounters with
Texas A&AMP;M, the Raiders are 3-10 under Coach Spike Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M TB Dante Hall remains questionable for the Kansas game while
continuing to rehab a strained muscle in his back. Players of the
week

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fletcher Lokey drove 90 minutes to hear former Sen.
Bill Bradley, a Democratic candidate for president, speak at a high
school in southern New Hampshire last week, and he was not
disappointed. ``I was electrified,'' he said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked which of Bradley's policy positions he liked
best, Lokey, 50, paused, then conceded that he could not think of
one. He said he liked Bradley, a former basketball star, mainly
because of his personality, which struck him as honest and sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sensibility, a gut feeling,'' Lokey, a maintenance
worker, said. ``But a real strong one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lokey and others like him are both the central strength, and
potential Achilles' heel, of Bradley's insurgent campaign,
particularly in the flinty state of New Hampshire, site of the
nation's first primary next February.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the endorsement of voters like Lokey _ disaffected
Democrats and independents who care deeply about character and are
attracted by Bradley's folksy style _ has propelled his campaign
from near obscurity into real contention.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bradley's sole Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore,
the inability of such voters to pinpoint accomplishments, or even
policy positions, of Bradley's indicates that the challenger's
support remains skin-deep. A steady dose of criticism against
Bradley, Gore's aides say, will move those voters toward Gore, or
at least away from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people know what this guy's record is, they'll realize
Bradley's not what he claims to be,'' said one senior official in
the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by that strategy, Gore and his surrogates have stepped up
their attacks on Bradley's character, integrity and voting record.
In Iowa on Saturday, before 3,000 Democrats at the
Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner, Gore accused Bradley of being a
disloyal Democrat for having retired from the Republican-controlled
Senate in 1996 and for having voted for President Reagan's budget
cuts in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Newt Gingrich took over Congress and tried to reinforce
Reaganomics to try to force deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, I
didn't walk away,'' Gore said. ``I decided to stay and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has also tried to brand Bradley as a political
panderer who has shifted position on an array of issues to win
votes. One example: they say that Bradley voted against ethanol
subsidies and other farm support programs when he was a senator
from New Jersey, only to endorse some of those policies when he
started campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Gore campaign's strategy is focused on appealing to
core Democratic voters who may have been slipping slowly into the
Bradley camp. It may have already paid dividends: on Sunday, John
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said Gore would win the
endorsement of the powerful labor federation this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's response to Gore's aggressive new campaign has been
carefully measured, making him appear, oddly, more like a
front-runner than Gore. When, for instance, reporters asked Bradley
last week to respond to the assertion that he was a quitter, he
removed an imaginary dart from his shoulder, and said, ``I don't
think the American people want the politics of the dart board.''
</P>
<P>
   Such high-mindedness reflects a core belief of the Bradley
campaign: that voters will be drawn to him because they view him as
having integrity and strong moral character. Nowhere is that
clearer than in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In more than three dozen interviews with New Hampshire
Democratic voters in recent days, a majority expressed approving
assessments of Bradley's character, commonly describing him with
words like ``authentic,'' ``regular guy'' and ``real.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Bill Duschatko, 55, an Internet consultant who
came to hear Bradley speak at a middle school in Bedford, N.H.,
last week. Though Duschatko could not name policy positions that he
liked, beyond Bradley's support of abortion rights, he said he
respected the candidate's straightforward nature. ``Not so much
hucksterism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Duschatko, Bradley's decision to quit the Senate after three
terms actually demonstrated a strong character, showing that he did
not need a comfortable Congressional perch to run for president.
``I admire the way he handled himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, New Hampshire looms as a crucial proving ground.
Many political analysts say he must win or finish a close second in
the state to stay alive as the campaign speeds into a dense clump
of March primaries, when the vast majority of delegates will be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that Bradley has pulled even with, or ahead
of, Gore in New Hampshire. Exhilarated by this initial success, his
campaign has opened a second field office in the state and begun
using hundreds of college volunteers to do weekend canvassing.
Bradley himself has visited New Hampshire almost every other week,
usually for several days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that Bradley's anti-establishment campaign
could play well in New Hampshire, where voters have a reputation
for contrariness, having handed victories to underdogs like Pat
Buchanan, a Republican, in 1996 and Sen. Gary Hart, a Democrat, in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly aware of New Hampshire's independent streak, Bradley has
tried to cast himself as a reform-minded upstart. He calls Gore
``an establishment politician'' who travels in Air Force 2, ``while
I arrive in a van.'' He has made a central issue of weeding ``the
corrupting influence'' of big money out of American politics, a
line that almost always draws loud applause from New Hampshire
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But more than his policy positions, or even his Hall of Fame
basketball career, it is Bradley's plain-Joe manner that seems to
attract voters in New Hampshire and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He often slouches in his chair. He slams his hands into his
pockets as if they were pesky appendages that should be hidden.
When he speaks, he usually sucks on throat lozenges, which, when
amplified through a microphone, make loud clacking sounds when he
rolls them against his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Harris, 53, of Peterborough, N.H., said Bradley's lack of
polish made him seem warm. ``Even though Bradley is not a
charismatic speaker, he's honest, he's genuine,'' she said. ``It
feels like he just connects with people.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Alice Bruning, 34, a friend of Ms. Harris', said
the vice president seemed too well packaged.``He's too well
trained,'' she said. ``I don't feel that he's lived a regular
American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might expect Al Gore to ask what a scanning machine at a
grocery store is,'' she added, remembering President Bush's
campaign gaffe in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has become adept at underscoring his rough
edges. In Iowa last week, he was introduced by a local supporter,
John Tapscott, who noted that just before the event, a strap on the
back of the candidate's tie had fallen off, causing the two ends to
dangle apart.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Bradley fixed it with a piece of Scotch tape, which he
then proudly showed to the crowd as he took the podium to speak.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inability of many New Hampshire voters to identify
Bradley's positions on major issues could loom as a vulnerability.
In the recent interviews, few of the people who said they admired
Bradley knew much about his platform. Many were not even aware that
he had recently outlined a plan to make health insurance available
to almost all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Several who said they liked Bradley's homespun style expressed
doubts about voting for him when they learned about some elements
of his philosophy, which compared with Gore's, favors a more
expansive government role on a variety of issues, like gun control
and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Maryellen House, 42, the owner of a collectibles shop in
Concord, N.H., said she had little interest in Gore because, ``once
you're in office a long time, you forget the people.'' She said she
liked the way Bradley's campaign used hand-painted signs, which
indicated to her a more grass-roots style that might attract her
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But told that Bradley _ like Gore _ supports strong gun-control
measures, she paused. ``I kind of like John McCain,'' she said,
referring to the Arizona senator seeking the Republican
presidential nomination.  &QL;

GOVERNMENT ENDS CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION OF INDONESIA'S FORMER
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 3rd graf to clarify Habibie's reaction.)  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The government of President B.J. Habibie
announced Monday that it was dropping an investigation of possible
corruption by former President Suharto, defying public sentiment
days before an assembly is to choose the next president of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that drew an immediate angry response from many
people here, Attorney General Ismudjoko said that in a yearlong
investigation he had failed to find enough evidence to proceed with
a case against Suharto. Ismudjoko's inquiry centered on what had
seemed the most accessible area of investigation, a complex of
seven charitable foundations. Critics said Suharto had laundered
huge payoffs through those foundations as part of a corrupt regime
that earned him many billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie did not comment Monday. But the announcement appears to
reflect his continuing allegiance to his longtime mentor. Habibie
succeeded Suharto when he was forced to resign in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the move also reflected worries among Habibie
and other veterans of Suharto's government that they could be
tarred by a genuine and wide-ranging investigation into corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected this,'' said Tenten Masduki, who heads Indonesian
Corruption Watch, an antigraft group. ``No one in this country is
brave enough to put Suharto on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement also sharpened what will be one of
Habibie's crucial liabilities as an electoral assembly makes its
endorsement next week for the next president _ his closeness to
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Most assembly members were elected in a nationwide vote in June.
Habibie's party came in second to the party of Megawati
Sukarnoputri. But both candidates remain strong contenders for the
presidency, which the 700-member assembly is to decide on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy chairman of Ms. Megawati's party, Kwik Kian Gie,
criticized the announcement and the entire investigation. ``It is
very clear that all of this is just a mockery,'' he said. He
promised that Ms. Megawati would reopen the inquiry if she won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A number of assembly members also voiced criticism, including
the Parliamentary representative of the powerful military bloc,
Hari Subarno. He said a review of Suharto's presidential decrees
would be enough to show ``who gets monopoly rights and who is
involved in corruption, collusion and nepotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the party that Habibie inherited from Suharto, Golkar, saw
a backlash on the day before it is to announce whether it will
continue to back Habibie as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, this is a major factor,'' said Marzuki Darusman,
who heads an anti-Habibie faction in Golkar. ``It could damage
Habibie's candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was greeted with shock by many, particularly
those who were active in opposing Suharto and who are struggling to
help shape a more open society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, it's very disappointing,'' said Smita
Notosusanto, who heads a new group, the Center for Electoral
Reform. ``I feel that we should go to the streets and demonstrate
against Habibie right now. And if the students decide to go to the
streets tomorrow, we will have to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, an investigation and trial of Suharto, 78, on
charges of corruption has been a main demand of student
demonstrations, which have often turned violent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Along with his six children _ and one of his grown grandchildren
_ Suharto is believed to have stolen billions of dollars of the
national wealth through a broad network of deals in which his
family made money from virtually all areas of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the children are under separate investigations for
corruption, and his youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, known as
Tommy, is on trial over a multimillion-dollar land deal. A verdict
is expected as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Suharto's wealth has been difficult to gauge, and
estimates have ranged wildly. But particularly in the last decade
of his 32-year rule, Suharto and his children made little effort to
conceal the reach of their financial interests in hundreds of
companies. Family members became indispensable middle men in
virtually all major enterprises, taking 10 percent to 15 percent
shares in contracts for toll roads, power stations and
petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the World Bank in the last year of Suharto's rule
estimated that at least 20 percent to 30 percent of foreign aid for
national development had been diverted through ``informal''
payments to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected scope of corruption went well beyond the
charitable foundations that were the central focus of the attorney
general's investigation, said Jusuf Wanandi, director of the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a policy institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just look at the foundations, as if that is the only
thing he has done,'' Wanandi said. ``It's abuse of power in all the
things he has done _ in forming monopolies, in manipulating state
contracts, in using state enterprises for his own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who is recuperating at home after a stroke, has denied
all allegations of corruption and insisted that he does not own a
single penny abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers said Monday that the investigation of his finances
had been politically motivated. ``We knew all along this case would
be dropped,'' one lawyer, Danny Kailimang, said.
</P>
<P>
   A perception that Habibie is protecting his predecessor from a
corruption investigation could sharpen anger over a separate
corruption scandal that is imperiling Habibie's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   That scandal involves a multimillion-dollar fee paid by Bank
Bali to a senior official of Habibie's party, a fee that his
opponents contend was diverted to his election campaign. On Monday,
the police questioned two senior government ministers in that
investigation. Habibie denies the allegations.

A CLINTON CRITIC PUSHES FOR A HIGH-STAKES VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (Also see TEST-BAN-TREATY) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't get Sen. James Inhofe started on Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Oklahoma conservative has assailed President
Clinton's policies in Bosnia and Kosovo as drains on military
readiness, criticized the administration's reluctance to build a
national defense against limited missile attacks, and complained
that the Pentagon's budget has consistently been given short
shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's unquestionably the worst commander in chief in the
history of America,'' Inhofe, an Army veteran who sits on the Armed
Services Committee, said in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Now Inhofe's distrust of Clinton is coming to bear on the treaty
that would ban underground nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate poised to vote as early as Tuesday on the
treaty, Inhofe is leading the charge not only to defeat it, but
also to block any effort to withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the treaty debate require that all 100 senators
agree before the vote can be postponed. But Inhofe and three other
conservatives have vowed they will not give in. ``We don't need to
be delaying and delaying this thing,'' Inhofe said during the
Senate debate on Friday. ``Certainly we have had ample time to
study it and digest it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe concedes that Senate Democrats might use a parliamentary
maneuver to get around him. And he expressed fears that Trent Lott,
the Senate majority leader, would strike a bargain with the White
House rather than follow through with a high-stakes vote.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, a 64-year-old former real estate developer and insurance
executive, is not moved by Clinton's warning that defeating the
treaty would deal the United States a damaging diplomatic blow.
``Frankly, I'm not concerned about our allies,'' Inhofe said during
the Friday debate. ``I'm concerned about our adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe insists the treaty's provisions cannot be adequately
verified, and would permanently bar the United States from testing
while rogue nations could conduct clandestine tests that would
undercut America's edge in nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not conducted a nucleartest since 1992,
relying instead on sophisticated computer models and nonnuclear
explosions to maintain the safety and reliability of the country's
nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   But under a condition Clinton attached to the treaty, the United
States could withdraw if top officials ever determined that the
stockpile was not safe and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   For Inhofe, such safeguards give cold comfort. Indeed, he said
the treaty shares many of the same flaws as a treaty the Senate
approved two years ago to ban the production, storage and use of
poison gas. Clinton lobbied hard for the treaty, and swayed many
Republicans. But not Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd use the same arguments with this treaty: a chief problem
is verification. That's what Reagan said over and over again so
eloquently, you've got to verify.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TODD PRATT CAN STAND THE HEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Todd Pratt does not remember much about the 1997 Super
Bowl _ only the intense heat from the pizza oven.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thousand orders in a three-hour period,'' Pratt recalls. ``I
was supervising a full crew and I sweated harder than I ever did in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His self-image was of a major league baseball player, but he had
just spent a season away from the game, working for Bucky Dent's
school in Florida, and his job description at the moment was
manager of a Domino's franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to go back to it, I could,'' Pratt said Monday.
``There's nothing wrong with managing a pizza parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving pizza never made him cry, the way baseball did, once. For
the moment, he is the man who hit the home run that won the
division series last Saturday, dancing around the bases, jumping
into the embrace of his teammates, allowing the Mets to avoid a
deciding game against Randy Johnson in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was one of the most important homers in the 38 years
of the Mets, and it was unloaded by a man who has had trouble
sticking in the major leagues, but that is one of the peculiar
charms of baseball. It really is a game of backup catchers and long
relievers and defensive specialists _ not just the $15 million
players, but even a few guys who have pulled pizza out of an oven.
</P>
<P>
   The former manager of a Domino's _ ``I never did deliver'' _
probably will not be starting Tuesday night when the Mets play the
Braves in the first game of the National League Championship
Series. Mike Piazza says his ailing thumb is better, and he expects
to play. Pratt has been the backup to a lot of catchers in his
career; not all of them were Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself behind John Marzano in the Red Sox's system and
was a backup to Darren Daulton with the Phillies in 1992 and '93.
He said his greatest thrill in baseball, up until Saturday, was
hearing his name announced for the 1993 World Series opener in
Toronto, after which he clumped off to the bullpen, never to
reappear. In 1995 he backed up Rick Wilkins with the Cubs. In the
spring of 1996, the Mariners told him they could not afford him.
</P>
<P>
   He went home and went to work for Dent, another man who had hit
an epic home run once upon a time. Just to keep the memory alive,
Dent maintains a replica of the left-field wall at Fenway Park at
his school in Delray Beach in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a right-handed hitter, would take some left-handed hacks
at the wall in games against the teen-agers in the baseball school,
just to renew his own hopes from his early days in the Boston
chain.
</P>
<P>
   While teaching teen-agers about baseball, Todd Pratt discovered
he was learning the game all over again.
</P>
<P>
   People had tried to tell him things about the mechanics of
catching, ``but maybe I was too bull-headed to listen.'' Now, he
said, ``the lightbulb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the academic world, a year away from campus is called a
sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great word to describe it,'' Pratt said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets contacted him in the spring of 1997, and he hit his way
up from Norfolk. In 1998 he was having a good spring, and the Mets
traded for another itinerant catcher named George Fabregas, and
they sent Pratt down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I ever cried after a manager talked to
me,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   He soon slugged his way back to the Mets, and this year he
batted .293 with 3 homers in 71 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Pratt is a credible major league catcher who could be No.
1 with a lot of teams,'' Bobby Valentine said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Pratt is a loyal teammate who impulsively
called New York reporters ``front-runners'' for having counted the
Mets out a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Pratt's home run made him much, much more than
the voice of clubhouse pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most humbling experience of my life,'' Pratt said.
``My teammates were celebrating in the clubhouse and I was being
taken from TV crew to TV crew. I didn't see my wife for a few
hours. That night I had dinner with her and our two kids, and we
realized how crazy it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt can live with backing up Piazza, the way he lived with
working at the baseball school, the way he lived with working for
Domino's, feeling the reality of the working world singe the hairs
of his forearms. &QL;

   NASDAQ RISES TO A RECORD AS DOW AND S&AMP;P 500 SLIP
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose to a record, propelled by a
handful of telecommunications and semiconductor stocks. However,
many traders were off for the Columbus Day holiday, leaving most
stocks little changed. The Nasdaq rose 29.38 points, or 1.02
percent, to 2,915.95. Meanwhile, most other major market averages
barely budged. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 1.58 points,
to 10,648.18. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.81
point, to 1,335.21.

   REVERSAL FOR GENERIC-DRUG MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, generic versions of popular drugs were coming to
market with relative ease, and investors were clamoring for shares
of the tiny companies. But the group has had a rapid descent
recently. A raft of legal troubles from lawsuits to inquiries by
the Federal government have spooked investors, while the number of
drug introductions has stalled.

<P>
   COMMISSIONS CUT FOR TRAVEL AGENTS
</P>
<P>
   Three more airlines cut travel agent commissions to 5 percent
from 8 percent, following the lead of United Airlines and American
Airlines. Despite the loss in revenue from previous cuts, most
travel agents have demonstrated surprisingly strong survival
skills. The shares of most airlines declined. For example, AMR, the
parent of American Airlines, fell $2.4375, to $60.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines joined other large carriers in raising
leisure fares 3 percent to 6 percent after Continental Airlines
increased prices because of higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   DISPUTE OVER MINORITY BUSINESSES
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders and minority business groups have become
divided over what constitutes a minority-owned company. Many black
and Hispanic owners of large businesses are arguing that the
traditional definition _ a company in which members of minority
groups own 51 percent _ limits their ability to raise capital by
selling stock. But civil rights leaders and minority small-business
owners say that changing the definition will erode the idea of
affirmative action.

   GLOBAL CROSSING PUSHES INTO EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing made an aggressive push into Europe, acquiring
the telecommunications business of Racal Electronics of Britain for
1 billion pounds, or about $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET MAKER WARNS ABOUT PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Trimark, the biggest Nasdaq market maker, said that its
third-quarter income would rise less than analysts had forecast
because of fewer trades from Internet brokers, its main customers.
The company said earnings will be 17 cents to 19 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   3 COMPANIES IN LINUX ALLIANCE
</P>
<P>
   Trying to nudge Linux software into the mainstream of computing,
three companies are joining in an unusual collaboration to promote
Debian, a Linux operating system. Two computer makers, VA Linux
Systems and Silicon Graphics, and the specialist book publisher
O'Reilly &AMP; Associates are linking up to sponsor a broader
distribution of Debian. The use of Linux _ a free version of the
powerful Unix operating system created by a Finnish programmer,
Linus Torvalds _ has grown significantly in the last couple of

TRANSCRIPTS REVEAL NIXON'S ROLE IN HISS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, 1948, Richard Nixon, then a young congressman,
appeared in New York before a federal grand jury that was
investigating communist infiltration of the government. Two days
later, the grand jury indicted Alger Hiss, a former State
Department official, in a perjury case that became one of the most
divisive issues of the Cold War and thrust Nixon into the national
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have only been able to speculate about what Nixon
actually told the grand jury, testimony that most believe was
pivotal in the jury's decision to indict Hiss and not to pursue
charges against his chief accuser, Whittaker Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than 50 years later, newly released transcripts of
Nixon's appearance before the grand jury show that Nixon, as his
critics have maintained, blatantly lobbied grand jurors to indict
Hiss, yet was more subtle and sophisticated in his approach than
his critics have ever given him credit for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been very close to this Chambers case from the
beginning,'' Nixon told the jury at one point, ``and my only
interest in it has been in attempting to get to the truth of the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts help explain Nixon's reasons for wanting to
testify, suggesting that he believed he had to take a dramatic step
to protect the broad investigations of espionage within the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts of Nixon's testimony, which run to 51 pages, are
part of a larger trove of grand jury records, totaling about 4,200
pages, released by the Justice Department last week to a coalition
of scholars and historical groups that had sued for access to the
materials based on their historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars now believe that Hiss was a Soviet spy, but other
questions remain, such as the extent of Soviet espionage in the
United States, the relationship between the House Committee on
Un-American Activities and the Justice Department, the use of grand
juries to indict dozens of people for perjury in the McCarthy era
and Nixon's role.
</P>
<P>
   David Vladeck, director of Public Citizen Litigation Group,
which represented the scholars, said the entire set of records is
to be released in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Peter Leisure, of U.S. District Court in New York, who
ordered the release after reviewing detailed summaries of the
transcripts, had ruled that an exception to traditional grand jury
secrecy should be made for the archive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds the public has a significant interest in
disclosure of Nixon's testimony,'' Leisure wrote. ``Grand jury
testimony by a congressional official allegedly attempting to
influence a grand jury's charging decisions is of inherent and
substantial historical importance.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of Nixon's testimony was given to The New York Times by
someone who reviewed the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Craig, the historian who had initially filed the petition
to release the records and who has read the full set, said both
sides in the Hiss-Chambers debate are likely to find support for
their positions in the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said the significance of the records is in the way
they illuminate the other issues, ``and give a richness to the
historical record.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig characterized the Nixon grand jury testimony as ``the
speech that the American people never were able to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Another historian who has reviewed the archive, Sam Tanenhaus,
author of a biography of Chambers, said: ``You see the brilliant,
conniving, calculating but also the masterly Nixon. He knows where
to draw the line and he never crosses it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's arrival at the grand jury, whose term was to expire in
two days, was well chronicled. News accounts described Nixon, then
35, as entering the grand jury at about 1:40 p.m., clutching a new
calfskin briefcase, inside which were several canisters of film
negatives.
</P>
<P>
   The film was known as the ``Pumpkin Papers,'' photographs of
confidential Navy and State Department documents that Chambers
claimed Hiss had secretly passed to him about 10 years earlier.
(Chambers had turned them over to investigators for the House
committee after hiding them in a pumpkin on his farm in Maryland.)
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had been warned by a fellow congressman that the film
belonged to the House and should not be given to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon saw the film as crucial evidence of Hiss' guilt, was
convinced the Justice Department was not taking the investigation
seriously and feared the grand jury might seek to indict Chambers
for perjury instead of Hiss, Nixon later wrote in his book ``Six
Crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have speculated that Nixon had pleaded with the jury to
indict Hiss, and not Chambers. He did neither, the transcript
showed, but rather, more subtly, built a case that sought to leave
the jurors with no alternative but to indict Hiss.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon declared that he did not intend ``to make a speech to the
jury,'' the transcript showed. But then he did make such a speech.
</P>
<P>
   He told the jurors that he had come ``solely as a messenger for
the House,'' thad the film, and that they could inspect it.
</P>
<P>
   Of Hiss' testimony before se committee, he said:
``Technically, he may not have committed perjury. He did lie.''
</P>
<P>
   And he offered a road map of how the jurors might find a way to
indict Hiss, suggesting names of witnesses they might subpoena,
questions they might ask, even advice on how to interrogate Hiss,
whom he called ``a very persuasive witness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that Mr. Hiss can be cross-examined,'' Nixon
explained, ``is by obtaining basic information and then confronting
him with that information and then cross-examining him
relentlessly, and I mean relentlessly, until the truth comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The individual jurors, who are not identified in the transcript,
emerged as an active and assertive group.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon said he was barred from leaving the rolls of film
with the jurors, one reminded him that they and he are both working
for ``committees of the American government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't one help out another by leaving them here,
regardless of those laws?'' the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon still refused. ``I will not part with the films,'' he
said later. ``If the fiinto evidence, I go with them.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal was later struck that allowed the jury to have copies of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon recounted the findings of the committee's investigation,
and suggested that the committee had been faced with exactly ``the
same conundrum'' as the grand jury in sorting out the statements.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Nixon laid out ``two lines of inquiry'' that the
jurors might take. One was to trace the State Department documents,
which were available to only four people _ Hiss, his boss, and both
of their secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the grand jury would want to hear all four
of them on that point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also challenged the jury to closely examine Hiss' denials
that he was a communist, suggesting that it investigate Hiss'
``provable contacts'' with two suspected communists, ``both of whom
have rather extensive records.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the grand jury ``a very great American institution,
certainly as great as the Congress,'' Nixon said that if the
Justice Department ``does a proper job'' in presenting the case, he
was confident the jury would reach the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   But he also warned that if the jury was unable to indict because
of ``legal technicalities,'' allowing the guilty to ``go
scot-free,'' the committee would continue to pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hiss was indicted two days later.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Keeping Retirement Cash Safe 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: I am 44 years old and would like to retire within five years. I
have $250,000 invested in stocks, $400,000 in stock mutual funds in
my 401(k) plan, and a paper profit of $250,000 in fully vested
company stock options. Should I switch some of this money to
something safer to prepare for retirement?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: To answer with confidence, I would have to know more. Most
important is whether you have other significant sources of income _
a spouse's salary, for example _ and how much you think you will
need for living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I am going to take a shot at this question because I
get many like it, and even a hypothetical answer might show people
how to think about this kind of problem.
</P>
<P>
   I am going to assume that you are single, that you will have no
other sources of income once you give up your salary, and that you
need about $50,000 per year to maintain a satisfactory standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, you have little choice but to keep your funds
invested in the stock market. That will be risky _ the market
doesn't necessarily go up every year _ but anything less risky
won't pay you the return you need to retire so early.
</P>
<P>
   Your investments currently total $900,000. History suggests that
you can expect an average annual return of about 10 percent from
the stock market, including reinvestment of dividends. So your
expected annual return starting out would be $90,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   However, assuming that your $900,000 becomes $990,000 at the end
of one year, you would be imprudent to withdraw the entire $90,000
gain. Instead, you should leave extra money in the pot to guard
against inflation and large, unexpected expenses. (Speaking of
which, I hope you plan to maintain medical insurance because
without it, these calculations become extremely iffy.)
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of withdrawing 10 percent annually, you might want
to limit yourself to 6 percent. In that case, at the end of the
first year, you might withdraw as much as $59,400 (6 percent times
$990,000). That's plenty if all you need is $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   All this reasoning goes down the drain, however, if the United
States enters a long period of stagflation, such as it suffered
starting in the early 1970s. The cost of living soared, with annual
percentage gains in the Consumer Price Index eventually reaching
double digits. Meanwhile, the stock market hit some bad bumps and
went essentially nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   At age 44, you could have four decades or more of life ahead of
you. Anything could happen to the economy during that time _ and
probably will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Liquidating Stock
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My mother, who lives in a retirement home, has much of her
assets tied up in General Electric stock inherited from my father,
who was a longtime GE employee. Her stockbroker thinks that she
should sell some of the GE and diversify her holdings. However, the
cost basis for this stock is only half the current price, so the
capital-gains tax would be high. Mom doesn't need to liquidate any
assets now, but that might become necessary in two or three years.
When it does, should we sell the GE, or some other asset that would
leave her with a smaller tax bill?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: It's usually a good idea to diversify your investments, so I
can't fault your mother's stockbroker for suggesting it, even
though I have this irrational suspicion that he (or she) may just
be looking for commissions on the GE sale and on whatever you buy
to replace GE.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bite is not necessarily that big a deal. You don't
indicate how much money is involved, but if your mother sells, say,
$150,000 of GE stock and half of that represents a long-term
capital gain, she could be left with proceeds of somewhat more than
$125,000 after federal and state taxes. If she reinvests that
amount in stocks paying the same dividend as GE _ currently 1.1
percent of the stock value _ her dividend income would be reduced
by roughly $300 per year to $1,400 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Tax considerations always should take a back seat to investment
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   If you think GE is going to perform much better than anything
else in your mother's portfolio, then it might be a terrible idea
to sell it, even though this would provide greater diversification.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you think GE is going to be an inferior
performer, then you should sell it and taxes be damned. If GE was
about to tank, you'd be foolish not to sell it. Better to pay taxes
on a gain than to have no gain.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't consider yourself qualified to judge GE's
prospects, then you are taking too much risk by letting it dominate
your mother's portfolio. You might as well diversify the portfolio
and let her broker have those commissions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Y2K Safeguard
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the impending Y2K crisis, I am thinking of transferring
my employer-sponsored retirement account from a stock fund to a
government-security fund. When the crisis is over, I would just
transfer it back. What do you think of this plan?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: What Y2K crisis?
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, how certain can you be that whatever happens after
midnight on New Year's Eve will reduce drastically the value of
your stock-market investments?
</P>
<P>
   The present value of the stocks in your fund includes a
consensus of everybody's best estimate about the potential impact
of Y2K. If Y2K turns out to be significantly worse for these stocks
than the consensus believes, then yes, your stock fund will suffer,
at least temporarily. And yes, under those circumstances, a fund
invested in something safer like U.S. Treasuries probably will
perform better.
</P>
<P>
   But if Y2K turns out to be no more than a minor glitch and you
are holding a highly conservative portfolio, then you might lose
out on some growth in your assets.
</P>
<P>
   There is no definitive answer to your question, so do whatever
helps you sleep most soundly.

 Publishers Mine the Internet  
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
If you want to get a book published these days, it helps to include
the word ``Online'' in the title.
<P>
   Amazon.com, the Internet retailer, lists 1,090 such books for
sale. Among them are 15 whose titles include the phrase ``Online
Investing,'' and seven more with ``Online Trading'' in the title.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ``Online'' is in: It helps to sell books. But in the
case of investment books, the ``Online'' titles often are
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   These books don't teach you the magically profitable techniques
you can use when you buy or sell securities online _ as
distinguished from trading over the phone with a live broker or
through an automated telebroker system.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there aren't any magical techniques. When it
comes to investing, your computer is simply another tool for
sending orders to your broker. You click a mouse instead of
fingering a touchpad or (God forbid) talking to someone.
</P>
<P>
   Online investing is a good thing for investors because they pay
lower commissions than they do with other types of order placement.
Brokers can charge less for an online transaction because it
entails minimal labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   That's about all there is to say about online investing _ and it
doesn't take long to say it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, we have all these books.
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy one, thumb through it carefully, read all the
chapter headings, even read the first paragraph of each chapter. If
you are going to plunk down $25 (give or take), make sure you get
something you need.
</P>
<P>
   You can't always tell a book by its title.
</P>
<P>
   What you will find, more often than not, is a lot of general
investment advice that would be useful _ or, perhaps, useless _
regardless of whether you own a computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you want investment advice, you might as well buy the
classics, rather than these upstart efforts. If you have to read
just three, make them the following: ``The Intelligent Investor,''
by Benjamin Graham; ``One up on Wall Street,'' by Peter Lynch; ``A
Random Walk Down Wall Street,'' by Burton Malkiel.
</P>
<P>
   The new online investing books do have an online angle of sorts.
Many of them contain lists of Internet Web sites, such as
Microsoft's MSN MoneyCentral Investor (http:/
/moneycentral.msn.com/investor), Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) and
TheStreet.Com (www.thestreet.com), that can help you research
potential investments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those Web sites are well known to investors with
Internet access. However, if you are behind the learning curve, go
ahead and buy a book.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that investment-research Web sites are
something to sneeze at.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of them are extremely valuable _ light years ahead
of the resources available to individual investors before the
Internet caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   They are also infinitely easier to use. It no longer is
necessary to trudge to your broker's office, the public libraries
or the nearest Securities and Exchange Commission filing room. You
don't even have to leave your den.
</P>
<P>
   You can use research Web sites to dig out a company's financial
statements, create charts of its stock performance, read the latest
news about the company and keep abreast of analyst opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most remarkable and useful of all, some Web sites _
among them MSN MoneyCentral Investor _ allow you to run computer
screens on all the many thousands of publicly held companies, to
find the ones that fit your investment criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Using a computer screen _ which can sort through millions of
pieces of data in a few seconds _ you can cull companies by their
rate of earnings growth or price movement, by the ratio of their
prices to their book values, and scads of other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider three online investing books at random. They
happen to be the three most recent ones to cross The Chronicle's
transom.
</P>
<P>
   _``Online Investing the Smart Way,'' by Stephen Littauer,
Dearborn, $19.85.
</P>
<P>
   This book, by a much-published financial writer, discusses the
features of some of the leading Internet research sites.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains some technical tips that could be useful to
investors who haven't previously bought or sold stocks through
their computers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it warns that brokerage Web sites have an
unfortunate tendency to crash on heavy trading days. To get around
this problem, it suggests that you open accounts with more than one
online broker. It also suggests that you sign up with more than one
Internet service provider, because ISPs also have their down days.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, however, the book drifts away from the online scene
and lapses into general investment advice that will seem familiar
and obvious to all but the greenest investors.
</P>
<P>
   Example: ``In buying stocks, select companies that appear to
offer the greatest chance for future earnings expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   This book ought to be renamed ``Investing for Dummies.''
However, that title has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   _``Online Investing,'' by Jon D. Markman, Microsoft Press,
$24.99.
</P>
<P>
   Markman is a former business editor and writer with the Los
Angeles Times, currently managing editor of Microsoft's MSN
MoneyCentral Investor Web site. He is a solid, sophisticated
thinker, and the book provides even veteran investment buffs with a
lot to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   Markman devotes the first part of his book to explaining his
proprietary method for screening stocks, using MSN MoneyCentral's
data-crunching capabilities. He favors so-called momentum stocks _
those whose prices are appreciating faster than the market in
general _ on the theory that ``stocks in motion tend to stay in
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   While you need to go online to use a stock screener and
experiment with Markman's stock picking criteria, it doesn't much
matter whether you place your trades online.
</P>
<P>
   He says his method works just fine if you initially buy a
portfolio of three to 10 stocks, then leave them untouched for one
year. He calls this technique ``yeartrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the midpoint, Markman declares: ``If I've persuaded
you to become a dedicated yeartrader ... you have to go no further
in this book.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who choose to plow on, he launches into detailed
descriptions of just about every useful investment site on the Web
and how to use them to analyze stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Markman brings the discussion back time and again to his
Microsoft Web site, which he plugs unabashedly, describing it as
superior in various ways to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the interests of accuracy, the book should perhaps be
renamed ``Microsoft Rules.'' But no doubt the publishing company _
like its proprietor, Bill Gates _ was too modest to use that title.
</P>
<P>
   _``Day Trade Online,'' by Christopher A. Farrell, Wiley, $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   This is the oddball of the lot. It isn't about online research
and it doesn't offer a lot of warmed-over investment generalities.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it describes the author's own day-trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, a New York hedge-fund operator, claims that he makes a
good living by trading in-and-out all day in New York Stock
Exchange stocks, grabbing a succession of tiny profits that add up
to hefty totals by the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to follow his system, you can do it. His methods are
described in full, unambiguous detail.
</P>
<P>
   One catch: Farrell points out that you need at least $50,000 in
capital to start, because you will be buying and selling 2,000
shares of stock at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He also recommends that you use a broker that charges
commissions no greater than $10 per trade, because the profits (if
any) on each trade will be small _ only 6.25 cents per share. On
2,000 shares, that would amount to $125 _ minus commissions on both
the purchase and sale.
</P>
<P>
   You also need access to real-time stock quotes, including
current bid-and-ask prices and the amount of stock being bid for
purchase or offered for sale.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many brokers with commissions no higher than $10
per trade that provide this information, but there is at least one
_ Datek Online.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed bid-ask information is crucial, because Farrell's
system is designed to exploit the difference between what the Big
Board specialists are bidding and asking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he might step in and bid slightly more than the
highest bid for 2,000 shares of a stock, then turn around quickly
and sell it for slightly less than the lowest asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that method will only work with stocks that
aren't fluctuating. If the bid-and-asked prices suddenly move lower
while you are holding 2,000 shares of a stock, you are going to
lose money on that trade.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Farrell advises those who follow his method to
buy only the least volatile stocks, such as utilities and
closed-end investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this book should be renamed ``Buy and Pray.''

 _ SF CHRON   PeopleSoft to Buy Vantive 
 &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
PeopleSoft Inc., a maker of business software, has agreed to buy
Vantive Corp., a struggling provider of customer service software,
for about $433 million in stock.
<P>
   Both companies have been hit hard this year by management
turmoil, a slow-down in sales and increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while the deal will not solve the problems of
the two companies, it should leave them in a position of greater
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasanton's Peoplesoft _ which makes financial, human resources
and manufacturing software _ has lost ground of late to competitors
Oracle Corp., SAP, and J.D. Edwards. Company founder Dave Duffield
recently stepped down as chief executive, following the departure
of many longtime executives.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft today also preannounced third-quarter revenue of
about $300 million, or $50 million less than the $351 million
reported for the year-earlier period. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Vantive has consistently lost money, despite the
fact that it competes in the red-hot customer relationship
management (CRM) market. AMR Research predicts the market for CRM
software will grow from about $2 billion last year to $11 billion
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals such as Siebel Systems and Clarify Inc. have soared as
companies look to automate their sales force, call center and field
service operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Vantive has not kept pace. The company today reported
preliminary third-quarter revenue of approximately $42 million, as
well as a net loss for the quarter of between $0.16 and $0.18 per
share. The company lost nearly $5 million in the six months ended
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts questioned whether the PeopleSoft-Vantive merger will
lead to a dramatic reversal of fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination makes sense for both companies, although
announcing it under more positive circumstances a year or two ago
would have provided a lot more bang for the buck,'' said Charles
Phillips of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``PeopleSoft needed a
product suite in the CRM area since demand (for its other software
products) has stagnated.''
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft chief executive Craig Conway said customers were
constantly asking the company to add customer service and sales
applications to its core software offering. ``The value proposition
is greater for customers the more integrated your solution
becomes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Dobrin, an analyst with software advisory firm
Benchmarking Partners, noted that PeopleSoft and Vantive have been
partners for several years, so it's unlikely the companies will
have trouble merging the two product sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think PeopleSoft will now be able to go to market
with more conviction,'' he said. Many of PeopleSoft's competitors
began adding CRM capabilities to their software suites more than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said Vantive chief executive Tom Thomas will become
general manager of PeopleSoft's new CRM division. He said Vantive,
which employees 600 people, would remain in its Santa Clara offices
and that he did not foresee a major reduction in staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not taking the approach of achieving immediate
financial gain through the elimination of redundant positions,''
Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in PeopleSoft yesterday fell 88 cents, or 5 percent to
$16.38. Vantive shares jumped $3.06, or 34 percent, to $12 on the
merger news.

 &HT;    Grand jury in Ramsey case finds itself in eye of media storm
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The JonBenet Ramsey grand jury reconvenes today
and, with expectations high that a decision could come at any time,
a media storm is gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scrambling,'' said CNN producer Betty Anderson.
When the eight women and four men on the grand jury walk into the
Boulder Justice Center this morning, she predicted, they will run a
gantlet of more than 100 news reporters, photographers and media
crews.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury, which has met for more than a year to hear
evidence in the slaying nearly three years ago of a 6-year-old
girl, ends its term Oct. 20. So while it may or may not happen
today, Anderson said, the speculation mounts that this will be
remembered as ``The Week That Was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are filling up with news people. Reporters who straggled
into town Monday had to find rooms outside the city. Network news
shows such as ''The Today Show'' and ''Good Morning America'' are
calling local officials for interviews. But the TV networks have
had crews stationed here for months, setting up elaborate command
centers in places like the local Marriott and the top of a bank
building.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, NBC, FOX and CNN have all been ``wiring'' the place for
some time, finding the best sites for live shots, building sources
_ all in covering terious death of one little blond girl in
an otherwise quiet hamlet that is increasingly irritated by the
unwanted attention.
</P>
<P>
   The town's anxiety may peak today with a grand jury decision.
Talk around here is that the jurors may not wait until the last day
to issue their verdict. They can choose to indict one or ore
people, or not charge anyone and issue a report on their
investigation _ or simply do nothing, say nothing and walk away
from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Many townsfolk want to put the whole thing behind them,
believing it has not portrayed Boulder in a good, or accurate,
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``JonBenet put Boulder on the map, but it's a sad way to be put
on the map,'' said Julia Wrapp, who works in a small bookstore on
Pearl Street, a quaint stretch of shops and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous, to spend all this time on a story about these
wealthy people,'' said John Putnam, 39, who owns a local car
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the national news media has rarely strayed from the
JonBenet murder mystery. It has defined a new kind of story that
appeals as much to the tabloids as to the mainstream media. If the
O.J. Simpson story was the first blockbuster of the genre, then
JonBenet is the steamroller.
</P>
<P>
   The news coverage has sometimes made Boulder and its
institutions look bad. Accusations of blunders in the
investigation, accounts of vicious infighting between the police
and the district attorney's office, have left their bruises on the
town's image.
</P>
<P>
   Since the morning after Christmas of 1996, when JonBenet's body
was found, the media have chronicled the self-destruction of the
leadership of the Boulder Police Department. The police chief and
several top investigators have left the department.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested or charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey, the girl's parents, have been the primary
focus of speculation, but they steadfastly maintain their
innocence. Police do not suspect the girl's older brother, Burke.
Since the murder, the Ramseys have moved to Atlanta where they
remain close to other family members and JonBenet's grave in
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Family members say the media attention has been a whole separate
tragedy for the Ramseys. In one moment of angst, Patsy Ramsey's
sister, Pam Paugh, exclaimed to a reporter: ''If Geraldo Rivera
calls my sister a murderer one more time, I will probably lose my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The slightest hiccup of news, or rumor of news, has repeatedly
drawn reporters of all stripes out of the woodwork. JonBenet's
beauty princess features have been pictured on countless tabloid
magazine covers; four times the story has made the cover of People
magazine. The death of the 6-year-old with the china doll face and
cascading blond curls, a former Little Miss Colorado, has fueled
debates on child abuse, on tiny-tot beauty pageants and on the
treatment of the wealthy when they come under suspicion of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this community tucked between the Rocky Mountains and the
Plains, between a rock and a hard place, is braced for yet another
wave of reporters and satellite trucks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Columbus Day holiday that kept the courthouse
closed, CNN made sure to have camera crews outside, just in case
somebody showed up and had something to say. This morning, yellow
tape will go up to mark off parking spots for the grand jurors, and
security staff will remind the camera crews to stay at least 25
feet away from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's disgusting,'' said longtime Boulder resident Ed
Amarant, 54. ``The media these days _ they blow everything out of
proportion.''
</P>

HEALTH CARE HORROR STORIES ARE COMPELLING BUT ONE-SIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds. note: no byline) 
(sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate leading up to the House vote last week
to expand patients' rights was punctuated by a stream of health
care horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, for example, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas,
rose to tell the story of ``little Steve Olsen,'' a boy whose brain
damage was misdiagnosed at a San Diego Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jen A. Marchesini, a spokeswoman for Children's Hospital,
confirmed that Steve had been cared for there but could not comment
on the case because of the need to protect patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a difficult twist in the health care debate.
</P>
<P>
   Harrowing stories like Steve's have been collected and
aggressively distributed by several interest groups that supported
the legislation to expand patients' rights. They know they have few
more powerful weapons than hair-raising examples of people who were
denied care or given botched treatments under managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But are the stories all true? These complicated personal
tragedies usually have two sides, and both are rarely adequately
presented. The health plans and providers cannot discuss individual
cases because of patient confidentiality laws. And although
patients can waive such restrictions, they generally do not.
</P>
<P>
   The groups distributing the stories are also unable to insure
their veracity. ``We tell the story in the patients' own words, or
from a parent,'' conceded Jamie Court, director of Consumers for
Quality Care, the group that found Steve's story. ``All we can do
is report on what people tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance industry resents the anecdotal barrage.
``These are allegations and should be treated as allegations unless
proven as fact,'' said Mark Merritt, vice president of the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents more than 1,000
managed care groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry and its allies expect to be confronted with a
new batch of stories the next time Congress debates health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate reality is no health care system is going to
be perfect,'' Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of these stories of hardships has become more
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA uses its Web site to solicit ``compelling stories''
of people who have had problems with their existing health
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Physicians Who Care, a nonprofit organization
based in San Antonio, Texas, offers on its Web site the Managed
Care Atrocity of the Month and the Managed Care Hall of Shame.
Links on the Web site offer a forum for personal stories and a
template for e-mailing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers for Quality Care also collects patients' experiences
on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to influence Congress through personal experience
does not stop with consumer groups. In 1997, the American Medical
Association ran advertisements for the physicians lobby: ``You
don't have to wait to tell the grandkids your managed care war
stories. The AMA wants to hear them right now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee's speech was not the first recounting of Steve
Olsen's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers for Quality Care, which is based in Santa Monica,
Calif., and is affiliated with Ralph Nader's Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, began circulating Steve's story four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson-Lee said she heard the story from the congressional
children's caucus. She also spoke to Steve's family before giving
her speech about his case. Ms. Jackson-Lee and Scott A. Olsen, the
boy's father, said Steve suffered brain damage in 1992 when, as a
2-year-old, he fell at a family picnic.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving care at the emergency room at Children's
Hospital, Olsen said, Steve was sent home. A week later he became
ill with flu-like symptoms and returned to the hospital. The
diagnosis was meningitis and the family was told that it would run
its course. Still weak and physically ill, Steve went home. Several
days later, he was found unconscious in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to the hospital and was given a CAT scan,
doctors found a swollen, infected area on the front of his brain,
which was believed to have been caused by the fall. Examinations of
the brain were delayed, the family said, despite their requests,
because their health maintenance organization denied the test.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Steve suffers from cerebral palsy; he is blind and
``developmentally delayed,'' Olsen said. The family continues to
face denials from the HMO for physical therapy and other medical
needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a jury ruled that the California Board of Regents,
which supervised the resident who cared for Steve, must pay the
Olsens $7 million for his pain and suffering, but that was reduced
to $250,000 because of a California law that limits malpractice
awards. The family received a $2 million liability settlement from
the medical group that provided care.

LIFTING BODY AND SPIRIT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first cable car in Israel was a makeshift contraption built
during the country's war of independence in 1948. Strung 160 feet
high across a valley below the walled Old City of Jerusalem, it
connected isolated Israeli fighters on Mount Zion with an outpost
to the west, and was used to ferry out wounded and lift in
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The car was a crude rectangular metal box long enough to carry a
stretcher, and it was cranked across the valley at night on a cable
that was dropped during the day to avoid detection by Jordanian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years later, state-of-the-art cable car rides whisk
visitors in comfortable gondolas to five historic and scenic points
in Israel and Palestinian-ruled Jericho in the West Bank. Gliding
to spectacular cliff-side and mountaintop locations, the rides
provide easy access to some of the most popular tourist sites in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The newest ride, which began operating in July, is in Jericho,
the sleepy desert oasis about 15 miles northeast of Jerusalem that
was the first West Bank town handed over by Israel to the
Palestinian Authority five years ago under the 1993 Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   The cable way is part of a new tourism complex that will include
restaurants at the base and top, souvenir shops and a 55-room
three-star hotel. The upper restaurant is scheduled to open at the
end of the month, the lower one in November and the hotel in
February.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal of the project is to attract more tourists to the
historic sites of Jericho, which bills itself itself as the oldest
and lowest city in the world, 10,000 years old and 800 feet below
sea level. The private venture is financed by Palestinian
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The cable way, built by an Austrian company, climbs 547 feet to
a cliff-side monastery on the Mount of Temptation, where according
to Christian tradition, Jesus fasted for 40 days and was tempted by
the devil. The 19th-century Greek Orthodox monastery, a row of
stone structures perched on the cliff, was built on the site of a
Byzantine chapel and medieval church, among caves that housed
Byzantine monks from the fourth to seventh centuries.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, pilgrims have toiled up a steep path to the
site from the foot of the mountain. Now it's a five-minute ride,
and as many as 625 people can be ferried to the monastery every
hour. That prospect was unsettling at first to a 65-year-old monk
known as Father Gerasimos, who after 15 years at the monastery is
the longest serving of the four Greek Orthodox monks still there.
He guides visitors to a rock revered as the place where Jesus
fasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that people should walk up, as Jesus did,'' recalled
Kamel Sinokrot, vice president of the firm running the cable way.
``I told him that if Jesus were here today, he would prefer the
cable car.'' After trying the ride, the monk relented, Sinokrot
said.
</P>
<P>
   An account in the Book of Matthew (Chapter 4) makes it clear
that Jesus, led into the wilderness, did not need a cable car.
``The devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and
sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
and saith unto him: All these things will I give thee if thou wilt
fall down and worship me.''
</P>
<P>
   A stunning panorama greets riders at the top: Jericho, with its
date palms and banana groves, the arid expanse of the Jordan
Valley, the northern end of the Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   New stone terraces and a small amphitheater furnish the heights,
and visitors can walk through small, empty cliff caves once used by
the Byzantine monks. The terrace restaurant will serve Middle
Eastern food during the day and French cuisine by night, when the
lights of Jericho glitter below.
</P>
<P>
   The ride up offers a bird's-eye view of two other historic
sites: Tel al-Sultan, an excavated mound opposite the base station
that contains the ruins of ancient Jericho dating back to the
eighth millennium B.C., and the remains of sugar mills built by
Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   Amir Dajani, operations manager of the cable way, said that with
the expected tourism surge of the approaching millennium, he
anticipates as many as half a million visitors a year. In the
future, visitors will be able to combine the cable-car ride with a
trip to the neighboring Israeli-managed site of the Qumran caves,
where the Dead Sea scrolls were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 miles south is Israel's best-known cable-car ride, at
Masada, the rock fortress where Jews rebelling against Roman rule
made their last stand after the destruction of the Temple in
Jerusalem in A.D. 70. A sleek new cable car system was inaugurated
in Masada National Park in August in an effort to accommodate the
swelling numbers of visitors, replacing a smaller one installed in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   A fortified palace stronghold of King Herod, the Roman-appointed
ruler of Judea, the mountain, flanked by sheer cliffs dropping
1,300 feet to the Dead Sea, was where 967 Jewish rebels held out
against a Roman siege, taking their own lives before their refuge
was overrun in A.D. 74.
</P>
<P>
   The site was excavated in the 1960s, yielding extensive finds,
including palaces, bathhouses, vast storerooms and a synagogue,
mosaic floors and frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, it has drawn more than 10 million people from Israel
and abroad, and forecasts of more than a million visitors annually
have prompted an ambitious plan to upgrade the site. Besides the
new cable-car system, the plans call for a visitors center,
reconstruction of ruins and conservation of the frescoes and
mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   The new Swiss-built cable-car system, which can transport 1,200
people an hour in cars holding 80 people each, posed a challenge to
the preservation of Masada. The Israeli Nature and National Parks
Protection Authority held public hearings on how best to provide
access from the upper station, by bridge or tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bridge said it would be an eyesore, while
supporters argued that tunneling into the ancient mountain would
violate the integrity of a national landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was to build a wood-and-steel bridge to the summit
plateau from the upper station, which was bolted into the side of
the cliff to preserve the profile of the mountaintop. The result is
visible for miles around: the massive gray steel of the upper
station on the side of the rock, the struts of the bridge giving it
the appearance of a giant centipede.
</P>
<P>
   The ride up is dramatic. In the space of three minutes,
passengers are swung 928 feet up to a sweeping view of the Dead Sea
and the badlands of the Judean Wilderness in a vast depression that
is the lowest place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there are still Israelis who, like the monk at the Mount of
Temptation, are uncomfortable with the notion of riding up to
Masada in a cable car instead of climbing the ancient Snake Path
that winds up the side of the mountain. For many Israelis, the
hourlong hike up was a pilgrimage, an initiation rite passed by
pupils, members of youth movements and soldiers who took their oath
of service on the summit. Legions of tourists have also climbed the
path, often before dawn, to witness sunrise over the hills of
Jordan to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Even the environment minister, Dalia Itzik, at the inauguration
of the new cable way, said: ``I prefer that twisting path. There's
something in that walk that makes you feel history every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the northern port city of Haifa, a cable-car ride up biblical
Mount Carmel is also infused with history. At a promontory rising
steeply from the Mediterranean, globe-shaped gondolas climb 454
feet in three and a half minutes. Ascending from a promenade and
restaurant at the water's edge, they reach a commanding point at
the northwest corner of the Carmel range, an area revered since
antiquity as a holy place.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian inscriptions name it as a hallowed site, the Bible
describes a confrontation on Mount Carmel between the prophet
Elijah and priests of the Semitic weather god, Baal, and Greek
writings describe Cape Carmel as a place of worship of Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Built by an Austrian company and run by a restaurant chain, the
cable car has been operating since 1985. As the gondolas glide up
the mountain, they pass Elijah's Cave, which according to a
fourth-century Byzantine tradition was the prophet's place of
refuge. The cave was first venerated by Christians, then also by
Jews and Moslems, and is now mostly visited by Jewish pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the palm-studded summit is a monastery of the Roman
Catholic Carmelite order, which was founded in the 12th century by
monks who settled in Carmel caves and revered Elijah. Today, there
are 10 monks at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The imposing 19th-century structure, crowned with a dome and
bell tower, contains a hostel for pilgrims and an ornate church,
whose soaring cupola is decorated with paintings of Elijah, other
prophets and saints.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the promontory stands a lighthouse built in 1928
on what was the 19th-century villa of an Ottoman governor. Now an
Israeli military installation, the lighthouse building is called
Stella Maris, Latin for Star of the Sea, a name also commonly used
for the monastery.
</P>
<P>
   From a terrace above the top station, there is a view of Haifa
sprawling down the slope of Carmel and of the entire northern
coastline, stretching past Haifa Bay and the walled Old City of
Akko (also known as Acre) to white coastal cliffs on Israel's
border with Lebanon. The same scene, or a night view of Haifa, can
be enjoyed from two eating establishments superbly situated next to
the upper station: The Lighthouse cafe and the China Ribs
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   From a promenade stretching south along Stella Maris Road, the
pine and scrub-covered mountainside drops away against the vast
blue backdrop of the sea. Standing out against the Mediterranean is
a small white domed chapel along a half-mile walking trail that
winds down to Elijah's Cave, providing views of the sandy beaches
south of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 miles north of Haifa, Israel's coastal road ends at
Rosh Hanikra, whose white cliffs are visible from the Stella Maris
lookout. There, a short, steep cable-car ride, down this time,
takes visitors to sea grottos on the border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Carved out of the chalk cliffs by pounding waves, the grottos
used to be accessible only to skilled swimmers who could make their
way around the bluffs, fighting currents and the pull of the tides.
Since 1968, visitors have been able to reach the grottos by cable
car on what its operators call the steepest and shortest cable way
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow cars, which can carry 15 people each, gently descend a
60-degree incline, bringing visitors down the 224-foot cliff in
little more than a minute. A walkway through a tunnel hewn into the
rock provides changing vistas of the grottos, where sunlight is
reflected in the blue-green water.
</P>
<P>
   The cable way, owned and operated by the neighboring Kibbutz
Rosh Hanikra, was originally built by a Swiss company and upgraded
in 1987 by an Austrian firm _ the latest of a long line of
conveyances over the coastal cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping off to the sea at the western edge of a high ridge, the
headland has served throughout history as a crossing point to and
from what is now Lebanon. Stairways carved into the rock were used
by travelers more than 2,000 years ago, and during World War II,
British forces built a tunnel and railway through the rock, the
remains of which can be seen near the lower cable-car station.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a gate across a road at the top of the cliff marks the
border between Israel and Lebanon. Although in recent years there
have been more than a dozen incidents in which guerrillas in
southern Lebanon have fired rockets into northern Israel, the
cable-car site has not been targeted and usually remains open, even
in times of tension.
</P>
<P>
   A drive 40 miles east and north along that border leads to the
longest and highest cable-car ride in Israel, at Qiryat Shemona in
the upper Galilee. From the southern entrance to town, the
French-made Manara Cliff cable way lifts passengers 2,374 feet from
the Hula Valley to the Naftali Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   A private enterprise financed by an Israeli investor, the ride
opened in August 1998, the brainchild of Kibbutz Manara members and
partly owned by the kibbutz. The seven-and-a-half minute ride
carries visitors past sheer cliffs and pine-covered slopes,
revealing views of Qiryat Shemona and the fields and fish ponds of
the Hula Valley, an expanse of farmland dotted by kibbutzim that
was once a swamp. The view from the gondola extends across the
valley to the Golan Heights and the looming Mount Hermon,
snow-capped in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The upper station is at Kibbutz Manara, where visitors can pick
apples in its orchards, swim in its mountaintop pool and have a
meal in the communal dining room, all for a fee. The biggest
attractions, however, are on the mountain itself.
</P>
<P>
   There are hikes on the wooded summit, following trails that loop
through stands of oak to dramatic cliff-side views of the valley.
There are bicycles for rent for a ride down the paved and rough
dirt roads that traverse the mountain. At the middle cable-car
station, you can rappel down a 135-foot cliff or scramble up an
artificial climbing wall.
</P>
<P>
   But even without the frenzy of activity, the swift, scenic ride
from the warm valley floor to the cool mountaintop is exhilarating
enough, ample proof that the geographic contrasts and rich history
of the land below can be appreciated anew from the lofty heights of
a cable car.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Some drivers here fear Interstate 95, for schizophrenic
traffic that plummets from 75 and 80 mph to tire-smoking zero,
without warning. They fear the long trains of bumper-to-bumper
drivers who speed just a few feet apart with no hope of stopping in
time.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, they fear trash.
</P>
<P>
   Every few months news anchors announce, with gravity but not the
least surprise, ``There has been another impaling on I-95,'' from
the debris that lies in wait, like booby traps in this concrete
jungle, for the unsuspecting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent drivers impaled on Interstate 95 and its
South Florida connectors was Chazz Campbell. He was driving home on
Sept. 18 when he saw a blur of metal flying at his car. The debris
hit the northbound lane, bounced and gouged through the floorboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a hot, burning, numbing sensation in my leg,'' Campbell
said. When he glanced down, he saw he had been skewered. ``I had a
2{-foot metal rod sticking in my leg, pinning me to the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread that highway,'' he said. ``I've seen everything go
flying into traffic, everything from mattresses and lawn chairs to
car parts and large stones.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, three people have been impaled by flying
debris _ iron reinforcing rods, glass and other projectiles _ on
I-95 and its connectors between Miami and West Palm Beach. So far,
no one has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   It happens, drivers here say, because Interstate 95 and its
connectors have become a dumping ground, by accident and on
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to be traveling at 75 mph down Interstate 95
and to see, smack-dab in the middle of four lanes, part of a
washing machine, a surfboard, a lawn mower or a twisted iron
reinforcing bar pointing like a spear at oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Although national statistics on impalements are difficult to
come by, South Floridians are convinced that the
Miami-to-West-Palm-Beach corridor must surely be the Impalement
Capital of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   James Hoffman, a limousine driver, was impaled while driving on
an I-95 connector, I-595, in April, when a 4-foot iron rod
shattered his windshield and bored into his right arm. Larry
Humphrey had to have glass flushed from his eyes when it came
flying into his face on I-595 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in one of the more terrifying accidents, 13-year-old
Stephanie Murray was traveling in the front passenger seat of her
mother's minivan when a reinforcing rod flew through the van's
windshield, passed through her chest and through her car seat. It
came within an inch of her heart, and it punctured her lung. She
survived, but she still coughs up blood and has trouble breathing,
said her father, James Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have thought that people would have taken this kind
of thing seriously when it happened to Stephanie,'' said her
mother, Denise Murray. ``It breaks your heart to see these things
happen again, month after month.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics responding to Stephanie's accident could not remove
her from the van, so they drove the van to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel it, between my bones,'' Stephanie said. ``I
thought, `This can't be happening to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie still sees trucks with their tailgates down, nothing
but gravity holding down their cargo, and she cringes. ``No one
should have to go through what I went through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The impalements are more dramatic, but debris has been blamed
for other bloody accidents here. They are usually not the big story
of the day, because they happen too often.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it has been one near-impalement after another on
South Florida expressways. In August, a Coral Springs woman escaped
serious injury when a metal rod struck her windshield, and in July,
an abandoned refrigerator door caused a three-car pileup. In June,
another metal rod went through the windshield of a car, landing in
the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor
Vehicles counted 121 accidents in which cars collided with
``movable object on road'' along interstates in Miami-Dade, Broward
and Palm Beach counties, resulting in 73 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   When such accidents occur, television reporters announce that
``there has been another near-impaling.'' The most frightening this
year was the case in May of Debbie Tejeda, who was pregnant when a
metal rod lying on I-95 was struck by another car and flew into her
windshield. It narrowly missed her.
</P>
<P>
   The debris does not fall from the sky, but from the backs of
trucks traveling the densely packed lanes, said police officers who
investigate the crashes, and highway workers whose job it is to
clean up that mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do take it very seriously,'' said Delrish Moss, a detective
with the City of Miami Police Department. ``We have established a
phone line _ (ASTERISK)FHP _ where commuters can call and report
road debris. We have crews that try and get to it _ before anyone
else does.''
</P>
<P>
   In a part of the country where building codes are often regarded
as mere suggestions, it is little wonder that construction crews
ignore most safety precautions when loading the trucks that rumble
along the interstates. They pile concrete, reinforcing rods and
other building materials haphazardly on pickups and larger trucks,
say the drivers who share the road with them and wince and swerve
every time a brick comes hurtling off the bouncing truck beds.
</P>
<P>
   Murray thinks his daughter might not have been so terribly hurt
if the driver of the truck hauling the iron rod had taken a few
extra minutes to make sure his load was secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting, it's frustrating, and you know it can be
prevented,'' Murray said. ``I feel like going out and picking up
every single piece myself. I wish I could.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the debris appears to have fallen off trucks or
to have been left along the highway by drivers working on their own
broken-down cars, some of it has been intentionally dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Work crews respond quickly to clean up such messes, but often
not quickly enough. ``They find just about everything,'' said Paul
Blanchard, resident maintenance engineer for the Florida Department
of Transportation in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items routinely spotted on the interstates here,
besides the too-common construction equipment, are sofas, chairs
and mattresses _ there are a lot of mattresses. But there have also
been kitchen appliances, sinks, whole automobile engines and
transmissions, brake drums, bumpers, 5-gallon buckets, wheels and
tires _ not pieces of shredded rubber, but the whole thing _ and
dead buzzards. (Buzzards, common here, have a wing span of several
feet, and hitting them is at least as intimidating as striking a
dead dog.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, after the little girl was injured,'' said Pembrook
Burrows, a lieutenant with the Florida Highway Patrol, referring to
Stephanie Murray, ``we established a program called Roads, or
Removal of All Debris Safely,'' a joint operation of the Highway
Patrol, Department of Transportation and police departments from
Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We patrol the interstate to make sure that there isn't any
loose debris,'' Burrows said. ``If we see any on a moving vehicle,
we will pull them over and ticket them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the police and motorists take the hazards seriously,
some here in South Florida take an almost perverse pleasure in the
dangers, calling them ``Miami Moments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to laugh at,'' said Campbell, who manages a clothing
store in Sunrise Mall in the Fort Lauderdale area. ``It's mentioned
on the evening news, and people are amazed and shocked, for about
two minutes.''

(DW) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A distraught Paul O'Neill learned Monday that he has
a fractured rib on his right side and has been advised by his
doctors to bypass the American League Championship Series and wait,
hope and pray he has healed sufficiently to play if the Yankees
advance to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam Monday at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center that showed he has a
nondisplaced fracture of the 10th rib on the right side. Nevalee
O'Neill, Paul's wife, said the Yankees cannot give her husband a
cortisone shot because he has some internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who admitted that the pain in his rib has remained
constant for several days, called his wife after receiving the
disturbing news. She took the call while waiting for O'Neill with
the couple's three children in the parking lot at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told him that he should take this series off and
try to play in the next series,'' Nevalee O'Neill said. ``If he
tries to play, they said that he's going to feel the same way that
he did the other night. He's going to have trouble breathing when
he runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dr. Stuart Hershon, the team physician, declined to
comment and the Yankees were typically quiet about O'Neill's
injury, General Manager Brian Cashman conceded for the first time
that there is a possibility the outfielder will not be on the ALCS
roster. But the possibility seems more like a definite, with Shane
Spencer likely to replace O'Neill, leaving the Yankees without
their regular No. 3 hitter and without the only outfielder whose
most comfortable position is right field. The roster is due to be
filed with the American League at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Cashman was asked to comment on Nevalee O'Neill's remarks
about her husband's being advised to skip the ALCS, the general
manager did not dispute them and simply said:
</P>

   ``He may be able to play or he may not be able to play.
Tomorrow's a big day. We have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill injured himself Oct. 2 by crashing into a low wall while
pursuing a foul fly ball at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,
Fla., in a game against the Devil Rays, and he has shown minimal
improvement since. X-rays initially showed no injury, but he
aggravated the problem while running in the outfield in Game 2 of
the division series and did not play in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   He muttered ``lovely news'' when approached by reporters at
Yankee Stadium Monday after the exam but retained slim hopes that
he would recover in time to play in Game 1 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four days I've done nothing,'' said O'Neill, who is 2
for 8 in the post-season. ``Tomorrow is going to be a day where I'm
going to have to go out and see if it's possible to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman had said that O'Neill's rib injury would not force him
to miss the ALCS, but the general manager revised his opinion even
before he knew that O'Neill's rib was fractured. The Yankees would
most likely play Ricky Ledee in right field, a position he played
for only seven innings during the season, with Chad Curtis and
Spencer sharing time in left. Both were nonfactors late in the
season as Spencer had 34 at-bats and Curtis just 25 in the final 31
games. While O'Neill had 19 home runs and 101 runs batted in for
the season, Spencer and Curtis combined for 13 and 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that with him in there we have a better chance of
producing a lot of runs,'' Darryl Strawberry said. ``That's the
most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee added, ``We're better with him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill will probably not be out there. As long ago as
Saturday, the 36-year-old O'Neill had questioned his availability
and said he might be out a ``long while'' if he did not get better
in 24 hours. Monday, O'Neill reported no improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I wake up and I feel it,'' O'Neill said. ``It
doesn't go away. I don't know if it's something I'll work through
or if it won't allow me to play.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neill first arrived at Yankee Stadium before noon and
before going to the hospital, he bumped into Manager Joe Torre in
the lobby and spoke ominously about his chance of playing. Before
O'Neill knew that he had a fractured rib, O'Neill told Torre that
he had to ``just go out there and see if I can play with it.'' The
two spoke briefly, and Torre ended the conversation by saying:
``We'll keep our fingers crossed. Maybe throw in a prayer or two.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Hours before O'Neill found out he had a fractured rib, it had
already been an exasperating day because he took his mother to
visit his ailing 80-year-old father in a hospital in Manhattan. His
father, Charles O'Neill, underwent a heart procedure last week, but
he developed a staph infection afterward and has had to remain
hospitalized longer than the family expected, creating more cause
for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess those things happen when you're 80,'' said O'Neill.
``This can get pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not announced their starting rotation for the
American League Championship Series, but it seems probable that
they will use the same alignment they used in the division series.
That means Orlando Hernandez would start Game 1, followed by Andy
Pettitte, Roger Clemens and David Cone. If Cone starts Game 4, it
will be his first start in 15 days. But Cone said, ``Joe can slide
me in anywhere that he wants.'' Hernandez was one of four players
at Yankee Stadium Monday, but he bolted by reporters and said,
``Tomorrow, tomorrow.'' Since the Game 1 starter has a news
conference Tuesday, Hernandez could have unwittingly offered a clue
that he will start the opener.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to stave off threatened state and federal
regulation of movies and videogames, the nation's video rental
stores and videogame makers, with the cooperation of the motion
picture industry, have joined forces in a push toward
self-policing.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort, which comes in the wake of such high-profile
teen-age shootings as those in Colorado and Georgia last spring,
includes a move to beef up restrictions on the sale and rental of
some products to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it clear this level of parental control is the
right vehicle, and home video stores are well equipped to handle
this,'' said Bo Andersen, president of the Video Software Dealers
Association, which represents more than 19,000 video rental stores,
about two-thirds of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
   This week, members of the association _ independent video rental
stores as well as chains like Blockbuster and Hollywood Video _ are
beginning to display new, brightly colored posters highlighting
their updated Pledge to Parents campaign. Some posters explain the
voluntary movie ratings system that has been administered by the
Motion Picture Association of America for the last 30 years. Others
highlight videogame ratings, created in 1994 by the Entertainment
Software Rating Board.
</P>
<P>
   Signs point out that, without parental consent, the store will
not rent or sell to children under 17 videotapes or videogames
designated as restricted. In addition, when adults apply for
membership at a video store, or at any point thereafter, they can
elect to prohibit the sale or rental of certain types of videogames
and movies to their children. For some stores, including the
Blockbuster chain, such moves supplement optional restrictions
already in place.
</P>
<P>
   In about a month, videogame makers will begin their own push,
which will include ads in national parent- and family-oriented
magazines as well as posters and pamphlets for retailers, said Doug
Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Association, a trade group. The group also is asking retailers to
restrict sales of videogames rated ``mature,'' or ``adults only''
by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, to people over 17,
Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have a great rating system,'' Lowenstein said.
``This is about making it as well-known as it possibly can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to concerns raised by the Clinton administration about
how violent games are marketed to children, the videogame makers
and their ratings board have established guidelines to limit
gratuitous violence, sexual content and profanity in advertising
videogames. The guidelines are to take effect at the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by these groups follow an announcement in June by the
National Association of Theater Owners that theaters would check
identification and prohibit minors from viewing adult-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Video dealers and game makers are planning to have most of the
revised educational material for their campaign in place before the
Christmas holiday selling season.
</P>
<P>
   While the videogame rating system has been in existence since
1994, and most games now sold include a rating logo, most parents
know little about the system and few stores enforce any limits on
sales or rentals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Institute on Media and the Family's
1998 Video and Computer Game Report Card, only 40 percent of
parents surveyed said they routinely checked the ratings of the
games their children buy or rent. Only 5 percent of parents could
identify a popular mature rated game, ``Duke Nukem,'' while 80
percent of junior high school students were familiar with the
title.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only 21 percent of the retailers it surveyed
enforced ratings policies on the sale of games. Fewer than half of
the retail and rental employees understood the rating system and
few stores educated their staffs about it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there is a rating system, there's not a lot of
knowledge about it,'' said David Walsh, president and founder of
the National Institute on Media and the Family, a nonprofit group
based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ``Most adults over the age of 30 have no idea
what's in these games because they can't play them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety about game violence and how inappropriate games are
marketed to children comes as the videogame industry is enjoying
its greatest popularity ever.
</P>
<P>
   From their start as two-dimensional blips on a screen in the
early 1970s to today's near movie-quality narratives, videogames
have grown into a more than $6 billion industry. They have spawned
movies, toys, clothing lines and even a postage stamp. The Navy has
even incorporated a flight simulator game developed by Microsoft
into its pilot training program.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 3, video stores rented about 213 million videogames
this year, compared with about 2.3 billion videotapes, according to
the Video Software Dealers Association. Last year, stores took in
$804 million on game rentals, a 50 percent increase over 1997, and
$8.1 billion on videotape rentals, a 9.6 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the school shootings this year, several states,
including New York and Pennsylvania, have proposed legislation to
ban the sale, rental or public viewing of violent games to minors,
or to establish state-governed rating systems. And an amendment
pending in Congress would mandate a universal ratings system and
prohibit the rental or sale of any unrated product. But the issue
has been around a while, and other states, such as Arkansas,
Florida and Minnesota, had already proposed similar legislation.
None of the bills have become law, according to the Video Software
Dealers Association and others watching the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education and voluntary compliance with retailers is probably
going to get us further,'' Walsh said. ``As soon as we start
passing laws, there are going to be challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier industry efforts to head off government regulation
included the original Pledge to Parents campaign, introduced in
1991 and intended largely to limit children's access to sexual
content.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was established in 1994, the Entertainment Software
Rating Board has rated more than 5,000 computer and videogames.
More than 70 percent of the products have been rated ``E,'' or
suitable for anyone over 6; 7 percent have been rated ``M,'' or
mature, and less than 1 percent have been rated ``AO'' for adults
only, Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry may have a tough time convincing retailers to take
bold moves to restrict access to some of the products they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, FAO Schwarz, the toy emporium,
reversed a plan to remove all toy guns from its shelves, saying the
toys' bright colors kept them from being mistaken for real weapons,
a company spokesman said. But a handful of FAO Schwarz stores,
including the company's flagship Fifth Avenue location in
Manhattan, did remove about a dozen videogames from shelves because
of their violent content.
</P>
<P>
   A Kmart spokesman said the chain had no official restrictions,
though it has refused to sell some games it has deemed
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   And an official for K-B Toys, the retailer based in Pittsfield,
Mass., said the company did not have any plans to restrict the sale
of adult-rated videogames. Employees explain the ratings system to
parents and other customers, but there are no pamphlets or
educational posters in stores now, he said. ``We make parents aware
of the ratings,'' he said, ``but we don't make a judgment.''

MARKET PLACE: THE INCREDIBLE ONENESS OF MERGING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: BASEBALL-MARKETPLACE, budgeted earlier, has been held.) 
(af) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the chief executive of a company proposes that the company
acquire another company that she also runs, it pays to pay
attention to the details of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years ago, when Linda Wachner first proposed a
merger of Warnaco Group Inc. and Authentic Fitness Corp., the terms
of the transaction called for an exchange of stock. No one _
neither Mrs. Wachner nor any other shareholder _ stood to get any
cash as a result of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   That deal fell apart, and since then neither Warnaco nor
Authentic Fitness has done very well in the stock market. Now, Mrs.
Wachner is back with another proposal for Warnaco to take over
Authentic Fitness. But this time, the offer is for cash. If this
deal goes through, she will walk away with $47.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco makes a variety of clothing brands, with labels like
Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Warner's and Olga. Authentic Fitness
designs and markets swimwear and athletic fitness wear under the
Speedo brand and other brands, and also operates retail stores that
sell those brands.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal, calling for Warnaco to pay $20.50 a share
for Authentic Fitness, was well received on Wall Street Monday.
Shares of Authentic Fitness rose $2.25, to $19.8125, while Warnaco,
which said the deal would cause its earnings per share to rise,
gained $1.6875, to $19.125.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it may be worth noting that Mrs. Wachner, 53, is
proposing to cash in more than a third of her combined interest in
the two companies. If the two companies prosper, she will stand to
profit less than she would have; by contrast, if they stumble she
will be better off than she would have been without the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Mrs. Wachner said that she wanted to do
this deal for cash because she viewed Warnaco shares as undervalued
and thought it would be unfair to Warnaco shareholders to use the
shares for an acquisition. She added that she had played no role in
the decision as to what price would be offered, adding that the
price was set by a board committee advised by Wasserstein, Perella,
an investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   Might Warnaco be interested in buying Calvin Klein, from which
it now licenses the right to produce clothing, and which was put up
for sale last week? Mrs. Wachner said she had not yet received the
book containing the company's financials from its investment
bankers, ``but when they give it out, we are certainly going to
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wachner owns 1.95 million shares of Authentic Fitness and
has an option to buy one million more shares at $12.50. Together,
those positions will be worth $47.9 million if the price goes
through.
</P>
<P>
   But she owns an additional 1.7 million options with an exercise
price of $20.875. Those options will be worthless if the proposed
price is the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mrs. Wachner will suffer in terms of annual income.
She said she would give up her $1.09 million salary at Authentic
Fitness, while not seeking any increase in her pay from Warnaco,
which last year paid her a salary of $2.7 million and a bonus of $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   The tangled history of Warnaco and Authentic Fitness is not a
simple tale to tell. In 1986, Mrs. Wachner led a group that bought
Warnaco in a hostile leveraged buyout, topping the bid by a group
led by the company's management.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, with the company needing money to pay debt,
she organized a leveraged buyout of Authentic Fitness, then a
division of Warnaco.
</P>
<P>
   She and the other investors paid $1.28 for the Authentic Fitness
shares that will now be purchased by the same company that sold
them, at a price 16 times as high. Authentic Fitness went public in
1992, at $7 a share, while Warnaco went public in 1991, at $10 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Warnaco reached a deal to acquire Authentic Fitness in
a stock swap, but that deal fell through amid uncertainties about
Authentic Fitness profits and opposition from Authentic Fitness'
largest shareholder, Pentland Ventures, a British company that
licenses the Speedo trademark to the company.
</P>
<P>
   R. Stephen Rubin, Pentland's chairman, did not return a
telephone call Monday, and Mrs. Wachner said he had not disclosed
whether he would back the deal. But she expressed confidence that a
majority of shareholders would vote for it in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first deal was proposed in 1996, neither Warnaco nor
Authentic Fitness have done very well in the stock market, a fact
Mrs. Wachner attributed to Wall Street hostility to the industry
and to midsize companies in general. From the day before the first
offer through last Friday, Warnaco was down 44 percent and
Authentic Fitness was off 4 percent. Over the same period, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 deal called for Authentic Fitness shareholders to get
about what they are going to get now, but in Warnaco stock that has
since fallen in price. For those shareholders, the new deal is
clearly a better one.
</P>
<P>
   If this deal goes through, what will Mrs. Wachner do with the
cash windfall? A good part of it will go to cancer research, she
said. ``And,'' she added, ``my dog, Ebit, will be getting a new
collar.''

   (NYT8) NEW YORK -- Oct. 11, 1999 -- EPHEDRA-DEBATE, 10-11 --
Sales of ephedra-based dietary supplements, like Metabolife 356, on
sale at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, are steadily
on the increase. Critics are concerned the nutritional supplement,
used by dieters, athletes, students and late-shift workers, not to
mention others simply looking for a jittery high, is a form of
``legal speed'' and say the herb, ephedra, is too easily abused.

WHITE HOUSE INDICATES IT WILL ACCEPT DELAY ON TEST BAN TREATY

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House signaled on Monday that it would
accept in principle a deal to delay a Senate vote on a nuclear test
ban treaty until after President Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Since it became clear that treaty supporters lacked the
two-thirds majority to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House have been locked
in a high-stakes, three-way struggle over the terms of postponing
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday satisfied one demand made by the Senate
Republican leader, Trent Lott, when he put in writing a request to
delay action.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the president has resisted the other demand, that he
agree to delay any further action until the next administration.
White House officials have argued that this would weaken his
ability to persuade Pakistan and India not to conduct more testing
of nuclear explosives.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton refused to publicly forswear a vote while he is
president, his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, suggested
that the White House could live with terms guaranteeing that the
Senate would not act on the treaty until the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a matter for the Senate, in terms of their schedule and
preferences,'' Berger said in an interview. ``It's not something
the president felt would be responsible for him to say.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication as to whether Lott or other
senators would now agree to postpone a vote, and the brinkmanship
was expected to go to the wire. A vote could take place as early as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leading senators of both parties have pushed for at least a
15-month postponement of a vote on the treaty, which was signed in
September 1996, but has yet to gather the required ratifications to
go into force. To implement the treaty, ratifications by 44
countries believed to have a nuclear capacity are needed. Countries
that have not ratified the treaty include Russia and China, both of
which have signaled that they will take their lead from the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In their debates, the lawmakers have appeared to address the
question of timing without overt involvement from the White House.
Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., were
drafting a letter to Lott and his Democratic counterpart, Tom
Daschle, requesting that Senate action on the treaty be delayed
until the 107th Congress convenes in 2001, and after a new
administration is in place.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott, John Czwartacki, suggested the seeds for a
deal were in hand, but many details needed to be worked out.
``Clearly, the president's letter is a first step,'' he said. ``Now
it's up to the Senate to see if the agreement can be reached that
the treaty not come up again this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Senate Republican and Democratic leaders
requesting that action be delayed, Clinton wrote: ``I believe that
proceeding to a vote under these circumstances would severely harm
the national security of the United States, damage our relationship
with our allies, and undermine our historic leadership over 40
years, through administrations Republican and Democratic, in
reducing the nuclear threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, as he did on Friday, refused to concede that the
pact would not be enacted during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that it is inappropriate for him to say
to the world that the United States is out of the non-proliferation
business during an election year,'' Berger said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top aides insisted on Monday that giving tacit
approval to a Senate plan to postpone a vote until he is out of
office did not foreclose the administration's ability to raise the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delay is better than defeat,'' said Berger. ``This is not a
question of taking a U-turn, but taking a side road that I believe
will get us back to the main road.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political reality is that Clinton does not control the
Senate calendar, and if Republicans and Democrats agree not to
bring up the issue, it is effectively dead for the remainder of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has the advantage in dealing with the president,
Lott is tiptoeing through a political minefield on this issue. A
majority of the 55 Senate Republicans are believed to support a
move to delay action on the treaty to avoid dealing the United
States a political and diplomatic setback.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott is also under pressure from Republican hard-liners, who
want to kill the treaty no matter what the political or
international fallout, to extract concessions from Clinton and
Senate Democrats after their demands for more than two years that
Republicans bring up the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president appears to be playing poker with the Senate, but
he does not have a winning hand,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
who heads the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides said Helms favors going ahead with the vote, but is open
to a last-minute deal if Republican assurances are met.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's ranks are not totally united either. While most of the
45 Senate Democrats want to put off the vote, a minority sees
political advantage in having the treaty defeated, only to be
revived again, perhaps next year, as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Warner and Moynihan, who both spoke eloquently
from the Senate floor on Friday about the perils of defeating the
treaty, faces scrutiny from both sides. Top Republicans aides, for
example, are insisting that the guarantees be airtight and signed
by top Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and Carl Levin of Michigan, the
ranking Democrats on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services
Committee, have both voiced reluctance to bring up the treaty again
next year, but are opposed to putting that in writing. ``Biden
doesn't believe in putting any conditions on the delay,'' said the
senator's spokesman, Chris Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point for Democrats is whether the letter
allows senators to break their vow in the event of an international
crisis, such as resumption of nuclear testing by India and
Pakistan. Warner said no such phrasing existed in the latest draft,
but that it was implicit in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the treaty debate require that all 100 senators
agree before a vote on the ill-fated accord can be postponed. But
four hard-line Republicans have vowed they will not give in.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, Daschle has said the Democrats would introduce a
motion to remove the treaty from the Senate's ``executive
calendar,'' a move that requires only a majority vote. But it is
unclear whether Democrats could persuade at least six Republicans,
for a total of 51 senators, to join them in a procedural vote that
is usually a test of party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said he might take such a step because
the consequences of killing the treaty were even greater. ``We've
got to get this thing pulled down,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Mets had not even arrived on Monday
afternoon, and the Atlanta Braves were already dismissing them,
flicking Manager Bobby Valentine's provocative remarks away like so
many foul tips.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 1 of the National League Championship Series still a
day away, the Braves warmed up to meet a team they dominated during
the regular season _ winning 9 of 12 games _ by smoothly assuming
the bemused air of the detached.
</P>
<P>
   If Chipper Jones had ignited much of Valentine's ire when he
tweaked Mets fans three weeks ago _ suggesting they drag their
Yankee gear out of the closet because the Mets were finished _ then
Valentine's comments Sunday about the Braves' perceived lack of
respect for the Mets, and then his rebuke of Jones for prematurely
predicting the demise of the Mets, seemed only to tickle the
Braves. It provided a pleasant diversion until the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves may have won the World Series only once in a decade
in which they have won eight division titles, but they have surely
learned how to win the war of words. As any child dealing with the
loudmouth in school knows, just hit him where it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his thoughts on Valentine, the voluble reliever John
Rocker, who once said he hated New York, responded with the
innocent smile of an altar boy and said: ``I look at the Mets team.
Seven of their nine hitters are .300 hitters, they have the best
infield in the history of the game, great bullpen, veteran starting
pitching. I'm really shocked to see how they had to squeak into the
playoffs with a one-game playoff. I thought they would beat us out
for the division, just looking on paper, at talent, theirs versus
ours. For us to still beat them 9 out of 12 times, I don't see how
Bobby Valentine could say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. ``He's a pretty good talent evaluator,'' Valentine said in
response to Rocker. ``I guess he feels we underachieved.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more sober moments. Mets catcher Mike Piazza took
batting practice with his left thumb heavily taped, but said he is
likely to play Tuesday, because the swelling and stiffness caused
by a cortisone shot had subsided.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, the Mets will start Masato Yoshii, who allowed two
runs on four hits in six and two-thirds innings in the Sept. 30
game the Mets lost to the Braves by 4-3 in 11 innings. He will
oppose Greg Maddux, whom the Mets unbelievably clobbered for eight
runs on 11 hits in a 9-2 victory on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves said that their regular-season dominance means
nothing in this series, that, despite the Mets' struggle, they had
always expected them to make the post-season. And the Braves say
they may do better than they did in the two previous league
championships _ losses to the Marlins and the Padres, respectively
_ precisely because they were challenged down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season, there was not much time between the
clinching and when the playoffs started,'' Jones said. ``Everybody
might have gotten a little rusty before. You had to play for 150
games, then relax for 10 days and then have the biggest series of
the year coming up. You had to flip that switch on. We haven't had
to do that this year, and hopefully that will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that he was not as hot at the plate as he was when he
single-handedly clobbered the Mets three weeks ago, that all the
teams pitching around him had thrown his rhythm off, explaining his
slump _ he batted .231 with one run batted in against the Houston
Astros in the division series. Someone asked Maddux whether any Met
in particular gave him trouble. ``No,'' he replied, not immodestly.
Later in the day, Valentine found it within him to call Jones a
``super talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But if baseball was still the lead story, then the more
interesting subtext was the frisson of tension between the two
clubs. The Braves have not had a true rival since moving to the
East, Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said, but their rival is whoever
challenges them each year in the division. That team this year was
the Mets, and Cox was quick to dismiss the notion Valentine had
proffered that the Braves somehow did not respect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke, a joke, the lack-of-respect angle,'' Cox said.
``I don't know where that came from. They've got our respect. They
have a lot of good players on that team and they're good guys. I
like them.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Valentine, who three weeks ago leveled this
devastating critique of Cox, ``This year he had to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know Bobby Valentine that well,'' said Cox, who
is thought to disdain Valentine, though he has never said so
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine, who arrived hours after the Braves finished their
workout, seemed perplexed by all the fuss his comments had caused.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, he seemed to be conceding that perhaps he had gone
too far, saying ``things are said and sometimes all of us don't
think before we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   So, was Valentine conceding that he had gone too far in his
attack on the Braves? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard them say anything other than we
underachieved,'' he said. ``Animosity? Our guys are loving, caring,
good fellows who just go about their business and just love to play
the game. I don't think there's any animosity on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could finally agree with something Valentine said.
This should make things much better. It's not the players the
Braves dislike, it's the Mets' fans, they explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they weren't done; they came back from the dead, I
guess,'' Jones said of the Mets. ``I always say things in the heat
of the battle. At that particular time it was more of a shot at
their fans than their ball club. Bobby Valentine can turn it around
any way he wants. The last thing I want to do is get into a
newspaper war with Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feed off the crowd,'' Jones said. ``If the fans of
New York can't get you pumped up for a game, nobody can. You hear
things about your mom, about your wife, about your kid. It's pretty
rude. Without a doubt, they're the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The games cannot begin soon enough.

REPORT FINDS FLAWS IN MISSOUR LAW ON SEIZURE OF DRUG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Flaws and gray areas in the law allowed
Missouri law enforcement agencies to circumvent state statutes when
they seized drug money, according to a report to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri auditor's report was undertaken this year because
of concerns that police had found a way to keep much of the drug
money they seized instead of sending it to public education, as
legislators intended.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, police must report all drug money they seize to
county prosecutors. The money is to be handled by state courts,
which normally would send that money to education.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star reported in January that in many cases
police simply gave seized money to federal agencies, which kept
part and returned the rest, usually 80 percent, to police.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's report is expected to be addressed in a
legislative hearing on the issue today in St. Louis. A copy of the
report was obtained by The Star.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor Claire McCaskill said she hoped the report would educate
legislators about the complexity of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one quick fix to the problems associated with
forfeitures in Missouri,'' McCaskill said. ``It is going to take an
effort in several different places to have forfeiture policies
follow what the legislative policy intended.''
</P>
<P>
   Her report, which was based on a survey of law enforcement in
Missouri, showed that $47 million was seized in the state in a
three-year period, with Missouri police agencies receiving more
than $19 million back from federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Five agencies, including Kansas City police, received 71 percent
of the $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report finds several problems in the state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Differences between state and federal law, the gray area of
task forces and the problems with the way state laws are written
create an environment where local law enforcement circumvents state
law and uses the federal instead,'' McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   State drug laws need to define when police have actually seized
cash or property. Currently state law simply requires police to
report money they seize to a county prosecutor. But some police
agencies have said they did not technically seize money in a search
of a person or property _ they were only holding it until a federal
agent arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the law are too restrictive. For example, people
who are charged in drug cases must be convicted of a felony before
the state can confiscate their property. The law should provide
some exemptions to that requirement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, local officers assigned to a federal task force
must still follow state laws when seizing property. But the report
says those officers could be subject to conflicting state and
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The report also questions some actions of law enforcement:
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies failed to always report to the county
prosecutor when they seized money or property. ``The prosecutors
have not been given the opportunity to determine how to proceed
with these potential forfeiture cases,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting attorneys and the attorney general have interpreted
state law to prohibit them from confiscating cash when drugs are
suspected but are not present in a search. For that reason,
officials have said, law enforcement turns that money over to
federal agencies. In actuality, according to the report, cash can
be forfeited under state law when no one claims it.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the small number of cases that were filed in state
court, judges often transferred money to a federal agency, even
though they did not need to under state law.
</P>
<P>
   The report also points out that the $47 million in seizures
makes up less than 1 percent of the funding Missouri provides to
local schools. The $3.5 million the Missouri Highway Patrol
received back from the federal government also is less than 1
percent of its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, however, have said that sending the money to
education is not the issue. They say they don't care where the
money goes as long as it doesn't stay with law enforcement. They
believe police agencies that generate revenue by seizures have a
conflict of interest and an opportunity for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill will release the report today at two news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   An interim legislative committee that has been holding hearings
on the matter will discuss the report at 10 a.m. today at
Harris-Stowe State College in St. Louis. The committee is headed by
Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, and Rep. Jim Kreider, a
Nixa Democrat and speaker pro tem.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the seizures in Missouri have involved large sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, St. Louis County police officers stopped a vehicle
on Interstate 44 in December 1998 because of traffic violations,
according to police reports. Officers searched the car and found
more than $1 million. They then notified the DEA, which sent agents
to the scene to take the money.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of the cash is pending. St. Louis County police
have said they chose not to comment on the case, and DEA officials
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   That case did not appear to be among the 104 seizures from seven
agencies, totaling $11.2 million, that state auditors sampled.

   If Consolidated Edison Co. reaches a deal to buy Northeast
Utilities, the combined company would have 4.7 million customers
stretching as far north as New Hampshire and would eventually be
able to sell cheaper power in the New York metropolitan region,
analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two companies are continuing, a person close
to the discussions said Monday. But the negotiations could still
break down. Neither company would confirm the talks Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both companies moved sharply last week on speculation
about a possible deal. Shares of Con Edison dropped by 7 percent on
concern that a merger with Northeast would depress Con Edison's
strong earnings. Shares of Northeast, meanwhile, rose more than 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Con Edison fell $1.875, to a 52-week-low of $37.1875.
Northeast rose 56.25 cents, to $21.125.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison, based in New York, had 1998 sales of $7.1 billion.
Northeast Utilities, which is based in Berlin, Conn., had 1998
sales of $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the utilities are in some ways very different,
analysts said that they were pursuing similar strategies and could
complement each other's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would make a nice fit,'' said Barry Abramson, a utility
analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison has pursued a cautious path under its chairman and
chief executive, Eugene McGrath, but is under pressure to expand in
the fast-paced environment of deregulation, where growth and size
are thought to be important.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Con Edison acquired Orange and Rockland Utilities
in New York state for $1.5 billion, adding to its customer base and
expanding its reach northward. It now has 3 million customers, many
of which need special high-quality power and require reliability.
An acquisition of Northeast, which sells power to 1.7 million
customers in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, makes
sense geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if McGrath does not act quickly, another large utility,
like the National Grid Group of Britain, could snap up Northeast.
David Jones, the group chief executive of National Grid, said last
week that he wanted to make more acquisitions in the Northeast, a
statement that may have spurred Northeast and Con Ed to enter into
more serious talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Abramson said, the deal would combine Con Edison,
which has had steady and strong earnings and has been paying a
steady dividend, with a utility that has had large losses in recent
years and had to suspend its dividend four years ago because of
financial pressures caused by problems with its nuclear plants.
McGrath may be reluctant to acquire a utility that would further
depress his company's stock price and dilute its earnings. But
Northeast has put a lot of its troubles behind it and has seen its
earnings recover. It plans to reinstate its dividend in December
and also plans to sell its nuclear plants, which are now operating
well.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have faced criticism recently.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-hour blackout on July 6 and 7 in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan, the worst blackout to hit the city in 22
years, left 200,000 people without power and raised a political
storm. The city has sued Con Edison, contending that the blackout
was caused by the company's failure to properly design and maintain
its network of cables that distribute electricity. The state is
also investigating the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast had losses in 1997 and 1998 because of problems at its
Millstone nuclear plant, which is owned by one if its subsidiaries,
Connecticut Light and Power Co. Unit 1 of its Millstone nuclear
plant is being retired and decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Long failures at Unit 3 of Millstone also plagued the company,
which had to buy expensive replacement power and do costly
maintenance. The plant has resumed operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also settling lawsuits over its nuclear
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are heading in the right direction,'' said Robert Rubin,
a utility analyst for Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its troubles, the company, under its chairman, president
and chief executive, Michael Morris, has been preparing for
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   As Con Edison is, his company is under orders by state
regulators to auction off its power-generating plants as part of
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Northeast has created an unregulated
subsidiary that has aggressively bought other power plants as they
have come on the market, including making a winning bid for 13 of
its own hydroelectric plants.
</P>
<P>
   It has built up a pool of power plants that can provide cheap
power, which is being sold to customers throughout New England by
another subsidiary, Select Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing arm has been able to win some big customers in the
region, offering long-term contracts to sell power and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that a merger would give Northeast an edge in selling
to Con Edison's customers.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, who have so far been reluctant or indifferent to
attempts by outside marketers to persuade them to switch over and
buy cheaper electricity, may be more willing to do so from the
combined utilities.

REPORT FINDS FLAWS IN MISSOUR LAW ON SEIZURE OF DRUG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
 2NDTAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Of those 104 seizures, the report said that
in 63 cases totaling $4.2 million, it appeared federal agents
initiated the case but that it was unclear whether a local or state
officer was involved in the seizure. To compound that problem,
sometimes law enforcement told auditors they would not comment on
the seizure and would ``let the records speak for themselves,''
McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63 federal cases, 29 were at airports, which the report
said appeared to be controlled by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In 33 seizures totaling $6.9 million, the report said, a local
law enforcement agency either controlled or initiated the case.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33, only one was reported to a county prosecutor or the
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 of those cases, totaling $282,052, a felony state charge
was possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 seizures, totaling $3.7 million, a felony could not have
been charged. If no one claimed the money, however, it could have
been forfeited under state law. But law enforcement records do not
reveal whether anyone actually claimed the property, which law
enforcement officials have said seldom happens.
</P>
<P>
   In three seizures, totaling $2.9 million, it was clear from the
case files that the money could have been forfeited under state
law.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found that of the $47 million seized in Missouri in
three years, $7 million was handled under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $1.5 million was distributed to schools, or 21 percent;
$1.8 million, or 26 percent, was transferred by a state judge to a
federal agency; $3.7 million, or 53 percent, was returned to owners
because charges were dismissed or the cases are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 186 cases totaling $1.8 million that state judges ordered
transferred to a federal agency, auditors reviewed 55 of them in
detail:
</P>
<P>
   In 30 of those cases, the prosecutor and the judge approved the
transfer, even though the corresponding criminal case was being
prosecuted in state court.
</P>
<P>
   In eight of the 30 cases _ representing $199,187 _ the judge
ordered the transfer because law enforcement requested it.
</P>
<P>
   In all of the 30 cases, it appeared that the property could have
been forfeited under state law. However, the report said, state law
was too subjective.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 other cases, a state forfeiture did not proceed,
because either no one was charged with a felony or the felony
charge had been dismissed.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CUTS IN COMMISSIONS STING TRAVEL AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Ill.)  (Eds: Also moved in ``t'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three more airlines cut travel agent commissions to 5 percent
from 8 percent on Monday, making the latest reduction in
commissions all but a fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts by Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, following the lead last week by United Airlines and
American Airlines, left the agent community shaken. ``It's going to
be devastating for lots and lots of travel agencies,'' said Mary
Berry Murphy, the owner of Berry World Travel in Omaha, Neb.,
echoing a concern widespread within the community.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' success with electronic ticketing and Internet
booking capability has periodically emboldened them to reduce
commissions, but most travel agents have demonstrated surprisingly
strong survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, 49 percent of travel agencies now have World Wide
Web sites of their own, compared with 37 percent last year,
according to the American Society of Travel Agents, and 76 percent
of the trade group's members have online capability, up from 61
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, these figures show that travel agents are using the
Internet to get the best deals for their clients,'' said James
Ashurst, a spokesman for the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Studies also suggest that many people who surf the Internet for
deals then turn to travel agents to make the bookings. For example,
a study this summer by NPD Online Research, which tracks consumer
buying and behavior, found that while more individuals are booking
travel online, ``56 percent of online travelers reported having
completed travel reservations with a traditional travel agent after
visiting a travel-related Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, NPD found, was ``the need for human contact and
assurances that reservations are correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Joe Galloway, the society's president, said, ``Despite the
doomsday forecasts by many industry `experts,' the Internet is not
carving away at travel agency profitability _ in fact, the exact
opposite is occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is likely that some of the almost 1,800 retail travel
locations that went out of business in the first seven months of
this year did so at least in part because of the drop in revenue
from lower commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lowering the rate, five airlines _ United, a unit
of UAL Corp.; American, owned by AMR Corp.; Delta; Northwest and
KLM _ like most other major airlines have imposed a $50 maximum
commission on round-trip domestic tickets and $100 on round-trip
international tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently wrote a $3,000 ticket for a corporate client who
likes to travel first class,'' said Joy Wittmann, the owner of the
Joy In Travel agency in Metairie, La. ``A few years ago we would
have made at least $300 on that ticket. Now it's $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, travel agents have turned to other sources of
income _ in particular, cruises, which with commissions averaging
about 15 percent are the second-biggest source of agent revenue and
the fastest growing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many travel agencies now charge fees averaging
between $10 and $15 for writing or rewriting tickets, booking
hotels or rental cars and processing refunds. Already 75 percent of
agencies charge fees, compared with 64 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murphy's agency, for example, charges fees of $10 and has
managed to reduce its reliance on the sale of airline tickets from
90 percent of the business to about 55 percent. To pick up the
slack, she sells more cruises and tours.
</P>
<P>
   Even with fees, a recent survey of 450 travel agencies found
that 90 percent of agencies that charge fees say they have retained
at least 81 percent of their clients; three-quarters say they have
kept at least 91 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, many travel agents believe that the combination of
commission cuts and direct online bookings has cut into their
revenues and profits _ and would have cut even deeper if the strong
economy of the last nine years had not emboldened people to keep
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murphy said that she had been aided by participating with
about 375 other Midwestern travel agencies in MAST, a consortium in
Hinsdale, Ill. The group's collective strength helps independent
agencies receive favorable rates on business items like computer
rentals and marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines hope to reduce their costs by cutting commissions.
United, for example, said that its commission cut is expected to
save about $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   American and Delta are not saying how much they expect to save.
Indeed, the releases announcing the cuts said that the carriers
would not offer any public comment about them.

A MIDWESTERNER IN PARIS EMERGES AS THE SURPRISE OF SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mo.) (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by

(DW) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ One lives in hope, as Andre Leon Talley, the Vogue
editor, likes to say _ meaning that for every budding genius, every
horribly effete or earnest display, one lives in hope of seeing a
young designer finally burst flush with talent.
</P>
<P>
   It is what one comes to Paris for, and it was why Talley,
ecstatically draped in a China-blue kimono with a black and white
fur over his arm, stood outside the Jeremy Scott show on Saturday
night _ the final day of the French spring ready-to-wear
collections _ with 100 other souls, even though there was no chance
of getting in.
</P>
<P>
   The fire marshals had declared the place full and locked the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for declarations. As soon as the show ended,
Talley, who is a big man, cut a swath through the crowd like an
ambulance shooting down Fifth Avenue, with all the people who had
been left outside pouring in behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Going straight into the dressing room, toward the bright lights
of the television cameras, Talley heard a couple of fashion writers
say it was Scott's best show. On the video replay, he saw for
himself how a scrawny 26-year-old designer from Missouri, who had
been too hot for anyone to handle _ going around Paris with gold
caps on his front teeth, seemingly trying to revolt everybody with
his ``vive l'avant-garde!'' bluster _ had simmered down to a cool,
mature talent.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's great stroke was to use his own experience, which is not
merely that of an American in Paris, but specifically that of a
Midwesterner _ as a foil to jet-set glamour. To the tick-tock tempo
of ``Welcome Aboard,'' the models strolled out in the old style of
department store fashion shows, with Scott providing perky
commentary. ``Our first model wears . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Out came khaki shirtdresses and suave trench coats printed
cheekily with Scott's name. Other ingenious touches included logo
flight bags and baby-blue tennis dresses, which Talley called
``very Serena and Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was a sweet victory for the misfit Scott. Standing near
him were his sister, Barbara, a lawyer in Kansas City, and their
mother, Sandy, a teacher. You could tell they had never given up
hope. Clutching flowers against her corduroy jumper, Mrs. Scott
said, ``Everybody needs a backup plan when they start out, and I
told Jeremy that I would be his backup if his reality didn't come
true. But it has, and I am still here.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other surprises in the final days of the collections,
particularly strong showings by established designers that all but
made puny the claims of the newer generation. Showing between such
a pair as Karl Lagerfeld of Chanel and Christian Lacroix, Narciso
Rodriguez's collection for Loewe was a blandly thin layer of
frosting buried in a scrumptious mountain of cake. Rodriguez showed
white leather for day and white leather for night, but it did not
add up to love in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix, on the other hand, seemed to come alive with his
collection. Opening with a sleek coat in a black and white floral
pattern over tropical-print jersey pants, Lacroix convincingly
mixed simple, modern shapes with kinetic colors and sudden bursts
of pattern. Everything was essentially based on the idea of two
pieces _ say, a pink jersey polo shirt worn nonchalantly with a
short skirt of chartreuse raw linen, which gradually broke up
around the hem in a loosely woven pattern of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Here were clothes that didn't look too much like Lacroix _ that,
in fact, seemed to break free of the old references. There were
white jersey bell-bottoms printed just at the back of the hems with
an eccentric drizzle of tie-dye flowers, a long-sleeve gray jersey
polo shirt worn with a fuchsia skirt splashed with a crescent of
metallic paillettes, and a fawn-colored suede tunic scissored open
at one side and glazed with silver beadwork. All this was shown
with the coolest stilettos: covered in striped or dotted fabric,
they flaunted the designer's lighter attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting front and center at the Chanel show was Marianne
Faithfull, whose career and songs of despair have meant so much to
the post-1960s generation. ``I am mad for her,'' said Lagerfeld,
who dressed Ms. Faithfull in Chanel for a performance here. ``I
think she is one of the most truthful human beings I know. She has
really gone through life like a survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   One could say the same of Lagerfeld. Anyone who tries to write
him off, say he's over, finished, forgets that his natural movement
is forward. The show he sent out for Chanel caught the momentum for
refined clothes with a dash of logos (camouflaged in a print) and
more feminine volume. That might mean a short, bouffant skirt of
oyster satin worn with a quilted chartreuse camisole, or a flippy
print skirt with a tight jacket in python _ a big trend here.
</P>
<P>
   Other take-away points in the show were hip-hugging jeans with
three zippers across the front, worn with a black lace T-shirt and
a black boucle jacket. Also on the march were pearls and quilted
bags (now attached to what looks like an oven mitt), but the real
news was Lagerfeld's cool revival of the Chanel jacket. He has made
it lighter, almost weightless, with a coy, inside layer of floral
chiffon drifting out like a blouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of seasons, Nicolas Ghesquiere has emerged as
a cult figure, in part because his silhouette for Balenciaga is so
unlike anyone else's, and also because his shapes seemed to combine
two current themes: 1980s disco (wide shoulders, pencil-thin
trousers) with 1950s volume.
</P>
<P>
   To look at the smocked yoke of Ghesquiere's taupe jersey dress
or one of his high-necked shirts or the V-front of a distressed
leather top is to see not the 80s but the very same details that
Cristobal Balenciaga used in the 50s. Ghesquiere's strength is to
express these ideas in his own terms. A gathered Balenciaga sleeve
now becomes a crushed leather glove. To convey Balenciaga's ideal
of Spanish correctness, Ghesquiere will put a crisp pinstripe shirt
under a distressed brown leather top. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the runways, Ennio Capasa sent out a strong,
simplified collection of sleek black separates enlivened with deep
lavender suede dresses and chiffon blouses that tied at the neck.
Jean Paul Gaultier's show, based on a ``Love Boat'' theme, was
hilarious, all right, with models sashaying out in Polynesian-print
palazzo pants, bloomers under denim miniskirts, jersey dresses and
tops gathered in keyholes around belly buttons, and big, buffoonish
hair. But as a collection it didn't make waves.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the light hand of John Galliano? He got
himself in such a twist the other night with his own collection,
mixing musical references and styles through the decades, that the
whole thing began to seem like the sartorial equivalent of the
Mashed Potato. There were some good moments, though _ a
coffee-colored satin party frock flounced with an underskirt of
tulle, and some skinny pant suits that brought to mind not so much
the Teddy Boys of the late 50s but the fierce, working-class style
in Stanley Kubrick's ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's impossible to pay much attention to Galliano's
overwrought clothes, with their ornate layers and heavy fabrics,
without thinking he has too much money at his disposal. He was much
more inventive when he was poor and used common telephone wire to
give his skirts their modern swing.

GLOBAL CROSSING BUYING A TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNIT IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Global Crossing Ltd. said Monday that it had acquired
the telecommunications business of Racal Electronics PLC of Britain
for 1 billion pounds, or about $1.65 billion, in cash. The deal
signals an aggressive push by Global Crossing into Europe, even as
it absorbs the Frontier Corp. of the United States, a provider of
long-distance and local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The move surprised some analysts, who had expected that Energis
PLC would acquire Racal, after reports in the British press and
briefings by executives at Energis that said a deal was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite surprised,'' said Mark Davies Jones, electronics
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. ``They kind of came from
nowhere with considerable rapidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said the two companies began
talking for the first time two weeks ago and signed the agreement
on Sunday night. Global Crossing, a communications start-up concern
with headquarters in Bermuda, hopes to build and operate a
worldwide fiber optic telecommunications network rivaling AT&AMP;T and
MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition of Racal is a catalyst for accelerating our
European operation,'' said Thomas J. Casey, vice chairman of Global
Crossing, in an interview. Speaking of the pressure to outbid
Energis, he added: ``We knew we were in a competition, but it
didn't dictate the price. Our valuation dictated the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Energis is said to have bid about 790 million pounds, or $1.3
billion in cash and stock. A spokesman for Energis acknowledged:
``Racal would have been a very attractive acquisition for us at the
right price. But for us, the right price is a lot less than 1
billion pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   While Global Crossing paid considerably more for Racal than
Energis was prepared to pay, analysts said the price tag reflected
pricing more representative of an American company than a British
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a reassessment in the U.S. market ab
much these things are worth, and it has begun to spill over to
Europe,'' said James Ross, a telecommunications analyst at ABN Amro
here.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing said that the acquisition would allow it to cut
costs by $420 million and that it would increase its income by
2001. The acquisition gives it control of a modern 4,500-mile
network that is built along the British rail system into major city
centers, making it less reliant on renting phone capacity from
British Telecommunications PLC than some of its large competitors
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Racal's network is built very deep into the
local exchange network allows Racal to interconnect to customers at
the lowest level of charges,'' Jack B. Grubman, an analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney in New York, wrote in a report issued to
investors Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Global Crossing fell $1.4375 Monday, to $35.0625,
in NASDAQ trading of more than 30 million shares. Racal rose 16.25
pence here, to 4.6625 pounds; Energis gained 33 pence, closing at
18.25 pounds. The deal was reported Monday by The Wall Street
Journal, The Financial Times and others.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts do not expect Energis or a third party to
re-emerge with a competing bid. Executives close to Energis said
the company did not plan to make a counteroffer.

EVOLUTION CONFLICT CONTINUES TO SIMMER AT KANSAS BOARD OF EDUCATION
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
 EVOLUTION-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evolution was a done deal in Kansas in August, but don't tell
that to the half-dozen persons who spoke Monday before the state
Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted to talk about it some more.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six condemned the board for voting 6-4 to downplay
the teaching of evolution. The two others _ a Hare Krishna leader
and Celtie Johnson of Prairie Village, a member of an area
creationist group, told the board that it was on the right track in
deciding that local school districts should determine whether
evolution should be taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has taken a bold and brilliant step in rejecting
Darwin's evolutionary theory as a scientific principle,'' said Hare
Krishna leader Danavir Swami, who was accompanied by several other
Hare Krishnas, all dressed in pale orange robes.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin provides ``no experiments and no intermediate forms
between species to back up his guesses'' that various species
evolved one from another without the need for an intelligent
designer, Swami said. ``Darwin bluffed the world with his
speculation and double-talk, but the Kansas Board of Education has
called his bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Swami, who is director of the Hare Krishna college in Kansas
City, said later that he does not support any teaching of evolution
in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The board is holding its monthly meeting Monday and today at De
Soto High School. It is scheduled to take up the question today of
how to rewrite its new science standards, which are based on
wording from three national science groups. Those groups, upset at
the decision to downplay evolution, decided recently to deny Kansas
permission to use the wording.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairwoman Linda Holloway said Monday during a break in
the meeting that she was not sure how the board would resolve the
copyright issue or who might rewrite the standards. She said she
hoped to learn more about the board's options today.
</P>
<P>
   As for the comments from the public Monday, she said: ``I'm glad
we live in America and can have free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who criticized the vote on evolution were Ken
Bingman, a biology teacher at Shawnee Mission West High School, and
Douglas Ruden, an assistant science professor at the University of
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Ruden presented to the board the 1999 Ig Nobel Prize for Science
Education, a ceramic green iguana. The spoof prize was awarded to
the board recently by four Nobel Prize laureates in a ceremony at
Harvard University. The award is sponsored by a science humor
magazine for work that ``cannot or should not be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway told Ruden to leave the iguana with a person at the end
of the table. He did.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of the board vote tried to make his point outside the
high school. Dave Raffel of Shawnee wore a gorilla costume and
carried a sign that said the board ``has made a joke of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffel said he was starting a group called ``Save Our Schools.''
He said he planned to work to oust members of the board who voted
in favor of diluting the teaching of evolution.

BRAVES ARE FAN PROOF, JORDAN SAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Jordan laughed at the suggestion that the Mets'
manager, with some fairly outrageous comments on Sunday, was trying
to induce the Shea Stadium fans to assist the Mets by taking the
Atlanta Braves out of their game this weekend, when their pennant
playoff goes to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at this level for nothing,'' Jordan said Monday.
``Gee.'' Then he added, ``The fans won't have any effect on our
play _ unless you jump out on the field and hit one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   As intelligent and as talented as the Braves right fielder is,
he was probably not too wise in raising that idea. One or more of
Manager Bobby Valentine's fan followers may actually try that
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have to come up with something different in their
attempt to beat the Braves one more time in the next week than they
did during the season, but mayhem doesn't seem like a good idea.
Stop Chipper Jones, all right; neutralize Jordan, for sure. But do
it with sliders and changeups and fastballs on the black, not with
cross-body blocks across the back of the knees of an unsuspecting
player minding his own business on the outfield grass.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves beat the Mets 9 of the 12 times they played this
season. The Braves won five of the six games the teams played in a
pivotal 10-day period late last month. The Mets can't afford to
allow the Braves to continue that pattern in the National League
Championship Series. If the Braves win four of seven or fewer
games, the Mets' march to the World Series will end prematurely. So
what to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some good information on them,'' John Stearns, the
Mets' advance scout, said at Turner Field Monday as the Mets went
through a brief round of batting practice. ``But you can get all
the information in the world; the guys still have to go out and get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Stearns had come from Houston, where he had watched the Braves
complete their division series victory over the Astros. In that
series, he watched Jordan rip Houston pitchers at the rate of .471.
He also saw Jones, who devastated the Mets here three weeks ago,
hit only .231.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chipper was more impatient than he was earlier,'' Stearns
said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, the Braves' batting coach, had made the same
observation. ``They were pitching around him and he came out of his
way of hitting,'' Baylor said. ``He became so impatient that he
swung at a 3-0 pitch, swung at a first-pitch changeup. Normally he
doesn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Mets didn't pitch around Jones, and he
banged four home runs and drove in 7 of the 13 runs the Braves
scored in their three-game sweep. In New York the following week,
however, the Mets pitched much more carefully to Jones, the Braves'
third baseman, and he collected only three singles and knocked in
two runs in 12 at-bats. But Jordan assumed the offensive load in
that series, showing the Mets the difficulty of the task they face
in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to not let Chipper Jones beat us,'' Darryl
Hamilton said. ``When we played here, he basically single-handedly
put us away. We can't let that happen anymore. But Brian Jordan is
hot now. With those two guys in the lineup, it's going to be tough
pitching around both of them. But we have to find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets should not expect to see the impatient Jones the Astros
saw. Baylor said he planned to talk with him before Game 1 Tuesday
night and tell him to be aggressive and not be lulled into thinking
the Mets will pitch around him. Baylor, however, wasn't planning to
say anything to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets a man on,'' Baylor said, ``when he gets two
strikes, I'm at ease. I know one thing. He's going to put the ball
in play somewhere, off the end of the bat, off the knob, he's going
to put it in play and try to get that run in. ``He gets into that
bunker mentality. Not too many times he's not going to put a good
at-bat on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was hit on the right hand by a pitch in June and was not
much of a factor in the Braves' lineup for weeks. He was in so much
pain swinging the bat at one point that he wanted to call it quits
for the season. ``I was in so much pain, I basically had given up
on myself and it affected me mentally,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   But a method of treatment he called cross-friction, a painful
procedure, restored the hand and wrist to game-ready status. ``Now
I don't even think about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what the Mets will confront, the tandem of Chipper
and Jordan, either one of whom can dominate a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got to make their choice and make their pick who they
want to pitch to,'' Jordan said. ``If Chipper and I don't do it,
Ryan Klesko and some other guys are going to do it. We play great
as a team. It's not Brian Jordan's and Chipper Jones' team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a team that will be affected by anything Valentine has
said or the New York fans may do this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's him,'' Jordan said, talking about Valentine's comments.
``It's not going to have an effect on one player in this
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had a message for the fans, too. ``They'll be better off
not getting on me,'' he said. ``At this point it's not going to
make a difference. I'm so motivated, so pumped up. I love playing
in the limelight. I love when fans get on me. It motivates me.''

KANSAS CITY IMMUNIZATIONS DROP AS NATIONAL AVERAGE INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As the national immunization rate for
America's toddlers climbed to a record high of nearly 80 percent
last year, the statistic for Kansas City area children took a dive.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson County the immunization rate fell from 90 percent in
1997 to 68 percent in 1998, according to statistics being released
today. Wyandotte County had the lowest percentage of five metro
counties, at 49 percent, down from 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, Platte and Johnson counties recorded slight declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed,'' said Bill Schmidt, administrator of the
Jackson County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt and other public health officials blamed high turnover
at health agencies, inconvenient times for immunization clinics, a
failure to mail reminder cards to parents, and societal complacency
_ there is no raging disease to promote urgency, as polio did
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also pointed to a new culprit _ the growing
anti-vaccine lobby that uses the Internet to spread its message
that infants and toddlers can suffer permanent injury, illness and
even death from childhood shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement is very vocal, and they are putting out a lot of
misinformation. The public is at a disadvantage,'' said Rosie
Howlett, a registered nurse and division head for preventive
clinical services for the Kansas City, Kan., Wyandotte County
Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the effect of the Web sites is difficult, because the
immunization rate for the country is at a record high. Still,
officials here say the movement could grow into a threat to public
health.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more visible Web sites is the National Vaccine
Information Center, which is based in Vienna, Va. Its home page
shows full-color photos of four toddlers _ two killed and two
permanently injured by adverse reaction to vaccines, said
co-founder Barbra Loe Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   She does not summarily denounce vaccines but staunchly
criticizes public health policy, which she says is designed to
protect society from disease while ignoring the knowledge that some
children will have adverse reactions from the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The message is that some are expendable for the good of the
many, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother doesn't give birth to a child to sacrifice for the
good of society,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts acknowledge that adverse reactions to vaccines do
occur and may cause serious harm. But they say the incidents are
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line _ the vaccine is safer than the disease,'' said
Leanne Glenn, maternal and children division manager at the Kansas
City Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The new immunization statistics are to be released today by the
Partnership for Children as part of its 1999 Report Card, which
grades the well-being of Kansas City's youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The rate is for children who have been fully immunized by age 2
for tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, polio, mumps, measles and
rubella. The data are for children seen by public health providers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no strict accounting for immunization of children seen
at private clinics, but surveys indicate the rate is a few
percentage points higher than for public agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the National Institutes of Health recently
estimated Missouri's overall immunization rate at 86 percent, three
points higher than the partnership's 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood immunization was a key focus of the partnership in
1991, when it began its mission to improve the well-being of
children in the area. The advocacy group sponsored clinics,
encouraged health providers to mail reminder cards to parents and
pushed for an immunization registry.
</P>
<P>
   The rate rose. From 52 percent in 1990, it increased each year
to a high of 84 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson (of this year's drop) is you can't let up _ every
year brings new parents,'' said James Caccamo, partnership
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The group takes some of the blame for the low rate, Caccamo
added. Perhaps there was a nonchalance attributed to the series of
increased rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He faulted health providers, too, saying they failed to
consistently mail reminder cards to parents and were not being more
``family friendly'' by offering clinics in evening hours. Reminder
cards, which are sent to a child's home to tell parents when a shot
is due, are key to immunization efforts, Caccamo said.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is likely to explore ways to increase the
mailings, even perhaps bringing private doctors into a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, at the Jackson County Health Department, blamed high
clerical turnover for failure to mail reminder cards, and he agreed
with Caccamo that more evening clinics might be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the department was also burdened by the new state
requirement of hepatitis B shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got behind and could never catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said the rate at the Kansas City Health Department held
steady at 79 percent, but she had a theory for declines elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunization is a victim of its own success,'' Glenn said. ``I
remember children with measles and meningitis. Most people don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Howlett said there needed to be a more concerted immunization
effort by day care operations, churches and health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that the anti-vaccine movement on the Internet, if
not met with a strong response, could mean an even lower rate next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who runs the vaccination Web site, says that is not her
goal. What she wants, she said, is for public health officials to
adopt a new policy that would consider each child individually. She
said children who were prime candidates for adverse reactions
frequently could be detected in individual screenings and family
histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't want to take the time to do that,'' according
to Fisher, who said her son suffered permanent brain damage from a
DPT shot in 1978. ``They just want to line these kids up and treat
them all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said, a more individual method would take more time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But isn't that the role of a humane and civilized society?''

 &HT;    Vandy gives fans money's worth
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It's not often that you find money-back guarantees
in college football _or anywhere in sports _ but that's exactly
what Vanderbilt University did for its new football season ticket
holders.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores made an announcement prior to the 1999 season:
Buy season football tickets and, if after the first three games
you're not satisfied with the ``Vanderbilt football experience,''
your money will be refunded.
</P>
<P>
   There were approximately 250 takers. And as of last Friday, the
deadline for refunds, only two ticket holders had asked for their
money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were probably Alabama fans, who just bought them to
insure they got tickets to that game,'' said Hunter Yuracheck,
Vanderbilt's assistant AD for marketing and promotions and the
brainchild behind the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's 4-2 record has helped. With NHL and NFL franchises
now in Nashville, Yuracheck knew the Commodores were competing for
the local entertainment dollar. He needed some way to let people
know Vanderbilt football was a good product.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores, who play host to Georgia Saturday at 2 p.m. at
Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville, are coming off their most lopsided
win in 47 years, a 58-0 victory over The Citadel. The Commodores
already have knocked off one ranked team this season when they beat
Ole Miss 37-34 in overtime in Oxford on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's other wins were a come-from-behind thriller over
Northern Illinois 34-31 and a 31-14 victory over Duke, which upset
Virginia recently. The Commodores lost to undefeated Mississippi
State 42-14 on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept our 4-2 record, but I was looking for a little better
than that,'' said coach Woody Widenhofer, who's 9-19 in three
seasons at Vanderbilt. ``We had Alabama and Mississippi State at
home and I thought we had a shot at (winning) both of those. I
thought the toughest game would be at Ole Miss and that's the one
we won.
</P>
<P>
   ``But any time you're on track to win more than you lose, you've
got to feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially at Vanderbilt, which hasn't enjoyed much success in
the 1990s. In fact, it hasn't had a winning season since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores, always good on defense under Widenhofer, are
suddenly getting it done on the other side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 142 points all of last season, Vanderbilt has
scored 191 this season and is fourth in the league in scoring
offense. After starting three different quarterbacks last year, the
Commodores committed themselves to Greg Zolman this year and he has
responded with 1,143 yards passing, just 307 yards shy of the
school record for a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt has solid running backs. Sophomore Rodney Williams
had 127 yards and four touchdowns before being pulled at halftime
against The Citadel. Williams, with 354 yards and seven touchdowns,
is second on the team in rushing. Junior Jared McGrath leads with
376 yards.

ADVERTISING: EXECUTIVES STRESS IMPORTANCE OF BRAND NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. _ Famous brand names, of people as well as
products, were the name of the game on Monday at the second general
session of the 1999 annual conference of the Association of
National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   At the general session, held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here, top
executives of two consumer-product companies offered case histories
to illustrate the theme of the conference, ``Brand Building for the
21st Century.'' And a round table of network radio personalities
discussed _ to paraphrase the jargon of the self-help movement _
how to be your best brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a strong brand,'' said David Vermylen,
president of the Keebler Brands division of Keebler Foods Co.,
``the retailer will dictate your strategy _ and your
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermylen, named a Marketer of the Year by the trade publication
Brandweek during a dinner Saturday that opened the conference,
outlined how new management at Keebler is seeking to increase sales
and shelf space in stores by ``leveraging the power of the Keebler
brand'' as embodied by the company's longtime symbols, the cartoon
elf characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Keebler strategy is that as adults, we may not believe in
elves,'' Vermylen said, ``but we can believe in the spirit of
elves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is defining what is your brand essence,'' he added,
``what it is about the brand that creates that connection with the
consumer and the retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Keebler cookies and crackers, Vermylen said, the
brand essence, or essential attributes, includes perceptions of
``uncommonly good quality, caring and fun,'' which become the focus
of advertising, promotions, packaging, store displays and other
marketing initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Elf Grahams, a line of bite-sized snack cookies
now being introduced, is being brought out in stand-up resealable
bags in elf shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bag is empty, you can reseal the top, cut off the
bottom and turn it into a hand puppet for kids,'' Vermylen said,
adding that he personally presented prototypes to heads of large
supermarket chains who ``think we're nuts'' _ but ``they love it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Cheez-It line of crackers, acquired when Keebler bought
Sunshine Biscuits in 1996, is being advertised for the first time,
Vermylen said, with sassy commercials by the Keebler agency _ Leo
Burnett Co., a unit of Leo Group _ that underscore the brand
essence as ``a bold, eat-them-by-the-handful snack.''
</P>
<P>
   The results? Cheez-It sales are expected to climb to about $360
million this year, Vermylen said, from $125 million in 1996, while
total Keebler sales should reach $2.5 billion, up from $1.6 billion
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Building very different types of brands _ toys and games _ was
the subject of remarks by Herbert Baum, president and chief
operating officer of Hasbro Inc., which sells products as disparate
as Monopoly, ``Star Wars'' figures, Furby dolls and Pokemon trading
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get one shot at the brass ring,'' Baum declared, urging
the audience to become experts in ``fast-lane marketing for fast
times'' as trends accelerate ``at twitch speed'' in selling
name-brand products to increasingly sophisticated consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six-year-olds don't aspire to be 12-year-olds,'' Baum
asserted. ``They're already there. And 3-year-olds are playing with
CD-ROMs instead of dolls.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fast-lane marketing to capitalize on trends offers ``high
potential market share in a short time,'' Baum said, ``but it's
hard to maintain momentum'' and ``year two can be a cold shower''
as a hot trend fades.
</P>
<P>
   And there are unforeseen risks, he added, like the recent
earthquake in Taiwan threatening the supply of chips for a Furby
based on the ``Star Wars'' character Yoda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many we presold,'' Baum said, but now
``we're not sure we'll get them out for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, there are benefits when the trends are in your
favor: ``I carry packs of Pokemon cards. I can get to the head of
any line, see any show, with Pokemon cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The radio round table was part of the sponsored portion of the
general session, paid for by five national radio networks. The
network executives were joined by five familiar radio
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all brands,'' Charles Osgood of CBS Radio Network, part
of Westwood One Inc., said of the five, ``in the sense that we have
a certain identity, have to maintain a certain quality and have to
bring something to the affiliates they can't bring to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Kasem, the longtime proprietor of top-40 countdown shows,
said, ``One word is more important than any other word:
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was starting out in radio in Detroit,'' Kasem recalled,
``there were DJs that were not very good, but they had an audience.
It was because these people were always bad, not good one or two
days a week.'' The audience laughed heartily.
</P>
<P>
   Kasem, who works for AMFM Radio Networks, and Osgood were joined
by Tom Joyner of ABC Radio Networks, a disc jockey in the ``urban
radio'' format; the talk-show host Rush Limbaugh of Premiere Radio
Networks; and April Ryan, White House correspondent for American
Urban Radio Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is part of Walt Disney Co. AMFM is part of AMFM Inc., which
agreed last week to be acquired by Clear Channel Communications.
Westwood One is managed by Infinity Broadcasting Corp., a division
of CBS Corp. Premiere is a unit of Clear Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also featured the presentation on Monday night of
the fourth annual Casie Awards for outstanding interactive
advertising and Web sites. ``Casie'' is derived from the Coalition
for Advertising Supported Information and Entertainment, founded by
the Advertiser Association and the American Association of
Advertising Agencies. The presentation was a curtain-raiser for the
general session on Tuesday, devoted to e-business.
</P>
<P>
   For best interactive ads for products, the winners were Kraft
Foods, part of Philip Morris Cos., and Modem Media.Poppe Tyson,
part of True North Communications. For best interactive ads for
communications, the winners were IN2 and Star Media.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best Web site for products went to Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co. and Grey Interactive, part of Grey Advertising, for the
Cover Girl cosmetics line. The award for best Web site for services
went to Continental Airlines and Blue Marble Advanced
Communications Group, part of MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is the 90th annual gathering of the Advertiser
Association, the trade organization representing the United States'
biggest marketers. It began on Saturday afternoon and is scheduled
to end Tuesday night.

EDITORIAL: FIGHTING FOR THE TEST BAN TREATY  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Despite the important contribution it would make to a safer
world, the nuclear Test Ban Treaty stands virtually no chance of
mustering enough support to win Senate ratification this week.
Proceeding with the vote under those circumstances would deal a
damaging blow to the foreign policy and military security of the
United States. The wiser course is to delay Senate action for at
least a few months, as President Clinton requested Monday, giving
the White House more time to overcome the arguments of treaty
critics.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican senators are recklessly insisting on an immediate
vote unless Clinton agrees to withdraw the treaty for the rest of
his term. That is something that he should avoid, because it would
signal to the rest of the world that the White House, not just the
Senate, is edging away from the Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refuses to be bound by such conditions. Nevertheless
some Senate treaty supporters, including Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
New York, are trying to put together a deal under which Clinton
would not give up on the treaty, while Senate Democrats would
refrain from pushing it in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The message that Washington sends to the world matters a lot.
One audience consists of countries like India and Pakistan, which
are still trying to decide whether to sign the treaty and would be
unlikely to do so if the Clinton White House gave up on eventual
Senate ratification. For these countries to remain outside the test
ban would encourage a dangerous nuclear arms race in South Asia
that could easily draw in nearby countries like Iran and China. It
could also fuel the ambitions of other intermediate powers, like
Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, to join an expanding nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of countries includes established nuclear nations
such as China and Russia. Like Washington, Beijing and Moscow have
signed the treaty but not yet ratified it, and are observing a
voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Clinton continues to campaign for the Test Ban Treaty
and there remains a reasonable chance that Washington will someday
ratify it, these countries are likely to refrain from further
testing. But if hopes for eventual U.S. ratification recede, China
or Russia might be tempted to test again in an effort to improve
their bomb designs and narrow America's present lead in nuclear
weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   These considerations argue strongly for delaying the vote rather
than giving up on it for this Congress. The treaty is backed by
America's military leaders, public opinion and Washington's main
allies. Good answers are available to the objections so far raised
by Senate critics. True, the election-year political calculus is
not favorable, and ultimately it may be necessary to wait until a
new president and a new Senate take office early in 2001. But U.S.
interests are best protected if in the interim Washington does not
disavow the treaty.

SUIT CHALLENGES N.Y. STATE'S WAY OF FINANCING PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judge will hear opening arguments Tuesday in
a case that poses the most serious challenge yet to New York
state's method of financing public schools. The case mirrors
lawsuits around the nation that have often forced states to
allocate more money to poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan and which
has already cleared several court hurdles, argues that the state's
school financing formula has deprived city students of their right
to a ``sound, basic education'' under the state constitution. The
plaintiffs, a coalition of advocacy groups called the Campaign for
Fiscal Equity, also accuse New York state of engaging in racial
discrimination by giving a disproportionate share of school aid to
districts outsiYork City. The city's student body is
overwhelmingly nonwhite.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the lawsuit could end the state's tradition of
meting out almost $13 billion a year to schools based largely on
political deal-making. It could force the state to raise taxes to
provide more money for schools in New York City and other poor
districts, or to find another way to sharply increase state aid to
those school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current formula, the city receives 35.5 percent of the
state's education aid, even though it enrolls 38 percent of the
state's public school children, according to the suit. The
difference of two and a half percentage points equals $318 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether all children are entitled to a decent
education in this state, and that means whether poor and minority
children are entitled to the resources necessary to provide them
with an adequate education,'' said Joseph Wayland, a lawyer for the
Campaign for Fiscal Equity. ``We know what it takes, we know they
don't get it, and the state is responsible for that shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in 1993, is similar to cases in other states
that seek to define an adequate education and force the state to
provide it. In New Jersey, a 28-year school financing battle ended
last year when that state's highest court accepted Gov. Christie
Whitman's plan to improve curriculums and school buildings in urban
districts. The court also ordered Mrs. Whitman to end a spending
disparity between the wealthiest and poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, the state's top court ruled in 1977 that the
school finance system was unconstitutional and ordered the state to
come up with a more equitable formula. A more recent suit charging
that inequities still exist is now in court.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the school financing suit that goes to trial
Tuesday follows a 1982 case in which the Court of Appeals, the
state's highest court, dismissed a similar challenge brought by a
Long Island school group. That group based its suit on spending
disparities between poor and wealthy school districts, and the
court ruled that such disparities did not violate the state
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The current case, however, focuses on whether the state has
failed to insure that students in poor districts receive the
minimally adequate education required by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The state tried to have the Campaign for Fiscal Equity's suit
dismissed, but the Court of Appeals ruled in 1995 that the case
could proceed in the lower courts and laid out an unusually
detailed blueprint to help the trial court determine whether the
current system is unconstitutional. A ``sound, basic education,''
the court wrote, ``should consist of the basic literacy,
calculating and verbal skills necessary to enable children to
eventually function productively as civic participants capable of
voting and serving on a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many school financing suits have charged that the
education in poor districts is inadequate, New York's case is one
of only a handful that also include a civil rights claim. In its
1995 ruling, the high court said the state's school financing
system could be found in violation of the federal Civil Rights Act
of 1964 if the plaintiffs could prove two things: that the system
had a ``discriminatory effect'' on minority students and that other
``less discriminatory alternatives'' were available.

EDITORIAL: HUMANITARIAN AID TO SERBIA  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   European foreign ministers on Monday approved the shipment of
heating oil to two cities in Serbia controlled by the opposition to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. While the Clinton
administration is concerned that the fuel might indirectly help the
Milosevic regime, the planned shipments actually do not go far
enough. Heat is a basic humanitarian necessity during the cold
Balkan winters, and should go to all Serbs who need it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war in Kosovo ended in June, Washington and European
nations have struggled with how to provide humanitarian aid to
Serbia without helping to prop up Milosevic. The West's obligations
are particularly hard to sort out because Serbia's infrastructure
and economy have been crippled not only by NATO bombing but by
years of Milosevic's ruinous policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is concerned that European nations
will seek to provide aid on such a broad scale that it could end up
benefiting the Serbian regime. The fear is legitimate, as many
nations in Europe have been relaxed about aid and trade with
Milosevic. Washington is right to oppose anything beyond
humanitarian aid until Milosevic is out of power. There should be
no restoration of air links to Belgrade, shipments of gasoline or
help to rebuild bridges and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has approved a very limited plan _ a small
shipment of heating oil to two cities, Nis and Pirot, with
opposition governments. If it is properly used _ not hijacked by
the central government or sold by corrupt officials _ the EU would
then begin sending fuel oil and perhaps other forms of humanitarian
aid to opposition-controlled areas elsewhere in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Help for Nis and Pirot could, in fact, damage Milosevic because
it would send a message to Serbs that the opposition can deliver a
higher standard of living than their leader can. Such aid will also
help people realize that sanctions are targeting Milosevic, not
ordinary Serbs. But if the aid program expands beyond humanitarian
goals to anything not necessary for saving lives, the aid must be
sent only to the opposition areas and in well-designed programs, or
wait until Yugoslavia is a democratic nation.  &QL;

A glimpse behind the scenes of San Francisco neighborhood 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a visit to any major city, there is no
substitute for being escorted about by a townie, someone who has
been around long enough to become intimately familiar with its
neighborhoods, its nooks, its secrets, its surprises.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has ever poked around the edges of San
Francisco's Chinatown district but always sensed that an entirely
different world percolated behind olorful facades, there is
a tour that takes delight in unraveling a few of the mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Overseen by writer, chef and Chinatown cheerleader Shirley
Fong-Torres, it transcends the conventional urban walking tour of
historic buildings, statues and plaques. This one combines culture,
history and superstition with food, glorious food.
</P>
<P>
   In its 14th year, it is playfully titled the Wok Wiz Chinatown
Tour, and although the 50ish Fong-Torres has a staff of 13 guides
to help conduct it _ she leans toward hiring older, longtime
residents of the community _ she personally headed up a recent
three-hour-plus stroll through the neighborhood of her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, her group of 13 trooped past vegetable and herb
stands, tiptoed into a Buddhist temple, squeezed down narrow
alleys, ducked into the shop of a venerable artist, sampled tea in
a sit-down ceremony, jaywalked en masse and made a requisite stop
at a fortune-cookie factory. And it all concluded with an elaborate
dim sum lunch at a restaurant so far off the tourist track that the
menu was printed entirely in Chinese and not a single server spoke
English.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the walk, Fong-Torres served up delicious tidbits of
lore.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The doorways in this alley were built so narrow,'' she said
at one point, ``so the burly white policemen couldn't get through
easily when they were chasing someone.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stop. Close your eyes. Listen. Hear that sound up above? The
women are playing mah-jongg in a room above the street.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The other people of San Francisco discovered this area
because of the wonderful smells coming out of here. There was a
street for herbs, one for dessert, one for candy.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which costs $37 including lunch, $25 without, is
conducted daily at 10 a.m. Bring an appetite. And a healthy
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Fong-Torres began with a few words of orientation at her small
office at 654 Commercial St. She described its feng shui _ the
superstitions and legends that govern placement of items in the
room: why the mirrors are positioned just so, what the wind chimes
and plants and idols represent, even the significance of the
sequence of numbers in the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult for the Chinese people when they came
here,'' Fong-Torres said, referring to an influx that was
alternately fueled in the last century by California's Gold Rush
and the construction of railroads in the West. ``They began to rely
on gods and goddesses for good luck. They would eat the right foods
_ serving long noodles to someone for long life. They wouldn't give
a clock to a woman in her 90s, so she wouldn't be reminded that her
life was ticking away.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the walk, she halted the group across from the Bank of
Canton, an ornate, bright-red building with the distinctive curved
roof. There was a belief that evil spirits traveled in a straight
line, so roof corners were curved upward ``to trick them,'' she
said. The red signifies happiness, just as green represents
progress and gold prosperity _ which is why those colors are so
prominent in this community.
</P>
<P>
   The building once served as Chinatown's telephone exchange, we
were told, and it was always a major event when someone received a
long-distance call.
</P>
<P>
   The tour group headed down a side street, stepped through a
doorway and was greeted by a gaunt, gray-haired man whose art
studio walls are lined with his paintings. Yiu-Kwan Lau opened
weathered boxes holding his paints and brushes and shortly
completed a drawing of a spirited horse in full sprint, much to the
delight of a young girl who edged her chair closer to watch him
work.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was a temple of Buddhist and Taoist worship. The
air was pungent with burning incense, and statuettes were lined up
shoulder to shoulder on every flat surface. The altar, we learned,
is used both for praying and the telling of fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop a grocery, where displays included roots, herbs, bark,
sea horses, cicada, shark fin _ most everything dried and
shriveled. ``The Chinese were afraid of American foods,''
Fong-Torres said. ``We dried food to preserve it, using the sun. We
were doing sun-dried tomatoes before it was trendy.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, she had to raise her voice to be heard over the
shopkeeper, who was arguing loudly in Chinese with a supplier who
had just brought in a crate of something brown and unidentifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Next was Ross Alley, where laundry hung from the fire escape
high above. Fong-Torres laughingly pointed out a tiny barber shop
and said, ``Five dollars, five minutes.'' Then she
unenthusiastically directed her charges to a fortune-cookie bakery.
She includes this stop because she figures people will feel
shortchanged without it, but she warned that the proprietors are
unbearably pushy. And, indeed, we were not two steps in the door
when someone thrust a tray of wares under our noses and barked,
``Try some? Now you buy some.''
</P>
<P>
   The group stopped in at King Tin Restaurant on Washington
Street, ``where you can buy duck feet, if you wish,'' Fong-Torres
said. ``Waste not, want not. The Chinese people would use all parts
of the chicken or duck.'' We were just browsing here, though; lunch
would come later, after we drank to this new acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   The simple ceremony took place at TenRen's Tea, on Grant Avenue,
where the walls are lined with bright-green tins of various types
of tea and samples are poured continually. Fong-Torres guided her
tourists to a table and chairs in the back to serve them oolong (to
celebrate friendship), hibiscus and ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was time for lunch. And what a feast it was. The
chosen restaurant was Ryumon, on Washington Street. Two tables were
set up and waiting for the tour, and Fong-Torres conversed
animatedly with the staff in Chinese as she got everybody seated.
</P>
<P>
   The fare soon arrived in a deliciously dizzying procession:
chrysanthemum tea, pork dumpling, spicy mustard, chili paste,
dumpling with young onions and shrimp, barbecued pork bun, bean
curd roll, beef chow fun, snow pea sprouts, salty fish with chicken
and rice (a dish from Fong-Torres' childhood, she said). Because
the group included a vegetarian with a less-than-robust appetite,
there were bonus dishes that were passed around: vegetarian
dumpling, pot stickers, glutenous rice balls.
</P>
<P>
   It was all sumptuous. Afterward, after we rolled out onto the
sidewalk, Fong-Torres grinned and said, ``Once, Chinatown was so
small, you didn't need a map, just a nose.''
</P>
<P>
   She was thanked for letting us join her this day as she followed
hers.

A glimpse behind the scenes of San Francisco neighborhood 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a visit to any major city, there is no
substitute for being escorted about by a townie, someone who has
been around long enough to become intimately familiar with its
neighborhoods, its nooks, its secrets, its surprises.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has ever poked around the edges of San
Francisco's Chinatown district but always sensed that an entirely
different world percolated behind those colorful facades, there is
a tour that takes delight in unraveling a few of the mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Overseen by writer, chef and Chinatown cheerleader Shirley
Fong-Torres, it transcends the conventional urban walking tour of
historic buildings, statues and plaques. This one combines culture,
history and superstition with food, glorious food.
</P>
<P>
   In its 14th year, it is playfully titled the Wok Wiz Chinatown
Tour, and although the 50ish Fong-Torres has a staff of 13 guides
to help conduct it _ she leans toward hiring older, longtime
residents of the community _ she personally headed up a recent
three-hour-plus stroll through the neighborhood of her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, her group of 13 trooped past vegetable and herb
stands, tiptoed into a Buddhist temple, squeezed down narrow
alleys, ducked into the shop of a venerable artist, sampled tea in
a sit-down ceremony, jaywalked en masse and made a requisite stop
at a fortune-cookie factory. And it all concluded with an elaborate
dim sum lunch at a restaurant so far off the tourist track that the
menu was printed entirely in Chinese and not a single server spoke
English.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the walk, Fong-Torres served up delicious tidbits of
lore.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The doorways in this alley were built so narrow,'' she said
at one point, ``so the burly white policemen couldn't get through
easily when they were chasing someone.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stop. Close your eyes. Listen. Hear that sound up above? The
women are playing mah-jongg in a room above the street.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The other people of San Francisco discovered this area
because of the wonderful smells coming out of here. There was a
street for herbs, one for dessert, one for candy.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which costs $37 including lunch, $25 without, is
conducted daily at 10 a.m. Bring an appetite. And a healthy
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Fong-Torres began with a few words of orientation at her small
office at 654 Commercial St. She described its feng shui _ the
superstitions and legends that govern placement of items in the
room: why the mirrors are positioned just so, what the wind chimes
and plants and idols represent, even the significance of the
sequence of numbers in the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult for the Chinese people when they came
here,'' Fong-Torres said, referring to an influx that was
alternately fueled in the last century by California's Gold Rush
and the construction of railroads in the West. ``They began to rely
on gods and goddesses for good luck. They would eat the right foods
_ serving long noodles to someone for long life. They wouldn't give
a clock to a woman in her 90s, so she wouldn't be reminded that her
life was ticking away.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the walk, she halted the group across from the Bank of
Canton, an ornate, bright-red building with the distinctive curved
roof. There was a belief that evil spirits traveled in a straight
line, so roof corners were curved upward ``to trick them,'' she
said. The red signifies happiness, just as green represents
progress and gold prosperity _ which is why those colors are so
prominent in this community.
</P>
<P>
   The building once served as Chinatown's telephone exchange, we
were told, and it was always a major event when someone received a
long-distance call.
</P>
<P>
   The tour group headed down a side street, stepped through a
doorway and was greeted by a gaunt, gray-haired man whose art
studio walls are lined with his paintings. Yiu-Kwan Lau opened
weathered boxes holding his paints and brushes and shortly
completed a drawing of a spirited horse in full sprint, much to the
delight of a young girl who edged her chair closer to watch him
work.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was a temple of Buddhist and Taoist worship. The
air was pungent with burning incense, and statuettes were lined up
shoulder to shoulder on every flat surface. The altar, we learned,
is used both for praying and the telling of fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop a grocery, where displays included roots, herbs, bark,
sea horses, cicada, shark fin _ most everything dried and
shriveled. ``The Chinese were afraid of American foods,''
Fong-Torres said. ``We dried food to preserve it, using the sun. We
were doing sun-dried tomatoes before it was trendy.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, she had to raise her voice to be heard over the
shopkeeper, who was arguing loudly in Chinese with a supplier who
had just brought in a crate of something brown and unidentifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Next was Ross Alley, where laundry hung from the fire escape
high above. Fong-Torres laughingly pointed out a tiny barber shop
and said, ``Five dollars, five minutes.'' Then she
unenthusiastically directed her charges to a fortune-cookie bakery.
She includes this stop because she figures people will feel
shortchanged without it, but she warned that the proprietors are
unbearably pushy. And, indeed, we were not two steps in the door
when someone thrust a tray of wares under our noses and barked,
``Try some? Now you buy some.''
</P>
<P>
   The group stopped in at King Tin Restaurant on Washington
Street, ``where you can buy duck feet, if you wish,'' Fong-Torres
said. ``Waste not, want not. The Chinese people would use all parts
of the chicken or duck.'' We were just browsing here, though; lunch
would come later, after we drank to this new acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   The simple ceremony took place at TenRen's Tea, on Grant Avenue,
where the walls are lined with bright-green tins of various types
of tea and samples are poured continually. Fong-Torres guided her
tourists to a table and chairs in the back to serve them oolong (to
celebrate friendship), hibiscus and ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was time for lunch. And what a feast it was. The
chosen restaurant was Ryumon, on Washington Street. Two tables were
set up and waiting for the tour, and Fong-Torres conversed
animatedly with the staff in Chinese as she got everybody seated.
</P>
<P>
   The fare soon arrived in a deliciously dizzying procession:
chrysanthemum tea, pork dumpling, spicy mustard, chili paste,
dumpling with young onions and shrimp, barbecued pork bun, bean
curd roll, beef chow fun, snow pea sprouts, salty fish with chicken
and rice (a dish from Fong-Torres' childhood, she said). Because
the group included a vegetarian with a less-than-robust appetite,
there were bonus dishes that were passed around: vegetarian
dumpling, pot stickers, glutenous rice balls.
</P>
<P>
   It was all sumptuous. Afterward, after we rolled out onto the
sidewalk, Fong-Torres grinned and said, ``Once, Chinatown was so
small, you didn't need a map, just a nose.''
</P>
<P>
   She was thanked for letting us join her this day as she followed
hers.

STAPLES CENTER: WHAT A PLACE!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ L.A. might tumble, fumble and bumble when it comes
to building a new football stadium, but, oh, has it made up for its
legendary foot-dragging when it comes to erecting a new sports
arena.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, L.A. soon will unveil the most modern, the most
luxurious, the most aesthetically-pleasing entertainment edifice in
America when The Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, performs the
opening show at the Staples Center on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As I donned a hard hat and walked through the $375 million
building the other day, I felt the same feelings of awed rapture I
had the first time I walked through the Superdome in New Orleans,
the Sky Dome in Toronto and even the Pond in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. has two dilapidated football sanctuaries in the Coliseum
and Rose Bowl. It has two other athletic places, the Forum and
Sports Arena, destined for the junk heap. And its 37-year-old
baseball outlet, Dodger Stadium, soon will be undergoing serious
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   But now, finally, L.A. has something it can gloat about.
</P>
<P>
   It possesses the creme de la creme of modern sports arenas.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the Staples Center would be state of the art, but it has
turned out to be even more impressive than what I had envisioned, a
roomy, 150-foot, 11-story-high structure with 1,200 TV monitors, a
$1.5 million sound system, 55 restrooms, 11 escalators, 10
elevators, 160 luxury suites and 14,000 seats with pleasing views
of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you can't see what is unfolding on the floor, or ice
from those 5,400 seats in the upper reaches of the arena. It's just
from that faraway vantage point Shaquille O'Neal will look small
enough to be riding a horse at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby area is immense, and there will be six minority-owned
fast food outlets---two McDonald's, two Pizza Huts, a Panda Express
and a Camachos---catering to hungry customers along with the
Staples Center's own culinary outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will starve, or get thirsty in this place,'' said
Michael Roth, the Staples Center's publicity director.
</P>
<P>
   When you first venture into the Staples Center, two features
immediately catch your attention---its architectural beauty and
sheer size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two and a half times bigger than the Forum,'' says Roth.
</P>
<P>
   It looks big enough to house a football team, which it will do.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Avengers of the Arena Football League will play their
home games at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, will the Lakers, Clippers and Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have 200 dates filled up for our first year in
existence,'' says Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center has only four luxury boxes still unsold, with
the other 156, 8 to 14-seat suites having been purchased by various
corporate entities and wealthy individuals for anywhere between
$197,000 to $307,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those with tickets to luxury boxes and premier seats will have
access to the Arena Club, a high-end bar-restaurant that will be
off-limits to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Still another exclusive refuge will be the Grand Reserve Club,
restricted to a membership of 200 with annual fees at a cool
$10,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place will have its own wine cellar and cigar room,''
says Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-sided scoreboard is another sight to behold, with four
Mitsubishi video screens and four message boards.
</P>
<P>
   It also looks to be at least four times larger than that dinky
one at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Natch, the Staples Center is abundant in high-tech gimmickry,
with something called the Pacific Bell Wireless Fan Access Hotline
available to the patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a baby-sitter wants to get hold of you at the game,
she pages us with your seat number,'' says Roth. ``And we'll take a
cell phone to your seat for you to make a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists attending Kings' game will sit in the Bob Miller
Pressbox, named after the Kings' long-time announcer.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a Chick Hearn Press Room, named after the
venerable voice of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The imposing downtown arena, located at 11th St. and Figueroa
next to the Convention Center, figures to present a traffic
nightmare for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably take people a year, but I'm sure they'll find
short-cuts on how to get in and out of here,'' says Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center already has proven to be a stellar attraction
for the downtown professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of attorneys, stock brokers and other business
types in the city buying season tickets,'' says Roth.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat in one of the purple-colored seats in the upper
concourse, a Mark McGwire home room from the floor, a young
construction worker laboring near the top inquired about the price
of tickets for Laker games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top ones go for $150 and the lowest are $10,'' said Roth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I guess this is where I'll be watching the games,'' said
the young construction worker. ``I'll just bring my binoculars. But
I'll be coming. I wanna be part of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the strong feeling here that a lot of people around L.A.
are going to want to be a part of this dazzling new monument.

RUSSIAN COURT ANNULS U.S. INVESTORS' STAKE IN A PORCELAIN FACTORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's shaky foreign-investment reputation weakened
further Monday when a court in St. Petersburg ruled that the
255-year-old Lomonosov porcelain factory be renationalized,
annulling a majority stake held by executives of a prominent Wall
Street buyout firm and an American-financed investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Stobie, vice president of the $440 million United
States-Russia Investment Fund, said it planned to appeal the ruling
that voided the ownership interests of his organization and those
of executives in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision on a case brought by the Russian Ministry
of State Property against the porcelain factory is the latest in a
series of disputes over the last year that have eroded foreigners'
investments in Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dart Group, for example, is struggling to prevent a share
issue by the Russian oil conglomerate Yukos that would dilute
Dart's stake in a Yukos subsidiary. BP Amoco PLC is trying to save
a half-billion-dollar investment in a now-bankrupt Russian oil
company, Sidanko.
</P>
<P>
   and other, smaller deals gone awry have supported the
widely held view abroad that Russia's market is a volatile one
unworthy of significant investment because most major Russian
companies, and perhaps even the government itself, flout
shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with start-ups who understand the importance of sound
corporate governance,'' Stobie said. ``But 90 percent of the
factories that existed under the Soviets still don't understand it.
They think an equity investment is a no-interest loan.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund was capitalized by Congress in the early 1990s to
encourage direct investment into the Russian economy, and so far,
it has invested about $240 million. The fund has spent about $4.25
million since September 1998 to purchase slightly more than 25
percent of the Lomonosov plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Kohlberg Kravis executives, through a holding company called
the International Porcelain Co., invested about $4 million of their
own money and acquired a similar-size holding. The rest of
Lomonosov is owned by current and retired employees and by two
offshore companies.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, Russia's oldest and most famous porcelain works,
was purveyor to the imperial court and, in modern times, the maker
of china praising the achievements of the Soviet state. During its
heyday, Lomonosov was regarded highly enough that museums all over
the world carried its porcelain sets. ``We invested because of the
brand name,'' Stobie said. ``There are very few high-quality
porcelain brands in the world, and this is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Soviets, however, and recent ragged years of reform,
the quality of Lomonosov china had steadily declined, Stobie said,
and the factory today is unprofitable. The investment fund had
planned to invest in new equipment, he said, to improve the quality
of the porcelain being turned out.
</P>
<P>
   But since their initial investment late in 1998, the fund and
the International Porcelain Co. have had severely limited access to
the plant and its books, mainly, they say, because of a hostile
management that, like many from the Soviet era, view outsiders as a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, the Ministry of State Property filed suit against
the Lomonosov plant to annul the privatization, based on what it
called an error in the factory's original incorporation in 1993.
Fund officials have said they suspect the suit was initiated at the
request of Lomonosov management to fend off the foreign investors.
Officials at Lomonosov and the property ministry could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stobie, the three judges hearing the case
deliberated for 15 minutes before repealing the privatization.

 &HT;    Gingrich seeks to depose wife's friend
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Ohio editors.)
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich wants to question one of his wife's Ohio
friends who served as a witness to the couple's 1987 separation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Villio of Warren, Ohio, and Marianne Gingrich have been
friends since before she met Newt Gingrich in the late 1970s.
Marianne Gingrich, 48, grew up near Warren, in the small town of
Leetonia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 56-year-old Gingrich filed a motion asking a Cobb
County, Ga. judge for permission to depose Villio, 54. The motion
was not specific about what Gingrich hopes to learn from Villio.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both Gingriches did not return phone messages left
at their offices Monday afternoon asking for comment. Efforts to
contact Villio failed.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich already has received permission to depose a
number of her husband's friends and associates, including his
closest adviser, Joe Gaylord. Callista Bisek, a 33-year-old
congressional aide, also has been subpoenaed to testify about her
relationship with Newt Gingrich. A judge will make a final ruling
next week on Bisek's motion to toss out the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Villio signed her name as a witness on the Gingriches' 1987
separation agreement that split everything from bank accounts to
furniture. Under the agreement, Marianne Gingrich was to be paid
$12,000 in alimony over six months. The agreement was drafted by an
attorney in Ohio, where Marianne Gingrich had gone after splitting
with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich first met in Ohio and
married there in 1981. Marianne Gingrich was a planner for Trumbull
County. She moved with Gingrich to Jonesboro, Ga., then part of
Georgia's 6th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's divorce lawyer, Tom Browning, said the couple's 1987
separation lasted six years. The Gingriches reconciled about a year
before Gingrich became speaker of the U.S. House in early 1995,
Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich and her attorneys won't confirm the length of
the separation. But during that period, the Gingriches made several
high-profile appearances together, including at a 1988 campaign
debate and at the 1992 Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1998 book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way,'' Gingrich
writes of leaning on his wife for support in May 1988, when he
filed ethics charges against then U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright:
``Maybe the loneliest day of my career was the day when Marianne
and I walked hand in hand down the corridor to the Ethics Committee
to file charges against the incumbent speaker. She stood by me when
it seemed no one else would.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Gingrich would still have been paying alimony to
Marianne Gingrich under their separation agreement.

EDITORIAL: A LABOR LIFT FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO endorsement of Vice President Gore, which is
expected tomorrow, will give him a badly needed boost in his battle
against Bill Bradley. Indeed, had Gore failed to secure the backing
of organized labor this week, his campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination would have been heavily damaged. But the
lift comes with a cost, because it reinforces the vice president's
problems as an insider too friendly with the Washington
establishment and too eager to please Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the labor endorsement is important in the Democratic
contest. That is why Bradley and his aides worked hard to try to
head it off. He argued that both he and Gore had good labor
records, except for the fact that both endorsed the North American
Free Trade Agreement, and that there was no reason for labor to
choose one candidate over another at a time when it was not clear
which one would get the nomination. Even with his outsider stance,
Bradley will have a hard time denigrating the endorsement after
working so hard to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are enjoying the Democratic fight, hoping to tie the
eventual winner to the traditional Democratic interest groups. Yet
among many Americans, labor may not be the demon it once was. Labor
lost heavily in trying to combat trade agreements early in the
Clinton administration. But it has come back with some big
victories since then, most notably on the minimum wage, using the
budget surplus for Social Security and Medicare and, most recently,
pushing for a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many moderate Republicans sided with Democrats on these issues,
and a strong bloc from both parties has prevented Republican
leaders from enacting anti-labor provisions in campaign finance
reform and other legislation. Gore's alliance with unions could, in
fact, portend that for all the talk about the ``new Democrats'' and
President Clinton's centrist approach on welfare and fiscal policy,
the coming election could well turn on the traditional cleavage of
many recent American elections: Republicans favoring tax cuts for
business and the wealthy and less government for everyone else, and
Democrats favoring more spending for health, education and the
environment. If that is the general-election agenda, either Gore or
Bradley will be happy to have labor in his corner. &QL;

PFIZER SAYS IT GAVE TO GROUP THAT PAID FOR 2 PATAKI TRIPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another large New York-based corporation with
significant interests in Albany said Monday that it had contributed
to a nonprofit trade group that paid for two trips by Gov. George
Pataki to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation, Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals conglomerate, said
it had given $5,000 to the group, the Hungarian-American Chamber of
Commerce of New York and New Jersey, shortly before the governor's
first trip in 1995. ``We did make a contribution back then to the
trip,'' said Bob Fauteux, a spokesman for Pfizer. ``We were happy
to support the governor in his outreach to Hungary.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which owns factories in New York and is closely
regulated by state environmental officials, is the fourth
corporation to disclose its involvement with the chamber and trips.
The others are another drug company, Bristol-Myers Squibb; Philip
Morris, the cigarette maker, and Pepsico. All four companies were
also big donors to the private corporation that Pataki set up to
pay for his 1995 inaugural.
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance Monday at the Columbus Day parade in
Manhattan, Pataki defended the trips, saying the one in 1995 had
led to the construction of a new glass factory in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a more than $300 million investment, the largest
industrial investment ever upstate, from Guardian glass company
because of that trip _ hundreds and hundreds of new jobs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Ethics Commission is considering whether to
investigate the trips, which took place in September 1995 and
October 1996. Pataki aides have said he and others in the
administration were not aware of any corporate donations to the
chamber.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The quietly driven, history-laced leadership Ben Crenshaw
brought to the U.S. Ryder Cup team last month will be replaced soon
with the fiery personality of Curtis Strange, several sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, 44, has agreed to be the U.S. captain for the 2001
Ryder Cup team, which will play the Europeans at the Belfry Golf
Club in Sutton Coldfield, England.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of 17 PGA Tour events in his 23-year career, Strange
will be charged with leading the Americans into what no doubt will
be a hazardous road trip to the Europeans' turf. It is that
daunting task that had one notable PGA Tour player, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, applauding the choice of Strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great contrast this is going to be in the U.S.
captain,'' said the player. ``Ben was so reverent and led with a
quiet passion. Curtis is going to be more like a football coach
leading his team out of the tunnel onto the field. He's going to
create a great atmosphere for the American players, especially
because they'll be playing in really hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis is absolutely pumped about it. And the players will
have a different sort of respect for him once they see those fiery
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the PGA of America, which selects the U.S. Ryder
captain, are expected to formally announce Strange's appointment
soon. No PGA representatives could be reached for comment Monday.
Traditionally, they announce their captain for the next Ryder Cup
in the first month or two after one is played.
</P>
<P>
   Until the PGA has named Strange, nothing is official. But
several executives in the golf world said Monday that Strange is
the only name on the PGA's list.
</P>
<P>
   Strange's personality is a feisty one, and that defiant attitude
should bode well for the American team he will lead across the
pond. He also is well-respected among the crop of players who will
compose the 2001 team.
</P>
<P>
   One of Strange's hobbies _ Harley Davidsons _ should give fans
an insight into the sort of captain he might be. He walks, or
rides, a little on the wilder side than does Crenshaw, who prefers
a John Deere tractor to a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Following Crenshaw as captain will be no easy task. Crenshaw
used historical frames of reference and his own good vibes to stoke
the Americans to a record comeback during the Sunday singles Sept.
26 at The Country Club. The Americans trailed 10-6 but won eight
matches and halved another on Sunday to pull out a 14{-13{ victory,
reclaiming the Ryder Cup for the U.S. after Europe had won it in
1995 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the U.S. won in Europe was at the Belfry in '93.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw already has removed himself from consideration for
leading the U.S. team a second time. Other players, such as Payne
Stewart and Mark O'Meara, still are in the prime of their playing
careers and likely will be future candidates for the captaincy.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, who won the U.S. Open in 1988 and '89, has reduced his
playing schedule in recent years to devote more time to his work as
a television analyst for ABC. He has been the network's lead golf
analyst since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He has won more than $7 million in his career and was the tour's
leading money-winner in 1985, '87 and '88. He was the first player
to earn more than $1 million in a season, doing so in '88.
</P>
<P>
   Strange played on five Ryder Cup teams and had a 6-12-2 match
record. But lack of success in the event doesn't have any bearing
on success as a captain, as Crenshaw proved. He was 3-8-1 as a
player in four Ryder Cups but pulled out the biggest comeback in
Cup history as a captain.

GENERIC DRUG MAKERS IN A `HUNKERING DOWN' CYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, the chief executives of the United States' largest
generic drug makers seemed almost giddy.
</P>
<P>
   Generic versions of popular drugs were coming to market with
ease, and investors clamored for shares of the tiny companies. The
stocks of two prominent ones _ Watson Pharmaceuticals, best known
for its estrogen-replacement therapies, and Forest Laboratories, a
maker of the popular anti-depressant Celexa _ each roughly doubled
in value in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the group has had a rapid descent recently. A raft of legal
troubles from lawsuits to inquiries by the federal government have
scared away investors, while the number of drug introductions has
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Standard &AMP; Poor's Drug index has slipped 6 percent
this year, the stocks of the generic companies have in some cases
lost a third or half of their value.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives are hard pressed to explain the sudden
reversals of fortune. ``Not a lot of drugs have come off patent
this year,'' said Fred Wilkinson, chief operating officer of Watson
Pharmaceuticals. ``Everybody is just hunkering down. But within the
next two years, more drugs will come off patent. That may change
the business cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   William Fletcher, chief executive of Teva Pharmaceuticals
U.S.A., one of the largest makers of generic drugs, said,
``Everybody is suffering from a lot of lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mylan Laboratories struck exclusive deals last year with
suppliers of raw materials necessary to make two anti-anxiety
drugs, the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of trying
to monopolize the market. The company asked a federal court to
dismiss the case but got nowhere. Analysts now worry that Mylan's
mounting legal bills could dent the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other generic makers face some serious court challenges over the
deals they have made with the drug giants. At issue is the practice
of accepting a payment from a branded drug company to delay the
introduction of a competing generic or to avoid patent litigation.
</P>
<P>
   People with knowledge of its investigations say the FTC is
considering filing a complaint against Hoechst Marion Roussel and
Andrx Corp., a maker of specialty pharmaceuticals and generic
drugs, over a deal they made to delay a generic version of
Hoechst's Cardizem CD, a treatment for high blood pressure, from
entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is investigating similar agreements between
Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, part of the giant Astra-Zeneca global drug
concern, and Barr Laboratories, a generic company, over the
breast-cancer drug tamoxifen, and between Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and
Sepracor, a specialty pharmaceuticals company, to develop an
improved version of Prozac, according to people with knowledge of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Mylan's case with the FTC has put the company's
shares under pressure,'' said David Saks, a managing director of
Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``But I don't think the FTC investigations will
change anything. This may be more for a warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Mylan Pharmaceuticals are off 41 percent this year,
closing Monday at $18.50. For the quarter ended in June, Mylan's
earnings fell 6 percent from a year earlier, and analysts have
forecast a slide of more than 6 percent in the next quarterly
report.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FTC's investigation of Andrx was disclosed late last
month, the company's stock has tumbled 23 percent, to $46.0625,
well off its $78 high in June. Even the stock of Watson
Pharmaceuticals, which has not been reported to be the subject of
an FTC investigation, fell 54 percent this year, to $28.9375.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Litigation has long been a cornerstone of the generic industry.
To get a generic drug to market, companies must sometimes fend off
a patent infringement suit.
</P>
<P>
   Such courtroom quarrels sometimes amount to David vs. Goliath
battles. Andrx has been sued by Glaxo Wellcome and Hoechst, among
others. Andrx had $8 million in earnings last year; Glaxo, $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher and Wilkinson complained in recent interviews that
their annual legal expenses had swelled to about $4 million each.
For Watson, that amounts to a 200 percent increase from two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   With litigation fears depressing the stocks, some stock pickers
now consider them undervalued. Analysts expect Andrx earnings, for
example, to jump 221 percent from the year-earlier period to 45
cents a share in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, generic drug companies point to a better pipeline
of new products. Drugs worth some $13 billion in sales over the
next three years are coming off patent in that period. Last year,
drugs with just $1.4 billion in sales came off patent, virtually
the same as is expected this year, according to Gruntal &AMP; Co. The
generic drug companies will record a combined $9 billion in sales
this year, up 9 percent from last year, by Gruntal's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Some expect the FTC investigation to eliminate exclusivity deals
and ultimately open the market wider for generics. Even if it does,
it will crimp some companies' revenues along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Andrx, for example, was to receive $100 million a year from
Hoechst to keep its generic version of Cardizem CD off the market.
The deal was scrapped in June, but only after Andrx had earned most
of that amount, when the companies settled their patent dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A more open market could put more pressure on the generic
companies to continue merging in hopes of better economies of
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to drug volume, the generic makers are going to
do quite well,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical analyst at
Mehta Partners. ``But there is so much competition within the
generic industry, that it is always going to be difficult to make
money.''

DEAD NEW BORN FOUND IN MIDTOWN GARBAGE CAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A newborn baby was found dead in a garbage can on one
of New York City's busiest corners Monday, leading the police to
canvass the streets and hospitals of midtown Manhattan in search of
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The infant girl, who had been stuffed inside a black plastic
shopping bag, was found by a maintenance worker at 9:40 a.m. as he
began to empty the can on the southwest corner of Broadway at 32d
Street, the police said. Inside the bag, the worker found the baby
wrapped in a multicolored quilt, which featured Disney characters,
and a pink blanket with the word ``Baby'' embroidered in white
stitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the top off and there it was,'' said the worker, Robin
Toppin, who empties the can as part of his normal rounds for the
34th Street Partnership, a business improvement district that helps
keep Herald Square clean.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they did not believe that the baby had
been there very long because Toppin had emptied the can only 90
minutes earlier, at 8:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief William Taylor, the commander of detectives in
Manhattan, said the baby was about 12 hours old and appeared to
have died before it was been placed in the garbage can. He said
there were no signs of trauma, visible wounds or blood on the baby
and that the umbilical cord was still attached when it was found.
``The body appears to have been kept clean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the City Medical Examiner's
office, said the coroner would not offer an opinion until an
autopsy had been completed today.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators closed the busy commercial stretch of Broadway on
which the baby was found, just a block from Pennsylvania Station,
and questioned store owners and passers-by in their effort to track
the mother. Detectives checked with area hospitals to see if a
woman had come in requesting postpartum care without a baby, and
they dusted the shopping bag and garbage can for fingerprints. They
also used a bloodhound to search Greeley Square, sniffing for
anything that might have revealed the baby's trail to the garbage
can.
</P>
<P>
   But the police had few clues to go on, except that the shopping
bag had come from a clothing store on Fulton Street in Brooklyn.

IS HOCKEY A LUXURY ITEM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now for something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? How different is hockey, the passion of the great
white North and about 10,000 zanies in Los Angeles, from baseball,
our national pastime?
</P>
<P>
   After making the move from one sport to the other about 10 days
ago, I have concluded the answer is: not that much.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance down the Kings bench shows Canadians, Swedes,
Slovaks and Finns. Not much change from the Dodgers clubhouse,
which has Americans, Dominicans, Mexicans and a Korean. There used
to be a pitcher from Japan and now the top minor-league prospect is
from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza once said he thought the Dodgers chemistry problems
stemmed from having so many players from different cultures. This
is a situation hockey has faced for many years. The Detroit Red
Wings won two Stanley Cups with a heavy Russian population. But
around the sport you still hear that European players are soft, not
big on going into the corners to get pucks or opposing players.
</P>
<P>
   When the Staples Center opens for sporting events Oct. 20 with a
game between the Kings and Boston Bruins, know that the Dodgers
will be watching closely to see how the city responds to luxury
boxes. They've never been available in this town, a town that was
happy to see its team on warm summer nights or through basic cable
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is a sport that has a lousy television contract and needs
ticket money to stay afloat. Despite its almost unlimited
resources, Fox is desperate to find new ways to make the Dodgers,
who claim they have lost $45 million in the last four years,
self-contained.
</P>
<P>
   They want to dive into the revenue stream of luxury boxes. But
will it work in L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it will be interesting to see whether new Kings coach
Andy Murray becomes the next Tom Lasorda or the next Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Kings love Murray's structure and attention to
detail. He has rules and a schedule. But he never played the game
at this level.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was a career minor-leaguer who had just a few games with
the Dodgers and Kansas City in the 1950s. As a manager, he won two
World Series and went to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had structure and attention to detail during his years
managing the Angels. He had rules and a schedule. He also had a
midseason mutiny with his players, who did not respect him because
he hadn't played in the majors. They didn't think he could relate
to their problems, so he became the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Collins resigned in September, knowing he would get fired. So
did general manager Bill Bavasi. Bavasi didn't play the game
either. But neither did his father Buzzie, who was GM for the
Dodgers during four World Series championships.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has an impressive resume as an NHL assistant and as a
head coach for Canada in international competition. Kings captain
Rob Blake played for Murray and his endorsement helped Murray get
the job.
</P>
<P>
   But spliced among the victories in the team's season-opening
road trip were a loss and a tie that showed flaws in the club.
Players are rarely good at looking in the mirror. If the team
doesn't make the playoffs during its first year in the Staples
Center, somebody will be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Will Murray be viewed as the ``Little General'' or an
overbearing control freak?
</P>
<P>
   As Terry Collins well knows, the answer can depend on the day.
</P>
<P>
   __ And another thing: Obviously the big difference between the
two sports is popularity in this country. When baseball decided to
clip the power of the umpires union by firing 22 of its members, it
was painted as the decline of Western Civilization.
</P>
<P>
   When Dallas Stars forward Mike Modano was nearly paralyzed after
getting cheap-shotted into the boards by the Ducks' Ruslan Salei on
opening night, the story was buried outside hockey circles, even
though it easily represented the biggest issue in the sport:
</P>
<P>
   How do you clean up hockey when the fans it so badly needs love
fights and violence?
</P>
<P>
   The NHL walks a tightrope between selling a fast and extremely
physical game and protecting its marquee players, who are the
primary targets of overly aggressive play. During games, the teams
run video highlights of the best hits of the week, many of which
are grounds for suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two teams played without incident Friday night at
the Pond, Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg has been portrayed by some
people around the league as leading a dirty team.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Hartsburg, who walks with a limp from a
cheap-shot incident during his playing career, would have been
teammates with Modano if he hadn't retired prematurely from the
injury. Hartsburg left the Minnesota North Stars in January 1989
and Modano played his first game with the same team during the 1989
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players needed: Colorado center Adam Deadmarsh is back after
suffering a hip pointer in the final exhibition game and the
Avalanche is hoping left wing Shjon Podein (knee surgery) returns
Wednesday when the club opens its new arena, the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   Top center Peter Forsberg is out until December after undergoing
shoulder surgery, but getting back Deadmarsh and Podein certainly
will help. The club also signed left wing Dave Reid last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deadmarsh, who has 98 goals the past four years, will center a
line with Chris Drury and Milan Hejduk. Drury played center during
the first week because Deadmarsh, who was going to play center in
Forsberg's absence, wasn't able to play.
</P>
<P>
   __ No frauds allowed:Edmonton became the first NHL team to put a
microchip in its uniform tops for identification purposes. This was
because of the retirement of former Oiler Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   `The collectibles market is getting so big that there are some
sweaters being sold that aren't the real thing,'' Oiler equipment
manager Barrie Stafford said. ``We had a fellow put the microchip
in, with the date of the game, the player's identity and number.
He's also worked with dogs and cows for identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Several game sweaters, which had a special autograph from
Gretzky inside on the hem, will be kept for posterity by the Oilers
organization.
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky left the Rangers after last season, he gave a
trainer and equipment manager each $5,000 to say thanks. Gretzky
wore five sweaters his last day in New York in April. He kept one
for himself, gave one to general manager Neil Smith, one to his
agent Mike Barnett, one to the Hall of Fame, and one to an
anonymous friend.

PHOENIX - There are days when Phyllis Malkiewicz simply hates her
self. She can't believe the things Phyllis Malkiewicz does, the
wild spending sprees, the callous disre gard for others, the lies,
the lawless ness. It bothers her so much that she's made calls and
written letters to banks and businesses warning them about Phyllis
Malkiewicz. She's even printed fliers and handed them out to local
retailers, so they won't sell anything to Phyllis Malkiewicz.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a month, she's tried to put a stop to herself, but
she can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I have been a responsi ble person,'' she said.
``Now, I have collection agencies after me. I'm afraid to buy
anything, anywhere because they might recognize my name. I feel
like I've lost control of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In late August or early September, someone got a hold of the
bank account numbers for Phyllis and her husband. The thief then
made or purchased some form of false identi fication _ a driver's
license, maybe _ with the name Phyllis Malkiewicz on it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the newly created Phyllis or an accomplice used a
computer to print a book of checks featuring the real Phyllis' bank
account number, then went shopping. &QL; 
The beginning &QL; 
``Our first clue came when Bank One called us and asked if I had
written a $857 check to Circuit City,'' Phyllis said. ``It was a
fraud, of course. But it was also just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a week or two, checks in the name of Phyllis and her
husband were used to purchase a gold watch, a computer, a
refrigerator, furniture for both a dining room and a living room
and more.
</P>
<P>
   They showed up in stores in Phoenix, Glendale, Peoria, Sun City,
Scotts dale and Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis did everything a person in her position is supposed to
do. She had all her accounts ``flagged'' by banks and credit-card
issuers. She canceled existing accounts, contacted credit bureaus
and, of course, called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Who ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I tried to get someone out to my house to take a
report I was told, `You're not the victim,' '' she said. ``They
said the stores being ripped off are the victim, and that I
eventually would get my money back.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she wondered, what about my good name? And what about the
fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Arizona has had a law making it a felony to assume
the identity of another person for any unlawful purpose. Phyllis
contacted Assistant Maricopa County Attorney Jerry Landau, who
helped get the law passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he told me that, yes, I was a victim,'' Phyllis said.
``But it hasn't yet helped to resolve my problem.'' &QL; 
Struggle to find help &QL; 
Phyllis has lost time at work, watched a $5,000 savings account go
to zero, and struggled to get the attention of four different
police departments, none of which has helped her.
</P>
<P>
   She's written to the offices of U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jon
Kyl, as well as Congressmen John Shadegg, Matt Salmon, J.D.
Hayworth and Jim Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   The only response she received was from a staffer in Shadegg's
office, who referred her to someone in the Arizona Attorney
General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like no one wants to catch the criminal,'' she
said. ``They all tell me, `Don't worry, eventually, you'll get your
money back,' and I say, `It's not just about money. It's about
crime. It's about my good name being taken from me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As of Oct. 11, no police department had taken an official report
from Phyllis. She did have some luck with the state Department of
Transporta tion, where an investigator is search ing for someone
with a false license in her name.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she went to the state motor vehicle office to
get a new, digital license. She also bought a paper shredder. When
she called me recently she identified herself as ''the real Phyllis
Malkiewicz.''
</P>
<P>
   How do I know for sure? she was asked. There was a time when
Phyllis, who has a good sense of humor, would have laughed. But not
now.
</P>
<P>
   She's not been herself lately. &QL;

`ACTION' DESERVES MORE ACTION IN TV RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Appropriately, Richard Burgi (right) plays an
action-movie star on Action, which also stars Jay Mohr. The biting
new series takes on Hollywood. 
Micheal Lavine/FOX 
Jay Mohr stars as Peter Dragon, an unscrupulous movie producer, in
Action. 
A s fans of the Mike O'Malley Show can attest, it's never too late
to start trying to save your favorite low-rated television show.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actually, if you were a fan of the Mike O'Malley Show, which
distin guished itself only by becoming the first new show of the
fall season to get the ax, you've got bigger prob lems. Like
finding yourself a good spot on the humor-transplant list.
</P>
<P>
   More discriminating viewers are con cerned with Action, Fox's
hilarious Thursday night comedy about an unscrupulous movie
producer named Peter Dragon who is willing to do anything _
anything _ to get his next film made. The show uses bleeped-out
cursing and ``adult situ ations'' _ code for sex _ to portray as
realistically as possible today's Hollywood. It says something
about the place that the only person Dragon can trust is a
child-star-turn ed-prostitute named Wendy Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say the show is like a snapshot of the current
moment in Hollywood,'' Action's executive pro ducer and movie
honcho Joel Silver said last week in a conference call promoting
another of his shows, UPN's The Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is necessary be cause, even though critics have
gone through barrels of ink praising Ac tion, millions of viewers
are studi ously avoiding it. What's worse, Action is getting
trounced by the awful new NBC comedy Stark Rav ing Mad. True, that
show lives in the rarefied air time between Frasier and ER, but
this is supposed to be the Age of the Remote.
</P>
<P>
   You've got one. Use it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fox executives are promising patience as Action takes a
break during the baseball playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at Fox could not be more supportive of the show,''
Silver said. ``That doesn't mean that we won't wake up in the
morning and read in the paper that it's canceled, but they're not
acting that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Action's very premise sets up an intriguing dilemma.
Most save-our-show efforts are spent on heartwarming dramas like
Touched by an Angel or Seventh Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   How does one defend a show whose characters are designed to be
inde fensible?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' Chris Thompson, who created Action, said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You defend that only by saying, `Is that the tyranny
ultimately of televi sion, in that everyone must be beloved? Do we
have to agree with everyone's motives? Do we only want to watch
people whose moral positions we admire? Is it about admiration and
role-modeling or is it about entertainment?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually it's about being funny, which Action is. In a season in
which most of the new network sitcoms go to great lengths to avoid
making you so much as chuckle, laughs _ no matter how crudely
gotten _ forgive a lot. Though not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it _ and I've only seen the pilot, and it did not
appeal to me enough that I went back to it a second time _ the
characters, other than Wendy Ward, just did not appeal to me,''
said Dorothy Swan son, the founder of Viewers for Quality
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to be lovable. They don't have to be likable.
But there have to be some redeeming qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   How about humor? That's a redeem ing quality. And Swanson admits
she thinks the show is funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly one of the few, if not the only, sitcom
anybody's even talking about,'' she said, ``and I think that's
important. There should be a sitcom that's worth discussing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Action is worthy not just of discussion
but of watching. Thompson is scheduled to meet with Fox bigwigs
today to discuss how to attract more viewers; likely scenarios
include moving Ac tion to a different night or time. If all else
fails and Fox cancels the show, perhaps it could be revived on
cable (Action was originally devel oped for HBO), where its content
might be a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, for his part, sounded reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may indeed be true that everyone needs to be likable in
television,'' he said. ``I don't know if that's true or not. I
would hope not, but I may wind up doing 12 episodes and that was
it, and maybe next year some body can do a show where some body's a
little edgier than a normal lead in a sitcom would be because I
opened that door a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or not. Or everybody in television will be a ballerina. I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one does. But if you haven't already, at least give Action a
try. Let's keep TV's dancing shoes on the shelf a little longer. &QL;

 &HT;    Net company sued over planned sale
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A shareholder of Net-Worker Inc., an Internet
company that alerts subscribers to career and networking events, is
suing the company's founders to prevent its sale to Agillion Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bruneman, former executive publisher of the company's Web
site, Networker.com, is also seeking $4 million in damages,
according to the lawsuit filed in Travis County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants are Agillion, which provides Web-based
software services, Steve Guengerich, Net-Worker's chairman and
chief executive, and Steve Papermaster, a director in Net-Worker
and chief executive of Agillion.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that if Net-Worker is folded into Agillion _
as Guengerich and Papermaster are planning _ that no cash will
change hands and that stockholders will not get any equity from the
deal. It also accuses Papermaster and Guengerich of stealing
Net-Worker trade secrets and of failing to obtain bids from other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster and Guengerich declined to comment, citing pending
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster and Guengerich acquired the Net-Worker software from
Civic Pride Inc. in March and created Networker.com. Net-Worker is
backed by the Powershift Group, a venture development group whose
principals are Papermaster and Guengerich.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Bruneman, who helped create the software at
Civic Pride, moved to Net-Worker and received 10 percent of the
company's stock, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Agillion, whose chief executive is Papermaster, is also backed
by Powershift.

EDITORIAL: JOHN DOE'S DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor in Milwaukee has found an intriguing new use for
DNA evidence. With the six-year time limit for filing charges in
three rape cases about to expire, he filed rape and kidnapping
counts last month against an unknown man implicated by semen tests
in three 1993 assaults, identifying him only by his DNA code. The
warrant refers to the alleged assailant as ``John Doe, unknown male
with matching deoxyribonucleic acid profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novelty of this approach, it is really just a new
twist on the long-established practice under state laws of allowing
``John Doe'' warrants that cite an alias, last known address or
other information that identifies the accused with ``reasonable
certainty.'' As courts are likely to find, a person's DNA code
easily meets that standard.
</P>
<P>
   But lurking in the case is a bigger issue for the future use of
DNA evidence. Chances are the prosecutor of this John Doe case
would not have been racing to beat the statute of limitations had
Wisconsin moved more quickly to test the vaginal and cervical swabs
of semen collected right after the 1993 attacks. As it is, the
samples waited at the police evidence room until last year, along
with 2,300 other unexamined rape kits, owing to a severe shortfall
in crime lab capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A survey commissioned by the National Commission for the Future
of DNA Evidence found that about 180,000 rape kits sit unexamined
in police departments across the nation. There are 12,000 in New
York City alone. In some places, the police still test DNA samples
only when a suspect has already been apprehended _ a Luddite
approach that fails to exploit DNA's usefulness for solving crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of DNA databanks now makes it possible to match
DNA evidence collected in rape, burglary and other cases against
DNA profiles of convicted offenders or of suspects in other open
cases. But absent more resources to collect and test DNA samples, a
lot of violent criminals who could be apprehended by DNA science
are destined to remain John Doe forever.

WHITE HOUSE WORKS BEHIND SCENES TO GET LABOR ENDORSEMENT FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>

13th graf, notes that there are 700 convention delegates.)  (See also BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the AFL-CIO's endorsement hanging in the
balance, President Clinton did his vice president a big favor
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Dority, president of the Food and
Commercial Workers Union, Clinton telephoned a friend of Dority's
to make one last nudge to ensure that Dority's union would provide
the crucial swing vote needed to secure the labor federation's
important endorsement of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called John Sweeney, the labor federation
president, over the weekend. While it is unclear how much Clinton's
calls ultimately affected the outcome, they were the final steps in
an intense effort by the Gore campaign _ and the White House itself
_ to win labor's support for the vice president with an endorsement
that the AFL-CIO is expected to approve on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To line up labor's support, Clinton appeared at a dinner last
Thursday honoring the Teamsters' president, James Hoffa. And in
recent weeks the White House has moved to limit imports of
low-priced steel, part of an effort to placate the powerful United
Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Clinton and four Cabinet members traveled to Chicago
to address the concerns of eight union presidents worried about the
loss of factory jobs. Clinton told them that on the recommendation
of Gore he was setting up a task force to determine how to save
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's full-court press is one of several factors
that have put Gore on the verge of grabbing the the biggest plum so
far in the early months of the 2000 presidential campaign. Equally
critical, many labor leaders said Monday, were the vice president's
record on labor issues as well as the need for Sweeney to prove
that he could unite the federation around Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore and his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, have battled
over the labor endorsement, with Bradley urging union leaders not
to rush to make an endorsement so early.
</P>
<P>
   The labor endorsement is a boon to candidates because the
AFL-CIO has 13 million members, prints millions of leaflets and
mobilizes thousands of union members to get out the vote and
operate phone banks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Dority said the Food and Commercial
Workers' Union decided to back Gore for a reason that was haunting
many of Gore's labor supporters: If Gore did not gain an
endorsement from the labor federation it would be construed as a
devastating setback to the vice president at a time when Bradley's
strength seems to be growing each day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most outspoken supporter in labor, Gerald McEntee,
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, said, ``There was a real fear that if we didn't have an
endorsement here for Gore, it would have cut him off at the
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, even though it was clear that Gore was the
favorite of organized labor, it was looking iffy whether the
AFL-CIO would endorse him at its convention this week. Some union
leaders were pushing for a delay, in hope of wresting more
concessions from Gore and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Sweeney was so discouraged that he told aides he might
not put an endorsement up to a vote at the convention because
several pivotal unions were not making the movement toward Gore
that he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime early Friday, AFL-CIO officials said, Sweeney decided
to stick his neck out and push hard for an endorsement even though
he was uncertain he could muster the needed two-thirds majority of
the 700 convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sweeney said he decided to work hard to line up
backing for the vice president because he believed that Gore has
been a good and loyal friend to American workers and that Gore was
going to be the Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, union officials said, saw that Gore nearly had the
two-thirds needed, and he was confident that if he pushed for an
endorsement, that would move several fence-sitting unions toward
backing Gore, enabling the vice president to clinch the two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Sweeney spoke out for an endorsement on Friday,
several fence-sitting unions other than the Food and Commercial
Workers announced that they would back an AFL-CIO endorsement of
Gore. Those unions were the Office and Professional Employees
International Union, the Laborers International Union of North
America and the National Treasury Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO, the
Service Employees International Union, gave Sweeney assurances this
past weekend that it would back an endorsement if its vote was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   For many union leaders, there was another big concern, that the
AFL-CIO and Sweeney would be weakened and embarrassed if the labor
federation did not endorse Gore at the convention, when Sweeney was
such an outspoken supporter of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there wasn't an endorsement, it would have hurt John,''
McEntee said. ``The guy worked so hard for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders interviewed said that the question always was
not whether they were going to endorse Gore, but when. Several
opposed an early endorsement because they said their members were
not yet paying attention to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members weren't mentally prepared to talk about the
presidential election,'' said Dority of the Food and Commercial
Workers' Union. ``We thought it would be better to wait until
closer to the election. But we saw that not endorsing at this time
might send a message that we're against Gore, and we didn't want to
be seen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up involvement from the White House and the Gore
campaign came only after many labor leaders had complained that
Gore had not given them enough one-on-one attention. At the same
time, Bradley was calling the leaders two or three times a day,
union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials said that they were receptive to the
argument Gore has been making recently that he has fought for union
issues for a long time while Bradley quit the Senate in 1996 and
has been viewed as doing little for labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's been out of the Senate now for how long?'' asked
William Burga, president of the Ohio affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
``Gore stayed in there. I think that means something.''
</P>
<P>
   But several union officials, most notably the presidents of the
Teamsters and the autoworkers, said there should be no rush for the
AFL-CIO to make an endorsement because they thought holding off
might wrest more concessions from candidates. Other union officials
argued against an early endorsement because the Gore campaign was
in disarray and Bradley was coming on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, the Sweeney aide, said, ``Because it was early, because of
the atmosphere _ is the Gore campaign falling flat? _ because
Bradley was doing a good job of reaching out, people got into this,
maybe we should just hang back. Why rush? Nobody was saying we
prefer Bradley over Gore. John's reaction was: That's not a
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   For labor officials like Sweeney, loyalty is an important
factor, and they have seen Gore speak out for years on labor's
issues, ranging from the minimum wage to a patients' bill of
rights. At two recent meetings of the AFL-CIO's executive
committee, the vice president won rave reviews for defending
workers' right to organize and for condemning corporations that
violate the law by firing workers who support unionization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been very much in the fray with us, on education,
on health, on children's issues'' said Sandra Feldman, president of
the American Federation of Teachers. ``Over the years he's been
with us very steadfastly.''

 &HT;    University grapples with death of students
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Jennessa Reed and Bonnie Saha are resident
assistants at Baylor University's Russell Hall. They're experienced
problem solvers, helping the young women living there settle
disputes with roommates or adjust to being away from home for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of three residents Sunday, however, left them
grasping for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us was prepared for it,'' Reed said. ``We just want to
be here for the girls. That's our main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women have seen and heard a lot of crying in the wake of
the deaths of Emily Hollister, 18, a freshman pre-medical student
from South Bend, Ind.; Erika Lanham, 18, a freshman pre-nursing
student from Fort Collins, Colo.; Tricia Lynn Calp, 18, a freshman
business major from Houston; and Dolan Walter Wostal III, 22, a
junior biology major from Santa Fe, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The four Baylor students and two other people were killed when
struck by a Ford Ranger truck driven by Brandon Michael Kallmeyer,
a Texas A&AMP;M student who fell asleep at the wheel. His pickup veered
off Farm-to-Market Road 60, about two miles west of the A&AMP;M campus,
shortly after midnight Sunday. Eight people walking to a party at
the Tau Kappa Epsilon house were hit, including Baylor graduate
David Gamradt, 22, who suffered only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor students were in College Station for the Bears'
football game against Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, when something like this happens, I don't think we
know why,'' Saha said. ``I think it's just something we have to
learn how to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Reed and Saha wore white ribbons on their blouses Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday night the students got together and talked about
wanting to show our love and respect for those who died,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hindering them was the fact that the three Russell residents had
been at Baylor only a little more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know if they had a favorite color,'' Saha said.
``But we thought white was a peaceful color.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russell residents helped create makeshift memorials outside
the three students' dorm rooms, leaving behind such things as
notes, cards and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said she was still at the point of trying to match the
names and faces of the freshmen together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless, it still hurts,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths Sunday were the second tragedy to strike Baylor in
less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Three Baylor upperclassmen died Aug. 19 when their Acura smashed
into a tree and flipped several times just south of College
Station. The driver apparently fell asleep as the students headed
back to Baylor, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Former chaplain Milton Cunningham said the deaths Sunday hit
students harder because of the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous deaths were at the end of summer,'' said
Cunningham, now special assistant to the vice president for student
life. ``The students had been separated. It wasn't like they had
just seen them the day before or that afternoon. That's why these
deaths are having such an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 70 years since Baylor lost so many students
so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the men's basketball team were killed in 1927
when their bus was hit by a train in Round Rock as they headed to a
game against the University of Texas. Among the dead was James
Clyde Kelly, the captain of the team, who pushed his friend Weir
Washam out a window to safety just before the collision. To Baylor,
the dead became known as the Immortal 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that time I don't believe we have lost so many students
in such a short period of time,'' said Baylor President Robert B.
Sloan Jr. ``It's on everybody's mind today. It's such a sobering
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several professors have canceled quizzes this week to give
students time to grieve, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements for the four Baylor students who died
Sunday will probably be released today, officials said. Students
were told Monday that a campus memorial service will probably be
held the first week of November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still working with the families,'' Cunningham said.
``They are planning memorial services in their respective towns. We
won't even begin planning our service until those local services
are concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he met with about 150 students at Russell on
Sunday, including men from the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, of
which Wostal was a member. The students did most of the talking,
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counseling is not a matter of telling,'' Cunningham said.
``It's a matter of listening. They were not there to find out what
I thought. They were there to talk to someone who is concerned
about them. There are no magic answers that will make all this go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's Saha said counseling came from a lot of sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had quite a few parents come by,'' Saha said. ``More
than you would normally see in the lobby on a Monday. This affected
some students more than they expected it to. I think the parents
wanted to offer a shoulder to cry on. I also think it was
reassurance for the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Faulkner, who lived three doors down at Russell from
Lanham and Calp (who were roommates), took comfort Monday in
gaining perspective on how fleeting life can be.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the deaths, Faulkner realized that she had
dropped off a roll of film to be developed containing pictures of
Lanham and Calp rollicking in the Freshmen Follies, an annual event
where dorm residents have food fights and engage in other
horseplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely makes you not take life for granted,'' Faulkner
said.

MCI'S PURCHASE OF SPRINT COULD AFFECT BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ MCI Worldcom Inc.'s planned acquisition of
Sprint Corp. could send a jolt through Brazil's telecommunications
industry, which has emerged as a battleground for many of the
world's largest communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. merger partners are competitors in Brazil's
long-distance business, since MCI Worldcom owns Embratel, the
country's dominant national long-distance company, and Sprint has a
25 percent holding in Intelig, a start-up venture with partners
that include National Grid Group of Britain and France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazilian law prohibits one company from controlling a
single sector of the telecommunications business, like
long-distance, wireless or fixed-line service, one of the holdings
will have to be shed.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the most likely outcome is the sale of
Sprint's stake in Intelig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the obvious choice given Sprint's commitment to the
Brazilian market hasn't been as great as MCI's,'' said Andy
Castonguay, head of the Sao Paulo office of Pyramid Research, a
telecommunications analysis firm. ``The interesting thing will be
how they find a buyer and if they can do it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The MCI-Sprint deal announced last week is only the latest
development to shake Brazil's telecommunications industry, which
has undergone a huge transformation since the government sold the
national telephone system, known as Telebras, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Telefonica SA of Spain has carved out the largest
presence in Brazil, buying the telephone companies in Sao Paulo and
Rio Grande do Sul, two prosperous states, in addition to several
cellular-telephone companies. European companies like Portugal
Telecom and North American companies like BellSouth Corp.,
Telesystem International Wireless Inc. and MCI have also made
significant investments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the end of the state monopoly has created a basis for
intense competition to begin in only one area, cellular telephones.
Meanwhile, start-ups are quickly building or renting networks to
compete with existing fixed-line companies and with Embratel, the
long-distance company acquired by MCI last year for about $1.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intelig was hoping to be up and running by the end of the year.
But that plan is now in doubt since Sprint has been providing much
of the company's technological expertise. Even if France Telecom or
National Grid acquires the U.S. company's stake in Intelig, they
may have to search later for another partner that could provide
advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelig has to be troubled by the possibility they could lose
much of their brain power,'' said Nilton Tuna, editor of RNT, a Sao
Paulo-based telecommunications magazine. ``Luckily there is a lot
of new technology _ and players _ in the market they could work
with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brazil's size, covering an area bigger than the continental
United States with a population of 165 million, and the relative
backwardness of its communications infrastructure have actually
worked to its advantage in creating a competitive and
technologically astute market.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the lack of financial resources that Telebras had
before its privatization meant that Brazil was almost a clean slate
for newcomers. So the country has become a kettle of new
technologies and techniques transplanted from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Intelig is a case in point. The company is largely depending on
``right of way'' technology, which enables existing fuel pipelines,
sewage lines and electricity grids to piggyback telecommunications
equipment. The advantage of the system is that is it cheaper and
quicker than building an entirely new network to compete with that
of Embratel.

 &HT;    Ungaro, Valentino get ruffled
 &HT;    By Robert Janjigian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The print factor at the Emanuel Ungaro spring-summer
2000 collection radiated as high energy as the disco soundtrack.
Models vamped in slinky ruffled crepe and georgette concoctions.
There was plenty of leather and lace. Floaty dresses rather than
rigid separates were the emphasis, which indicates the designer's
return to a more feminine silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Asymmetrical skirts reached ``up to there,'' though no doubt
when these exuberantly patterned and polka-dotted pinafores make it
to boutiques, they'll have a slightly less showy and revealing cut.
But for the moment, the sounds of Donna Summer moaning ``I love to
love you, baby'' and ``do it to me again and again,'' or Dan
Hartman pleading in song to ``relight my fire,'' only translated as
a return to the disco aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Ungaro did it again and again, capturing in cloth a freer and
easier, less analytical time, when colors were pretty and bright
and a party atmosphere prevailed. The clothes were made to move.
And that kinetic quality was catchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ungaro's collection was lighthearted, but not completely
oriented to the disco babe. In addition to the sexy slips,
one-shoulder dance dresses and tie-dyed tights was the clear
signature of the master of the mix, who seemed to be tossing away
any darker side that had emerged during previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His spring-summer collection was seductively upbeat. Any Goth or
gypsy references were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino
</P>
<P>
   The mood at Valentino was both frothy and elegant. The power of
the flower, as at Ungaro, was emphasized. Ruffles and fringe,
embroidery and bows, indicated an anything-but-pared down approach
by the Rome-based couturier.
</P>
<P>
   But there were sleek tailored elements to the collection,
successfully reviving the polished, yet always feminine, Valentino
look that has attracted style-setting clients from the late '60s
and early '70s until the present.
</P>
<P>
   He even reprised an ivory wool-cashmere coat that was originally
designed for Jackie O.
</P>
<P>
   In the handsome, ladylike focus of the clothes, there was no
evidence of any falling into The Gap or celebrating the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reliable chic'' is an apt way to describe Valentino's
offerings for next spring and summer. Think of Claudia Cardinale or
Sophia Loren in their heyday, and you'll get an accurate picture of
Valentino's vision. The collection represented ready-to-wea
indeed was ready to wear.

BOEING'S 717 LOSES TO AIRBUS IN BRITISH AIRWAYS COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After turning its back on Boeing last year to buy
planes from Airbus Industrie for the first time, British Airways on
Monday again hurt the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   This time it landed a haymaker on Boeing's slow-selling 717.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing was believed by some to have a slight edge in
the hard-fought competition, Europe's biggest airline rejected the
717 and announced it would buy a model from Airbus Industrie to
meet its requirements for a fleet of smaller jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   The order for as many as 24 A318s is worth nearly $1 billion at
list prices, though the carrier likely received a sizable discount.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. put the best possible face on the news, saying it
remains fully committed to the 717, a plane it inherited from
McDonnell Douglas that has so far failed to firmly establish itself
in the marketplace for smaller jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the latest blow from British Airways,
while not a knockout punch for the 717, underscores the fact that,
in more than four years since its launch, the 717 hasn't won a
single order from a top-tier airline. The British Airways
competition represented what would have been a breakthrough order
for the 717, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long before Boeing throws in the towel? I'd give them
maybe a year,'' said Richard Aboulafia, senior aviation analyst at
the Teal Group, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia has long been a vocal critic of the 717, arguing that
it is a very good airplane, but one without a market.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry analysts say Boeing still has time to find a
market for the 717, perhaps in Asia, but they pretty much agree the
plane's long-term future is in doubt, perhaps more so with Monday's
announcement by British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Boeing is clearly committed to the 717 and trying
to get more orders,'' said Peter Jacobs with the Seattle firm of
Ragan-MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, within a certain time if Boeing does not see
additional interest, they will have to make a decision whether to
commit to the program long term or just wind it down. I don't know
what that time frame may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing so far has landed 115 firm orders for the 717.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Hawaiian Airlines announced it intended
to buy at least 13 of the jets. That broke a yearlong order
drought. Because the sales agreement has not yet been inked with
Hawaiian, those orders are not yet counted as firm.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Pembroke Capital Ltd., an Irish leasing firm, has
said it intends to buy another 15 of the 717s and take options on
25 more. Those orders also are not firm. Pembroke previously placed
a firm order for 10 of the planes.
</P>
<P>
   But what Boeing has needed most to stimulate sales, according to
analysts, is a large order from a major airline, which in turn
could lead to orders from one of the large leasing companies such
as International Lease Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Although TWA ordered 50 717s in Decemeber 1998, and took options
for 50 more, the St. Louis-based carrier is hardly a model of
financial health. It ranked 24th in the world last year based on
1998 revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was hoping that British Airways would be that big,
healthy customer.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's flagship carrier wants to replace some of its bigger
757s with smaller and cheaper jets in a move to maximize profits on
short European routes by focusing on better-paying business
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   It had been evaluating offers by Boeing for the 717 and by
Airbus for the similar-size A318 that is now in development. As
part of any deal, British Airways had said it first had to trade in
its Boeing-built 757s. That happened last week when Boeing said it
would buy back 34 of the used 757s and convert them into freighters
for lease to DHL Worldwide Express.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that deal, and because the A318 won't enter
service until 2002, some published reports had speculated Boeing's
717 would win the British Airways competition.
</P>
<P>
   But the carrier announced it placed 12 firm orders for the A318,
and took options for 12 more. The first planes will be delivered in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, British Airways said it chose the Airbus plane
``for its superior economics, flexibility and commonality with the
rest of our short-haul fleet.'' The British Airways A318s will seat
about 100 passengers in a two-class configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said it now has won 157 firm orders and commitments for
the A318. Its Web site puts the number of firm orders at 45.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing 717 spokesman Warren Lamb said the company was
disappointed in losing the British Airways order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never like to lose a sales campaign, but we are committed
to increasing shareholder value at Boeing and we will only sell
airplanes at a price to meet that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb would not elaborate, but his comment suggested Boeing lost
the competition on price.
</P>
<P>
   While Airbus may have offered British Airways a better deal,
industry analysts said, airplane commonality was likely the
deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, British Airways ordered 20 Airbus A320s and 39 Airbus
A319s. The A318 is a shortened version of the A319, which itself is
a smaller version of the A320.
</P>
<P>
   Commonality is an important consideration for airlines when it
comes to buying new planes. Pilots can be more easily trained when
cockpits of different models are similar. There are maintenance
cost savings, too.
</P>
<P>
   The 717 does not have commonality with Boeing's 737. The 717 was
developed by McDonnell Douglas as a replacement for the DC-9. Until
the 1997 merger with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas called its new plane
the MD-95.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia, the industry analyst, said that given the importance
of aircraft commonality, no one should have been surprised British
Airways chose the A318 over the 717.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are asking a major airline with a lot of Airbus
narrow-body planes to take a limited number of orphan planes,'' he
said. ``Why don't they also pull their neckties until it hurts?
What's the advantage of having 10 or 20 orphan aircraft?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already have the A320 on order,'' he said. ``What would
have been a surprise is if they had decided to buy the 717.''
</P>
<P>
   The 717 was launched as the MD-95 in October 1995 with an order
for 50 airplanes and 50 options from ValuJet, which later changed
its name to AirTran after the horrific crash of one of its jets in
the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those planes went into service with AirTran this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing builds the 717 in California at its Long Beach plant,
where it is ending production of all other McDonnell Douglas planes
_ the MD-11, MD-90 and MD-80.

<P>
   Even though Aboulafia is convinced the future of the 717 is
bleak, he doesn't think Boeing will axe the program anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing the last Douglas program is politically unacceptable
or at best undesirable,'' he said. ``With the elections approaching
and all that. ... You don't want to throw a lot of people out of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   So for now, Boeing is continuing to talk with a number of
potential customers about the 717. Late last week, Boeing flew a
new 717 to Asia as part of what has been all-out marketing campaign
in recent months. The plane made a sales swing through Europe
earlier this summer after the Paris Air Show, where it was Boeing's
featured attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big market Boeing is looking at is China,'' said Nisbet,
the analyst. ``If that pans out, it could be a very good omen for
the program. ... It's too soon to write this off. ... I think
Boeing will go forward until they find the markets they are looking
at do not exist. ... If those don't work out, then they will give
the program a second look.''

 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
As Newsweek correspondent Eleanor Clift listened to Geraldine
Ferraro addressing the 1984 Democratic con vention, the hardened
reporter had tears in her eyes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York's congresswoman had just become the first female
vice-presi dential candidate nominated by a major political party.
It was a historic moment and a moving one for many American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represented the hope and the dream,'' Clift says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mondale-Ferraro cam paign ended that year with a
whim per, losing to the Ronald Reagan juggernaut, don't blame
Ferraro, Clift says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone he (Mondale) picked would have taken him
across the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's ill-fated run for the vice presidency will be the
opening chap ter in Madam President, a book being written by Clift
and her husband, Tom Brazaitis, Washington bureau chief for the
Cleveland Plain Dealer. The book explores the past 15 years of
women in politics, culminating with the current cam paign in which
Elizabeth Dole has become the first woman with a serious shot to
win the presidency _ or at least her party's nomination. &QL; 
At the same time, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has her eye on
the U.S. Senate seat once held by Robert Kennedy and Patrick
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Women running for high office are no longer tilting at
windmills.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, Clift, now a contributing editor for Newsweek and
regular panelist on public television's politi cal tongue lashing,
The McLaughlin Group, will be keynote speaker at an event sponsored
by the National Museum of Women's History.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Virginia-based mu seum named White House corre
spondent Helen Thomas as the first recipient of its Women Making
History Award.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a gala banquet at the Arizona Biltmore will honor an
entire slate of Arizona public offi cials, including Gov. Jane
Hull, Secretary of State Betsy Bayless, Senate President Brenda
Burns, At torney General Janet Napolitano, Treasurer Carol Springer
and Super intendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored will be Supreme Court Justice Sandra O'Connor,
former Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford, Gila River Indian Community Gov.
Mary Thomas and former state legislator Polly Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Clift would seem the perfect person to introduce the honorees.
Her book will devote a chapter to the historic all-female
administration as part of a Western tradition in which such states
as Arizona, California and Washington offer some of the best
opportunities to women running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Brazaitis has already traveled to Arizona to interview the women
dubbed the ``chicks in charge,'' and Clift is eager to meet them as
well, saying their administration is not just a blip on the
political radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very significant,'' she says from her home in
Washington, where she is on leave from her regular Newsweek duties
to follow the campaign trail. Her assignment: Glean juicy tidbits
about the presi dential candidates to include in the magazine's
special post-election edi tion and subsequent book. Offers optimism
</P>
<P>
   Clift's own book is due out next spring. It will focus on such
issues as the 1991 Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings and the
hopes raised by 1992's so-called Year of the Woman, a boom time for
female candidates. Those hopes fizzled somewhat in subsequent
elections, although the era brought a new face into Congress: the
conservative woman.
</P>
<P>
   Clift offers optimism for voters hungry for gender equality in
public office. A Ms. Foundation poll found that 76 percent of those
surveyed said they would elect a woman president. The bad news was
that respondents could name only two likely female candidates: Dole
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clift, whose liberal female voice often cuts through the
conservative male fracas on McLaughlin, can do better than that.
She names Califor nia Sen. Diane Feinstein, Texas Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchinson, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, New Hampshire
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and Maryland Lieutenant Gov. Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend as those most likely to take aim at the presidency in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   To acquaint the public with the array of women qualified for
high office, the White House Project, backed by the Clinton
administration, was launched, Clift reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get out of the novelty stage,'' she says, ``you have to
have more than one woman running.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, she notes, finished a respect able third in this summer's
Iowa straw poll by playing to her obvious base _ women, especially
Republi can businesswomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She showed she can motivate essen tially moderate women who
have not been politically involved,'' Clift says. ``She's got a
good shot. . . . We're in the realm of having a woman
(candidate).''
</P>
<P>
   Though she has chronicled other women's successes, Clift's own
story is a remarkable one. Raised in Queens, N.Y., she landed a
secre tarial job at Newsweek in 1963, when she was 22, shy and
known mostly for her typing skills. In 1972, she was assigned as a
reporter in the maga zine's Atlanta bureau. Covered Carter
</P>
<P>
   Her big break came when she began covering Georgia politician
Jimmy Carter in 1974 and scooped her colleagues by doggedly
pursuing the candidate behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Brazaitis is her second husband. Her first was Brooks Clift,
brother of the late Hollywood star Montgomery Clift. She has three
grown sons by Brooks, who died in 1986, four years after they
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a one-year stint in the Washington bureau of the Los
An geles Times, Clift, 58, has spent her journalism career at
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   She's been a regular on The McLaughlin Group since 1983, hold
ing her own in what usually amounts to a quadraphonic verbal
slugfest among moderator John McLaugh lin's vituperative cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Clift has been married to Brazaitis for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Exit question: What's it like collabo rating on a book with your
spouse?
</P>
<P>
   Clift laughs, admitting to some ``tense moments'' as one writes
and the other edits.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's not satisfied unless her anxiety level wakes up
Brazaitis in the middle of the night and infects him, too.
</P>
<P>
   And when she takes a break from writing and heads for the
kitchen, husband and cat are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, she says, ``It seems to work out.''

 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREDON, France _ At home here in his 500-year-old stone
farmhouse, Jose Bove seems pretty relaxed for someone out on
$17,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   He moves around in his slippers and turns off his cell phone so
he can answer questions without being interrupted. His antique
dining-room table is covered with stacks of paper, mostly faxes and
printouts from Internet sites. Outside his windows, tucked among
the trees, are the other five houses of this village and, beyond
them, hundreds of Bove's sheep leisurely picking over the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was arrested in August on charges of vandalizing a
nearby McDonald's building site _ though his principal complaint is
about American tariffs on luxury food _ this wiry, 46-year-old
union leader and sheep farmer has become something of a national
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a day goes by that French newspapers fail to mention him,
lauding him for his refusal to bow to globalization, running photos
of him with his hands clenched above his head and his wrists
cuffed, and suggesting that he may be the only man left in France
willing to go to jail for the republic.
</P>
<P>
   He has been praised by France's highest officials, including
President Jacques Chirac, who has declared that he, too, ``detests
McDonald's food.'' Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has also weighed
in, comparing Bove with other noted leaders who have emerged from
grass-roots movements in recent years: ``Here again is a strong,
vigorous personality,'' Jospin said admiringly.
</P>
<P>
   At home, however, Bove hardly looks militant. His eyes twinkle
over his handlebar mustache when he is asked about all the
attention he is getting. ``There was some luck in it,'' he
confides. ``The judge threw me into jail. People didn't like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove, who lives in Larzac, an area of southwest France that is
one of the country's best-known gastronomic regions, organized the
destruction of the McDonald's in nearby Millau _ using tractors to
tear down half the roof _ to highlight what he sees as the
unfairness of the U.S. decision to impose high tariffs on Roquefort
cheese, pate de foie gras and other luxury imported foods.
Washington acted in retaliation for the European Union's decision
to ban America's hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been three totalitarian forces in our lifetime,''
said Bove, who supplies sheep milk to cheese makers. ``The
totalitarianism of Fascism, of Communism and now of capitalism. How
can people try and tell us that we must import hormone-enhanced
beef? What is that?''
</P>
<P>
   But some say that Bove's crusade has tapped into far larger
issues gnawing at the French lately, including a general annoyance
with the power of the American economy and a nostalgia for a way of
life, including long lunches, that is disappearing yet still held
in high regard. Every year, new McDonald's franchises open and
flourish in France.
</P>
<P>
   However, few people admit to indulging in those
quarter-pounders. ``Spotted under the golden arches, the French
often behave as if they just got caught leaving an X-rated movie''
said Jean-Pierre Poulain, a sociologist at the University of
Toulouse recently quoted in the newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   Having recovered from Bove's attack in August, the Millau
McDonald's was doing brisk business the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here only once in a great while,'' said one customer,
Laurent Jeniez, who was getting back into his car alone. ``I do it
only with my children,'' he added, though none could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Millau is awash in pro-Bove graffiti. ``End McDomination''
and ``Free Bove'' are scrawled all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Bove himself favors a rhyming slogan that uses the French
nickname for McDonald's: ``McDo Dehors, Gardons le Roquefort''
(McDonald's Get Out, Let's Keep the Roquefort). That is what he
painted on the McDonald's construction site on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He considers his actions that day to be rather ordinary, hardly
worth more than a shrug. France, after all, is a country where
protesting is a national pastime. The development that really
shocked Bove, who heads a small farmers' union called the
Confederation Paysanne, was being put in jail five days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never do that,'' he said. ``But there was a young judge
and they are independent and they just saw property damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bove clinched his moment of fame when he refused to be freed on
bail, a stand that lasted only three weeks. He smiles when asked
about his change of heart. ``The conditions in there were really
bad,'' he said. ``And the food was inedible. And I said to myself,
`If all these people are trying to help me by raising the money,
why should I refuse to come out?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bove said his actions had been carefully planned and announced
in the paper the day before. ``There was nothing menacing about
it,'' he said. ``The children were there. There was singing. It had
a festival atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the McDonald's, Marc Dehani, sees it a bit
differently. He says $120,000 worth of damage was done. Still,
McDonald's has chosen not to take any civil action against Bove.
The restaurant chain has lately tried to calm protests by issuing
statements pointing out that the franchises in France are owned by
the French, employ French workers and almost exclusively sell food
grown in France.
</P>
<P>
   In the press, Bove is often described as the last holdout
against creeping American imperialism. But he is eager to say that
he likes Americans. His parents were researchers who spent years at
the University of California at Berkeley studying diseases that
attacked citrus trees. Bove lived there until he was 7 and still
speaks English.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that at the time he was playing on the northern
California beaches, Jack Kerouac might have been nearby. It is an
idea that obviously pleases him.
</P>
<P>
   But his contempt for American food habits is also obvious. He
offers statistics on the rate of obesity in America _ about three
times that of the French _ and disdains Americans for eating all
day long. He says America has no right to force its
hormone-enhanced food down French throats.
</P>
<P>
   Bove said his spell in prison had not lessened his outrage at
the luxury-food tariffs, and he intends to travel to Seattle in
November, when the World Trade Organization is expected to meet
there and consider the issue again. The U.S. actions were
authorized by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Bove is actually a protester from way back. He first came to
Larzac in the late 1960s, when the government was talking about
enlarging a military installation and the farmers were in an
uproar. Bove helped them lead the protest and then accepted their
invitation to settle here at the end of a quiet country road.
</P>
<P>
   With four other farmers, he owns about 500 sheep. About half are
raised to produce milk for Roquefort cheese. The rest are sold as
meat in local farmers' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bove says he has never eaten at McDonald's, not even once. No,
he insists, he is not curious. He does, however, like hamburgers
made on a grill, with sliced tomatoes and onions from the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``And mayonnaise,'' he added. ``But only the homemade kind.''

FEDEX CHIEF WILL RETIRE AT 55 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore Weise, the president and chief executive of Federal
Express Corp., will retire in January, the package-delivery company
announced Monday. He will be succeeded by David Bronczek, the
executive vice president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as a surprise because Weise is only 55 and has
worked at Fedex, the world's largest air-express delivery company,
since its founding nearly 28 years ago. But analysts who follow the
company said that his departure would have little effect on Fedex,
which has been hurt lately by rising fuel costs and slowing
domestic sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   FDX Corp., parent of Fedex and of several ground-delivery
companies, will still be run by its chairman, Frederick Smith, a
hard-driving, ex-Marine aviator, who pioneered the overnight
delivery business in the 1970s and who also is 55. ``This is a very
deep management bench,'' said Edward Wolfe, an analyst at Bear,
Stearns in New York. ``I don't think operationally it should be a
setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bronczek, 45, has worked at Fedex for 23 years. He began
his career there in 1976 as a courier, and held top jobs in Canada
and Europe before returning to headquarters in Memphis, Tenn.,
early last year to succeed Weise after he was promoted to succeed
Smith. Bronczek is currently responsible for the company's global
operations, as well as sales, e-commerce and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping aside on Jan. 31, Weise will continue to sit on
the Fedex board and to act as a consultant to its air operations.
He said in an interview Monday that he had no plans to work outside
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who spoke with Weise in recent months said they
had received no indication that his retirement was imminent. But
Weise said he and Smith had been planning to elevate Bronczek to
run Fedex since the umbrella FDX was formed early in 1998, after
Fedex bought Caliber System Inc., the owner of several trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exhausting,'' Weise said of his 28 years at Fedex.
``I'm just, quite frankly, ready to step aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Weise took a lead role in the company's confrontation with its
pilots last year. On the brink of a strike, the independent pilots
union ultimately backed down after Smith threatened to dismiss
several hundred pilots. Until then, Weise had issued most of the
threats and was widely resented by many pilots.

   Last month, FDX failed to meet already diminished earnings
expectations for the fiscal quarter that ended on Aug. 31. The day
the earnings were announced, FDX stock dropped 13 percent, the
steepest one-day fall in 12 years. Analysts said that high fuel
prices and increased domestic competition had slowed Fedex's
growth. FDX stock closed Monday at $42.75, up 43.75 cents.

   Jeffrey Kauffman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said
he did not believe that the weak results had any connection with
Weise's departure. ``The company's problems are macroeconomic,'' he
said, citing a slowdown in manufacturing. ``Every other player in
this market has not had the robust volume growth domestically as
they had in the last two years.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Gunter Blobel, a cellular and molecular biologist
at Rockefeller University in New York City, won the 1999 Nobel
Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering that proteins carry
signals that act as ZIP codes, helping them find their correct
locations within the cell.
</P>
<P>
   The research that Blobel has conducted for 30 years has had an
``immense impact'' on studies of the cell and helps explain the
molecular mechanisms behind diseases like cystic fibrosis, a
condition that creates a certain type of kidney stone in young
children, and other hereditary illnesses, the Nobel Assembly of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm announced.
</P>
<P>
   There are a billion protein molecules in an average human cell.
Cells are constantly dividing or being repaired to replace those
damaged or lost to everyday wear and tear. The mystery that Blobel
helped solve was learning how the cells regulate internal traffic
so the protein molecules ``go to the right address,'' he said in an
interview in his office at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Klausner, the head of the National Cancer Institute,
said many advances in recent decades, including his own research,
was in some way derived from Blobel's findings. ``Gunter's work in
many ways initiated the whole modern era of what we call molecular
cell biology,'' Klausner said in an interview. ``It began to merge
the observational approaches of cell biology, looking, describing
structure'' and so scientists could ``figure out how molecular
information underlies the structure and functioning of the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20th Nobel Prize awarded to scientists associated
with Rockefeller University, reflecting its strength in basic
science.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel, who recalled witnessing the bombing of Dresden as a
child, said he was donating most of the $960,000 in prize money to
the Friends of Dresden, an independent American group that supports
the reconstruction, restoration and preservation of Dresden's
artistic and architectural legacy. The group is helping rebuild the
Frauenkirche, a bell-shaped church that was a fixture in pre-war
Dresden. Blobel, who is not Jewish, said he is also donating part
of the award to reconstruction of a synagogue in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the firebombing destruction of Dresden from very near,''
Blobel said, ``only a few kilometers away; for an eight and a half
year old, this was all very impressive. The bombing was so bright
that you could read the newspaper by the red sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three days earlier, Blobel's mother had shown him the
architectural beauty of Dresden, a scene that stimulated Brobel's
life-long interest in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel's father was a veterinarian who had one of the few
functioning cars in the area, which the family used to pass through
the rubble. In the last days of the war, one of his sisters was
killed, and the seven surviving siblings were left under Russian
occupation in the East German state of Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   Young Gunter graduated from high school ``with highest grades,
although he never studied very much,'' his oldest brother, Dr. Hans
Blobel, said in a telephone interview from his home in Geissen,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he couldn't continue to study because he didn't want _
none of us wanted _ to join the Communist youth parties,'' he said.
In the early 1950s, Blobel escaped to the West through Berlin. He
became a U.S. citizen in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel is a tall, kindly man with an impressive shock of white
hair, an appearance that ``has lent an air of authority to his
lectures,'' Klausner said.
</P>
<P>
   It was among the reasons that colleagues had long told him that
he deserved the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Initially,
Blobel said he believed them. ``But as the years passed and I
didn't get a phone call, I didn't believe it anymore,'' Blobel said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel learned of his Nobel award shortly before 5 a.m. on
Monday. His wife, Laura Maioglio, who is accustomed to the phone
ringing at odd hours as the owner of Barbetta's restaurant in
midtown Manhattan, said she told the caller: ``Dr. Blobel is
sleeping.'' The caller responded: ``We have to speak to him. Wake
him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Blobel knew the award was being announced on Monday, and when he
took the call, he first thought it was a prank. Then he realized
none of the many foreign scientists in his laboratory was Swedish
or could mimic a Swedish accent well. He quickly recognized the
voice of Nils Ringertz, the secretary of the Nobel Committee, and
knew the award was real, recognition of his three decades of
doggedly pursuing a line of research that many scientists,
including colleagues at Rockefeller University, told him was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel was born in 1936 in Waltersdorf, Silesia, Germany, now
part of Poland. After earning a medical degree from the University
of Tubingen, he interned at a small hospital where he said he
``realized that treatment of disease was irrational and not based
on profound knowledge'' and that his interest was in research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his brother, Hans, was on the faculty of the
University of Wisconsin on a Fulbright Scholarship. Hans advised
Gunter that his medical training was insufficient to do research,
that American universities were ahead of their German counterparts
because of the war, and that he should come to Madison. Gunter
Blobel did, and earned a Ph.D. there in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Blobel moved to Rockefeller University as a
post-doctoral fellow largely because he wanted to work with Dr.
George E. Palade, a pioneering cell biologist. ``My work was a
direct extension of the work Dr. Palade had started at
Rockefeller,'' Blobel said of Palade, who went on to win a Nobel
Prize in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, scientists had used the electron microscope and
other techniques to describe the structure of the cell, Blober
recalled. They learned that a cell contains many different
structures known as organelles that carry out different functions.
Each organelle is surrounded by a membrane.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists did not know how the cell worked. A particular
mystery was how large proteins could get through the tightly sealed
membranes surrounding the organelles.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel reasoned that proteins have to be transported either out
of the cell, or to the different organelles. Such transport had to
be highly regulated, or the cell would be wide open to damage from
things entering from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Blobel and Dr. David D. Sabatini, who now heads cell
biology at New York University School of Medicine, proposed a bold
idea known as the signal hypothesis. It was that ``proteins
secreted out of a cell contain an intrinsic signal that governs
them to and across membranes,'' the Nobel Assembly said in its
citation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years, with support from the National
Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
Blobel and his team have conducted experiments to prove the
existence of programmed steps that allow molecules to move from one
part of the cell to another, and directed to their proper location.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel Prize was awarded not for a single major discovery,
but for the series of findings in the decades that it took to prove
the hypothesis, Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Blobel's team found the intrinsic signal they were
seeking, in a protein found in one organelle known as the
endoplasmic reticulum.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel found that each newly made protein has an
organelle-specific address, a stretch of the protein called a
signal sequence, that is recognized by receptors on an organelle's
surface. His team showed that in the endoplasmic reticulum, the
binding of the signal sequence to its receptor opens a watery
channel in the membrane through which the protein can travel.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel also characterized in detail the molecular mechanisms
underlying the processes and showed that they were universal,
operating similarly in yeast, plant and animal cells.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Rockefeller University on Monday, Blobel
said there were many disappointments in the 30 years of research
``such as when your grants and papers are rejected because some
stupid reviewer rejected them for dogmatic adherence to old
ideas.'' His remarks drew thunderous applause from sympathetic
colleagues and younger scientists who packed the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps you going are the little blips of excitement every
three to four years,'' Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists know that the cell works because it sorts its
proteins and directs them to the right places to carry out various
functions. Some proteins become building blocks for constructing
the cell. Others function as enzymes catalyzing thousands of
specific chemical reactions. Without the little signals Blobel
hypothesized, the cell would cease to function. Scientists also
know that a number of hereditary diseases are caused by errors in
these signals and transport mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel is still working, trying to unravel the trafficking of
signals between the cell's nucleus and cytoplasm. A knowledge of
how such communication goes on in normal cells is necessary to
understand what goes awry in cancerous cells, Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   His research has contributed to the development of a more
effective use of cells as ``protein factories'' for the production
of important drugs such as erythropoeitin. It helps stimulate the
production of red blood cells in the bone marrow and is used widely
in many kidney and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel said that with more research he expected that scientists
would unravel the mysteries of how brain cells are damaged by
Alzheimer's disease, blood cells are destroyed by the AIDS virus
and other infections, and normal cells become malignant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As long as we do not know how the cell works we don't know the
kind of havoc the AIDS virus creates in the cell,'' Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel said his work has not found any cures and that there will
not be specific treatments for many cancers and other diseases
until scientists gain that fundamental understanding. ``We are very
far from it,'' Blobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Blobel credited Rockefeller University's focus on basic research
for the last century in providing him the teaching and work
environment to make his discoveries. He thanked his his wife, Laura
Maioglio, for ``tolerating my long hours in the lab.'' ``Our
schedules meshed because she worked late at the restaurant and that
gave me the opportunity to come home late from the lab.''

IT'S TRIANGLE TEST TIME AS LAKERS HIT ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ The calendar was marked clearly:
!ital!Camp ends. Fly to Arkansas for exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Los Angeles Lakers training camp is over,
concluding mid-day Monday. Tonight, the Lakers unleash the triangle
offense on an opponent for the first time, playing the Washington
Wizards in Little Rock (6:30 p.m., Channel 9).
</P>
<P>
   But no one is foolish enough to believe the training itself is
over. Not where coach Phil Jackson's offense is concerned. Jackson
is encouraged by the progress he saw in one week at UC Santa
Barbara, but he didn't exactly heap praise on his pupils as the
Lakers broke camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't offering to take us out to lunch,'' Rick Fox
quipped. ``But at the same time, I think he saw enough to let us
out of the gym, instead of delaying the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, the Lakers will try to compete against the Wizards
on back-to-back nights, concluding Wednesday in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult even for the Lakers to say whether they're on
pace for picking up the nuances of Jackson's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I don't know. I don't know where we're supposed to be.
We can only do what we're being asked of, but we don't know how
good that is,'' Fox said with a laugh. ``I wasn't in Chicago, but I
think it took them more than one week to become proficient at the
offense. I think he's consistently going to challenge us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acknowledged the Lakers weren't necessarily ready for
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had another week before we started, but this is it,
so we play it,'' he said. ``I think (the players) got an air for
what we're trying to say. They're willing and I think sometimes
they're responding. I think they have that determination as a group
to try to become a better team, and I think all those things are
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now when the contests actually begin and conflict happens
out there on the court, we'll see how (able) we are to stay with
our newfound stuff and to forsake our old habits. And that's what
basically this process does _ it gives us an opportunity to build
new skills and new habits as a basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will offer a glimpse into Jackson's rotation and he
hopes to give starters and other key players up to 20-25 minutes.
He plans to use all 18 players, but winning is still a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important,'' he said. ``We don't expect to have
players out there at the end-game situation, to try to win the
games for us down the stretch, because that's not the way I work.
But we want people to show they want to do things to be on this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Homecoming: No one will be more excited tonight than guard
Derek Fisher, who will have hundreds of friends and family members
on hand to watch him play in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   His parents received a key to the city and other honors Monday
on his behalf. Fisher had to admit, even amid the electricity of a
new season under a new coach, playing in Little Rock ``is at the
top of the list right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we win that championship that we're shooting for, I
don't think I'll be able to put (tonight) up against anything. It
will be a special feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendinitis that flared in Fisher's left knee, meanwhile, is
not considered serious, and he was able to practice fully Monday.

OVERTIME IS BEST PART OF DEVILS-SENATORS 2-2 TIE

<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ The Devils and the Ottawa Senators had their
first experience Monday with the National Hockey League's new
overtime format, which produced the most exciting hockey of the
afternoon after three periods of mediocre play had produced two
goals by each team.
</P>
<P>
   There was no scoring in the five-minute overtime, with just four
skaters on each side, and the game ended at 2-2, with each team
earning a point. But the extra session was the only time the Devils
(2-1-1) and the Senators (4-0-1) played with any kind of rhythm and
intensity at the Corel Center here on Canada's Thanksgiving Day.
The overtime produced three shots, two by the Devils, but it was a
wide-open affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik tied the score for the Devils with 2 minutes 41
seconds left in regulation after second-period goals by Marian
Hossa and Rob Zamuner had given the Senators a 2-1 lead. Krzysztof
Oliwa scored the first goal for the Devils with 3:57 left in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overtime was very exciting to watch,'' said Oliwa, who sat
on the bench during overtime because the teams used their fastest
players. ``It was back and forth, and everyone enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa has been working extra hard with Slava Fetisov and Larry
Robinson, the assistant coaches, on improving his skating and
stick-handling, and his extra work has paid off handsomely four
games into the season. The towering Oliwa scored the first goal for
the Devils in their season-opening victory at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Both of his goals came with crafty moves and were vivid proof
that Oliwa can be more than just the Devils' biggest pugilist.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Oliwa's score came on a backhander from close
range on the right side after he took a pass from Scott Gomez.
Defenseman Sheldon Souray, who played his second game after missing
the first two because of a hip flexor injury, started the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gomez made a great play,'' Oliwa said, giving credit to the
rookie for his goal. ``He moves the puck so well. All I wanted to
do was put it on net and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa also had a marvelous scoring chance early in the third
period but hit the post.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tugnutt, Ottawa's goaltender, had little chance to stop
Holik's score. Standing at the top of the right face-off circle,
Holik one-timed Brian Rafalski's pass into the net for his fourth
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Holik and Petr Sykora had 29 goals each last season, the closest
any Devils player has come to reaching the 30-goal mark since John
MacLean, now with the Rangers, and Stephane Richer, now with Tampa
Bay, did it in 1994.

MORRIS WEST, 83, AUTHOR OF RELIGIOUS NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris West, who used his power as a storyteller and fascination
with Roman Catholic faith and morals to spin more than two dozen
novels, many of them best sellers like ``The Devil's Advocate'' and
``The Shoes of the Fisherman,'' died on Saturday in Sydney,
Australia, where he lived. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   He died while at work on his latest novel, ``The Last
Confession,'' The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics were often disdainful of his work, calling his
characters unbelievable and the twists and turns of his plots
far-fetched, West wrote stories that captivated readers, selling an
estimated 60 million copies worldwide. His novels were adapted into
movies, theatrical productions and radio dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his novels strongly reflect his Roman Catholicism. ``The
Devil's Advocate'' (Morrow, 1959) is about a young priest dying of
cancer who is sent to a Calabrian village to make the case against
the canonization of a British deserter executed by communist
partisans during World War II. In the process, he discovers in
himself the means of dying in the grace that he imagined he had
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shoes of the Fisherman'' (Morrow, 1963) concerns the
election of a Russian pope and turns into a study of Vatican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both novels were made into films. ``The Devil's Advocate''
starred John Mills in 1977. ``The Shoes of the Fisherman'' starred
Anthony Quinn in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   West wrote two other novels set in the Vatican. ``The Clowns of
God'' (Morrow, 1981) is the story of a pope obliged to abdicate
rather than reveal his vision of the Second Coming. ``Lazarus''
(St. Martin's Press, 1990) concerns another pope who comes to
believe that the church is losing its following and who seeks the
virtues of the humble parish priest.
</P>
<P>
   While he was often referred to as ``a Catholic novelist''
because he once seriously considered taking holy orders in Rome and
because of his preoccupation with theology, his writing frequently
challenged the church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 he published a play called ``The Heretic,'' about the
trial and execution of an Italian heretic by the Inquisition, and
later that year in collaboration with Robert Francis, a Canadian
journalist, he published ``Scandal in the Assembly'' (Morrow), a
treatise denouncing the Vatican's refusal to recognize divorce. The
book reflected West's dismay at the difficulty in obtaining a
church annulment of his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Such critical works seemed to come strangely from the author of
``The Shoes of the Fisherman'' and other devout and respectful
novels.
</P>
<P>
   West said in an interview at the time that he had ``spoken
against authority'' because the church had been wrong ``to use the
law to enforce its wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the runaway success of his novels, not even West could
make Hollywood step to his tune. By 1987, after he had sold three
of his major best sellers to film studios, West learned that the
actors and the director then making ``The Shoes of the Fisherman''
had rewritten what he considered a delicately balanced scene that
he had taken pains to adapt for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised hell,'' he said at the time. ``I argued that it
destroyed the theological validity of the plot in violation of
contractual obligations between the studio and me.''
</P>
<P>
   He won the battle but lost the war. ``By the end of the film the
accumulation of the variations was such that I took my name off the
script,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, he said, he would sell to Hollywood only those
thrillers that had ``a very simple story.''
</P>
<P>
   If the public was almost invariably taken with his yarns, the
critics were often disdainful. When ``The Shoes of the Fisherman''
came out in 1963 and began selling what would eventually amount to
12 million copies, Orville Prescott writing for The New York Times
called the book ``clumsy and dull,'' with shortcomings that ranged
from poor characterization to an overabundance of ponderous
theological exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``The Tower of Babel'' (Morrow, 1968) for The New York
Times, Charles Poore was caustic, writing, ``Having read the book,
I can wait indefinitely for the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Langlo West was born on April 26, 1916, in St. Kilda, a
suburb of Melbourne, Australia. The eldest of six children of
Charles Langlo West and Florence Guilfoyle Hanlon, West told
interviewers that his early childhood was not happy. At 14 he
entered a Christian Brothers seminary in Sydney as ``a kind of
refuge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later he attended and graduated from the University of Melbourne
and taught modern languages and mathematics in New South Wales and
Tasmania. In 1942 West decided against taking his final vows for
the priesthood. War had broken out, and he volunteered for service
with the Australian Imperial Forces.
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Moon in My Pocket,'' based on his years as a
Christian Brother, was published in 1945 and sold 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   More novels came in the 1950s, the first two paying for a visit
to Italy, where he was employed as a social worker. His book about
the street urchins of war-ravaged Italy, ``The Children of the
Sun,'' drew sympathy and support from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and '60s five of West's novels led to films,
most notably ``The Shoes of the Fisherman.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Joyce Lawford, whom he
married in 1952; and by their three sons, Christopher, Paul and
Michael, and a daughter, Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, West acknowledged his unhappiness
with his religion. ``Christian belief is not always a comfort but a
bleak acceptance of a dark mystery,'' he said.

<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ For weeks Ohio State coach John Cooper
carefully tried to protect the psyche of his young team,
acknowledging its mistakes but refusing to criticize players'
talent or ability.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, after a demoralizing 42-17 loss to Wisconsin, he
criticized several of his veteran players in a team meeting. A few
days later, after a 3-point comeback victory over Purdue, he
acknowledged this OSU team isn't as talented as past Buckeye
squads.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as his players prepared for a road trip to No. 2 Penn
State (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) this week, Cooper made his most startling
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty obvious that if we play our best game and
they play their best game and neither team makes any mistakes,
they'll probably win the game,'' Cooper said. ``We've got to play
lights out for 60 minutes. And if we do that, we'll get a break or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been awhile since Cooper has deferred a talent advantage to
an opponent and acknowledged that his team would need ``a little
help'' to come away victorious. It's an about-face from his
defensive bunker mentality just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But after six games in which the No. 18 Buckeyes (4-2, 1-1)
frequently have been outplayed, Cooper said he's not acknowledging
anything his players don't already know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our players are realistic enough to know that we're
going to have to play fanatically better to go win that game'' at
Penn State, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Though several OSU players agreed they're going to have to play
great to beat the Nittany Lions, they weren't willing to concede
their opponent has superior talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to shortchange coach, but I don't believe that,
personally,'' strong safety Donnie Nickey said. ``We lost two
games, people are going to challenge the talent level. They're
going to question our abilities as a football team. But I don't
feel our talent level has dropped enough to be noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Kevin Houser said Cooper's scenario simply isn't
practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who's playing, no matter how good a team is, no
one's going to play a perfect game,'' he said. ``So I'm going to
disclaim coach Cooper's comment. Football is a game where mistakes
are made and we're going to try to make fewer mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Houser, Nickey and several of their teammates said maybe
Cooper's comments are simply another way to motivate the team, to
challenge them. His challenge last week produced a squad that
coaches and player said played with a lot of heart and fought for
four quarters to defeat Purdue, 25-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the coach tells you the other team will win, we have
to go out and work harder and show, on national television, that we
can win,'' defensive end James Cotton said. ``It's just motivation.
We don't play the game on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Penn State is clearly the superior team. From win-loss
record to offensive and defensive statistics, the Nittany Lions
rank ahead of the Buckeyes in almost every category.
</P>
<P>
   But junior linebacker Na'il Diggs said that was the case with
Ohio State and Michigan State last year and the statistically
inferior Spartans won the game.
</P>
<P>
   OSU was the No. 1 rated team in the country when unranked
Michigan State came to Ohio Stadium. The Bucks had one of the best
defenses in the nation and their offense routinely collected 500 or
more yards per game. But somehow, someway the underdog Spartans
came away with a 28-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing, just like us last year against Michigan
State,'' Diggs said. ``They came in our house and beat us. So it's
not impossible for us to beat (Penn State).''

GEORGE FORREST, 84, SONGWRITER FOR BROADWAY, FILMS AND CLUBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Forrest, the songwriter who collaborated with Robert
Wright on the words and music for the songs ``Stranger in
Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' died on Sunday in
Miami, where he lived. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who was Forrest's writing partner for the last 72 years,
survives him. The music for ``Stranger in Paradise'' and ``Baubles,
Bangles and Beads,'' were part of the score of the 1953 hit
Broadway musical ``Kismet,'' which was based on music by Borodin.
The two men's other musicals included the 1944 musical ``The Song
of Norway.'' They wrote the words and music for the song hit ``It's
a Blue World'' (1940) and the lyrics for ``Donkey Serenade''
(1937).
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Broadway musicals that the team collaborated on
were ``Gypsy Lady'' (1946), ``Magdalena'' (1948), ``Kean'' (1961),
``Anya'' (1965) and ``Grand Hotel'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Forrest's death, he and Wright were working on
another musical, ``Betting on Bertie,'' a project they had begun
years ago with P.G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton, who wrote the book
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lantz, Forrest's agent, said on Monday that the body of
work that Forrest and Wright created ``ranges from cabaret work and
nightclub work to movies in the early days of Hollywood and to
musicals for which they adapted musical works by Borodin,
Rachmaninoff, Strauss, Villa-Lobos and others, and for which they
also wrote lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, whose name was originally George Forrest Chichester
Jr., was born in Brooklyn. In the early 1920s he and his family
moved to the Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   Although his formal musical training was minimal, he mastered
the piano before he entered kindergarten. Wright, an accomplished
pianist who met him in the late 1920s, said in a 1974 interview:
``He always was marvelous. He was a natural. He could play by
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Forrest was 13 he was already playing piano and
accompanying singers in Miami night spots and singing second tenor
in the glee club at Miami High School. Wright, a year older and the
conductor of his own radio show and Sunday concerts, was the glee
club's pianist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, before either of the two was 20, they left on an
eighth-month tour, playing cabarets from New York westward until
they reached Hollywood for a tryout with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   Their audition with the best dozen of their 80 songs from the
tour won them a seven-year contract. Their first major task at MGM
was to create, in 1937, a new score for the MacDonald-Eddy movie
``Maytime'' after the studio had discarded almost all the songs
that had been prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest and Wright produced some new lyrics and a new score that
was a blend of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, Verdi and French folk
songs. Their work won them immediate esteem.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they wrote the songs for ``Grand Hotel,'' the pair
had written ``lyrics and music of more than 2,000 compositions for
16 produced stage musicals, 18 stage reviews, 58 motion pictures
and numerous cabaret acts,'' the show's Playbill said.
</P>
<P>
   By then they had won Tony Awards for ``Kismet'' and had been
nominated for three Academy Awards for the songs ``Always and
Always,'' ``It's a Blue World'' and ``Pennies for Peppino.'' In
1995 they received the Ascap/Richard Rodgers Award for their
contribution to the American Musical Theater.

COMPANIES JOIN TO PROMOTE A LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to nudge Linux software into the mainstream of computing,
three companies are joining in an unusual collaboration to promote
Debian, a Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer makers, VA Linux Systems and Silicon Graphics Inc.,
and the specialist book publisher O'Reilly &AMP; Associates are linking
up to sponsor a broader distribution of Debian, which was created
and is supported entirely by a volunteer corps of nearly 500
programmers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorship agreement will pay for the commercial
distribution of Debian, which has been distributed free over the
Internet. The commercial version will include the operating system
on a CD-ROM; a copy of O'Reilly's new book ``Learning Debian GNU
Linux,'' and a coupon for a copy of the Star Office productivity
suite by Sun Microsystems. The bundle of products will sell for
$19.95, available directly from VA Linux and some retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate customers, in particular, often prefer commercial
versions of free software, so they get written documentation
explaining the software and are assured of technical support if
they have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat Software, Caldera and other companies market commercial
versions of Linux, the operating system created by a Finnish
programmer, Linus Torvalds. Debian will still be supported mainly
by its network of volunteers, but VA Linux Systems also plans a
commercial support service for new users.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the three corporate sponsors is also a nod to making
a contribution to the open-source community of engineers whose
volunteer work has created the commercial opportunities that the
companies are now exploiting.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux Systems, which recently changed its name from VA
Research, has just registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to sell shares to the public. The Silicon Valley maker
of computers running Linux is growing at a rate of more than 200
percent a year. Because of its rapid growth and direct-odel,
some analysts have called it the ``Dell Computer of the Linux
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting requests for Debian from customers,'' said Brian
Biles, vice president for marketing at VA Linux. ``But we're also
doing this now because we're now in a position to offer support for
Debian, to give something back to the open-source community.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of Linux _ a free version of the powerful Unix operating
system _ has grown significantly in the last couple of years
because of the Internet. It is particularly popular as an
operating-system environment in the powerful server computers that
send out Web pages to desktop users.
</P>
<P>
   The different flavors of Linux, like Debian and Red Hat, are
varying implementations of the same underlying operating-system
software, or kernel. What differs are the software tools for tasks
like installation and systems management.
</P>
<P>
   Debian was created in 1993 by Ian Murdock, who was then an
undergraduate at Purdue University. The name comes from putting
together the first name of Murdock's wife, Debra, and his own first
name.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from the commercial distribution of Debian will go to
Software in the Public Interest, a nonprofit group that supports
open-source software projects.

BAYLOR STUDENTS GRAPPLE WITH DEATHS FROM CRASH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Baylor University coped with its second major
tragedy in as many months Monday as students struggled to
understand why four classmates were struck down in an automobile
accident over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is pretty much in a state of shock,'' said
Jennessa Reed, 21, a resident assistant in the dormitory where the
crash's three female victims lived.
</P>
<P>
   In all, six college students died early Sunday when the
18-year-old driver of a pickup fell asleep and fatally struck three
men and three women as they walked to a fraternity party on FM 60
in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Three women, all freshmen who lived on the same dormitory floor,
and a junior were from Baylor. The accident was especially jarring
to this 13,000-student campus because three other students
returning to school died in a car accident Aug. 19 during the
school's welcome week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, students also recalled a 1927 accident when 10
students were killed when their bus collided with a train en route
to Austin for a college basketball game. They are now known as the
Immortal Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Students are told about the incident during freshman orientation
and a candlelight vigil is held the Wednesday before homecoming
each year to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reminds everybody of that,'' said Dawn Maple, a sophomore
photographer who works for the student newspaper, The Baylor
Lariat. ``I think it's made everybody pretty cautious. It's made us
all realize our own mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor students killed Sunday were: Tricia Calp, 18, of
Houston; Emily Hollister, 18, of South Bend, Ind.; Erika Lanham,
18, of Fort Collins, Colo.; and Dolan Walter ``Tripp'' Wostal III,
22, of Santa Fe, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were William Flores, 22, a Southwest Texas State
student from San Marcos, Texas, and Ted Bruton, 21, a Texas A&AMP;M
student from San Angelo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After word reached the Baylor campus Sunday morning, Wostal's
fraternity brothers at Tau Kappa Epsilon held a service Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at North Russell Hall, where the three women lived,
sponsored a memorial later, attended by about 250 students. The
university's chaplain, Dr. Milton Cunningham, who spoke at both
events, said he was struck by the students' love for their lost
classmates and their difficulties rationalizing the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you learn as you grow older is that life
takes away your answers, and that you just don't have all the
answers,'' Cunningham said Monday afternoon. ``And I told them it's
OK to say, `I don't know,' and `I don't understand.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But some of their friends saw them just hours before they
died. They have vivid mental pictures of them. It's going to take
them a long time to get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Calp, Hollister and Lanham said the three were
seemingly inseparable, always happy and regular participants in
such sports as intramural volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were beautiful, beautiful girls,'' said Chrystal Ray, 19,
a freshman who lived two doors down from Calp and Lanham, who were
roommates. ``They were friendly. Every time I saw them, they had a
group of people around them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, flowers, cards and poetry were stacked around Calp
and Lanham's second-floor room as a shrine to the women, Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Saha, a resident assistant on the floor, said she was
collecting similar materials for Hollister because putting them
outside the room would only further upset her roommate.
</P>
<P>
   At the family's request, the rooms have been undisturbed, so
relatives can see how the women left them.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at the residence hall plan to prepare scrapbooks for the
women's families as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 470-plus students who live in the all-female
residence hall wore memorial ribbons Monday, choosing white because
of their lost potential and as a way to remember their happiness, a
dormitory staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   A residence hall described by its occupants as vibrant and full
of life was quiet Monday. The spacious lobby was silent except for
the occasional hug or soft tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somber would be the word,'' said Saha, 20. ``People are
talking, but it's not like it was. My hall used to be lively, you
know, the music up loud. Not today.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is feeling the hurt, Ray said. ``You can see it in
their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wostal, who traveled to College Station with the three women for
a barbecue and to watch the Baylor-Texas A&AMP;M football game, was a
junior studying biology who planned to become a doctor, said Tau
Kappa Epsilon's Baylor chapter president, Brian Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity was planning another memorial for the Baylor
victims and sent flowers to each family, Garcia said. Baylor
officials also were planning a schoolwide memorial but set no date
because the service will be after the four funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Like the women, Wostal was active, winning his weight class in a
recent school power-lifting competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tripp was a small guy with a big heart,'' said Garcia, who
wore sunglasses that failed to hide his tears. ``He's the kind of
guy who anyone would want as the best man at their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he would have become a great doctor.''
</P>

BOLLER'S BACK, BUT CAL'S GOT HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kyle Boller will assume Gwyneth Paltrow's role in
a local adaptation of ``Sliding Doors.'' For a few fleeting hours
this weekend the former Hart High standout will see his life as it
might have been had he managed to push his way aboard before UCLA's
recruiting train left the station last year.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, Boller was left standing on the platform
after J.P. Losman swept through the sliver of an opening and the
door swooshed shut behind him.
</P>
<P>
   With Losman, Cory Paus and Drew Bennett aboard, the Bruins'
quarterback car was rush-hour crowded. So Boller waited for the
next train and wound up in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   His two tracks of destiny will converge Saturday at the Rose
Bowl when he makes his Southern California collegiate debut as the
Bears' No. 1 quarterback. It didn't have to start this way, with
Boller a visitor in his own backyard, playing in front of a crowd
that'll include 160 friends and family members, some of whom are
torn between their loyalty to UCLA and their love for Kyle Boller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' said Boller's father, Bob. ``Other people are
more into the what-ifs and should-haves than we are. I run into
people all the time who say, `I sure wish your kid went to UCLA.'
It's always going to be a topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Bob Toledo unwittingly opened himself up to
criticism when he promised Losman that UCLA wouldn't sign another
quarterback in the Venice High recruit's class. Toledo held his end
of the bargain, but Losman transferred to Tulane before the start
of fall practices, leaving open the seat Boller had coveted.
</P>
<P>
   A few football fans in the San Fernando Valley were so upset by
Toledo's snub of Boller, they wrote him pointed letters. Rather
than rail at Toledo and his staff, these fans ought to fire off
letters to the NCAA, calling for the abolition of the early-signing
period that is making a high school athlete's senior season all but
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   As long as kids are being scouted in the eighth grade and signed
in the 11th, late-bloomers such as Boller are bound to fall through
the cracks. Who has time to reward patience when there are so many
prodigies?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle's a great kid,'' Toledo said Monday, ``and I'm sure he's
going to be an outstanding quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? Losman might have divorced UCLA after the
shortest honeymoon on record, but the Bruins have another
back who signed before his senior year in high school who is
working out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Said Toledo, ``If Kyle were here or J.P. Losman were here,
they'd be backing up Cory Paus.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller said he's looking forward to playing UCLA. After all,
it's the next best thing to attending school there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to be in my hometown and play in front
of my family and friends,'' Boller said. ``I'm really close to my
family, so it was kind of hard to go away. I always wanted to go to
UCLA, but when they signed Losman I was out. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed out of the nest by circumstances, Boller believes
everything happened for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't even a sigh like, `Oh, man,' when Kyle heard
about J.P. Losman,'' Bob Boller said. ``Once he signed at Cal, that
was it. Since then, I haven't heard him say one what-if.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller sure sounded sincere when he said, ``I'm happy the way
things worked out. The coaches at Cal are great, the player
relationships here are unbelievable and I see the team as having a
lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal's defense is fully developed; it's the offense that's in the
embryonic stages.
</P>
<P>
   You have to learn to block before you can run or pass. The
Bears' young offensive line has protected Boller about as well as a
busted lock since he replaced starter Samuel Clemons in the third
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games _ losses at Washington State and BYU _
Boller has been sacked seven times. Those footsteps Boller keeps
hearing are making him understandably jittery.
</P>
<P>
   Against BYU, Boller hurried his passes and threw so hard you
needed a radar gun to track them. He completed 11 of 33 attempts in
the Bears' 10-point defeat. He saved his best for last, connecting
with receiver LaShaun Ward on a 55-yard scoring pass with 2 seconds
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did throw a lot of hard passes that needed to be softer,''
Boller said. ``I was trying to force stuff. I was anxious. I was
really disappointed in how I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller would feel better if he'd just remember he's not in the
Foothill League anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted against players who will be in the NFL next fall, it's
unrealistic to expect the instant success he had at Hart. Boller
passed for 4,838 yards and 59 touchdowns despite not starting at
quarterback until his senior season (he backed up David Neill as a
junior and played safety).
</P>
<P>
   Rick Neuheisel, then the coach at Colorado, was so impressed by
Boller's bionic arm he offered the player a scholarship after his
first Hart start. Before his senior season was half over, Boller
was being heralded as the greatest quarterback prospect in the San
Fernando Valley since John Elway in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Like Elway, Boller throws the ball hard enough to break his
receivers' fingers. Unlike Elway, he's not getting a chance to
leave the high school game and merge into the Pacific-10 at a
leisurely speed.
</P>
<P>
   It has been snap-your-neck-back fast for Boller. Elway had the
advantage of playing behind Turk Schonert for most of his freshman
year at Stanford. He completed 50 of 96 passes that first year,
averaging 10.9 yards a completion and one interception every 32
passes. Boller has attempted 123 passes and completed 51 for 612
yards. He is averaging 12 yards a completion and one interception
every 31 passes.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from high school to college hasn't been a snap
for Boller, on the football field or in the classroom. He spoke
Sunday of feeling ``time-robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller might not feel like there are enough hours in the day. In
the master schedule, though, time is very much on his side.

FOSTER TO SIT VS. CAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One step might have cost UCLA so tailback
DeShaun Foster several games.
</P>
<P>
   Foster aggravated his sprained right ankle making a cut on his
only run of the Oregon game. He won't play Saturday against Cal and
is questionable for the Oct. 23 game at Oregon State. Most likely,
he'll return for Arizona the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that could have happened to me happened, the
turf gave out from under me,'' Foster said. ``I'm trying to stay
positive, but it's hard because I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster has three carries in the two games since suffering a high
sprain (above the ankle bone) at Stanford on Sept. 18. Despite
daily treatments and minimal practice, the weakened ligaments gave
out on Foster's 11-yard, second-quarter run. He spent the rest of
the night on the bench with his ankle on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Without Foster, the Bruins will rely on senior Keith Brown and
junior Jermaine Lewis. Brown rushed for 182 yards at Arizona State
and the duo combined for 105 yards against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a missing link,'' Brown said of Foster's injury. ``When
one of us is down, it hurts the rotation. Me and Jermaine just have
to fill in for DeShaun and try to make all the big plays he makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's OK. I'm a senior. There's supposed to be pressure
on me. I go into every game thinking I'm going to be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   __ He'd like to thank: Receiver Danny Farmer was named Pac-10
Offensive Player of the Week for his seven-catch, 196-yard
performance against Oregon. He's the first Bruin honored by the
league this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great heart and he knows how to compete, how to
win,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``He has a lot of intangibles.
He's not the fastest guy, but he runs away from a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer owns the UCLA record for career receiving yards (2,847)
and is 33 catches from Kevin Jordan's school record for career
receptions (179).
</P>
<P>
   __ Throw long, young man, throw long: Toledo responding to fan
criticism of his decision to throw deep on third down with 1:20
left:
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they had to score a touchdown to beat us. Everybody was
thinking we were going to run it. My thinking was to go for a big
one and put the nail in the coffin. We were going to have to punt
anyway. I felt we were playing good enough defense to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the pass) had been one foot longer, coach Toledo would
have been a genius instead of a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Tight end Bryan Fletcher (strained groin) is
questionable for Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz (sprained shoulder) and offensive
tackle Brian Polak (knee tendinitis) are probable.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jason Bell will miss his fifth consecutive game
because of a painful right heel.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Farmer was named UCLA Offensive Player of the
Game. Jermaine Lewis won the special-teams honor (three tackles).
The defensive award went to the entire unit, which held Oregon to
one scoring drive longer than 44 yards. . . . Cornerback Ryan
Roques and guard Oscar Cabrera will join season-long selections
Pete Holland and Farmer as captains this week. . . . The Bruins
have won 13 consecutive home games, the longest streak in the
Pac-10. They also have won 11 straight conference home games, one
short of the league record set by USC from 1986-89. . . . Kickoff
for the Oct. 23 game at Oregon State, initially scheduled for 1
p.m., has been moved to 3:30. It will be televised on Channel 9.

IN THEATER, GOOD NEWS, IF EARLY, IS BAD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The review was a rave, but the reaction to its
publication was not.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of a forthcoming Broadway show were crying foul on
Monday after Newsweek magazine violated a longstanding, if
unwritten, rule of theater coverage by running a review of a show a
week before its opening night.
</P>
<P>
   The review, written by the theater critic Jack Kroll, was of
``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,'' and arrived on newsstands Monday
morning. ``The Royal Tour,'' a one-man show at the Booth Theater by
the Australian actor Barry Humphries, does not open officially
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kroll's review was generally glowing, the decision to
run it early prompted concern from the show's producers _ who said
the critic had sneaked into an early preview _ and the League of
American Theaters and Producers, who are worried about what sort of
precedent it might set.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the league said the early review ``disrespects a
tacit agreement that has existed between the Broadway industry and
the media for close to 100 years.'' It also added that such reviews
did a ``disservice to the customer'' because preview performances
are often works in progress that do not resemble the finished
product.
</P>
<P>
   In general, producers offer two or three dates, and free
tickets, for critics in the final week of previews. But Kevin
McAnarney, a spokesman for the show, said Kroll had paid for a pair
of tickets and attended a performance last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack called on Friday and said, `I have good news and bad
news,''' McAnarney said. ```The good news is I liked the show; the
bad news is the review is running on Monday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at the Newsweek offices Monday, Kroll had little to say
about the decision to run the review early, except that the
decision was not his but was made by his editors. Sarah Petitt, a
senior editor who oversees the magazine's theater coverage, did not
return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Brunett, a spokesman for the magazine, said he did not have
specific details of why the magazine had chosen to break the
embargo, but defended the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry they're upset over such a positive review,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the theater league, Kylie Robertson, said that
the organization was drafting a letter to the magazine to protest
the decision, but that it was highly unlikely any sanction would be
imposed on the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Other denizens of the Broadway scene said the move was
surprising _ but not particularly worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is a bad precedent,'' said Alexander Cohen, a veteran
Broadway producer, ``that involves a good notice.''

 &HT;    Martinez sparkles in relief, O'Leary homers twice to sink
Cleveland
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Indians didn't just dare Boston's Troy
O'Leary to put them out of their misery, they double-dared him. And
he obliged both times, crashing a pair of home runs to lift the
championship-starved Red Sox into the American League Championship
Series for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's grand slam in the third gave the Red Sox a two-run
lead, then his three-run rip in the seventh broke a tie and ended
with a dull thud Cleveland's hopes of qualifying for the ALCS for
the fourth time in five years, a 12-8 exclamation point to three
days of administering cruel and unusual punishment to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   And what a dubious conclusion for the Tribe, a winner in the
first two games of the five-game series. Needing one victory to end
it, the Indians were assaulted for 44 runs over the final three
games to become the second team to lose the last three games of a
Division Series after winning the first two _ matching what the New
York Yankees did in losing to Seattle in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove was determined that American
League batting champion Nomar Garciaparra was not going to destroy
his team, so O'Leary did the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Both times Garciaparra was walked intentionally with first base
open, O'Leary drilled the next pitch for homers _ the grand slam
off starter Charles Nagy and the three-run game-winner off Paul
Shuey.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tribe assaulted Boston starter Bret Saberhagen and
relief pitcher Derek Lowe for eight runs in the first three
innings, Boston manager Jimy Williams tossed caution over the wall
and gambled by bringing in sore-backed 24-game winner Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   It was like drawing a window shade in front of a voyeur. The
Tribe saw nothing the final six innings _ no runs, no hits, three
walks, say good night to the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   All that was missing in the first three innings were bellies
sagging over belts and cut-off jeans. It was a perfect imitation of
a slow-pitch softball game at a church picnic.
</P>
<P>
   After three, 15 runs crossed the plate and not one runner was
left on base.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cleveland 8, Boston 7, with Jim Thome smashing two
two-run homers that covered 904 total feet, but Martinez turned off
the tap the final six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's reward is an all-expenses paid trip to New York
Wednesday to face the New York Yankees in the ALCS, the defending
World Series champions. Boston hasn't been to the World Series
since 1986.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; It seemed odd that USC did not take tailback Malaefou
MacKenzie to Arizona last weekend, after the sophomore appeared to
have recovered from his hamstring injury. Especially after Trojans
coach Paul Hackett said before the game that MacKenzie was ready to
be eased into the line.
</P>
<P>
   According to several sources, MacKenzie was left home because of
a team-rules violation.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie, who has not played since the season-opener against
Hawaii, is officially listed as ``probable'' for the Notre Dame
game.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Chin up:!off! Hackett said he is not worried the Trojans
will fall into a tailspin after losing two of their past three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the maturity of the team. We've got Notre Dame
and a whole half of a season left,'' Hackett said. ``It's a team
that's very, very distraught over seeing the chance to go to the
Rose Bowl fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``But stranger things have happened. You've got to play it out
because there's no dominant team (in the Pacific-10 Conference).
You don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Grain update:!off! Right guard Jason Grain underwent a
magnetic resonance imaging test Monday on his injured knee. Results
were not available, but he is expected to be out at least a month,
and might miss the rest of the season if torn ligaments are found.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Hard to watch:!off! Among those watching the Arizona game
at home was quarterback Carson Palmer, who is recovering from his
broken collarbone. He was particularly frustrated watching the
offense slump against Arizona's supposedly porous defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough watching them struggle,'' Palmer said.
``Seeing plays you'd like to be in on.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he won't feel worse over not playing against Notre
Dame. The Irish were his No.1 choice in high school, but he was
told he needed to raise his Scholastic Assessment Test score 100
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult but no more difficult than last
week,'' Palmer said. ``It's a game and I'd give anything to play. I
want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means he still doesn't want to redshirt. Palmer is wearing
a harness over both shoulders to help his broken collarbone heal.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!No major changes:!off! Hackett said he didn't anticipate
any differences in the starting lineup, unless injuries dictate it.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback John Fox took most of the snaps in Sunday's
practice, but Hackett said he was just getting work because he had
not played against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Position change:!off! Freshman linebacker Troy Polamalu
has switched back to weakside linebacker after playing strongside
the past few weeks. It's the second time he has played the weakside
position this season.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Denmon's back:!off! Hackett said center Eric Denmon will
be back at full strength this week after being bothered with sore
knees that caused him to miss the Oregon game and play sparingly
against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   USC also gets left guard Donta Kendrick (ankle) back this week.
Linebacker Zeke Moreno said his arm was sore but that he would be
able to play.!dlim! &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

LOUIS CLAIBORNE, 72, DEPUTY SOLICITOR GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis Claiborne, a deputy solicitor general who argued more than
60 cases on behalf of the government before the Supreme Court and
was noted for the elegance of his legal briefs, died on Wednesday
at his home in Wivenhoe, Essex, England. He was 72 and also had a
home in Nerja, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   John Briscoe, a partner in his law firm in San Francisco, said
the cause was lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A major environmental case for which Claiborne wrote his last
brief will be heard by the Supreme Court Tuesday. The brief argues
that private citizens should not be permitted to bring lawsuits
under the Clean Water Act because any penalties imposed on a
polluter would go not to the plaintiffs but to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief, Claiborne wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ```How's that again?' is the likely reaction of the untutored
ear when asked whether a private citizen properly may bring suit to
compel a violator of a federal environmental law to pay a fine to
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Minear, an assistant solicitor general who will be
arguing in the case on behalf of the government and opposing his
old colleague's position, said the passage was typical and added:
``Louis will always have a presence that will remain even when he
has left the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne first served in the solicitor general's office from
1962 to 1970, when he moved to Britain to teach at the University
of Sussex and to please his Welsh-born wife, Jacqueline. While
there, he became one of the few American lawyers to be admitted to
practice as a barrister in England.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne returned to the solicitor general's office in 1978 and
remained there as a deputy until 1985, when he joined the San
Francisco law firm of Washburn, Briscoe &AMP; McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow deputy solicitor general, Lawrence Wallace, said
Claiborne argued many important civil rights cases before the
Supreme Court, including Green vs. County School Board in 1968, in
which the court upheld the government position that school
desegregation should go forward in New Kent County, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was born in Brussels, Belgium, where his father was a
bank executive with Guaranty Trust Co. of New York (now Morgan
Guaranty Trust), and he left with his family for the United States
when the Nazis invaded Belgium in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He went to high school in Mountain Lakes, N.J., to college at
the University of Louvain in Belgium and the Ecole de Sciences
Politiques in Paris, and finally to the Tulane University Law
School in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   One result of that multicultural schooling was an accent that to
Americans sounded British, to the English, Continental. With the
veneer of the Louisiana bayous, he pronounced his first name in the
French manner, Louie.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, to whom he was married for 40 years, Claiborne
is survived by his son, Andrew, and his daughter, Michele, both of
Wivenhoe; a brother, Omer, of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Liz
Claiborne, the designer and apparel maker, of Manhattan, and six
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while Claiborne was arguing against segregation in
Louisiana, Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg asked him about
Claiborne Parish, which was on the government's list of problems,
according to ``The Tenth Justice: The Solicitor General and the
Rule of Law'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1987) by Lincoln Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret to say Claiborne Parish is one of the worst,''
Claiborne said, and he added that it was named after his
great-great-great-grandfather, who was the first American governor
of Louisiana.
