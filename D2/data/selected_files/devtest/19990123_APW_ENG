<HEADLINE> Quotes From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Quotations from inside and outside Saturday's session of the  
Senate's impeachment trial of President Clinton: 

</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., on the  
impact of Clinton's popularity: 
</P>
<P>
	``We have, or we have not, a representative democracy. We're not  
delegates who are sent here to weigh our mail every day, and then 
to vote accordingly. There are issues of transcendent importance 
that you have to be willing to lose your office over. ...I've been 
on the Judiciary Committee -- this is my 25th year -- and equal 
justice under the law is what moves me. It animates me. And I'm 
willing to lose my seat any day of the week rather than sell out on 
those issues. Despite all the polls and all the hostile editorials, 
America is hungry for people who believe in something.'' 

</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff:  
</P>
<P>
	``The answer to that question is not the polls your read in  
papers or see on the evening news. Whatever those may be, that's 
only one clue. And each of you know the people in your jurisdiction 
far better than any polltaker. One way to answer the ultimate 
question that I've described is to ask yourself on the basis of 
experience over the last year the political, and by the political 
and I mean political in the Hamilton sense, what your sense of 
their needs are. Do they need the kind of cleansing spoken about. I 
think that answer is no. But surely the sense of the people, the 
will of the people ... must guide, not mandate, the result of these 
proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.:  
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment is equivalent to the political death penalty. What  
I hope you will be able to do as a wise body is not leave this 
confusion behind -- whether or not it's a crime. It can be a high 
crime and you then have to decide the impact on society, but if you 
leave us confused about whether or not this is a crime or not, the 
impact on society is far greater than if you make the decision of 
it's a crime but proportionately is not what the death penalty 
would call for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., on the desire of House impeachment  
managers to interview Monica Lewinsky: 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a right to prepare that witness. ...It has nothing to  
do with the formal proceeding of taking a deposition. It has 
nothing to do with her testimony actually here. It has everything 
to do with the right of anyone to prepare their witness. It is 
normal practice to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff:  
</P>
<P>
	``The earlier suggestion that just a friendly little chat was  
all they were looking for is belied by the notion that what we have 
here is the managers using their own institutional role to get the 
independence counsel to join with them and use the authority he has 
under the immunity agreement to threaten Ms. Lewinsky with jail. 
...Can you imagine what that little conversation is going to look 
like, held in the independent counsel's office, with people who 
have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy:  
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike the House we respect the rules of the Senate. ... The  
only explanation for the House managers' behavior is, in the words 
of Sen. Bumpers, 'wanting to win too badly.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark:  
</P>
<P>
	``The White House counselors do not want to talk about the  
facts, the obstruction of justice. Just like in the House, they 
want to talk about the process, everything but the obstruction of 
justice. Every time the president tried to talk to (Oval Office 
secretary) Betty Currie, I don't think the president invited the 
independent counsel in.''

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Sign Gary Trent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Gary Trent, a 6-foot-8 forward who played for  
Portland and Toronto last season, signed a one-year contract with 
the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent, in his fourth season, averaged a career-high 11.7 points  
and 6.3 rebounds in 53 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
reported that his contract with the Mavericks was worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Mavericks thought they had a commitment  
from forward Kurt Thomas, but he signed with New York. The 
Mavericks also pursued Cedric Ceballos before signing Trent. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent was selected by Milwaukee with the 11th overall pick in  
the 1996 draft but was traded immediately to Portland. Last 
February, Trent was traded with Kenny Anderson and Alvin Williams 
to Toronto in a deal that sent Damon Stoudamire, Carlos Rogers and 
Walt Williams to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent's averages in points, rebounds and assists have increased  
in each of his first three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Trent was charged with misdemeanor assault after  
his pregnant girlfriend told Portland police he hit her in the face 
and kicked her in the ribs. Trent pleaded guilty to a lesser 
misdemeanor charge of harassment and received probation for one 
year.

<HEADLINE> Seventh-Day Adventist Head Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- Leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist  
Church will hold a special meeting next Monday to examine 
allegations of improper business transactions by the church 
president, Robert Folkenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of 20 church leaders from around the world is  
scheduled to meet at the Dulles International Airport Marriott 
Hotel in Northern Virginia to review the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkenberg could not be reached for comment. But his attorney,  
Joe Reeder, said Folkenberg had requested the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the denomination, which is headquartered here,  
declined Friday to provide details of the questionable 
transactions. They came to light after a former business partner of 
Folkenberg sued him and the church last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged that Folkenberg and others had violated the  
terms of a business agreement with James E. Moore, who lives in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's chairman, Niels-Erik Andreasen, president of  
Andrews University, a church-affiliated seminary in Michigan, said 
it ``is not clear'' if the questioned business transactions 
involved church funds.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky: All-Star Game Still Fresh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- When Wayne Gretzky steps on the ice for  
Sunday's NHL All-Star Game, it will be all so new to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he hasn't been there before. It's just that every year  
is like a fresh experience for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think the excitement of being part of the NHL All-Star  
Game makes it fresh,'' Gretzky said. ``I think every guy who gets a 
chance to come here enjoys being here. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be a part of an NHL All-Star Game is a privilege. Nobody  
ever turns it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the same sense of wonder that Gretzky brings to every game  
-- something that hasn't left him since he was a daydreaming 
schoolboy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to sit and think how wonderful it would be to be a  
professional hockey player,'' Gretzky said. ``I just wanted to play 
in the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And play he has. He holds some 60 records, some of which may  
never be equaled. Gretzky has done it all, including winning four 
Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with his fourth team and in his 20th NHL season,  
Gretzky still hasn't lost his passion for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day is a challenge as far as I'm concerned,'' Gretzky  
said at a news conference Saturday. ``This challenge hasn't changed 
for me since I started. Coaches told me to just go out and work 
hard. My challenge is go to the rink and do the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now playing in his 18th All-Star Game, Gretzky will always  
remember the first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to play with Gordie Howe,'' he said. ``He was my hero  
growing up and it was a moment I will never forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky still trails Howe in All-Star appearances -- Howe played  
in a record 23. Gretzky does hold All-Star records for career goals 
(12), including four in one period, and points (22). 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has not only been the biggest offensive force in league  
history, he has been the NHL's most important player in terms of 
exposure for hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	He put Edmonton on the hockey map in the 1980s. When the  
cash-strapped Oilers traded Gretzky to Los Angeles in a blockbuster 
trade in 1988, the move reverberated across the NHL and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The native of Brantford, Ontario, was regarded as one of his  
country's most valuable natural resources. His No. 99 remains a 
synonym for ``great'' in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's arrival in the United States inspired league growth,  
particularly to warm-weather sites. The NHL has since expanded to 
Anaheim, San Jose, Dallas, Miami and Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is growing,'' Gretzky said. ``I think the NHL is  
doing a good job selling the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Gretzky will be a reserve at the All-Star Game.  
Philadelphia's Eric Lindros was picked to start over him at center 
for the North America team when Detroit's Steve Yzerman, voted in 
by the fans, was sidelined with a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Other starters for the North America All-Stars: New Jersey  
goaltender Martin Brodeur, defensemen Al MacInnis of St. Louis and 
Ray Bourque of Boston and forwards Brendan Shanahan of Detroit and 
Paul Kariya of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Starters for the World All-Stars: goaltender Dominik Hasek,  
center Peter Forsberg of Colorado, forwards Jaromir Jagr of 
Pittsburgh and Teemu Selanne of Anaheim and defensemen Nicklas 
Lidstrom of Detroit and Teppo Numminen of Phoenix, who replaced 
injured starter Uwe Krupp of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who turns 38 this month, chuckled when asked about  
retirement, particularly in light of Michael Jordan's decision to 
leave basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always asked that because of my age and situation,''  
Gretzky said. ``But I really haven't thought about it. I don't fib: 
At the end of the year, I'll sit down and think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if this would be his last All-Star Game, Gretzky said,  
``Yeah,'' then added a qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't take that the wrong way,'' he said with a smile. ``I  
said the same thing last year.''

<HEADLINE> McGinnis Won't Be Bears Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Dave McGinnis withdrew his name as  
candidate to coach the Chicago Bears today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have taken myself out of the job,'' McGinnis, defensive  
coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals, told WMAQ-TV. ``It did not 
feel right in my gut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bears spokesman Scott Hagel confirmed that McGinnis was out of  
the running. 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis' decision came one day after the Bears announced he was  
hired as coach -- then later said the details had not been worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis was furious that team president Michael McCaskey  
announced his hiring before there was an agreement. When several 
attempts to smooth things over didn't work, team chairman Ed 
McCaskey, Michael's father and a personal friend of McGinnis, 
called McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears met with McGinnis again today before the negotiations  
were called off for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why the Bears did things the way they did, but I  
am not criticizing anyone,'' McGinnis told WMAQ. ``I have ended 
talks because I felt this was right for me. The Bears are a great 
team, they always will be. This is very, very disappointing to me 
and my family but we will all go on -- the Cardinals and the 
Bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WMAQ reported that McGinnis would stay with the Cardinals.  
</P>
<P>
	His withdrawal caps one of the most embarrassing episodes in the  
NFL's oldest and most storied franchise at a time when the Bears 
thought they were moving forward to replace Dave Wannstedt, who was 
fired three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis had spent 10 years as Chicago's linebackers coach, and  
the job seemed to be his from the time it opened. He had stood 
before the media only 24 hours before Friday's aborted news 
conference and said coaching the Bears was ``anyone's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this also was a disaster that was months in the making.  
McCaskey, a grandson of Bears founder George Halas, has refused to 
hire a general manager despite not having a football background. 
When he fired Wannstedt after consecutive 4-12 seasons, he 
surprised Mark Hatley, director of player personnel, by telling him 
to put together a list of potential coaches and do initial 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatley didn't know until then that screening coaches was part of  
his job, and this was going to take up valuable time during the 
prime scouting period. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the Bears got their coaching list together, they  
were woefully behind other teams. Including the expansion Cleveland 
Browns, nine NFL teams had coaching vacancies. The Bears are the 
only team still looking now.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Details Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans first heard about Social  
Security as they registered for their cards to help them get their 
first jobs as teen-agers. But most people -- women in particular -- 
are only beginning to understand how the system benefits them, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future of Social Security is, without a doubt, one of the  
most important issues facing our country and facing women in 
America today,'' the first lady said. ``Yet many of us are just 
beginning to get involved in the debate, and we're just starting to 
learn about how Social Security affects us as women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's comments opened the teleconference ``What Every  
Woman Should Know About Social Security.'' The gathering linked 
Washington to 10 major cities across the nation. It was intended to 
stress the significance of preserving the retirement program and 
explain how Americans, particularly women, benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of all elderly women would fall below the poverty  
level without Social Security, Mrs. Clinton said. Currently, she 
said, Social Security is the only income one in four women 
receives. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go to the supermarket, when you go to church or to  
synagogue, when you're walking down the street, I want you to think 
that every other woman you see who is over 65 would be living below 
the poverty line if it were not for Social Security,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women have ``unique life patterns,'' because they live longer  
then men, Mrs. Clinton said. They also make lower lifetime earnings 
and, therefore, reach retirement with smaller pensions and other 
financial assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after the first lady, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said  
the Social Security system must be preserved ``at least at the 
current level so that women will have peace of mind that Social 
Security will be there for them as they move into retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn said if nothing is done to the current system, Social  
Security will be able to pay only 73 percent of current benefits 
when her oldest child reaches retirement age in 2032. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the mother of two sons, I know that the last thing a woman  
wants to be is a burden on their family,'' she said. ``Preserving 
social security will help women who are growing older to have the 
freedom and independence that comes with knowing that their future 
retirement is secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have accepted President Clinton's suggestion  
to reserve 62 percent of the budget surplus until an agreement on 
Social Security is reached. Mrs. Clinton praised the decision and 
urged lawmakers to reserve more of the surplus to protect Medicare, 
the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled that, 
like Social Security, is in danger of being financially overwhelmed 
by aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health security and retirement security should go hand in  
hand,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn said lawmakers want to work quickly to ensure Social  
Security's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always going to be looking for areas in which can agree  
to make the system better for all of us,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Princess Caroline Gets Re-Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONACO (AP) -- After wedding a playboy and a businessman,  
Princess Caroline of Monaco married a prince, exchanging vows 
Saturday with Ernst August of Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
	The princess, a Roman Catholic, chose her 42nd birthday as the  
day for the civil ceremony with her longtime boyfriend, who is 
Protestant. Caroline's father, Prince Rainier, announced the 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The bride wore an elegant light gray suit with gold buttons and  
a gold pin on her lapel, while her husband was dressed in a dark 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In accordance with a historical agreement between the British  
and German royal families, the prince was required to asked Queen 
Elizabeth II for permission to marry Caroline. It was the second 
marriage for the German prince. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter of the late Princess Grace was divorced after an  
unhappy two-year marriage to French playboy Phillipe Junot -- a 
union in 1978 that had disappointed both her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Her second marriage in 1983 to Italian businessman Stefano  
Casiraghi ended seven years later when he was killed in a boating 
accident. They had three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Paparazzi and a few tourists gathered in the courtyard of the  
Grimaldis, the royal family of Monaco, best known for the 
fairy-tale wedding of Princess Grace to Prince Rainier and Grace's 
death in a 1982 car crash.

<HEADLINE> Swiss City Praised for 2006 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss city of Sion received a  
glowing review Saturday from an IOC panel assessing the six bids 
for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee's Evaluation Commission said  
Sion was strong in sporting terms and had a sound financial base, 
excellent infrastructure and good environmental credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The report generally praised the Italian bid from Turin but said  
its venues were too far apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It raised serious doubts about the multi-country bids involving  
Klagenfurt, Austria, and Helsinki, Finland, saying those posed 
major logistical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And it questioned whether Poprad Tatry in Slovakia and Zakopane  
in Poland had the necessary infrastructure and finances to host the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission issued its report under the shadow of the  
corruption scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to limit future chance for bribery, the IOC Executive  
Committee this weekend is expected to recommend overhauling bidding 
procedures for the games. Proposals include banning visits of IOC 
members to candidate cities and leaving the selection to a small 
group rather than the full IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new streamlined system would be submitted for approval by  
the general assembly at a special session March 17-18. If ratified, 
it would be in place for the selection of the 2006 host at the June 
IOC session in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiharu Igaya, chairman of the Evaluation Commission, said he  
was confident that the host city could be decided on the basis of 
the bid documents and evaluation report alone rather than by full 
site visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should be sufficient for them to give a fair judgment on  
which city could host it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, which lost out to Salt Lake City as host for the 2002  
Olympics, has long been considered a front-runner, slightly ahead 
of Turin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sports concept is well thought out, with the Olympic  
Village centrally located in Sion, the ice sports in the Rhone 
Valley and the skiing events in the mountains on either side of the 
city,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the transport plan was very good and there were adequate  
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion 2006 director-general Jean-Daniel Mudry said he was happy  
with the report. 
</P>
<P>
	On Turin, the report criticized the fact that organizers wanted  
to stage hockey and skating in Turin and other sports like skiing 
in the Suse valley in Pragelato. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the existing infrastructure, the Evaluation  
Commission believes that the sports concept should be more 
concentrated,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	It criticized the fact that most of the ice rinks in Turin would  
be dismantled after the event. 
</P>
<P>
	But Turin officials remained upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I learn from the report is that Sion is ready to host the  
games and that Turin is capable but needs more time,'' Marco San 
Pietro said. ``But it's a matter of months, not years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main fault of Helsinki was the proposal to stage the Alpine  
skiing events in Lillehammer in Norway because of the lack of 
mountains in Finland, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whilst the individual venues are excellent, the distance  
between Helsinki and Lillehammer and the fact that a large portion 
of the games will be held in Norway may lead to organizational and 
operational burdens,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the Klagenfurt bid -- which also includes  
neighboring Italy and Slovenia ``represents the original concept of 
an Olympic games beyond borders between Austria, Italy and 
Slovenia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This concept presents interesting aspects but also potential  
organizational difficulties,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the distances involved were too big, it said. If  
Slovenia still was outside the European Union in 2006 this would 
complicate border crossings and security, it pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Igaya said in general, joint bids posed a ``big challenge.''  
</P>
<P>
	The report found major problems with the bid of Poprad-Tatry.  
These included lack of guaranteed funding for the Olympic Village, 
insufficient quality venues and lack of a nearby international 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Evaluation commission believes that the costs of building  
infrastructure for and putting on the Olympic Games will be a 
significant challenge to the financial resources of both the public 
and private sectors in Slovakia,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports, hotel and transportation facilities all needed upgrading  
in Zakopane, the report said. It added that there also were 
questions about the budget.

	Elway will finish his career by starting at quarterback in a  
Super Bowl for a record fifth time; Chandler is a journeyman who 
has played for six teams, almost all bad, in 11 NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Chandler's new teammates wondered when the Falcons got him  
from the Oilers two years ago for almost nothing -- fourth and 
sixth-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he arrived here, we're all like, `We traded for him? He's  
going to be our quarterback?' '' said Jamal Anderson, the Falcons' 
All-Pro running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Jamal, he is your quarterback and you're happy to have him  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Chandler got Atlanta to the title game by completing  
27 of 43 passes for 340 yards, directing a 71-yard drive for the 
tying touchdown, then a 70-yarder for the winning field goal in the 
30-27 overtime win at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: A team that was a 100-1 to win the Super Bowl at the  
start of the season -- and 3-13 two years ago -- is in the NFL's 
ultimate game for the first time after 32 seasons in which it went 
184-298-5. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Chandler was better than Elway, at least  
statistically. His rating was 100.9, seven points higher than 
Elway's, and he surprised even himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still hard to realize that I've gotten this far,'' said  
Chandler, who never had been to a playoff game in his first 10 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast between Elway and Chandler starts from the  
beginning of their pro careers -- about all they had in common were 
Pac-10 backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway entered the NFL in 1983 from Stanford with so much  
potential that he was able to dictate his own terms. He told the 
Baltimore Colts, who had the No. 1 pick in the draft, that he 
didn't want to play for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts picked him anyway, then traded him to the Broncos.  
After a predictably erratic start, Elway has fulfilled every 
expectation, leading Denver to five Super Bowls, winning his first 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a guy in the NFL who  
symbolized his town like John Elway,'' said Shannon Sharpe, the 
Broncos' tight end. ``If you think of Denver, you don't think of 
skiing. You think of John Elway. It's always been John, and even if 
he retires, it will still always be John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was a ``maybe'' coming out of the University of  
Washington in 1988, a third-round draft pick by Indianapolis. His 
arm was strong and his head was good, but his mobility and 
durability were suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ensuing decade, he went from the Colts to the Bucs,  
Cardinals, Rams, Oilers and finally the Falcons, playing until this 
season on only one winning team -- the 1988 Colts, who were 9-7 -- 
and living up to his injury-prone reputation by never playing all 
16 games in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may have had something to do with his supporting cast,  
particularly the offensive line. Overall, the teams he played for 
in his first 10 seasons had a combined record of 62-98 and he often 
was a victim of front-office floundering. The Bucs, who gave up a 
first-round pick for him in 1991, released him outright six games 
into the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he couldn't  
stay in one piece,'' said George Young, the NFL's senior 
vice-president for football operations, who as general manager of 
the Giants had some interest in Chandler. ``When players get a rap 
for being injury prone, people finally give up on them or decide 
they don't want to take the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ask Chandler's father-in-law, John Brodie, who played  
quarterback for the 49ers from 1957-73, and you get a different 
perspective. They talk weekly and Brodie serves as unofficial coach 
and cheerleader for his son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see a quarterback and all the pieces come together it  
never comes together right away,'' Brodie said. ``It develops over 
a period of time and you never know the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early in his career, he had no support, no one was in his  
corner. Everyone was looking for him to fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was looking for Elway to fail and he hasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	He's combined athleticism, brains and a strong arm with the  
ability to be at his best under pressure. He's led 47 
fourth-quarter drives that have tied or won games for Denver, the 
most famous a 98-yarder that tied the 1986 AFC title game that sent 
the Broncos to their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, until last season, Super Bowls were the only blemish on  
Elway's record. He had lost three, all on Denver teams coached by 
Dan Reeves, who will lead Atlanta against the Broncos in next 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the AFC championship against the Jets, Elway was only  
13-of-34 for 173 yards, while Terrell Davis was carrying the Denver 
offense. The Broncos won 23-10 in what was almost surely Elway's 
final game at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he took a victory lap, acknowledging the fans who  
have watched him work his magic for 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel comfortable, taking that lap,'' Elway said.  
``But I'm glad I did it. I had a chance to see the fans and look 
into their eyes, to really concentrate on them. They were so 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one in Minnesota wanted a victory lap from Chandler after he  
saved the game for Atlanta. But Reeves drew some comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him after we went down there and tied the score, that  
ranks right up there with any of the big-time quarterbacks,'' 
Reeves said. ``He's done it with the pressure on him, made some 
big-time throws, did it after being hurt from the scramble, hung in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to see how well Chandler does under the ultimate  
pressure against a quarterback who in five years will be an almost 
automatic choice for the Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Tenn., Ark. Declared Disaster Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- James Lee Witt has seen some of the  
worst disasters imaginable as director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. But even he was rattled by the destruction 
caused by the tornado that hit historic downtown Clarksville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow!'' he said Saturday as he was driven past the Madison  
Street United Methodist Church, an 1882 building whose sanctuary 
was destroyed and massive twin spires were ripped nearly in half by 
Friday's storms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like someone dropped a bomb on it. That's just what  
it looks like,'' said Witt, who toured damaged areas in Tennessee 
and Arkansas by helicopter, bus and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal disaster area-status was declared for one county in  
Tennessee and five counties in Arkansas. The storms Thursday and 
Friday killed one in Tennessee and seven in Arkansas, and damaged 
thousands of homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister cut a five-mile swath through Clarksville, a city of  
89,000, ripping apart a five-block area downtown and tearing 
through the center of Austin Peay State University and a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton planned to tour damaged areas in Arkansas on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In many places in Little Rock, there was little for Witt to see:  
Houses weren't just damaged, they no longer existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's storms in Beebe, Ark., brought winds gauged at 200  
mph. On North Main Street, the front door of a house was ripped 
off, but inside a Christmas tree stood upright with each gold 
ribbon still in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see things that are just unexplainable,'' said Sandie  
Glover, standing in front of her damaged home. Beebe's elementary, 
junior high and high schools were ravaged and made unusable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, S.L. Porchia, in his 80s, said he wanted to stay  
in his house even though it had neither an intact roof nor 
electricity. Delois Ross, his granddaughter, didn't want him to but 
figured he would anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to budge,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	More relief workers joined the effort Saturday, along with  
insurance adjusters and church volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a south Little Rock Neighborhood Alert Center, victims and  
volunteers streamed in for food and guidance. ``We're here to do 
what we can,'' said Bill Donnell, a helper from the Immanuel 
Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksville, workers cleared away debris to make streets  
passable. Downtown residents and business owners were allowed to 
see their properties for the first time since the twister hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's federal emergency declaration, grants can help  
pay for temporary living expenses and minor home repairs. 
Low-interest loans will be made available to cover residential and 
business losses not covered fully by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work as fast as humanly possible in aiding all those  
in need,'' said Witt. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt, like Clinton an Arkansas native, said the devastation  
struck a nerve for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen so much of this the last six years, but any time it  
happens at home, it hits close to the heart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms also destroyed a treehouse where Chelsea Clinton  
played as a child outside the governor's mansion in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm in Tennessee was the second tornado to hit a large  
Tennessee city in less than a week. Last Sunday, Jackson was 
heavily damaged by a twister that was part of a storm system that 
killed nine people and damaged more than 1,900 homes and 
businesses.

<HEADLINE>  Davis Wants Proper Elway Sendoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Last year, the ring was the thing.  
</P>
<P>
	With quarterback John Elway in the twilight of his career,  
running back Terrell Davis and his Denver teammates desperately 
wanted to get Elway a Super Bowl ring that had eluded him in three 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, it's a proper goodbye. With Elway almost certainly in  
the final season of a brilliant 16-year career, the Broncos are 
using Elway's departure as motivation to send him off with another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to ride that thing this year,'' Davis  
said. ``Last year, we wanted him to get a ring. I think he's going 
to leave this year, and we really want to send him out on a high 
note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was mainly responsible for Elway's ring, rushing for 157  
yards and three touchdowns in the Broncos' 31-24 victory over Green 
Bay, a performance that earned him Super Bowl MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	For several anxious moments, however, the Broncos were without  
the services of their star running back. Davis neglected to take 
his migraine headache medicine and suffered a blinding migraine 
that sidelined him almost the entire second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to emergency treatment on the sideline, he was able to  
return for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	If, on Super Bowl Sunday in Miami, Davis suddenly sees stars,  
has blurred vision and experiences a searing pain in his head, he 
wants it to be from a hard tackle -- not from another migraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will make sure it won't happen again,'' Davis said Thursday  
with a sheepish grin. ``I already have a reminder. I will have this 
big sign and put it on my locker. That's the first thing I'm going 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, plagued by migraines since he was a teen-ager, has  
experienced relief from the debilitating symptoms in recent years, 
provided he follows his doctors' orders. In fact, he has proved to 
be much more of a headache for opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the fourth-year pro rushed for 2,008  
yards, becoming only the fourth player in NFL history to reach the 
2,000-yard plateau, and was named the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He has topped 100 yards rushing in six straight postseason  
games, including 199 and 167 yards this postseason, the latter 
coming in last week's 23-10 victory over the New York Jets in the 
AFC championship game to advance the Broncos to the Super Bowl on 
Jan. 31 against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	In four postseason games last season, he rushed for 581 yards,  
and playoff statistics are numbers he cherishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a lot of postseason numbers because people tend  
to measure you by that,'' he said. ``Eric (Dickerson) was the 
greatest back to play the game, but as far as his postseason 
numbers, they're not really up there. That's one thing I'm trying 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at Emmitt Smith, he's really been put in front of a  
lot of running backs because of the championships he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's small but mobile offensive line received much of the  
credit for the Broncos' offensive success in 1997, but Davis 
believes this year's revamped line -- with two new starters and a 
third player moving to a different position -- is actually better 
than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired,  
and right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with 
Seattle. Then, in the preseason, David Diaz-Infante, who was 
projected to be Habib's replacement, injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Right tackle Tony Jones moved to Zimmerman's vacated spot on the  
left side, second-year pro Dan Neil became the starting right 
guard, and veteran Harry Swayne became the starter at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this line is definitely better,'' Davis said. ``We had  
some people move in and change positions, but the continuity has 
been there the entire year. Losing Zim and switching Tony over to 
left tackle, you would think we would lose something. But I think 
Tony is a better left tackle than he is a right tackle, and Harry 
came in and played great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and center Tom Nalen both are headed to the Pro Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Rose Awaits Word on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose is in an uncomfortable situation.  
He wants to be a free agent, but hopes to stay with the Indiana 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers say he belongs to them and the NBA agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	Rose is awaiting an arbitration ruling to settle the dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract Rose signed as a rookie with Denver in 1994  
declared him a restricted free agent after his fourth season. But 
the NBA has signed two collective bargaining agreements since then 
and no longer has restricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's agent, Norm Nixon, has requested a ruling from the league  
and hopes to receive one before the start of the season on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get this settled quickly,'' Rose said Friday.  
``But from now until then, and hopefully after that I'm still going 
to be a Pacer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who scored in double figures the last nine games of last  
season, averaged 9.4 points while playing in all 82 games as a 
reserve. He followed that up by averaging 8.1 points in 15 playoff 
games as Indiana reached the seventh game of the Eastern Conference 
finals before losing to the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in Indiana, no question about it. I love playing  
for coach (Larry Bird). My teammates are great, they love me and I 
love being here,'' said the 6-foot-8 Rose, who believes playing for 
Bird will pay dividends in more playing time and more production 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to come out and do what I can to help us win a  
championship. While I'm on the floor, I don't think about it (the 
contract). I think about it when I go back to my hotel room,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose doesn't want to get an apartment until the league makes its  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to win a championship. Nobody is going to distract  
us from that,'' said Rose, who rejoined his teammates Wednesday 
after spending much of the lockout in California working out on the 
UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like being the team to beat, a team that people say is  
going to win the championship. But that doesn't necessarily mean 
we're going to win,'' said Rose. ``We've got to go out and stay 
focused. ... If we are focused, and everybody is on the same page 
there's a good chance that it (championship) will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers head into Sunday's exhibition game at Chicago with  
virtually the same team that lost to the Bulls in the playoffs. The 
players who accounted for all but 23 of the 7,874 points the team 
scored last year return and free agent signee Sam Perkins is 
expected to provide additional depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part we were a deep team last year. We beat teams  
with our depth. Any time you're playing 50 games in 85 days, depth 
has to come into play,'' Rose said. ``Hopefully that will be a 
spark for our team, and help us get over the hump in a lot of 
games.''

<HEADLINE> Losing City Wants IOC Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- A member of Manchester's failed  
effort to land the 2000 Olympics has asked the IOC for compensation 
in light of the reported corruption surrounding Sydney's winning 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Stringer, a member of parliament and a key member of the  
Manchester bid team, also suggested the IOC should compensate other 
losing cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (various bid committees) paid out good money and they  
should be paid compensation,'' he said. ``The IOC have sat back and 
done nothing when they were in a position to clean the whole thing 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The northern English city finished a distant third behind Sydney  
and Beijing and also failed in a bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney bid committee members have revealed they made $70,000  
inducements for two African votes the night before they won the 
Summer Games for 2000 -- by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, the Australian executive board member from  
Australia, said he couldn't ``rule out'' that some might call for 
Sydney to lose the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports suggest Manchester spent about $12 million on its bid.  
</P>
<P>
	``You only have to be within the confines of the Olympic  
movement for five minutes to realize that things are not 
straightforward, that there has been corruption,'' Stringer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean you can prove it,'' he added. ``What has  
happened recently is that proof has come out that Salt Lake City 
and Sydney used bribery and improper practices to get their 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always said we were a clean bid and were not indulging in  
bribery and we thought that was a positive asset. We have played by 
the rules,'' he said. ``I don't know if we would have won. There 
were other geophysical reasons involved. But we will never know.''

<HEADLINE> Suns, Gugliotta Finalize Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns, in a high-risk waiting game as  
the number of free agents dwindled in the NBA's post-lockout 
signing frenzy, landed the player they wanted Saturday when Tom 
Gugliotta agreed to a six-year, $58.5 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta turned down a last-ditch effort by Minnesota to  
re-sign him, and possibly trade him, and was to be in Phoenix for 
practice on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a risky business. We let a lot of free agents go by and  
got a guy that we all are very excited about,'' Suns coach Danny 
Ainge said. ``From a coaching perspective, I think we're going to 
have a great basketball team. It's going to take some time, but I 
feel we are back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing was crucial to the Suns after losing power forward  
Antonio McDyess to Denver. After the bizarre waffling and eventual 
departure of the 24-year-old McDyess, Suns owner Jerry Colangelo 
praised the maturity of Gugliotta, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see stability. I see someone who's a pro,'' Colangelo said.  
``He's a given. He's a former all-star. He's competitive. He loves 
to play. We know every night we're going to get a great effort out 
of this guy because he's a pro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement cleared the way for the final two major moves the  
Suns must make, re-signing Rex Chapman and Clifford Robinson. The 
Suns expect to get both under contract in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, the NBA approved the sign-and-trade deal that  
brings center Luc Longley to Phoenix for Mark Bryant, Martin 
Muursepp and Sam Jacobsen. Colangelo said that deal, rather than 
signing Longley directly as a free agent, saved $2 million in 
salary cap room that was crucial in acquiring Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns also re-signed George McCloud on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta will get $7.8 million the first year, with a 10  
percent increase each year thereafter. A crucial element in the 
agreement is an opt-out clause after five years, when Gugliotta 
would be eligible for a much higher salary as a 10-year player. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we met with (agent) Richard Howell and Tom, we said,  
`That's it. That's what we have,''' Colangelo said. ``You have to 
make decisions sometimes that are not just monetary decision but 
have to do with where you want to be and who you want to be with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves offered Gugliotta the maximum seven-year, $86.7  
million contract allowed under the NBA's new collective bargaining 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Gugliotta averaged 20.1 points per game last  
season, but missed 41 games because of foot surgery, the first 
serious injury of his six-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first two seasons at Washington, Gugliotta was a teammate  
of Chapman and current Suns assistant coach Scott Skiles. Gugliotta 
was traded to Golden State for Chris Webber and draft hoices in 
November of 1994, then was traded to Minnesota for Donyell Marshall 
in February of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a very versatile player,'' Ainge said, ``a guy  
who can play a little bit of center in a pinch, can play small 
forward and can play power forward. He can pass. He can shoot. He 
can create off the dribble. He's a complete basketball player. He 
really knows how to play the game and make people better on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, rumored to have not gotten along with Minnesota point  
guard Stephan Marbury, is looking forward to playing with Jason 
Kidd, Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys who can score love to play with guys who deliver the  
ball,'' Colangelo said. ``I think he was intrigued with the thought 
of playing with Jason, very much so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta came to Phoenix Thursday night and spoke to Suns  
officials into the wee hours Friday. He left Friday for Atlanta, 
where Howell lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell and Gugliotta spoke with Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor  
on Saturday, then made the decision to go with the Suns at 
mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta went back to Minneapolis on Saturday to pack his bags  
and bring his wife with him to Phoenix on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said Timberwolves general manager Kevin McHale called  
Colangelo's son, Bryan, Phoenix's general manager, on Saturday to 
ask about a possible sign-and-trade deal that would have involved 
Dallas' top draft pick this year, now owned by the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colangelos turned him down, taking a chance that another  
possible sign-and-trade deal involving the Timberwolves and the Los 
Angeles Lakers would never materialize. That deal reportedly would 
have sent Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and Sam Jacobsen to 
Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Medicare Changes Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the eligibility age for Medicare and  
making the wealthy pay more for old-age health coverage are two 
possible recommendations from a Medicare reform commission, its 
chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
	Another potential proposal would have Medicare shift to helping  
elderly Americans buy health insurance instead of paying individual 
medical bills, as it does now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare needs fundamental reform, not just more money,'' Sen.  
John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission 
on the Future of Medicare, said Friday. The commission is advising 
President Clinton and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux also said the commission is likely to recommend adding a  
prescription benefit to Medicare, which does not cover most drugs 
now. ``People would like to have a drug program if we can find a 
way to pay for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address, Clinton said Medicare should  
cover prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the health care program for the elderly and disabled is  
expected to be financially overburdened by the huge, aging baby 
boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed devoting 15 percent of government surpluses  
expected over the next 15 years -- $650 billion to $700 billion 
according to the latest projections -- to Medicare. White House 
officials estimate this would keep Medicare from running short of 
cash for another 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But further savings would be needed to keep Medicare out of  
financial trouble beyond that, or to expand the program such as 
adding drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Congress are awaiting recommendations due from the  
Medicare commission -- a 17-member panel of lawmakers and private 
experts -- on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Breaux released a draft outline recommendations he  
supports and believes stand a good chance of getting the 11 
commissioners' votes required. But some already were not happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly one vote he's not going to get,'' said Bruce  
Vladeck, a former Medicare administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux's plan gradually would raise the Medicare eligibility age  
from 65 to 67 -- the same as is already scheduled for Social 
Security. People now age 62 and older would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of commissioners say they will not vote for a higher  
eligibility age unless at least some Medicare benefits remain 
available to people between the ages of 62 and 65 -- similar to the 
reduced early-retirement benefits Social Security offers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Breaux's plan would transform Medicare to make it  
more like the health benefits many companies and the federal 
government offer workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under such a system, sometimes called ``premium support,'' a  
retiree could choose from a menu of health insurance policies and 
receive a Medicare subsidy to help cover the enrollment fee, or 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux also mentioned making wealthy retirees pay more of their  
own insurance costs so government subsidies can be higher for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Participating health plans would be required to cover at least a  
minimum package of benefits -- likely what Medicare does now.

<HEADLINE> Activists Deny Encouraging Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Defendants in a federal lawsuit that  
accuses anti-abortion activists of illegally threatening doctors 
say free speech never killed anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	But the principal defendant said the murders of two abortion  
doctors was justified, and he did not condemn the killers -- both 
former anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's justifiable,'' Charles Wysong said Friday, referring to  
the murders of Drs. John Britton and David Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed by Planned Parenthood and others, seeks $200  
million. It claims the American Coalition of Life Activists -- of 
which Wysong was once regional director -- and other activists 
crossed the line between free speech and threats with a series of 
``wanted'' posters and an Internet site called ``The Nuremberg 
Files,'' which lists list names and addresses of abortion doctors 
and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet site has drawn attention in particular because a  
New York abortion doctor on the list was killed by a sniper last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster called ``The Deadly Dozen'' was distributed at an  
anti-abortion rally, charging a dozen doctors with ``crimes against 
humanity'' and offering a $5,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Wysong said Friday that such literature wasn't intended as a  
threat -- but merely as a means to expose abortion doctors to public 
scrutiny and encourage local opposition to clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Force is not going to end abortion,'' Wysong said. ``We don't  
need to use violence. We have been able to use free speech methods. 
But they are trying to take away our free speech rights by using 
this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Murch, another former director for the American Coalition  
of Life Activists, testified that he repeatedly rejected violence 
in discussions with other abortion opponents about tactics and 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied that anti-abortion fliers and posters produced at  
his commercial printing shop in Springfield, Mass., were crafted to 
threaten the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Jones said he would like to see  
closing arguments in the case begin early next week.

<HEADLINE> Stop Traffic Wins at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Stop Traffic rallied in the closing  
strides to overtake Belle's Flag by a length Saturday to win the 
$200,000 Santa Monica Handicap for fillies and mares at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Corey Black, Stop Traffic covered seven furlongs in  
1:22 and paid $9.80, $4.20 and $4.60. Belle's Flag and third-place 
finisher Closed Escrow, who ran as an entry, returned $3.40 and 
$3.20. Closed Escrow finished two lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really settled nicely today,'' Black said of Stop Traffic.  
``When she gets in that mode, it was just a matter of if I get 
racing room. I got running room in time and that's all she 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $120,000, was Stop Traffic's 11th in 27  
starts and increased her career earnings to $725,395. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the Pearl, who has earned more than $3.4 million racing  
in Japan, made her North American debut, finishing in fourth place, 
four lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's Flag, the 9-5 favorite, took control of the lead on the  
last turn before being overtaken. Corey Nakatani, aboard Belle's 
Flag, and Closed Escrow's rider Gary Stevens both thought their 
horses had enough for the win.

<HEADLINE> Senators Pose More Impeach Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial resumed  
today with attention divided between senators' questions and a new 
legal battle touched off by prosecutors' efforts to force Monica 
Lewinsky's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a chain of events set in motion by lead House prosecutor  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's attorneys 
went to court Friday for an emergency order to compel Ms. Lewinsky 
to be interviewed by the House managers concerning the alleged 
coverup of her affair with Clinton. The judge ruled today that she 
must submit to questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starr attorneys argue that the former White House intern's  
immunity agreement requires that she cooperate with the House. 
</P>
<P>
	But a legal source said U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson ruled that Ms. Lewinsky had to submit to an interview with 
Starr and his staff to assist the Senate impeachment trial, and 
that House prosecutors could attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Johnson  
ruled that House prosecutors themselves had no right under her 
immunity deal with Starr to force Ms. Lewinsky to interview with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he opposed the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an inappropriate intervention of the judiciary in the  
proceedings of the Senate,'' Kerry said. ``It is a separation of 
powers problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the trial, senators began a second day of probing the  
two legal teams, submitting written questions through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the House prosecutors,  
pleaded with senators not to end the trial and ``leave this 
confusion behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you leave us confused about whether or not this is a crime  
or not, the impact is far greater than if you rule that this is a 
crime but the political death penalty is not called for,'' he said, 
arguing senators should allow the trial go through to a final vote 
of the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	The House managers were also questioned by Democrats about why  
they pressed ahead with plans to force Ms. Lewinsky to submit to an 
interview. They acknowledged they had not told the president's 
lawyers of their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not think our desire to talk with Ms. Lewinsky violated  
any of the rules that you passed,'' Rep Bill McCollum told 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial faces two crucial decisions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., a senior senator, said he will  
introduce a motion to dismiss the trial, providing senators a quick 
opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the move would fail and the question of calling  
witnesses then would be considered. The House move was an attempt 
to learn what Ms. Lewinsky would say at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns Friday  
responding to some 50 written questions submitted by senators and 
read by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's announcement startled senators, who knew there would be a  
motion to dismiss but did not suspect it would be offered by a 
Democrat who has been no friend of the White House in the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Respected for his knowledge of Senate traditions, Byrd had  
created some doubt earlier about whether he would stick with 
Clinton as other Democrats have done throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our  
country'' and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's 
conviction and removal from office were ``not likely to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he made his decision ``not because I believe that the  
president did no wrong,'' but because ``it is necessary that we 
begin now the process of healing and reconciling the differences'' 
caused by Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, suggested his own exit strategy but  
said it would only be initiated after a decision on calling 
witnesses -- and after it was certain the two-thirds majority for 
conviction would not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	His resolution would adjourn the trial with language that would  
characterize the House impeachment vote as ``the ultimate 
condemnation for the president's despicable actions,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said approval of an early vote to dismiss the trial would  
be ``cavalier treatment'' of the House's case alleging perjury and 
obstruction of justice by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what an annoyance we are in the bosom of this great  
body,'' Hyde told the Senate. ``But we are a constitutional 
annoyance, and I remind you of that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said, ``I don't know of any  
Republicans who will vote to dismiss'' and abruptly end the trial. 
Byrd's motion could lose on a party-line vote in a Senate 
controlled by Republicans, 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., called Byrd's announcement ``a  
significant move. He's highly respected on both sides of the aisle. 
The White House lawyers have raised a lot of doubts about the 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another slight crack in Republican unity, Sen. Susan Collins  
of Maine said she was having difficulty with House evidence 
presented in support of the charge that Clinton lied before a grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had not decided whether to vote against the perjury  
article but added, ``I think ... the obstruction charge is much 
stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House reacted to Byrd's proposal with cautious  
optimism. ``Senator Byrd's statement speaks for itself. Our 
position has been clear. We believe in a fair, bipartisan and 
expeditious resolution of this whole matter,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the questions Friday dealt with key issues still in  
conflict. They included whether Clinton tried to coach Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; 
whether a job search for the former intern was an attempt to buy 
her silence about the affair; and whether the search was related to 
Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the witness list in Paula Jones' 
sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.

<HEADLINE> Value of Nixon Speech Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alexander Butterfield, the man who spilled the  
beans about the Nixon White House taping system, leaned back in his 
witness chair and grinned Friday as he read how appraisers had 
valued the president's famous ``Silent Majority'' speech at more 
than $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve drafts and the final, reading copy of the speech are  
worth that much, Nixon estate appraisers say, because of the 
address on Nov. 3, 1969 generated a huge public response. But with 
a knowing smile, Butterfield testified that the 50,000 favorable 
telegrams and 30,000 letters that poured into the White House after 
the speech were largely ``manufactured'' by the president's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield was called as a government witness in U.S. District  
Court to challenge the Nixon estate, which is seeking to collect 
$35 million in compensation and $175 million in compounded interest 
for tapes, photos, films and documents the government seized after 
Nixon left office on Aug. 9, 1974. The government contends the 
estate is entitled to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did have to smile when I read this,'' Butterfield said,  
referring to two appraisals that affixed the value of the speech 
materials at $90,250 and $150,000. ``Everybody was spring-loaded to 
respond. ... It truly was manufactured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, made during massive protests against the Vietnam  
War, Nixon called on the ``great silent majority'' of Americans to 
support him and dismissed the demonstrators as a noisy minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield said he helped arrange accolades to be sent after  
the speech from members of labor unions, the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, American Legion, Air Force retirees, governors and state 
Republican chairmen. ``I even went down to Dallas to Ross Perot,'' 
Butterfield said. ``He said he would bring a locomotive to Union 
Station full of mail. He failed on the locomotive, but he did 
generate a lot of mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Nixon's estate, who completed their case earlier in  
the week, have argued that if all of Nixon's materials had been 
marketed, Nixon would have earned more than $35 million. Since the 
government seized the materials, the president's estate is entitled 
to fair-market-value compensation, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Day 26 of the trial, the 72-year-old Butterfield  
testified that Nixon never indicated any plans to sell his 
materials or use them for commercial purposes. Justice Department 
attorney Neil Koslowe has said that if some money must be paid to 
compensate the Nixon estate, a fair value would be no more than 
$2.2 million plus compounded interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying in a natty navy suit, blue-striped tie and watch with  
a photo of Nixon greeting Elvis Presley, the gray-haired 
Butterfield said that early in Nixon's presidency, plans were being 
made to house these materials at a presidential library. He said 
detailed daily diaries of Nixon's activities, including ``when he 
got a haircut'' and ``when he took a nap,'' were closely held and 
that news summaries containing Nixon's scribblings were treated 
``the way we in the military treated classified material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than two decades ago, Butterfield's explosive testimony to  
the Senate Watergate Committee about the existence of a taping 
system at the White House changed the entire complexion of the 
investigation into presidential wrongdoing. From that time on, the 
investigation, triggered by a break-in at Democratic Party 
headquarters in the Watergate building. became an battle over 
access to the tapes.

<HEADLINE> Senators Argue Over Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial was  
thrust into turmoil today by House prosecutors' secret effort to 
force Monica Lewinsky to submit to questioning, prompting a White 
House attack on the maneuver from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid increased pressure from Democrats to cut short the trial,  
the senators also heard lead prosecutor Henry Hyde make an 
impassioned plea for them not to ``sell out'' for political 
expediency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the polls and hostile editorials, America is  
hungry for people who believe in something You may disagree with 
us. But we believe in something,'' Hyde said, defending the 13 
Republican prosecutors who have been assailed for pressing to call 
witnesses at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was dominated by discussion of a judge's ruling -- forced  
by Hyde -- that would require Ms. Lewinsky to be interviewed by 
Kenneth Starr's prosecutors with the House trial managers listening 
in. Ms. Lewinsky was returning to Washington this afternoon as the 
House prosecutors pressed to do the interview as soon as possible, 
a House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff, sarcasm in his voice,  
ridiculed a claim by the prosecutors that they were merely seeking 
a routine interview with a potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had gone to court  
on behalf of the House, Ruff said, ``Can you imagine what that 
little conversation is going to look like, held in the independent 
counsel's office, with the people there who have the capacity to 
put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK, to have one  
side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's 
office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity 
agreement if she doesn't fly across the country for this little 
chat? I think not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., dismissed the criticism, and  
suggestions Ms. Lewinsky would be mistreated. ``The White House 
counselors do not want to talk about the facts, the obstruction of 
justice. Just like in the house, they want to talk about the 
process, everything but the obstruction of justice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time the president tried to talk to (Oval Office  
secretary) Betty Currie, I don't think the president invited the 
independent counsel in. ... I didn't necessarily expect him to,'' 
said Hutchinson, one of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also disclosed he had made contact with the lawyer  
for presidential friend Vernon Jordan, seeking to see whether he 
would agree to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	With sentiment building among Democrats and even some  
Republicans for cutting short the trial without live witness 
testimony, one House prosecutor today offered some sympathy to the 
senators who will make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how hard that decision is,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham,  
R-S.C., said. ``It has always been hard for me. ... When you take 
the good of this nation ... reasonable people can differ on what we 
should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham made clear he believes such testimony was necessary  
to resolve conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff made a plea to look at the sentiment of the American  
public, two-thirds of whom polls suggest oppose removing Clinton 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to say it is a popularity contest. ... But surely  
the sense of the people, the will of the people, the belief of the 
people in this president's ability to govern must educate each of 
you, not mandate a result but surely guide the result that you 
reach in this proceeding,'' the White House lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said a few minutes later that ``our work here is not an  
ongoing plebiscite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My life is devoted as a lawyer ... and equal justice under the  
law is what moves me and animates and consumes me and I am willing 
to lose my seat any day of the week rather than sell out on those 
issues,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling on Ms. Lewinsky came at the request of the House  
prosecutors. They were helped by Starr's office, which supported 
the claim that the young woman's immunity agreement obliged her to 
grant an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with her testimony actually here. It has  
everything to do with the right of anyone to prepare their witness. 
It is normal practice to do this,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not yet decided whether to call witnesses at  
Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But a legal source said U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson ruled today that Ms. Lewinsky had to submit to an interview 
with Starr and his staff to assist the trial and that House 
prosecutors could attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Johnson  
ruled that House prosecutors themselves had no right under her 
immunity deal with Starr to force Ms. Lewinsky to interview with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he opposed the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an inappropriate intervention of the judiciary in the  
proceedings of the Senate,'' Kerry said. ``It is a separation of 
powers problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial faces two crucial decisions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., a senior senator, said he will  
introduce a motion to dismiss the trial, providing senators a quick 
opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the move would fail and the question of calling  
witnesses then would be considered. The House move was an attempt 
to learn what Ms. Lewinsky would say at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns Friday  
responding to some 50 written questions submitted by senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's announcement startled senators, who knew there would be a  
motion to dismiss but did not suspect it would be offered by a 
Democrat who has been no friend of the White House in the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our  
country'' and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's 
conviction and removal from office were ``not likely to develop.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Heads for D.C. Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge Saturday ordered Monica  
Lewinsky to submit to an interview sought by House prosecutors in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial or ``forfeit her 
protections'' under her immunity deal with Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr. Democrats assailed Starr for intervening in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, acting on House prosecutors' behalf, won the emergency  
order from U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who said Ms. 
Lewinsky could do the interview with House managers directly or 
request that Starr's office be present. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky flew back to Washington on Saturday as the House  
prosecutors pressed to do the interview quickly. Sources close to 
Ms. Lewinsky said they did not believe her lawyers would appeal the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers and Senate Democrats were outraged that House  
prosecutors were seeking to interview Ms. Lewinsky before the 
Senate decides whether witnesses will be called in the impeachment 
trial, and that they would not be allowed to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``No other lawyer that I know of gets to have a prosecutor  
sitting in the room with them and saying 'talk to these people or 
your immunity deal is gone and you go to jail,''' White House 
counsel Charles Ruff said during Saturday's question-and-answer 
period in the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff also suggested Starr had wrongly injected himself into the  
Senate impeachment trial and had become ``the moving force in the 
development of the truth and the facts,'' a role the Constitution 
had reserved for the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time that Starr has been accused of injecting  
himself in the impeachment drama. Starr's ethics adviser, Sam Dash, 
abruptly resigned to protest the prosecutor's decision to testify 
at House impeachment hearings late last year. Dash said Starr had 
wrongly become an advocate of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr denied those allegations. His office offered no comment  
Saturday, although House prosecutors firmly defended their request 
and Starr's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are they afraid of? Are they afraid of our talking to  
Monica Lewinsky?'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the House 
prosecutors, said. ``We're not doing anything abnormal. We are 
exercising our privileges, our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the 13 Republican House  
prosecutors, said the interview was necessary for the prosecutors 
to decide whether to submit Ms. Lewinsky's name to the Senate as a 
possible trial witness. Clinton has denied the House impeachment 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice growing out of his 
affair with the young woman and efforts to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky can resolve some of these crucial conflicts'' in  
previous testimony, McNulty said. ``This is lawyering 101 -- any 
good lawyer would talk to a witness before deciding to put her on 
the witness stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson ordered that Ms. Lewinsky ``allow herself to be  
debriefed by the House managers, to be conducted by the Office of 
Independent Counsel if she so requests, or forfeit her protections 
under the immunity agreement between Ms. Lewinsky and the OIC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview had not been scheduled as of Saturday afternoon.  
House prosecutors made clear they did not intend to allow senators 
or presidential lawyers to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority Leader Tom Daschle and three other Senate Democrats  
wrote House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde demanding that 
prosecutors stop efforts to interview Ms. Lewinsky and any other 
witness until ``the Senate has given you the authority to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle also denounced the House managers for ``their outright  
refusal to allow representatives of the Senate to be at the 
meetings'' or to get transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of secrecy, this unwillingness to cooperate with the  
Senate ... is as clear a demonstration of raw partisanship as I 
have seen to date on the Senate side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde sought Starr's help in a letter Thursday that cited Ms.  
Lewinsky's immunity agreement and said her lawyers had refused to 
make her available for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 28 immunity agreement said Ms. Lewinsky ``will testify  
truthfully before grand juries in this district and elsewhere, at 
any trials in this district and elsewhere, and in any other 
executive, military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers argued in a letter Friday to Starr that the immunity  
agreement ``does not require Ms. Lewinsky to be interviewed by the 
House Managers or any congressional body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's role in dealing with congressional witnesses with  
immunity deals is not new. In June 1995, his office sat in on an 
interview with Whitewater figure Webster Hubbell that was being 
conducted by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
At the time, Hubbell was a cooperating witness with Starr under the 
terms of a plea bargain.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh Poster Ordered Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A judge ordered the owner of a video  
store in Westminster's Little Saigon neighborhood to remove a 
wall-sized portrait of Ho Chi Minh and a Vietnamese flag that 
prompted five days of picketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the shopping center, Terra-Buchard Ltd., sought the  
court order against Truong Van Tran, complaining the display was 
disruptive to other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Barbara Tam Nomoto Schumann  
ordered Tran to take it down and set a hearing for Feb. 4 on 
whether to make her order permanent. The items were removed later 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Terra-Buchard also canceled Tran's monthly lease and gave him 30  
days to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his lease, he's prohibited from activity on the premises  
that interferes with tenants' orderly business activities,'' said 
Terra-Buchard attorney Jonathan Slipp. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California is home to about 300,000 Vietnamese  
immigrants, two-thirds of them clustered around Little Saigon. Many 
of them fled South Vietnam after it fell to the communists in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 500 demonstrators had picketed the store during five  
days of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Many likened the picture of Ho Chi Minh to posting a swastika or  
portrait of Adolf Hitler in an immigrant Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said he is not a communist but believes it is time for the  
United States to consider improving relations with Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Starts Life As Rocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen officially has started life  
without Mike. 
</P>
<P>
	And for a player whose image has been etched on the Chicago  
landscape for his entire career along with Michael Jordan, Pippen 
was anxious to begin his new career with the Houston Rockets at 
Saturday's first workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing with Michael, who was always the superstar, and coming  
to a team that has more than one superstar, that's different and 
it's a situation you want to be in,'' Pippen said, referring to new 
teammates Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets and Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton, finally waded  
through the complicated negotiating process late Friday night and 
signed Pippen to a five-year, $67.2 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having a dominant center (Olajuwon) inside is going to be a  
little different,'' Pippen said. ``It's going to be fun, it gives 
us inside scoring. Teams will come down and have to double team and 
that gives us the opportunity to spot up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, more of the attention has centered on Pippen's jump  
from the Bulls, where he had spent his 11-year pro career. He 
expects that to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that Hakeem and Charles can take some of that  
attention away from me,'' Pippen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I am just looking to fit in and get comfortable  
with the system before I look to do more. I can't see that 
happening until we develop what (coach) Rudy (Tomjanovich) wants on 
the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon liked what he saw in the first workout Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has good leadership and interacted well with everybody,''  
Olajuwon said. ``He has to feel comfortable that this is his 
system, too. The system is just there to guide you. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like he is going to college and learning a system. He  
will be able to play his game within the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skirmishes with Bulls management convinced Pippen it was time to  
move on even if Jordan had returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talking to Michael during the season and knowing that he was  
retiring, it was time for me to move on,'' Pippen said. ``It would 
have been different for me, especially for a guy used to being in 
the playoffs and contending for a title. That's why I wanted to be 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had more great times there than bad times. I just want to  
walk away from that situation with a positive attitude and realize 
that there are bigger and better things for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a seven-time NBA all-star with six championships, is  
definitely appreciated in his new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in awe of his championship rings,'' owner Les Alexander  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich didn't think the Rockets had a chance to get Pippen.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the most fortunate coach in the league,'' Tomjanovich  
said. ``Everyone in the organization feels honored that Scottie 
decided to come to the Houston Rockets. He is the most complete 
player in basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich thinks Pippen will allow the Rockets to play more up  
tempo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very athletic and we've got some young players coming  
in,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We've always tried to stress running at 
times but because of age and injuries, we haven't been an efficient 
running team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley was not present for the first workout. He was playing in  
the Bob Hope Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also signed former Utah center Antoine Carr Saturday  
as a backup for Olajuwon.

<HEADLINE> Federal Trial Wins at Gulfstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Federal Trial, given a smart ride by  
Robbie Davis, captured the $100,000 Canadian Turf Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park on Saturday for a surprising victory in his first 
stakes race. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trial took the early lead and turned back challenges  
from Deep Dive and Unite's Big Red to win by three-quarters of a 
length. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Dive stayed a neck in front of Unite's Big Red to finish  
second. Vergennes, the 9-5 favorite, was fourth in the field of 11 
older horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trial covered the 1 1/8-mile turf course in 1:47 4-5,  
returning $43.80, $19 and $12.80. Deep Dive paid $7.80 and $5.60, 
and Unite's Big Red returned $9 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trial, a lightly raced 4-year-old son of Skip Trial, has  
four wins and two seconds in six starts since finishing fourth in 
his debut last June. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory Saturday nearly doubled his earnings, from $66,190  
to $126,190.

<HEADLINE> Suns Reach Agreement With Gugliotta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns have reached a contract  
agreement with free agent forward Tom Gugliotta, The Associated 
Press learned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns did not confirm the deal but scheduled a 7 p.m., EST,  
news conference to announce the acquisition of a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, considered the best of the free agents still  
uncommitted, reportedly was en route to Phoenix on Saturday. He is 
expected to sign a six-year contract worth about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will have a clause allowing him to opt out after five  
years, when he would be eligible for a much bigger salary as a 
10-year player. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, 29, could have made more money by re-signing with the  
Minnesota Timberwolves but had said all along that he was more 
interested in finding a team and city that were the right fit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were in serious need of a power forward with  
Gugliotta's firepower after Antonio McDyess decided not to re-sign 
with Phoenix and instead signed with Denver, the team that traded 
him to the Suns 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta averaged 21 points per game last season but missed 41  
games because of foot surgery. It was the first serious injury of 
his six-year career. He played four seasons in Minnesota after the 
first two in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's agreement came the same day that the NBA approved a  
sign-and-trade agreement that sends Luc Longley to the Suns from 
Chicago. Phoenix sent the Bulls Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and 
Bubba Wells, along with a first-round draft choice. Chicago either 
will get the worst of Phoenix's two picks this year or the Suns' 
pick in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Longley reportedly signed a six-year contract worth about $32  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's agent, Richard Howell, had asked to speak with  
Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor on Saturday before making a 
decision, but it was not known whether that conversation took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta and Howell flew to Phoenix late Thursday and met with  
Suns officials into the wee hours before leaving town on Friday for 
Atlanta, where Howell lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves could have offered Gugliotta a seven-year, $86  
million contract, but team officials there had long recognized he 
was on his way out. On Friday, Minnesota reached a contract 
agreement with another power forward, Joe Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns admitted they were taking a gamble by waiting for  
Gugliotta to make his decision, because most other free agents 
already have committed to other teams in the frenzy of activity 
that followed the end of the NBA lockout on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Phoenix general manager Bryan Colangelo had identified  
a ``big three'' free agents -- Scottie Pippen, McDyess and 
Gugliotta. Denver and Detroit had expressed interest in Gugliotta 
earlier but had dropped out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers reportedly were interested in a  
sign-and-trade deal with Minnesota that would have sent Eddie 
Jones, Elden Campbell and Sam Jacobsen to the Timberwolves.

<HEADLINE> Senators Asking More Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators face a tumultuous week in  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, House prosecutors have 
touched off a new legal battle by trying to force Monica Lewinsky's 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a chain of events set in motion by lead House prosecutor  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's attorneys 
went to court Friday for an emergency order to compel Ms. Lewinsky 
to be interviewed by the House managers concerning the alleged 
coverup of her affair with Clinton. She has refused to be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starr attorneys argued that the former White House intern's  
immunity agreement requires that she cooperate with the House. U.S. 
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson did not rule immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's legal team said Senate proceedings with both  
Clinton's lawyers and House managers present are the proper forum 
for any questioning of her. It is inappropriate for her to be 
turned into ``a partisan'' who sits down with one side and not the 
other, they said, adding that Starr's office is ``acting as an 
agent for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, Starr said his office ``has its own, continuing  
duty to provide the House with information relating to 
impeachment'' and that he ``is not acting as an agent for the House 
managers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde wrote Starr's office a letter Thursday asking for  
assistance in interviewing Ms. Lewinsky on Friday, today or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike the House managers, we have chosen to respect the will  
of the Senate and abide by its unanimously adopted procedures,'' 
White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said today. ``The only 
explanation for the House managers' behavior is, in the words of 
Sen. (Dale) Bumpers, `wanting to win too badly.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate Democratic official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the Democrats oppose Hyde's request because it 
could delay the trial and was not part of a bipartisan agreement 
covering conduct of the proceedings. Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., had no immediate reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial faces two crucial decisions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a senior Senate statesman, said he  
will introduce a motion to dismiss the trial, providing senators a 
quick opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the move would fail and the question of calling  
witnesses then would be considered. The House move was an attempt 
to learn what Ms. Lewinsky would say at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns Friday  
responding to some 50 written questions submitted by senators and 
read by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's announcement startled senators, who knew there would be a  
motion to dismiss but did not suspect it would be offered by a 
Democrat who has been no friend of the White House in the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Respected for his knowledge of Senate traditions, Byrd had  
created some doubt earlier about whether he would stick with 
Clinton as other Democrats have done throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our  
country'' and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's 
conviction and removal from office were ``not likely to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he made his decision ``not because I believe that the  
president did no wrong,'' but because ``it is necessary that we 
begin now the process of healing and reconciling the differences'' 
caused by Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, suggested his own exit strategy but  
said it would only be initiated after a decision on calling 
witnesses -- and after it was certain the two-thirds majority for 
conviction would not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	His resolution would adjourn the trial with language that would  
characterize the House impeachment vote as ``the ultimate 
condemnation for the president's despicable actions,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said approval of an early vote to dismiss the trial would  
be ``cavalier treatment'' of the House's case alleging perjury and 
obstruction of justice by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what an annoyance we are in the bosom of this great  
body,'' Hyde told the Senate. ``But we are a constitutional 
annoyance, and I remind you of that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said, ``I don't know of any  
Republicans who will vote to dismiss'' and abruptly end the trial. 
Byrd's motion could lose on a party-line vote in a Senate 
controlled by Republicans, 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., called Byrd's announcement ``a  
significant move. He's highly respected on both sides of the aisle. 
The White House lawyers have raised a lot of doubts about the 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another slight crack in Republican unity, Sen. Susan Collins  
of Maine said she was having difficulty with House evidence 
presented in support of the charge that Clinton lied before a grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had not decided whether to vote against the perjury  
article but added, ``I think ... the obstruction charge is much 
stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House reacted to Byrd's proposal with cautious  
optimism. ``Senator Byrd's statement speaks for itself. Our 
position has been clear. We believe in a fair, bipartisan and 
expeditious resolution of this whole matter,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the questions Friday dealt with key issues still in  
conflict. They included whether Clinton tried to coach Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; 
whether a job search for the former intern was an attempt to buy 
her silence about the affair; and whether the search was related to 
Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the witness list in Paula Jones' 
sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.

<HEADLINE> Atheist's Bible Sells for $2,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PFLUGERVILLE, Texas (AP) -- The personal belongings of the  
nation's most prominent atheist went up for sale on Saturday, 
bringing $10 for a penny with ``In God We Trust'' crossed out and 
$2,000 for a Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service seized Madalyn Murray O'Hair's  
belongings to pay back taxes and creditor fees after she 
disappeared in September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair helped knock out organized prayer from public  
schools in a 1963 Supreme Court case and founded several atheist 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The penny was no shock -- she often crossed out words relating to  
God from her coins and bills -- but the Bible surprised several 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some irony in that Bible,'' Austin lawyer Jimmy  
Nassour said. Mrs. O'Hair received it from a group of Oklahoma 
schoolgirls in 1968. ``I was willing to go up to $500, but I got 
caught up in the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nassour said he may sell it to a museum.  
</P>
<P>
	An earlier attempt to hock her belongings ended in March 1997  
when a last-minute federal bankruptcy petition was filed on behalf 
of Mrs. O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter Robin 
Murray-O'Hair, all of whom were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bulk of Mrs. O'Hair's belongings sold hand over fist  
in the auction, her most personal items -- her diaries, birth 
certificate and photographs -- remain tucked away in a safe deposit 
box in a downtown Austin bank. 
</P>
<P>
	They are to be sold separately. It was not known how much was  
raised by the auction.

<HEADLINE> NHL All-Star Game Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, FLA. (AP) -- The NHL All-Star break was a good time to  
recall one of the greatest collection of all-stars on one team -- 
the Edmonton Oilers of the 1980s and 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Bourque vividly remembered a star-studded Oilers team that  
beat his Boston Bruins twice in the Stanley Cup finals, in 1988 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were probably the most explosive team that was put  
together,'' said Bourque, alluding to such players as Wayne 
Gretzky, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri and Paul Coffey. ``They had two 
lines that kept coming at you in waves, and made it tough on you. 
The more room you gave them and the more respect you gave them, the 
more they would chew you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurri, currently a broadcaster in Finland, was in Tampa for  
Sunday's All-Star game at the Ice Palace. He remembered when they 
started to break up that great Oilers team that won five Cups in 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sad when we started going our different ways, because  
we could have stayed together another 10 years,'' Kurri said. ``We 
could have had some fun, won more Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I guess later on, we realized that hockey was a  
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the Oilers started with a group of young core players  
who stayed together for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were like brothers at a young age, growing up together,''  
Kurri said. ``(The coaches) gave us the green light: play the game, 
have fun. Don't worry about mistakes, or worry about being sent 
down to the minors. They planned to keep those guys together and 
win the Cup in five years, and that's what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	REPORTING THE TRUTH: For Wayne Gretzky, hockey has been good.  
But he thinks sports writers have a good deal, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the media Saturday at the NHL All-Star Weekend,  
Gretzky talked about the enjoyment of playing ``the greatest sport 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing better than that is to be a writer and follow  
us,'' said Gretzky, eliciting laughter from the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WATCHING WAYNE: Boston Bruins defenseman Ray Bourque appreciates  
watching other athletes in his sport. Especially Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne sees the ice like nobody else,'' Bourque said. ``He's  
got eyes in the back of his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bourque said when he's on the bench, he will watch Gretzky like  
any other fan. Except that he has a better view. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to watch him from that close,'' Bourque said. ``You  
pick up things that are subtle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bourque will start for the North America team in Sunday's NHL  
All-Star Game at the Ice Palace. He is appearing in his 17th 
All-Star Game and will be starting for a record 12th time. Gretzky 
is making his 18th All-Star appearance. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SHARING THE WEALTH: The World Team at this year's All-Star Game  
features players from eight countries. Russia, the Czech Republic 
and Sweden have the most representation with five apiece. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPEAKING CRISPLY: The first coach in Tampa Bay Lightning  
history, Terry Crisp, wouldn't mind getting involved in building 
another expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of fun doing it,'' said Crisp, who participated in  
the Heroes of Hockey activities for the NHL's All-Star Weekend. 
``To be involved in hockey, some form of making decisions is my 
first love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp had a 142-204-45 record over five-plus seasons with the  
Lightning before his dismissal Nov. 12, 1997. He is currently a 
television analyst for the Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ESPOSITO SHAPING UP: Despite being firing by the Tampa Bay  
Lightning, Phil Esposito is in good shape -- and not only because he 
has found success working on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer who was the Lightning's general manager, has  
lost 20 pounds since being fired Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enjoying it,'' Esposito said of his TV work.  
</P>
<P>
	The change has been especially good in one regard -- Esposito  
finds less stress working as a Fox studio analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little stress, pressure and everything else,'' he  
said. ``I'll never say never about anything anymore, but it would 
have to be the right situation for me to leave TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NET RESULTS: With scoring down this season, goaltenders seem to  
be having more fun in the NHL. That won't necessarily be true in 
Sunday's All-Star Game, usually a high-scoring contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get the spotlight 82 games anyway,'' Phoenix forward  
Keith Tkachuk said. ``It's nice for the forwards to get the 
spotlight.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROCKET TAKES OFF: The NHL honored one of its greats with an  
announcement Saturday night of a Maurice Richard Trophy. The award 
will be presented at the end of each season to the league's top 
goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocket Richard played for 18 seasons with the Montreal Canadiens  
and was the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in a 
season and the first to score 500 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'll play hockey again,'' said the 79-year-old  
Hall of Famer. ``But maybe I'll be refereeing an old-timers' game 
in a year or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HOCKEY'S GREATEST FIGHT: With John Cullen in attendance, the NHL  
announced that more than $900,000 has been raised by the league and 
associated organizations for cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	It is all part of a ``Hockey Fights Cancer'' campaign initiated  
by the NHL to raise money to battle the disease. League awareness 
became more intensified during Cullen's recent fight against the 
life-threatening disease, as well as that of referee Paul Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always something positive that comes out of something  
negative,'' Cullen said. ``This is a pretty big positive. I would 
go through another treatment for bone marrow cancer if we could 
raise another million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to be a part of that (raising funds), cancer wasn't so  
bad.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highlights from President Clinton's  
impeachment trial on Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
	--U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that Monica  
Lewinsky must submit to an interview requested by House prosecutors 
or risk losing the immunity from prosecution she had gained from 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	--House prosecutors' secretive effort to force Ms. Lewinsky's  
cooperation -- and the involvement of Starr -- dominated the debate 
at the impeachment trial as senators spent a second day submitting 
written questions to both legal teams. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Majority Leader Trent Lott, seizing on a comment made by a  
White House lawyer during the day, announced that Senate 
Republicans would submit written questions to Clinton as early as 
Monday. ``We'd like to see what the president has to say about some 
of the inconsistencies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Republican Senate official claimed ``remarkable unity'' among  
the GOP rank and file against a Democratic bid to dismiss charges, 
expected as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	--Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, gave an impassioned defense of  
prosecutors. ``There are issues of transcendent importance that you 
have to be willing to lose your office over,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	--White House Counsel Charles Ruff assailed House prosecutors for  
seeking to interview Ms. Lewinsky without Senate permission and 
accused Starr of exceeding his authority by intervening in the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ms. Lewinsky flew back to Washington from California in  
anticipation of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	--House prosecutors defended their efforts to interview the  
former intern, saying it was necessary before they decided whether 
to submit her name to the Senate as a potential witness. ``What are 
they afraid of?'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., asked of the 
president's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sent a letter to Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist requesting him to dismiss the order from Judge 
Johnson compelling Lewinsky to be debriefed by House managers, 
citing the Senate's ``sole power'' to try impeachments.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Chief Heyman To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After four years at the head of the  
Smithsonian Institution, Secretary I. Michael Heyman is expected to 
announce Monday that he will retire at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyman had been asked to stay beyond the regular five-year term  
but he told the Smithsonian's 17-member Board of Regents that he 
wants to return to California, said officials speaking on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyman has had his share of criticism during his tenure.  
</P>
<P>
	He took the post in the midst of a controversy over an exhibit  
at the Air and Space Museum on the dropping of the atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima. Some historians and veterans' groups complained that the 
exhibit was too sympathetic to the Japanese. When he had the show 
revised, other critics found it not sympathetic enough. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago the Smithsonian dropped an outside sponsor of a  
lecture series, the New Israel Fund, after a congressman complained 
that the promised contribution of $20,000 by the organization, 
which promotes conciliation between Arabs and Jews, could be seen 
as criticism of the Israeli government's security policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer and city planner, Heyman spent the 1980s as chancellor  
at the University of California, Berkeley. He took his present job 
in 1994 after serving as counselor to Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Smithsonian will break ground for the new Museum  
of the American Indian, to open in 2003. The institution comprises 
16 museums and the National Zoo, all of which are in Washington and 
charge no admission fee, except for the National Design Museum in 
New York, known as the Cooper-Hewitt. The Museum of the American 
Indian has a branch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	They are projected to spend $569.7 million in the fiscal year  
that ends Sept. 30 -- up from $458 million when Heyman took over in 
1994. Last year the Smithsonian museums had 31.5 million visitors, 
including 3 million at the zoo. Only a small portion of its 140 
million objects and specimens -- 122 million of them in the National 
Museum of Natural History -- are on view at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	For its 150th anniversary in 1996, the Smithsonian sent a  
special exhibit, 300 of its treasures called ``America's 
Smithsonian,'' to visits by 3 million people around the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Impeachment Trial-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Saturday's impeachment trial against President  
Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``We have stressed ... the rule of law and its importance to our  
society, not only to serve the public and social interests. But you 
are the guardian. When in fact there are crimes against the state, 
who is there to serve the public interest, especially if in fact it 
is the president, the vice president, a judicial officer or other 
civil officers?'' -- Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., House prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The law loves repentance. Baptists love repentance. I'm a  
Baptist. In my church everybody gets saved about every other week. 
The idea that if you'll come forward, and you admit you're wrong, 
should get a different result is loved in the law.'' -- Rep. Lindsey 
Graham, R-S.C., House prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not it's a crime, ladies and gentleman of the  
Senate, it can be a high crime and you then have to decide the 
impact on society, but if you leave us confused about whether or 
not this is a crime ..., the impact on society is far greater than 
if you make the decision of `it's a crime, but proportionately is 
not what the death penalty would call for.' It would not be a 
political death penalty case.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The need for witnesses is so basic and fundamental to our  
truth-seeking system of justice in this country that words fail me 
in making the case that we should call witnesses and that you 
should permit it in this proceeding.'' -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, 
R-Ark., House prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard little hints about how Vernon Jordan might be a liar  
because of what he said about Dec. 11. And all of a sudden, just 
five minutes ago, this body heard for the first time, he's not only 
maybe a liar about the job search, but he's maybe a liar about 
destroying evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Words fail me.'' -- Charles Ruff, White House counsel.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not arguing with the managers about the law. We're not  
arguing with the managers about the disparity. We're talking about 
prosecutorial practices.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I would suggest to you that you have to actually have findings  
of fact; that the Senate has findings of fact, that the president, 
in fact he lied, or he did not lie, or he committed an obstruction 
that you actually have findings of fact, and then you can move 
beyond to the questions of application of the law.'' -- Buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you as a United States attorney, serving under two  
presidents, that I would prosecute these cases, because I did 
prosecute such cases.'' -- Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., House prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What brings us here today is the belief by the House of  
Representatives, in lawful public vote, that this president 
violated in numerous respects his oath of office and the criminal 
code of the United States of America. In particular, that he 
committed perjury and obstruction of justice.'' -- Barr. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Every piece of this puzzle when put together demonstrates a  
very clear pattern of obstructing justice; not to cover up a 
personal embarrassment, not to cover up an indiscretion, but to 
destroy Paula Jones' right under the sexual harassment laws of this 
country to have her day in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that is the ultimate question that this body is going to  
have to address.'' -- Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.

	``The White House, the president, the president's agents, the  
president's spokespersons, no one has ever trashed, threatened, 
maligned or done anything else to Monica Lewinsky. No one.'' Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We take, I think, as a basic understanding in our  
jurisprudence that as a matter of law the settlement of case is not 
probative of any belief on either side about the strengths or 
weaknesses.'' -- Ruff.

<HEADLINE> IOC Meets About Bribery Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The credibility and future of the  
IOC was at stake today as Olympic leaders began considering whether 
to expel members accused in the biggest corruption scandal in the 
games' history. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rapidly growing crisis spread to the 2000 Sydney  
Olympics, a special IOC panel met under tight security to conclude 
its investigation into bribery allegations surrounding Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Australia's top IOC official said he saw nothing  
``sinister'' in the $70,000 inducements offered by Australia's 
Olympics chief to two African delegates the night before Sydney won 
the vote for the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the facts I have, I have no reason to believe that was  
bribery,'' executive board member Kevan Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper said the IOC will discuss the Australian payments on  
Sunday and could order a full-scale investigation of Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement released in the evening, the IOC said it  
was in the ``final stages'' of its Salt Lake City inquiry. The 
six-member panel was to work late into the night to complete its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members were implicated in the Salt Lake scandal over  
cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and other favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members resigned this week, and IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said as many as seven others face the possibility of 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day,'' said Jacques Rogge, a Belgian member of  
the inquiry panel. ``But we will do what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are cases among them that are just unacceptable, brutal  
corruption, when simply money was asked for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-man commission will report its findings and  
recommendations to the executive board Sunday. The board will then 
propose expulsions and announce plans for overhauling the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who headed the internal  
investigation, declined to comment today as he headed into the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In extraordinary scenes, barricades were set up outside the IOC  
headquarters on the shores of Lake Geneva. Police and security 
guards kept a close watch on the scores of journalists gathered in 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials avoided the media crush by driving into the  
underground parking lot and entering the building through a private 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamine Keita, the IOC member from Mali who is among the 13  
delegates implicated, arrived in midmorning to appear before the 
panel to defend himself in person. Others appeared throughout the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news briefing early this afternoon, Gosper -- who is not on  
the inquiry panel -- said the commission would continue working 
throughout the day. He said there had been no further resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing ``due process reasons,'' Gosper declined to reveal the  
names of any of the IOC members who appeared to defend themselves. 
He said the executive board Sunday would propose ``appropriate 
action against any members who have clearly violated the rules of 
the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The International Olympic Committee will not tolerate  
improprieties of any kind,'' Gosper said. ``The IOC will act very 
decisively to ensure that all of our members strictly adhere to the 
IOC rules and to the oath they all swore to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fairly difficult times for the IOC,'' he said. ``I  
can assure you we will emerge stronger as a result of this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC was shaken Friday by revelations that Sydney bidders  
made $70,000 inducements for two African votes the night before 
they won the Summer Games for 2000 -- by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates released  
documents showing annual $5,000 payments to Olympic committees in 
Kenya and Uganda from 1994 through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the payments were offered to get votes from Kenya's  
Charles Mukora and Uganda's Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso the night 
before the IOC ballot in Monte Carlo on Sept. 22, 1993. The offer 
was contingent on Sydney winning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates told the 
Sydney Morning Herald. ``My view was it might encourage them to 
consider their votes for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney beat Beijing 45-43 in the secret balloting.  
</P>
<P>
	Gosper on Friday described the reported offer as going ``beyond  
goodwill'' and said, ``I can't rule it out that some may call for 
the games not to proceed in Sydney. I could see the published 
material being viewed as questionable conduct by the candidate 
city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper, in a clear damage control exercise, attempted to put  
a more positive spin on the case today. He said he was now 
``comfortable'' with the payments after speaking with Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information has now been clarified,'' he said. ``While it  
has added a new dimension (to the scandal), I don't think there's 
anything sinister about that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coates said he pledged the money to African officials  
because he thought Sydney's chances were ``slipping away.'' He said 
the payments were within IOC guidelines and were similar to plans 
used by bidding competitors from Beijing and Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said Coates was doing all he could up until the last  
minute to secure votes. He said the inducements stemmed from a 
legitimate assistance program for African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unusual in any bid process for encouragements,  
incentives, to be part of the bid as long as they are out in the 
open,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper reiterated he will propose that the executive board  
reaffirm that the games will go ahead in Sydney and Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the executive board may still decide to order an inquiry  
into the Sydney bid. If so, Gosper said the panel should be 
different from the one that looked into the Salt Lake scandal and 
should not be limited to executive board members. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite mounting calls from outside the IOC for Samaranch to  
resign over the widening scandals, Gosper said the president 
retains the full confidence of the executive board and general 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever we need a good president, an experienced president, we  
need him now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New York To Probe NYC School System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The governor has appointed a special commission  
to investigate allegations of massive waste in the construction of 
school buildings and the inflating of student attendance to win 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we are challenging the status quo in New York City,''  
Gov. George Pataki said Saturday in announcing the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	New York taxpayers commit more than $4 billion a year to the  
largest school system in the nation, ``only to see reading scores 
drop in every city school district but one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to ask some hard questions,'' Pataki told The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and Board of Education President  
William Thompson, Jr. said Pataki had other motives for creating 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is ``an overt diversionary tactic as he begins  
his pitch for national office,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $200 million was wasted over several years to cover  
design errors or omissions, Pataki said. Estimated construction 
costs of $40,000 per student in 1996-1997 is triple the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the renovation of Erasmus Hall High School in  
Brooklyn, the city's oldest, was to be finished in 1995 at a cost 
of $22 million. Still ongoing, costs have escalated to more than 
$100 million while students occasionally eat in the cafeteria under 
umbrellas because the roof leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, there are allegations that school bureaucrats have  
inflated student attendance to increase state funding. 
</P>
<P>
	At Brandeis High School in Manhattan, ghost students were  
allegedly ``enrolled'' in phantom classes, including a gym class 
held in a guidance counselor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that in principle, ``I  
think investigations are good things, they gather facts. ... What 
I'm trying to figure out is, where does this go, what's the vision 
for reform?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The School Construction Authority, created in the 1980s to  
improve how city schools are built, has delivered all its projects 
on time in recent years, Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew said an antiquated school transfer policy was responsible  
for the alleged ghost students. And his office had already asked 
the construction authority for an accounting of $100 million in 
taxpayer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But the governor insisted something was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``The system has investigated itself time and again,'' he said.  
``I don't think we're in a position that we can justify spending 
billions and billions and not know why the system is so 
inefficient.''

her desire to add another gold statue to her collection -- this time 
for her role in ``Stepmom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Sarandon -- who won a best-actress Academy Award for her

the perfect place for it in the home she shares with longtime love, 
actor-director Tim Robbins.

the Oscar nominations are announced Feb. 9.

<HEADLINE> Markey Chides Intel Over New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressman wants Intel Corp. to reconsider  
plans to give its upcoming Pentium III computer processor the 
ability to transmit across the Internet unique numbers to help 
identify consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that he understood the  
technology's implications for online commerce, where the anonymity 
of the Internet can encourage fraud. But he worried it also will 
help online marketers surreptitiously track consumers on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in  
a way that compromises personal privacy,'' Markey wrote Friday in a 
letter to Intel Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey, the senior Democrat on the House consumer protection  
subcommittee, urged Intel ``to better balance both commercial and 
privacy objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said Markey ``clearly is  
missing some information here.'' He said the company will contact 
the congressman's staff ``to make sure they understand the entire 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel announced its technology earlier this week at a security  
conference in San Jose, Calif. Its new Pentium III chip, to be sold 
early this year, will by default transmit its unique serial number 
internally and across the Internet to help verify the identity of 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can turn the feature off, but it turns itself back on  
each time the computer is restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the technology is needed to encourage trust in online  
sales and also can be used to prevent piracy by preventing a single 
copy of a software program from being installed on several 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	To mollify privacy advocates, Intel said it will not maintain a  
master database of consumer names matched to Pentium serial 
numbers. Intel also encouraged Web sites and software programmers 
to warn consumers whenever the serial number is retrieved. It 
predicted the first such Internet pages and software will appear 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flip side of the coin for security is privacy,'' Mulloy  
said. ``We acknowledge there are certain risks associated with that 
serial number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil libertarians still found fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``The potential harm that this plan could do to privacy is  
pretty large,'' said Stanton McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, a civil liberties group in San Francisco. ``It's just 
unfathomable they would come up with such an insecure system, 
especially given the vast majority of users who are extremely 
concerned about online privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over Intel's new technology occurs as Congress  
considers whether to propose new federal privacy laws for the 
Internet. The Federal Trade Commission, which chided the online 
industry for its failure to protect privacy rights, successfully 
pressed last year for a law to prohibit Web sites from collecting 
personal information on children without their parents' permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore last summer called privacy ``a basic  
American value, in the information age and in every age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William McKiernan, the chairman of Beyond.Com and Cybersource  
Corp., said electronic commerce sites on the Internet clearly need 
better protection from fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	When McKiernan's company first went online selling software in  
1994, he lost more sales to credit-card fraud in one week than he 
sold legitimately. The site now verifies a consumer's identity 
using a technique that he licenses to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But McKiernan said the conflict is only beginning between the  
needs for privacy and for positively identifying customers online.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Impeachment Trial-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Saturday's impeachment trial against President  
Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``Without review, either by the presiding judge or the grand  
jury, a referral was sent to the House that was a one-sided, 
unfair, prosecutorial summary. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the House managers speak of the need for discovery, they  
have no such need. Everything prejudicial that could be found 
through an unlimited budget and a seemingly endless investigation 
has been found and put there. Tied up with a red ribbon for them.'' 
-- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He (the president) tried to navigate his way through a mine  
field without violating the law, and he believes that he did. There 
is no statement in that testimony, in the grand jury, that 
reaffirms, ratifies and confirms all of his testimony in the Jones 
deposition.'' -- Greg Craig, White House special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little bit disappointed in the inference of the argument  
that those of us who oppose impeachment for the reasons that you 
understand somehow are sending a message to kids that it's okay not 
to tell the truth. I'm a little bit disappointed in that argument. 
Because I don't think that's the way the parents of this country 
feel. That's certainly not the way I feel. And I don't believe that 
impeachment is a question of what you tell your children about 
truth-telling. Of course you tell your children to tell the 
truth.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``And the rule of law ... is neither a sword nor a shield,  
depending on your perspective. We're all subject to it, and we live 
with its outcome if it is fair and is consistent with the system of 
justice that we've developed in the last 210 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so, the verdict here, if it is not guilty, as I trust it  
will be, or if this trial is ended appropriately through some other 
legal motion or mechanism, as long as it's done within the rule of 
law, will have met all of our obligations. And most importantly, it 
will have ensured that the president is treated neither above nor 
below the law.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has said, and I've said on his behalf, that he  
will not use his powers, or ask anyone else to use their powers, to 
protect him against the application of the rule of law.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps there has been some extraordinary transposition from  
the mood and the tenor of the comments made during those days when 
the Judiciary Committee was doing its work to the days when these 
managers have appeared in the well of the Senate, something that 
has transformed the mere probable cause screening finding that they 
allegedly viewed as the role of the House and of the Judiciary 
Committee into the certainty that you hear today.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, Mr. Manager Hutchinson used a word, a phrase I'd like to  
call your attention to. Repeatedly, as he was summarizing the 
evidence, he used the phrase in essence. Now that's another phrase 
that's kind of a weasel word. When you hear that, it means that the 
evidence isn't really quite there, but if you look at the big 
picture maybe you can see what's there in essence. It doesn't work 
here. It doesn't work because of the evidence. Just a week ago Mr. 
Manager Hutchinson, on this obstruction of justice question, was 
asked very clearly: `On the case that you have against the 
president on obstruction of justice, not the perjury, would you be 
confident of a conviction in a criminal court?''' -- Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Constitution should be your guide. And I would suggest to  
you that there is nothing in the Constitution which establishes a 
different standard for the president, for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not something in the Constitution that says he is  
subject to a different standard because he is elected.'' -- Rep. 
Charles Canady, R-Fla., House manager. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Harkin, it's difficult for me to  
explain how after you've gotten 19 interviews, two grand jury 
appearances, one deposition, to cover, to cover that precise 
territory, that any further kind of inquiry along those lines would 
be of any help.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The House managers have argued that they need to call  
witnesses for the purposes of resolving inconsistencies, conflicts 
and discrepancies in testimony. And they have, in fact, identified 
Monica Lewinsky, in particular, as having given testimony in 
conflict with the testimony of the president, with Betty Currie and 
Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would be well to remember that the lawyers for the  
office of independent counsel, certainly not seeking to elicit 
testimony that's favorable to the president, that those lawyers 
have already done a great deal of this precise kind of inquiry at 
some great length. Those lawyers, no friends of the president, have 
already explored inconsistencies, they've already tested memories, 
they've already laboriously and at great length subjected these 
witnesses to searching scrutiny. And their work is available for 
all to see in the record of this case before the Senate today.'' -- 
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not afraid of witnesses. But we do want fairness. And we  
don't think it's fair in this process -- if you're going to have a 
real trial, then we want a real defense. And to have a real 
defense, requires real discovery, and real opportunity to have 
access to documents, and witnesses, and evidence that has been in 
the custody and the control of the House of Representatives, that 
has not been made available to us.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I would simply submit that within the bounds of ethical  
behavior I'm sure, because I respect the professionalism of the 
House managers, but I would suspect that one of the reasons they 
want to inquire of Ms. Lewinsky is not to resolve discrepancies and 
disputes. It is to perhaps, challenge her testimony when it's 
helpful to the president, and perhaps bolster her testimony when 
it's not helpful to the president.'' -- Craig.

<HEADLINE>  Senators Argue Over Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial was  
thrust into turmoil today by House prosecutors' secret effort to 
force Monica Lewinsky to submit to questioning, prompting a White 
House attack on the maneuver from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid increased pressure from Democrats to cut short the trial,  
the senators also heard lead prosecutor Henry Hyde make an 
impassioned plea for them not to ``sell out'' for political 
expediency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the polls and hostile editorials, America is  
hungry for people who believe in something You may disagree with 
us. But we believe in something,'' Hyde said, defending the 13 
Republican prosecutors who have been assailed for pressing to call 
witnesses at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was dominated by discussion of a judge's ruling -- forced  
by Hyde -- that would require Ms. Lewinsky to be interviewed by 
Kenneth Starr's prosecutors with the House trial managers listening 
in. Ms. Lewinsky was returning to Washington this afternoon as the 
House prosecutors pressed to do the interview as soon as possible, 
a House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff, sarcasm in his voice,  
ridiculed a claim by the prosecutors that they were merely seeking 
a routine interview with a potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had gone to court  
on behalf of the House, Ruff said, ``Can you imagine what that 
little conversation is going to look like, held in the independent 
counsel's office, with the people there who have the capacity to 
put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK, to have one  
side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's 
office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity 
agreement if she doesn't fly across the country for this little 
chat? I think not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., dismissed the criticism, and  
suggestions Ms. Lewinsky would be mistreated. ``The White House 
counselors do not want to talk about the facts, the obstruction of 
justice. Just like in the house, they want to talk about the 
process, everything but the obstruction of justice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time the president tried to talk to (Oval Office  
secretary) Betty Currie, I don't think the president invited the 
independent counsel in. ... I didn't necessarily expect him to,'' 
said Hutchinson, one of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also disclosed he had made contact with the lawyer  
for presidential friend Vernon Jordan, seeking to see whether he 
would agree to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	With sentiment building among Democrats and even some  
Republicans for cutting short the trial without live witness 
testimony, one House prosecutor today offered some sympathy to the 
senators who will make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how hard that decision is,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham,  
R-S.C., said. ``It has always been hard for me. ... When you take 
the good of this nation ... reasonable people can differ on what we 
should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham made clear he believes such testimony was necessary  
to resolve conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff made a plea to look at the sentiment of the American  
public, two-thirds of whom polls suggest oppose removing Clinton 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to say it is a popularity contest. ... But surely  
the sense of the people, the will of the people, the belief of the 
people in this president's ability to govern must educate each of 
you, not mandate a result but surely guide the result that you 
reach in this proceeding,'' the White House lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said a few minutes later that ``our work here is not an  
ongoing plebiscite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My life is devoted as a lawyer ... and equal justice under the  
law is what moves me and animates and consumes me and I am willing 
to lose my seat any day of the week rather than sell out on those 
issues,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling on Ms. Lewinsky came at the request of the House  
prosecutors. They were helped by Starr's office, which supported 
the claim that the young woman's immunity agreement obliged her to 
grant an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with her testimony actually here. It has  
everything to do with the right of anyone to prepare their witness. 
It is normal practice to do this,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not yet decided whether to call witnesses at  
Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But a legal source said U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson ruled today that Ms. Lewinsky had to submit to an interview 
with Starr and his staff to assist the trial and that House 
prosecutors could attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Johnson  
ruled that House prosecutors themselves had no right under her 
immunity deal with Starr to force Ms. Lewinsky to interview with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he opposed the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an inappropriate intervention of the judiciary in the  
proceedings of the Senate,'' Kerry said. ``It is a separation of 
powers problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial faces two crucial decisions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., a senior senator, said he will  
introduce a motion to dismiss the trial, providing senators a quick 
opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the move would fail and the question of calling  
witnesses then would be considered. The House move was an attempt 
to learn what Ms. Lewinsky would say at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns Friday  
responding to some 50 written questions submitted by senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's announcement startled senators, who knew there would be a  
motion to dismiss but did not suspect it would be offered by a 
Democrat who has been no friend of the White House in the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our  
country'' and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's 
conviction and removal from office were ``not likely to develop.''

counselors do not want to talk about the facts, the obstruction of 
justice. Just like in the house, they want to talk about the 
process, everything but the obstruction of justice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time the president tried to talk to (Oval Office  
secretary) Betty Currie, I don't think the president invited the 
independent counsel in. ... I didn't necessarily expect him to,'' 
said Hutchinson, one of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also disclosed he had made contact with the lawyer  
for presidential friend Vernon Jordan, seeking to see whether he 
would agree to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	With sentiment building among Democrats and even some  
Republicans for cutting short the trial without live witness 
testimony, one House prosecutor today offered some sympathy to the 
senators who will make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how hard that decision is,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham,  
R-S.C., said. ``It has always been hard for me. ... When you take 
the good of this nation ... reasonable people can differ on what we 
should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham made clear he believes such testimony was necessary  
to resolve conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff made a plea to look at the sentiment of the American  
public, two-thirds of whom polls suggest oppose removing Clinton 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to say it is a popularity contest. ... But surely  
the sense of the people, the will of the people, the belief of the 
people in this president's ability to govern must educate each of 
you, not mandate a result but surely guide the result that you 
reach in this proceeding,'' the White House lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said a few minutes later that ``our work here is not an  
ongoing plebiscite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My life is devoted as a lawyer ... and equal justice under the  
law is what moves me and animates and consumes me and I am willing 
to lose my seat any day of the week rather than sell out on those 
issues,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling on Ms. Lewinsky came at the request of the House  
prosecutors. They were helped by Starr's office, which supported 
the claim that the young woman's immunity agreement obliged her to 
grant an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with her testimony actually here. It has  
everything to do with the right of anyone to prepare their witness. 
It is normal practice to do this,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not yet decided whether to call witnesses at  
Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But a legal source said U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson ruled today that Ms. Lewinsky had to submit to an interview 
with Starr and his staff to assist the trial and that House 
prosecutors could attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Johnson  
ruled that House prosecutors themselves had no right under her 
immunity deal with Starr to force Ms. Lewinsky to interview with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he opposed the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an inappropriate intervention of the judiciary in the  
proceedings of the Senate,'' Kerry said. ``It is a separation of 
powers problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial faces two crucial decisions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., a senior senator, said he will  
introduce a motion to dismiss the trial, providing senators a quick 
opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the move would fail and the question of calling  
witnesses then would be considered. The House move was an attempt 
to learn what Ms. Lewinsky would say at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns Friday  
responding to some 50 written questions submitted by senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's announcement startled senators, who knew there would be a  
motion to dismiss but did not suspect it would be offered by a 
Democrat who has been no friend of the White House in the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our  
country'' and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's 
conviction and removal from office were ``not likely to develop.''

<HEADLINE> Cavagnoud Wins World Cup Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) -- Regine Cavagnoud of France, the  
new star on the women's ski tour, mastered a bumpy and icy World 
Cup super-G course Saturday to crush her nearest rival by a 
whopping 1.03 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never had so much fun,'' the 28-year-old Cavagnoud  
said. ``I dominated the course completely and had the most amazing 
sensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A late-bloomer, Cavagnoud burst onto the ski scene Thursday when  
she clinched the downhill here, her first victory after eight years 
on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished third the next day in the first of consecutive  
super-Gs here, then blew away her competitors Saturday, posting a 
time of 1 minute, 20.25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is crazy,'' Cavagnoud said. ``I can't believe I am so far  
ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Sylviane Berthod, 21, claimed her first career  
podium, finishing second in 1:21.2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been working so hard to try to make the podium,'' the  
Swiss rookie said. ``But I never expected it would happen so 
soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Michaela Dorfmeister repeated the third place she  
scored a week ago in a super-G at St. Anton, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really happy with how I skied because the course was  
extremely demanding,'' Dorfmeister said. ``This is my third podium 
in a week and it gives me a lot of confidence for the worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpine World Ski Championships begin Jan. 31 at Vail, Colo.  
</P>
<P>
	The winner of Friday's super-G, Austrian Renate Goetschl,  
finished a distant 19th on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, the World Cup downhill leader, won consecutive  
downhills in Lake Louise, Alberta, in November. But she hadn't 
triumphed in super-G since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria continued to struggle after  
winning five races at the start of the season. She finished 18th in 
Thursday's downhill, sixth in Friday's super-G and then 13th 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course was really difficult and my skis slid a lot on the  
ice,'' Meissnitzer said. ``It is amazing Cavagnoud was so fast. I 
don't know how she did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer's last victory was Dec. 19 in a downhill at  
Veysonnaz, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	She maintains a comfortable 255-point lead over Germany's Hilde  
Gerg in the overall World Cup standings, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Isolde Kostner of Italy, who has claimed four of her five career  
victories in Cortina and was a big favorite, failed to make a tight 
corner and missed a gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Melanie Turgeon, 22, scored one of her best results  
Saturday, finishing sixth in 1:22.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety, 27, of Anchorage, Alaska, also had a good day,  
placing ninth in 1:22.48, and three of her teammates also scored 
points with finishes in the top 30. Caroline Lalive of Steamboat 
Springs, Colo., was 23rd, Kate Monahan of Aspen, Colo., was 25th 
and Jonna Mendes of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was 29th. 
</P>
<P>
	A giant slalom is scheduled Sunday, the last women's race prior  
to the world championships.

<HEADLINE> Knauss Leads Austria Downhill Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- Hans Knauss led an Austrian sweep of  
the podium Saturday on their very own Streif -- the most dangerous 
and prestigious course in the world -- for his first career World 
Cup downhill victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a spectacular display of aggression, the 27-year-old Austrian  
tamed the wild, fearsome Streif, the same course which ended 
teammate Patrick Ortlieb's career on Thursday, in 1 minute, 54.18 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This victory on the Streif has the same value as a world  
championship title,'' Knauss said. ``It's a childhood dream come 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Knauss's first World Cup victory this season and fifth of  
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knees were shaking at the start, I was so nervous,'' Knauss  
admitted. ``But I guess that's what I need in order to perform 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I can tell you I was even more nervous in the finish area  
waiting for the others to come down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most distressing moment came when teammate Peter Rzehak,  
starting 23rd, blitzed down to finish second, just .15 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoving out of the start hut when most believed the podium was  
already decided, Rzehak posted the fastest intermediate time, as 
Knauss watched anxiously from the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please pray for me that I stay first,'' Knauss pleaded to  
coaches through a walkie-talkie as Rzehak came down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rzehak, who was injured in the 1996 world championships in  
Sierra Nevada, Spain, and missed the last two seasons on the World 
Cup circuit, covered the steep, icy Streif in 1:54.33. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be on the podium in Kitzbuehel is a dream of a lifetime for  
every Austrian,'' said Rzehak, who lives just an hour away from the 
resort. ``I didn't feel I was going particularly fast, but on the 
last jump I started to hear the crowd shouting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was over, I looked at the board and saw I was second  
and I couldn't believe it,'' Rzehak said. ``It was only the noise 
of the crowd that confirmed it and I knew it was true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forced to requalify for World Cup competition after his two-year  
absence, Rzehak successfully regained his place on the Austrian 
team with a third place in the Europacup downhill standings last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rzehak's fall in Sierra Nevada was only the most recent in a  
long string of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he crashed out on the Streif and was sidelined with a  
pulled groin muscle for the rest of the season. A year later, his 
season was again cut short when he tore knee ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This second place makes up for all my injuries,'' Rzehak said.  
``This course once took a lot away from me but it has just given me 
back even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Werner Franz crossed third in 1:54.35.  
</P>
<P>
	Still seeking his first World Cup victory, and runner-up in both  
downhills in Kitzbuehel two years ago, Franz was nevertheless 
content with his third place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still good to be in the top three, especially here,''  
Franz said. ``My shape is getting better and better. Watch out for 
me in Vail,'' where the world championships begin Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time Austrians swept the podium in  
Kitzbuehel since Franz Klammer, Erwin Resch and Anton Steiner took 
the top three places in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sixth podium sweep this season for Austrian skiers,  
who have won 13 of 23 races and have climbed the podium in every 
race except one. 
</P>
<P>
	Making history earlier this season, Austrian skiers swept the  
top nine places in a super-G in Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	While missing the podium by a maddening .01, Norway's Lasse Kjus  
continued to mark himself as a favorite for the worlds, finishing 
fourth in 1:54.36. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Norwegian failed to land on the  
downhill podium this season, aside from a race in Bormio, Italy, 
when he was forced to sit out with a lung infection. That downhill 
was won by double Olympic champion and current overall World Cup 
leader Hermann Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Knauss is the only Austrian other than Maier to have won a  
downhill this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus triumphed in Friday's two-leg sprint downhill, collecting  
his fourth victory in the discipline this season and solidifying 
his lead atop the rankings. He has 530 points, 180 ahead of Franz 
and 238 ahead of Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing eighth almost a second back, Maier, who crashed out in  
Friday's sprint downhill, saw his lead atop the overall World Cup 
standings reduced even more. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,053, the 26-year-old Austrian holds a tenous 51-point  
advantage over Kjus, the 1996 overall champion. Norway's Kjetil 
Andre Aamodt, the 1994 overall champion who finished seventh, sits 
third with 925, just 138 behind Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, a former Olympic and world champion in the combined, could  
overtake Maier before the weekend is out, with additional points 
from both the slalom and the combined event. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who usually never races in the purely technical  
discipline, said he would race in Sunday's slalom in an attempt to 
preserve his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Daron Rahlves of Truckee, Calif., had the top American result,  
finishing 21st, 2.36 seconds behind. He had been as high as fifth 
during training. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakub Fiala, who was born in the nearby Czech Republic and  
raised in Breckenridge, Colo., was 37th in his first race on the 
Kitzbuehel course in 1:58.90.

<HEADLINE> New Bulls Try To Get Acquainted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Roy Rogers meet Rusty LaRue. Martin  
Muursepp, go shake hands with Keith Booth. Toni Kukoc, do you know 
Mark Bryant? Ron Harper, how about slapping five with Bubba Wells? 
</P>
<P>
	The unrecogniza-Bulls, as they are already being called, have  
had little time to get acquainted and even less -- three practices 
and a scrimmage -- to get ready for a game. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the post-lockout NBA, the Bulls after Jordan, Rodman and  
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to have some semblance of organization,'' coach Tim  
Floyd said Saturday, looking forward to Sunday's exhibition opener 
against the Indiana Pacers, a team that has been working out 
together throughout the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt, teams like the Pacers are ready for payback on the  
former six-time champions, even as they try to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	The beatings could commence Sunday and last until May.  
</P>
<P>
	``BULLS are still written across the shirt and I think there  
will be some people trying to send some messages,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not that's fair or not I can't really answer that.  
But I do know that we can't really concern ourselves with that. We 
have so many new faces and the triangle is such a complex offense, 
our times has got to be spent on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said Rogers, Muursepp, Wells and Bryant, all of whom came  
to Chicago in trades-and-sign deals for Scottie Pippen and Luc 
Longley, would dress for Sunday's game against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie draft choices Corey Benjamin, the star of a Friday night  
scrimmage before 14,000 at the United Center, and Cory Carr also 
are signed and cleared to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said he wasn't aware of reports that free agent Brent  
Barry would prefer to play in warmer weather, which would rule out 
the Bulls. Barry met with the Bulls earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry's agent, Arn Tellem, told the Chicago Tribune his client  
is learning toward Golden State or Phoenix but could also return to 
Miami, which needs a shooting guard because Voshon Leonard has a 
stress fracture of the left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd says he'll probably go with a starting lineup of Harper,  
Kukoc, Bill Wennington, Randy Brown and Dickey Simpkins because as 
veterans they are more familiar with the triangle offense. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the scrimmage, that team was beaten by a group of free  
agents and rookies who had never played together before. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a little disconcerting,'' Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Now the Bulls will try to match up against an Indiana team that  
lost to Chicago in a rugged, seven-game Eastern Conference final 
last spring when the Bulls still had Pippen, Michael Jordan and 
Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Muursepp put Chicago's situation into perspective after  
Saturday's early practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a strange feeling,'' he said. ``I don't know anybody, but  
everybody is a good athlete so we'll see what we can put 
together.''

<HEADLINE> Hyatt Corp. Founder Pritzker Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jay Pritzker, founder of the Hyatt hotel chain  
and one of the richest men in the nation, died Saturday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after suffering  
a heart attack, according to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked last year by Forbes as the 20th richest American with a  
fortune of $5 billion, Pritzker created Hyatt Corp. with a single 
hotel and turned it into one of the world's largest hotel chains 
with more than 200 hotels and resorts worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	With his brother Robert he created a holding company called the  
Marmon Corp., which over the years had interests in Braniff 
Airlines, McCall's magazine, and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker, who was the former chairman of Hyatt, was also known  
for his generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his brother donated $70 million to various causes in  
1996, according to Fortune magazine. The $100,000 Pritzker 
Architectural Prize, created in 1979 and awarded annually, is 
widely considered the most prestigious award in architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker was born in 1922 to Fanny Doppelt and A. N. Pritzker, a  
Harvard-trained lawyer who made millions of dollars in business. 
His penniless grandfather arrived in Chicago in 1881 from a Jewish 
ghetto near Kiev, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritzker graduated from Northwestern and became a naval aviator  
during World War II. He later earned his law degree from 
Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the board of trustees at the University of Chicago and  
was chairman of the Pritzker Foundation which, among its other 
activities, has formed the Nancy Friend Pritzker Laboratory at 
Stanford University for research in depression.

<HEADLINE> Daiei To Sell Hawaii Shopping Mall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In a sign of corporate Japan's retreat from  
overseas amid a prolonged slump at home, troubled retailer Daiei 
Inc. plans to sell a major shopping mall in Hawaii, a Japanese 
newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiei, which posted a net loss last year for the first time in  
more than two decades, hopes to find a buyer by March for its Ala 
Moana Shopping Center in downtown Honolulu, the Yomiuri daily said, 
citing company chairman and founder Isao Nakauchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiei officials were unavailable for comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Several American companies have expressed interest in purchasing  
the showcase property, which Daiei expects to sell for between $873 
million and $1.31 billion to help ease a $22.7 billion debt burden, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's largest supermarket chain operator, Daiei acquired a 60  
percent stake in the shopping center in 1982 for $382 million. It 
bought out the remaining 40 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiei did not disclose the price, but Japanese media reported  
the deal was valued at about $410 million.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Antoine Carr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets signed former Utah Jazz  
backup center Antoine Carr Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr averaged 5.7 points and 2.0 rebounds per game last season,  
helping the Jazz win the Western Conference championship. He's also 
played for Atlanta, Sacramento and San Antonio in his 14-year NBA 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antoine's a valuable addition for us because he gives us  
another veteran big man,'' executive vice president Carroll Dawson 
said. ``He plays both inside positions and he'll be a comfortable 
fit for what we've already put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakeem Olajuwon, the Rockets' starting center, was happy to have  
Carr as a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised we were able to get him,'' Olajuwon said. ``I  
don't understand how Utah could let him go, but that's good for us. 
I like that.''

<HEADLINE> Trucking Office Might Not Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said  
Friday he is unsure he will support a change in oversight for the 
federal Office of Motor Carriers, despite a report showing the 
office consorted with those it regulates. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the head of the Federal Highway Administration said  
the four people cited in the report for improper conduct will 
continue working for the Transportation Department until an 
internal review is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly do not approve of the conduct of the individuals  
involved, and so we have moved quickly to make changes,'' FHWA 
Administrator Kenneth C. Wykle said in an interview. ``But in terms 
of retaining people within the agency, that's to ensure they get 
due process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released Thursday, was written by Kenneth M. Mead,  
inspector general for the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He found that leaders in the Office of Motor Carriers enlisted  
truckers last year to help the agency fight an attempt to move it 
out of highway administration and into the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the leaders wrote letters that trucking  
organizations -- a powerful lobby -- then sent to members of Congress 
in opposition to the change. Those actions violated DOT rules and 
the department's policy on lobbying. Congress ultimately defeated 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who proposed the change in oversight,  
has complained that the OMC is too cozy with truckers. He also felt 
the safety administration, which oversees automotive safety, was a 
more appropriate supervisor, rather than the highway 
administration, which is charged with building roads. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report did not identify the officials involved, The  
Associated Press learned they included George Reagle, who until 
Tuesday served as head of the OMC. Wykle replaced Reagle with 
agency veteran Julie Anna Cirillo and assigned Reagle new duties 
within the highway administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The others named in the report were Jill Hochman, director of  
the Office of Motor Carrier planning and customer liaison; Clinton 
Magby, director of motor carrier field operations; and Cynthia 
Elliot, chief of the Policy Planning and Customer Liaison division. 
</P>
<P>
	All continue to work for the Transportation Department.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Slater said the report ``suggests inappropriate  
contact'' that was ``clearly unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Slater said he was not sure there was a need to switch  
oversight of the office because all Transportation Department 
branches are committed to improving safety on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, I think what's important is that the  
Transportation Department -- which includes Federal Highways and 
NHTSA -- is aggressive and up front and proactive on these issues,'' 
the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said he plans to refile his bill on Feb. 2. Wykle said he  
looked forward to hearings on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the key thing is to have the debate, look at it  
objectively and then, collectively, we'll see what comes from 
that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Suspect Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Last June, just hours after the black man's  
right arm, head and torso were recovered from where they'd 
scattered as he was dragged two blood-smeared miles behind a pickup 
truck, investigators zeroed in on three white suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	All had blood on their shoes. All had criminal records. Two of  
the three reportedly had white supremacist leanings, reinforced in 
prison and reflected in racist tattoos that blanketed their upper 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	A wrench engraved with the third man's last name was found near  
the shredded body of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the provocative physical evidence, the trial of the  
first suspect, John William ``Bill'' King will not be open and shut 
when it begins Monday with jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is an ex-convict with a history of involvement in a  
racist prison gang. But whether he intended to kidnap Byrd and then 
to kill him will be key in the capital murder case -- and, if he is 
convicted, to whether he's sentenced to life in prison or put to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have an intentional murder to have capital  
murder,'' says Neil McCabe, who teaches at South Texas School of 
Law in Houston. ``They have to prove kidnapping beyond a reasonable 
doubt, and they have to prove intent to kill beyond a reasonable 
doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 23, whose wrench was found near Byrd's body,  
was the only defendant to give a statement about events leading to 
Byrd's death. But his statement is legally inadmissible unless he 
testifies, and his attorney says he won't permit Berry on the stand 
without a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, says he believes  
District Attorney Guy James Gray intends to go forward without 
Berry's testimony. Gray has declined to discuss his strategy. 
King's attorney, C. Haden Cribbs, also declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's murder scarred Jasper, an East Texas timber town of 8,000  
people just west of the Louisiana line. Reporters arrived from 
around the world, closely followed by knots of Ku Klux Klansmen and 
New Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants -- King, Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31 --  
were roommates who shared an apartment. Berry, brought in for 
questioning because of the wrench, told officers the three men had 
been drinking the evening of June 6. Late that evening or shortly 
after midnight, the men went out for a ride in Berry's rusty, 1982 
gray Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, Byrd had attended a niece's bridal shower that  
afternoon. Around 6 p.m., two of his sisters drove him to a 
friend's house for a party. Byrd, who lived on disability checks, 
was too poor to own a car, so he walked where he needed to go or 
caught rides. Late that night, he began walking the three miles 
home from the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry spotted Byrd and offered him a ride.  
</P>
<P>
	Berry and Byrd had the same parole officer and may have known  
each other. Byrd, a former vacuum cleaner salesman and father of 
three, had served time in prison for theft. Berry, working as a 
manager at the town's movie theater, was rebuilding his life after 
a stint in prison boot camp for a 1992 burglary that King helped 
organize. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what Berry says happened after the pickup truck stopped  
for Byrd: 
</P>
<P>
	King objected to giving a ride to a ``nigger'' and, after the  
group stopped at a convenience store, took the wheel and drove to 
an abandoned logging road outside town. There, King declared he was 
``fixing to scare'' Byrd. Berry watched as Brewer and King beat 
Byrd into unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry fled and King drove after him. After Berry got back in and  
the truck took off, he turned and saw Byrd's body bouncing behind, 
fastened to the bumper with a chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The route they took, a two-mile asphalt stretch of Huff Creek  
Road, was later marked with 75 red spray-painted circles to show 
where police found Byrd's keys, dentures and parts of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged King, Brewer and Berry with capital murder  
but decided to try the cases separately. King's is the second 
capital murder trial in Jasper County. The only other one was in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, 200 potential jurors will report to the town's  
historic, peach-colored stucco courthouse to hear the case outlined 
and undergo initial questioning by lawyers. For the first time in 
the 110-year history of the courthouse, all visitors will have to 
walk through metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The oak benches in the churchlike courtroom, where tall, narrow  
windows are topped with stained glass, can accommodate 100 
spectators. Roughly half the seats are reserved for reporters, with 
the overflow consigned to a basement kitchen where they can monitor 
the trial on audio speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days before the trial, workers trimmed the shrubs, washed  
down the white wood and repaired rotting boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been meaning to do that for a year and a half or so,''  
County Judge Joe Folk said. ``This kind of accelerated it.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Proposes $366M on Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore will propose on Sunday  
spending $366 million more on high-tech projects next year and 
extending a $2.4 billion research tax credit aimed at helping 
scientists, for example, develop super-fast computers that can 
speak and understand language. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration plans to increase federal research spending  
to a total $1.8 billion during fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1. 
Most of the money, about 60 percent, would go to research 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was expected to announce the White House proposals at the  
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science in Anaheim, Calif., according to a senior administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending increases are part of the administration's $1.8  
trillion budget it plans to unveil Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore announced Saturday that the administration will  
seek an additional $128 million in the budget to help children 
learn to read well. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House statement said the proposal includes $26 million  
for the Reading Excellence Act and $50 million for a new initiative 
to identify and address reading problems in young children. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said the increased technology spending --  
mentioned briefly by President Clinton during last week's State of 
the Union address -- could be used, for example, to create 
``intelligent agents'' that roam the Internet collecting 
information or for new computers that can speak, listen and 
understand language. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also will propose extending an existing tax credit worth  
$2.4 billion that otherwise would expire June 30. It offers a 20 
percent tax break based on a company's increase in research 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extending the tax credit on a permanent basis would be the  
best possible thing,'' said Bill Joy, chairman of the President's 
Information Technology Advisory Committee and co-founder of Sun 
Microsystems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they didn't have to renew it at all, so this is the next  
best thing,'' Joy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the committee proposed increasing research  
investments by roughly $1 billion over the next five years. Its 
next report to Clinton will probably be completed in late February. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, whose members include some of the nation's  
leading high-tech scientists, warned that the United States is 
``gravely under-investing'' in the field.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Harassed on Uraguay Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Former ``Baywatch'' star Pamela  
Anderson cut short a South American tour after being mobbed by 
scores of teen-age boys on a beach in Uruguay, a news agency 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson immediately canceled the filming of a suntan lotion  
commercial in Uruguay and a guest appearance on a TV show in 
neighboring Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pamela is frightened, and though we offered to suspend her  
open air presentations she just wants to go home,'' tour manager 
Diego Cassagne told the Argentine Diarios y Noticias news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble started at a news conference Friday on the beach at  
the Atlantic resort of Punta del Este, Uruguay. During the 
conference, teen-agers began to heckle the casually dressed 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked her about a video in which she appears in  
a romantic encounter with her estranged husband Tommy Lee, she 
said, ``I think I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the teen-agers surrounded Anderson on the beach, shouted  
vulgar remarks and tried to fondle her. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson flew to Buenos Aires to connect with a flight to Los  
Angeles, scheduled to depart late Saturday.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bears, embarrassed by a premature  
announcement that cost them their first choice for a new head 
coach, hired Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coordinator Dick Jauron 
on Saturday night.

	Jauron takes the job Dave McGinnis turned down. The defensive  
coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, was announced as the Bears' 
choice on Friday, but the deal fell through and McGinnis left town 
Saturday, just hours before the Jauron selection was announced.

three candidates -- Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Pendry, Green 
Bay offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis and Jauron -- to fill the post 
of the fired Dave Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears spokesman Bryan Harlan said Jauron would be introduced as  
the new coach at a news conference on Sunday. He said he couldn't

<P>
	In 1978, a nuclear-powered Soviet satellite plunged through  
Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, scattering radioactive debris 
over parts of northern Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the Voyager II space probe swept past Uranus, coming  
within 50,679 miles of the seventh planet of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, gunmen in Lebanon kidnapped educators Alann Steen,  
Jesse Turner and Robert Polhill and Mitheleshwar Singh. All were

death in Florida's electric chair for the 1978 kidnap-murder of 
12-year-old Kimberly Leach. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: President Clinton promoted William J. Perry, the  
Pentagon's second in command, to the post of defense secretary. The

statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Pope John Paul II, delivering blunt political

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates How To Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, often called the world's greatest  
deliberative body, may not get a chance to debate whether to 
dismiss or call witnesses to President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., believes those are  
procedural questions and don't need to be debated. Spokesman John 
Czwartacki said Lott plans Monday to offer a motion to simply have 
up-or-down votes on those two issues. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought howls of protest Saturday from Democrats, including  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``To say to senators, 
'We're going to deny you the right to speak about the motion to 
dismiss,' is mind-boggling,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another question is whether any debate would be open to the  
public. Senate rules now say that all impeachment debate is closed, 
but several Democrats are pushing for a two-thirds vote to change 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that affects every citizen in this  
country,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how much support that effort has, but a bipartisan  
group led by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, will seek a vote 
to open final deliberations on the two articles of impeachment -- if 
the proceedings get that far. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	After expressing misgivings a day earlier, Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist overruled Senate Parliamentarian Robert Dove's 
interpretation of the rules on whether the 13 House managers can 
object to questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dove had advised Rehnquist on Friday that the managers could  
object only to an answer, which the chief justice commented was 
``kind of an unusual thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue came up again Saturday, Rehnquist decided it made  
no sense at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., stood to object when a question was  
posed about something he said on ABC's ``This Week'' program about 
the perjury and obstruction of justice allegations against 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators objected to Hutchinson's objection, and  
Rehnquist said he had ``second thoughts'' about the 
parliamentarian's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice, noting that the rule came from President  
Andrew Johnson's 1868 impeachment trial, said the correct position 
is that the managers have no right to object to anything. 
</P>
<P>
                           	 *--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Several well-known spectators were spotted Saturday at President  
Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	One was Ann Richards, the former Democratic governor of Texas,  
who is perhaps best known for her 1988 Democratic National 
Convention speech in which she said President George Bush was out 
of touch because ``he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' 
She's also done television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Another was Eunice Kennedy Shriver, whose brother, Sen. Edward  
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is among those deciding Clinton's fate in the 
Senate. Mrs. Shriver is founder of the Special Olympics and wife of 
Democratic 1972 vice-presidential candidate and former Peace Corps 
director Sargent Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
	Also there was Tim Mathison, who played the caddish Otter in  
``Animal House,'' as a guest of Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland spokesman Robert Gibbs said Mathison has been visiting  
the senator for three days. The two are friends who met through a 
mutual buddy, actor Tom Berenger, Gibbs said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Arms Control Pact Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring the United States must shore up its  
defenses against ``new threats,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright intends to explore with Russian leaders changes in a 
historic arms control treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Friday that she would push for changes next week  
in Moscow even though Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov claims Russia 
will oppose any U.S. plan to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a landmark in accords reached with the former Soviet Union  
to cap and then reverse the nuclear arms race between the two 
powers. Still languishing in the Russian Duma, without 
ratification, is the START II Treaty, which would cut U.S. and 
Russian arsenals by two-thirds their size during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Friday whether Russia might agree to modify the 1972  
treaty under certain conditions, Ivanov responded bluntly, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We proceed from the assumption that it mustn't happen, and  
will actively be trying to convince our American partners,'' the 
foreign minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was not deterred. She said she would assure Ivanov that  
the United States was committed to key strategic aspects of the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have many new threats with which to deal and we need to  
make sure that we are able to fulfill our responsibilities 
regarding our own defenses,'' Albright said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty stripped the two sides of a national defense against  
missiles. The theory, which gave arms control a big push, was that 
a country was unlikely to launch a nuclear attack if it was unable 
to defend itself against massive retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has had its domestic foes from the outset,  
essentially conservative members of Congress who were anxious about 
defending against a Soviet attack. Picking up on this theme, 
President Reagan in 1983 proposed a space-based defense program 
known as Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan's program, which would have been very expensive, was  
shelved, partly because arms control experts argued that the Soviet 
Union might respond with its own defense system or with a weapons 
buildup. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the emergence of Iran, Iraq and North Korea,  
among other nations, as potential nuclear powers has prompted some 
arms control advocates to consider changing the 1972 treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent in the conservative opposition, Sen. Jesse Helms,  
R-N.C., said he intends to have the Senate vote on the treaty this 
year and ``toss it into the dustbin of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, said in a speech his aim was to ``clear the way to build 
a national missile defense for the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissing the Clinton administration's strategy, Helms said it  
amounted to asking Russia for permission for the United States to 
protect against a missile attack from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Russia, which succeeded the Soviet Union  
after its disintegration in 1991, as America's ABM partner, each 
have the right under the treaty to withdraw and go their own way on 
a missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright took note of that right in a speech Thursday. But on  
Friday she said ``there needs to be no concerns about withdrawal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said afterward:  
``We are not proposing amendments to the ABM treaty. We are going 
to have discussions with them about the new threats out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said each potential threat to the United States was  
different, and no decision had been taken on what changes might be 
required in the treaty to defend against them. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's budget proposal for the year 2000 will  
include an additional $6.6 billion for national missile defense, 
with the cost rising to $10.5 billion through 2005 for a network of 
high-technology radars and missile interceptors.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Keenan Questions Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A frustrated Mike Keenan says  
he's heard nothing from team management to convince him published 
reports he'll be fired as the Vancouver Canucks coach are not true. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Sun said Saturday that Keenan would be fired  
before the Canucks' next game -- Thursday against St. Louis -- and be 
replaced with Marc Crawford, the former coach of the Colorado 
Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm assuming it's a fait accompli,'' Keenan told radio station  
CKNW in Vancouver on Saturday night. ``I just wish someone would 
have the courtesy of making a phone call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks general manager Brian Burke, who was supposed to be in  
Tampa, Fla., for Sunday's NHL all-star game, issued a statement 
Saturday might. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vancouver Canucks organization has nothing to announce at  
this time and will not respond today to the speculative story on 
Mike Keenan's coaching status,'' he said. ``We will expect to be 
able to make a further statement tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TSN reported that Burke was returning from Tampa to meet with  
Keenan on Sunday. The station also said that no agreement between 
the Canucks and Crawford was in place, but that he had been in the 
Tampa area over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tampa, Canucks forward Markus Naslund was in the dark as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reporter told me about it -- I don't know anything,'' said  
Naslund, whose World All-Star team will meet the North America 
All-Stars on Sunday. ``It's a tough situation, we're struggling so 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your team is not winning, something happens. You either  
make a trade or fire the coach. I can't comment until something 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who led the New York Rangers to a Stanley Cup  
championship in 1994, was hired as the Canucks coach in November 
1997 after Tom Renney was fired. In 63 games last year, he had a 
21-30-12 record and missed the playoffs for the first time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks are 15-24-6 this season and are battling for the  
final playoff spot in the weak Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan defended his record, noting the team has played all  
season without Pavel Bure, a 51-goal-scorer last year who sat out 
to back his trade demand. He was traded to the Florida Panthers 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also has been hurt by with injuries, losing Todd  
Bertuzzi (broken leg), Alex Mogilny (knee and kidney), and Mark 
Messier (concussion). 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us are happy with the record,'' Keenan said. ``We had  
three of our top four forwards out for most of the season. We 
stayed competitive. I think the players have worked extremely hard. 
I've been very proud of what they've been able to accomplish on 
most evenings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the season Burke has publicly supported Keenan, but did  
say he would evaluate his coach's performance after the Bure trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, without citing sources, said Burke is unhappy with  
Keenan because the team's young players aren't developing properly; 
that players have complained about not working on special teams 
during practice; and he doesn't take advantage of his assistant 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also suggestions of friction within the team because  
Keenan scheduled a team practice on the eve of the All-Star break, 
but allowed Messier, the Canucks captain, to skip the workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, 37, stepped down as the Avalanche's coach last spring  
after Colorado was knocked out of the first round of the Stanley 
Cup playoffs. Once considered one of the league's up-and-coming 
coaches, Crawford's star was tarnished when the Avalanche didn't 
play to their potential and he failed to coach Canada to a medal at 
last year's Winter Olympic Games in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, who played for the Canucks in the 1980s, was  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who also took the Philadelphia Flyers and Chicago  
Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup finals, expressed frustration that 
neither Burke, nor anyone with team owners Orca Bay Sports and 
Entertainment, had contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I, sitting here all day wondering if somebody is  
going to call us, is quite disturbing to say the least,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Says Keep NHL in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky thinks it would be a good idea  
for NHL players to return to the Olympics in 2002, a prospect the 
league continues to explore. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Gary Bettman said Saturday night that a decision  
could be made as early as late February or early March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overwhelming sentiment relayed to me by the players is  
they want to go back. That's step one,'' Bettman said following his 
annual state of the league press conference during All-Star 
Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do it in a way we're comfortable with and makes  
sense in terms of shutting down the season for 12 days, then you 
go. The most important thing to us is our season. The Olympics are 
secondary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Gretzky said first and foremost that it's important to  
allow players to compete for their countries because ``it's one of 
the greatest thrills that anyone can have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the problems we have in Canada is our kids grow up  
saying I want to play in the NHL,'' he said. ``And because you play 
in the NHL, that almost eliminates your opportunity to play for 
your country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (Olympics) is going to be in the United States. It's an  
opportunity for the National Hockey League to get tremendous 
exposure ... I think it would be great for our sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bettman said the state of the league is strong -- and  
would be even without improved television ratings because of the 
NBA lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're having a terrific season,'' he said. ``Our ratings are  
strong ... Our attendance is strong, if not stronger than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance is up with teams playing to 93 percent capacity so  
far this season. And, the commissioner added, game-related injuries 
are down thanks to the efforts of Colin Campbell, the league's 
chief disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	Concussions have declined 25 percent, while injuries are down 35  
percent overall. Further evidence of progress is that the league 
recently went more than a month without having any incidents 
requiring supplemental discipline, Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't because we stopped looking,'' the commissioner said.  
``It's because the players have adjusted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky also said he felt Campbell -- a one-time teammate who  
also coached the 18-time All-Star with the New York Rangers -- is 
doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, he's in an impossible situation because you can  
never satisfy everybody,'' Gretzky said. ``No matter what he does, 
somebody's going to be critical of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the biggest thing about Colin was he's an  
ex-player, an ex-coach, and he understands what the players go 
through. ... I don't think he has any personal vendetta or anything 
that is not at all positive for the game. He's just trying to do 
the job to minimize people trying to intentionally hurt people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No major news came out of a Board of Governors meetings where  
Bettman said members were updated on the Olympics as well as 
franchise problems with Pittsburgh, Ottawa and the New York 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman said there was nothing significant to report on the  
Penguins and Senators. Efforts continue to try to build support for 
a new arena for the Islanders, who are unhappy with their situation 
at Nassau Coliseum.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs GM Truck Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAQUEMINE, La. (AP) -- A judge has approved $1,000 vouchers for  
5.8 million owners of General Motors trucks with side-mounted fuel 
tanks in a ruling that could end a 7-year dispute over the safety 
and value of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The vouchers will go to owners of C- or K-series trucks built  
from 1973-87 or R- or V-series truck built from 1987-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Claimants must have owned the trucks as of July 1, 1996, when a  
national class-action settlement was first approved, said Michael 
Crow, attorney for the truck owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The vouchers are good toward the purchase of any GM vehicle  
except Saturns. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics had claimed gas tanks on the trucks were fire hazards in  
side-impact crashes. Most trucks' tanks are mounted in the middle 
of the frame to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement drew criticism for the more than $24 million in  
payments to attorneys when truck owners were not getting cash but 
vouchers that had to be used to buy a new GM vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow said there was a reason plaintiffs couldn't get more: GM  
proved that the trucks held their resale value. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as plaintiffs could not prove that the value of the  
vehicles had been diminished at all as a result of the location of 
the tanks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Canucks To Fire Keenan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The struggling Vancouver  
Canucks are about to fire coach Mike Keenan, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Sun, citing unidentified sources, said Saturday  
that general manager Brian Burke will remove Keenan before the 
team's next game Thursday against the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL teams are idle this weekend because of Sunday's All-Star  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke had said he would give Keenan until after the Pavel Bure  
trade before he began assessing his job as coach. Bure was traded 
to the Florida Panthers last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks lost 4-1 to the expansion Nashville Predators on  
Tuesday, convincing Burke a change had to be made, the Sun 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun said former Colorado Avalanche coach Marc Crawford is a  
leading candidate to replace Keenan. Crawford was unavailable for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver is 2-6-2 in its last 10 games and has a 15-24-6  
overall record, tied for ninth in the Western Conference with 
Nashville, six points behind the eighth-place San Jose Sharks.

<HEADLINE> Text of Henry Hyde's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of comments Saturday by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., when asked  
at President Clinton's impeachment trial about ``the views of the 
American people'': 
</P>
<P>
	``Edmund Burke was asked that once. And he said that a member of  
parliament owes the highest fidelity to its constituents, but he 
doesn't owe his conscience to anybody. We have, or we have not, a 
representative democracy. We're not delegates who are sent here to 
weigh our mail every day, and then to vote accordingly. Our work 
here is not an ongoing plebiscite. We are elected to bring our 
judgment, our experience and our consciences with us here. I have 
always believed (that), and I believe (that) more firmly than ever, 
and this experience confirms me in that belief. There are issues of 
transcendent importance that you have to be willing to lose your 
office over. I would think of several that I am willing to lose my 
office over. Abortion is one. National defense is another. 
Strengthening, not emasculating, the concept of equal justice under 
law. My life is devoted as a lawyer; I've been on the Judiciary 
Committee -- this is my 25th year -- and equal justice under the law 
is what moves me. It animates me. And I'm willing to lose my seat 
any day of the week rather than sell out on those issues. Despite 
all the polls and all the hostile editorials, America is hungry for 
people who believe in something. You may disagree with us, but we 
believe in something.''

	Senators' Questions Continue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial of President Clinton  
resumes today at 10 a.m. EST as senators continue to offer 
questions to both the prosecution and defense in the case. House 
prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns yesterday responding 
to some 50 written questions submitted by senators and read by 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Friday's questions included 
whether Clinton tried to coach Oval Office secretary Betty Currie 
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; whether a job search for 
the former intern was an attempt to buy her silence about the 
affair; and whether the search was related to Ms. Lewinsky's 
appearance on the witness list in Paula Jones' sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the president. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate May Want Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators face a tumultuous week in  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, House prosecutors have 
touched off a new legal battle by trying to force Monica Lewinsky's 
cooperation. In a chain of events set in motion by lead House 
prosecutor Henry Hyde, R-Ill., Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
attorneys went to court yesterday for an emergency order to compel 
Ms. Lewinsky to be interviewed by the House managers concerning the 
alleged coverup of her affair with Clinton. She has refused to be 
questioned. The Starr attorneys argued that the former White House 
intern's immunity agreement requires that she cooperate with the 
House. U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson did not rule 
immediately. 

</P>
<P>
	Byrd: Let's End This Thing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., says he will  
introduce a motion to dismiss the Clinton trial, providing senators 
a quick opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. Byrd 
said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our country'' 
and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's conviction and 
removal from office were ``not likely to develop.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II is visiting the world's  
most populous Roman Catholic city to shepherd his flock in the 
Americas in a new direction for the millennium. The pope promised 
to outline his vision of the church's future at a Mass today at the 
Basilica of the Virgin of Guadelupe. His message was expected to 
address the increasing presence of Protestants in Latin America and 
reinforce positions against abortion, birth control and the death 
penalty. The pope meets with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo 
tonight.

	Another Standoff in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International peace monitors today  
tried to defuse another dangerous standoff in Kosovo after 
separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas seized five Serb villagers. 
Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were 
optimistic the five would be released as early as today. The 
monitors were said to be negotiating with the rebels, but there 
were no details. The kidnapping yesterday came as international 
officials pressured government forces and the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army to stop attacks in the separatist province in 
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.

told customers by e-mail late yesterday it could not avoid the 
effects of the so-called ``Y2K'' problem and by October must shut 
the service down. The company said the problem was not expected to 
affect its newer ``Prodigy Internet'' service, launched in late

argument so far, losing only 17 games in three matches. Agassi beat 
Czech player Jiri Novak 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. For Serena Williams, the 
line judge said ``in'' and the umpire said ``out,'' on her second 
match point, and three games later she made a racket-flinging exit, 
booed by the crowd for her petulance. ``The match was actually mine 
at that point, so that's like having someone take it away from 
you,'' she said after her 6-2, 2-6, 9-7 loss to No. 14 seed 
Sandrine Testud of France.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Fans Welcome Belle, Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Until the Ravens start to experience success in  
the NFL, Baltimore will be known as a baseball town. That's just 
fine with Will Clark, who learned Saturday that the Orioles always 
attract a crowd at Camden Yards -- even in the middle of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 8,000 people showed up Saturday for FanFest, the  
Orioles' two-day version of a Star Trek convention. Nearly two 
dozen current and former players attracted long lines for 
autographs and pictures, including Clark, who joined the Orioles in 
December after spending the better part of his career in San 
Francisco and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it here. I like it a lot,'' Clark said after signing  
nearly 1,200 autographs. ``The two other organizations I played 
for, when August comes around the fans turn their attention toward 
football. Here, baseball is king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and fellow newcomer Albert Belle found FanFest to be the  
perfect place to get to know the people of Baltimore. Belle, who 
had a reputation for shunning fans in Cleveland and Chicago, 
altered set plans in order to attend Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended up signing his name around 1,000 times, both surprising  
and delighting fans of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response was pretty good. They gave me a nice cheer when I  
stepped up to the table to sign,'' Belle said. ``Unfortunately I 
couldn't mingle with every fan, but I enjoyed talking to the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FanFest, held at the Baltimore Convention Center across from the  
baseball stadium, concludes Sunday evening. It also features 
clinics, a special Negro League exhibit and items from the Babe 
Ruth and Cal Ripken museums. Fans can buy baseball cards and 
jerseys, kids can test their skills in interactive games, and 
everyone can grab an autograph if they're willing to wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Brown, 40, of Fairfax, Va., waited 2 1/2 hours to get catcher  
Charles Johnson's signature. Brown also got Belle's autograph and a 
few others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was here when the doors opened,'' Brown said. ``Albert was  
very pleasant. He got done signing for a few hours and then came 
back and did some more. I'd say he made a very positive 
impression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles officials are expecting at least 10,000 fans at FanFest  
on Sunday, when Ripken and Clark are slated to discuss their 
careers and answer questions during a fan forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and pitcher Mike Mussina did the honors Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mussina got the biggest cheer from the fans after someone asked  
him how Orioles backers can do something about all those New York 
Yankees fans that show up at Camden Yards during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't sell your season tickets to Yankee fans,'' Mussina said.  
``Let them sit in the upper deck. Sell your tickets to other Oriole 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, Mussina, Harold Baines, Mike Bordick, Terry Crowley,  
Delino DeShields, Scott Erickson, Doug Johns, Scott Kamieniecki, 
Ray Miller, Sidney Ponson and B.J. Surhoff are all slated to 
participate in autograph or photograph sessions Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle took a 5 o'clock flight home Saturday, but Orioles fans  
can expect him to make an early appearance at spring training camp 
in Florida next month. He said he was planning to be in uniform a 
week before the veterans are scheduled to report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really looking forward to this season,'' he said. ``I feel  
like we're underdogs, waiting to rise to the top. Hopefully we can 
get back to where the Orioles were in 1996.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles eliminated Belle and the Indians from the playoffs  
in 1996, advancing to the AL Championship series before losing to 
New York.

<P>
	Short-term schedule of expected developments in the Senate  
impeachment trial: 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's trial resumes Monday at 1 p.m. EST.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said senators expect  
to send President Clinton a series of written questions by Monday 
in hopes he can explain some of the inconsistencies in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., plans to offer a motion to dismiss  
the case. The House managers and White House lawyers would have an 
hour each to argue the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is expected to be a motion to subpoena a list of  
witnesses. The White House lawyers and the House would have three 
hours each to discuss that motion. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if the senators will be permitted to debate  
either question. Also not clear is whether any debate will be open, 
or all proceedings closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Either motion would take a simple majority of 51 senators to  
pass.

<HEADLINE> Scandal Shakes Olympics Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- With the credibility and future of  
the IOC at stake, Olympic leaders today began considering whether 
to expel members accused in the biggest corruption scandal in the 
Games' history. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rapidly growing crisis spread to the 2000 Sydney  
Olympics, a special IOC panel met under tight security to conclude 
its investigation into bribery allegations surrounding Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members were implicated in the scandal over cash  
payments, scholarships, free medical care and other favors accepted 
from Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members resigned this week, and IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said as many as seven others face the possibility of 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day,'' said Jacques Rogge, a Belgian member of  
the inquiry panel. ``But we will do what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are cases among them that are just unacceptable, brutal  
corruption, when simply money was asked for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-man commission will report its findings and  
recommendations to the executive board Sunday. The board will then 
propose expulsions and announce plans for overhauling the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who headed the internal  
investigation, declined to comment today as he headed into the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In extraordinary scenes, barricades were set up outside the IOC  
headquarters on the shores of Lake Geneva. Police and security 
guards kept a close watch on the scores of journalists gathered in 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials avoided the media crush by driving into the  
underground parking lot and entering the building through a private 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamine Keita, the IOC member from Mali who is among the 13  
delegates implicated, arrived in mid-morning to appear before the 
panel to defend himself in person. Others were expected to appear 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The session, starting the most crucial meeting in IOC history,  
came a day after the IOC was rocked by new revelations from 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney bidders said they made $70,000 inducements for two  
African votes the night before they won the Summer Games for 2000 -- 
by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney's Olympic leaders were assessing the fallout from their  
own emerging scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial signs were that the damage could be major.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't rule it out that some may call for the games not to  
proceed in Sydney,'' said Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board 
member from Australia. ``I could see the published material being 
viewed as questionable conduct by the candidate city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper called for Sydney to make all the bid documents public  
and said the IOC may call for a full-scale investigation along the 
same lines as the Salt Lake inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates released  
previously secret material from the Sydney bid to Australian news 
media on Friday. It contained data on annual $5,000 payments to 
Olympic committees in Kenya and Uganda from 1994 through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what the payments were for, Coates said they were offered  
to get votes from Kenya's Charles Mukora and Uganda's Maj. Gen. 
Francis Nyangweso the night before the IOC ballot in Monte Carlo on 
Sept. 22, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates told the 
Sydney Morning Herald. ``My view was it might encourage them to 
consider their votes for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney beat Beijing 45-43 in the secret balloting.  
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Sydney today, Coates confirmed the  
payment plan but again said the money was intended to help finance 
sports in Kenya and Uganda. He said he pledged the money because he 
felt Sydney's chances were ``slipping away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to die wondering why we didn't win,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the payments were within IOC guidelines and were  
similar to plans used by bidding competitors from Beijing and 
Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, who said he had not seen the bid documents, described  
the reported inducements as going ``beyond good will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that John's decision was intended to influence the  
IOC members' thinking,'' Gosper said. ``The perception may not 
match John's intention, the event having taken place the night 
before the vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya became the second  
IOC member to resign in the Salt Lake case. He stepped down 
following revelations that his son, Suhel, received tuition to 
attend an English language center at Brigham Young and a community 
college, plus $700 a month for expenses, all from Salt Lake 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member implicated in the Salt Lake scandal also was in  
the spotlight again, this time for actions attributed to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Jacques Ganga asked Salt Lake bid executives for  
$30,000-$35,000 the day before the city lost the 1998 Winter Games 
to Nagano, a source close to the bid process told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Ganga said he might be able to influence four votes  
but did not promise them, said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The offer was turned down. Salt Lake lost the next day 
by four votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Claude Ganga, president of the Association of National  
Olympic Committee in Africa and an IOC member from the Republic of 
Congo, has been linked to cash payments of some $70,000 from Salt 
Lake, along with fee medical care and help on a profitable land 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Edges Ray To Win First Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Sharp was the fastest in  
winter testing and in practice at Walt Disney World Speedway, so it 
was no surprise that he won the pole Saturday for the Indy Racing 
League season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was not easy.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the competition for the top spot in Sunday's Indy 200  
went down to the wire as Sharp knocked Raul Boesel off the pole, 
then stood in the pits and waited as Greg Ray went after him on the 
one-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worse sitting there watching than being in the car,''  
said Sharp, whose lap of 171.371 mph gave him his second pole in 
the open-wheel series sponsored by Pep Boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, making his first start for Team Menard after replacing  
former series champion and 1998 race winner Tony Stewart -- now 
running full-time in NASCAR -- came close, taking the outside of the 
front row at 170.697. The time differential between the two laps 
was only .083 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was disappointed, particularly after having to give up a  
spot near the front of the qualifying line because of a gearshift 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made some changes to the car after practice and we thought  
it would be better,'' he said. ``But a shim worked itself loose and 
got jammed in there and I wasn't able to select any gear. We had to 
abort the (first) run and go to the back of the pack. And we got 
only one flying lap on our second try. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all or nothing. The car was good, but if I would have  
had one more lap to get to trust the car a little more, I think we 
could have been close to Scott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Ray will be making his third start from the outside  
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Boesel, who is starting his second year in the IRL after several  
seasons in the rival CART series, earned his best starting position 
since making the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that Scott and Greg were going to be fast, so it was  
good to put a little pressure on those guys,'' the Brazilian said. 
``I feel a lot of confidence in this car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp won his only previous pole at Pikes Peak International  
Raceway in 1997. He then crashed hard in the race, sustaining a 
severe concussion -- his second of the season -- that kept him out of 
a race car for the rest of the year and initially threatened his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew all along I'd be fine and come back,'' he said. ``I  
wanted to come back the next week, but other people told me I had 
to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, I lived in the Bay area at that time, and there's  
a lot of people who know about multiple concussions in athletes 
there. I went for counseling and to several doctors and they told 
me if I laid low and had patience -- which I don't have a lot of -- 
I'd be 100 percent. They were right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp came back in 1998, his first season with Kelley Racing,  
and won two races and finished fourth in the season points. The 
goal this year is to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to come here and see that our testing paid off,''  
Sharp said. ``I don't need to win the pole to feel good, but it's 
important for our team to have this kind of success. Now we need to 
see what we can accomplish tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Goodyear was fourth in Saturday's qualifying at 169.731,  
followed by defending series champion Kenny Brack at 168.563, Jeff 
Ward at 168.350 and Sam Schmidt at 168.122. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt is replacing two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Arie  
Luyendyk, who will run only Indy this season before retiring.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Settles Discrimination Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rhonda Capps says she had seen so little  
advancement of fellow blacks during 13 years of work at The Boeing 
Co. that she recently felt ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	But a settlement forged between the aerospace giant and black  
workers who sued the company for various discriminatory practices 
has given her hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other day I changed my mind,'' said Capps, an electrical  
engineer and one of the suit's plaintiffs. ``I want to see this 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing agreed Friday to pay $15 million to settle allegations it  
discriminated against blacks in hiring, promotions and workplace 
treatment. The company admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement, which will go mostly to 20,000 past and  
present black employees, was announced by Boeing chairman Phil 
Condit, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and lawyers for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	About $3.7 million will be used for equal-opportunity and  
diversity training at Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would settle two class-action lawsuits filed last year.  
It is subject to approval by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement ensures further expansion of our efforts to  
improve our promotion processes, enhance training opportunities and 
ensure employees have avenues available to address their 
concerns,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is ``a significant step on the long journey to  
making Boeing the best it can be,'' said Jackson, who helped broker 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits were filed on behalf of employees in the Seattle  
and Philadelphia areas who alleged they were treated with hostility 
and passed over for promotions that went to less-qualified white 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is the world's biggest maker of passenger jets.

<HEADLINE> NBA OKs Longley Deal to Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The deal to bring center Luc Longley to the  
Phoenix Suns from the Chicago Bulls was approved by the NBA 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns also announced they had re-signed George McCloud.  
</P>
<P>
	The trade, confirmed by the Suns earlier in the week, sends Mark  
Bryant, Martin Muursepp, Bubba Wells and a first-round draft pick 
to the Bulls for the 7-foot-2 center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will get either the worst of Phoenix's two first-round  
draft picks this year or the Suns' first-round pick in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Longley has been in Phoenix since Thursday and has been going  
through informal workouts. Terms were not announced, but the 
six-year deal was believed to pay Longley $4 million this season. 
With a 12 percent raise each year, he would earn about $32.4 
million over the term of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloud was among 10 free agents renounced by the Suns earlier  
in the week. He averaged 7.3 points and 3.5 rebounds per game last 
season.

<HEADLINE> W. Virginia May Tax Chewing Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- The governor of the state that leads  
the nation in chewing tobacco use says the chewers should pay taxes 
on their habit to finance children's health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia has the nation's highest percentage of men who  
chew tobacco -- 18.4 percent, compared with the national average of 
7.2 percent. In one county, 54 percent of men chew. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood, a former board member of the  
American Cancer Society, wants $5 million of the anticipated $7 
million revenue from a first-ever tax on chewing tobacco to pay the 
state's share of a program for children without health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Underwood is catching opposition from both sides of the  
legislative aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans oppose new taxes, and many Democrats say chewing  
tobacco is a part of West Virginia's culture, something that grew 
in popularity in part because smoking is banned in the coal mines. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father always told me, if you know a person who chews  
tobacco or carries a pocket knife, you'll find he's a pretty good 
fellow,'' said Senate Majority Leader Truman Chafin, a Democrat. 
``And it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has proposed a 25 percent tax, despite the urging of  
anti-tobacco lobbyists, who want it to be 50 percent. Chewing 
tobacco in West Virginia sells for about $2.50 a can.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial  
dissolved into partisan debate Saturday, as lawmakers and lawyers 
alike dueled over a surprise attempt by House prosecutors to 
question Monica Lewinsky before the Senate decides whether to call 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	As opposing attorneys clashed over that issue in the well of the  
Senate, a Republican spokesman predicted that an attempt by 
Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd to dismiss all charges ``will 
certainly fail'' when the roll is called next week. Republicans 
hold a 55-45 majority -- but that is well short of the two-thirds 
majority needed to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Senate, meeting for a rare second straight Saturday,  
White House Counsel Charles Ruff assailed the maneuver of House 
prosecutors in enlisting assistance from Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr in their effort to interview Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine what that little conversation is going to look  
like, held in the independent counsel's office, with the people 
there who have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail? 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK, to have one  
side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's 
office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity 
agreement if she doesn't fly across the country for this little 
chat? I think not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., rejected suggestions Ms. Lewinsky  
would be mistreated. ``The White House counselors do not want to 
talk about the facts, the obstruction of justice. Just like in the 
House, they want to talk about the process, everything but the 
obstruction of justice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their comments, both Ruff and Hutchinson were responding to  
questions posed by senators through Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist, who is presiding over Clinton's trial on articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor erupted as U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson  
ordered Ms. Lewinsky to appear for questioning, either by House 
prosecutors, or by lawyers from Starr's office on the prosecutors' 
behalf if she wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky flew back to Washington from California to comply.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, quietly wrote Starr on  
Thursday seeking his help in bringing Ms. Lewinsky to the table 
after her lawyers had refused to make her available voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his own remarks on the Senate floor, Hyde responded to a  
question posed to him with a ringing defense of the effort he is 
leading to convict Clinton and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are issues of transcendent importance that you have to  
be willing to lose your office over,'' he said. ``I can think of 
several that I'm willing to lose my office over. Abortion is one. 
National defense is another. Strengthening, not emasculating the 
concept of ``equal justice under law'' is a third, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Time/CNN poll released Saturday, 54 percent said they  
disapprove of how Republicans in the Senate are handling the 
impeachment trial. About four out of 10 said they disapprove of how 
Democrats are handling it. The survey of 1,024 adults taken 
Wednesday and Thursday had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling was the latest on a series of rapid fire  
developments that left even senators struggling to keep up with the 
ebb and flow of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I notice a shift every half day in terms of people thinking it  
will go on for months, or it's going to be over in a few hours,'' 
Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	What's today's line? he was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to go on for a while.''  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority leader Trent Lott dispatched his spokesman, John  
Czwartacki, to tell reporters that an early morning closed-door 
meeting had produced ``remarkable unity'' against a Democratic bid 
to dismiss the charges and in favor of deposing witnesses. The 
trial, he said, appears to be entering a ``phase which may be 
partisan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said the House prosecutors'  
maneuver was the most ``clear demonstration of raw partisanship 
that I have ever seen,'' and 44 Democratic senators urged the House 
to reverse course. The president's lawyers will be locked out of 
the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked, through Rehnquist, whether the prosecutors would  
provide the Senate with a transcript of their planned questioning 
of Ms. Lewinsky, and permit one Republican and one Democratic 
senator to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans said no.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd had unexpectedly announced on  
Friday he would lead the effort to dismiss. Overnight, his 
announcement seemed to have strengthened the resolve of Democrats 
eager to bring the trial to an end, but also stiffened the will of 
Republicans eager to proceed to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd -- a defender of Senate prerogatives as well as a former  
Democratic leader -- issued a statement during the day attacking the 
efforts by House prosecutors to question Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort ``is clearly a desperate attempt ... to pre-empt the  
coming vote by the Senate on whether or not to depose witnesses'' 
and violates a bipartisan agreement on trial guidelines approved 
earlier by the Senate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House floor, Republicans explained their move in far  
different terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to violate those rules and we don't think that  
we have,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``As anybody knows, if you have a witness that you're going to  
produce, you have a right to prepare that witness. It's as plain 
and simple as that.''

Rehnquist, who is presiding over Clinton's trial on articles of 
impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor erupted as U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson  
ordered Ms. Lewinsky to appear for questioning, either by House 
prosecutors, or by lawyers from Starr's office on the prosecutors' 
behalf if she wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky flew back to Washington from California to comply.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, quietly wrote Starr on  
Thursday seeking his help in bringing Ms. Lewinsky to the table 
after her lawyers had refused to make her available voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his own remarks on the Senate floor, Hyde responded to a  
question posed to him with a ringing defense of the effort he is 
leading to convict Clinton and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are issues of transcendent importance that you have to  
be willing to lose your office over,'' he said. ``I can think of 
several that I'm willing to lose my office over. Abortion is one. 
National defense is another. Strengthening, not emasculating the 
concept of ``equal justice under law'' is a third, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Time/CNN poll released Saturday, 54 percent said they  
disapprove of how Republicans in the Senate are handling the 
impeachment trial. About four out of 10 said they disapprove of how 
Democrats are handling it. The survey of 1,024 adults taken 
Wednesday and Thursday had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling was the latest on a series of rapid fire  
developments that left even senators struggling to keep up with the 
ebb and flow of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I notice a shift every half day in terms of people thinking it  
will go on for months, or it's going to be over in a few hours,'' 
Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	What's today's line? he was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to go on for a while.''  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority leader Trent Lott dispatched his spokesman, John  
Czwartacki, to tell reporters that an early morning closed-door 
meeting had produced ``remarkable unity'' against a Democratic bid 
to dismiss the charges and in favor of deposing witnesses. The 
trial, he said, appears to be entering a ``phase which may be 
partisan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said the House prosecutors'  
maneuver was the most ``clear demonstration of raw partisanship 
that I have ever seen,'' and 44 Democratic senators urged the House 
to reverse course. The president's lawyers will be locked out of 
the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked, through Rehnquist, whether the prosecutors would  
provide the Senate with a transcript of their planned questioning 
of Ms. Lewinsky, and permit one Republican and one Democratic 
senator to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans said no.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd had unexpectedly announced on  
Friday he would lead the effort to dismiss. Overnight, his 
announcement seemed to have strengthened the resolve of Democrats 
eager to bring the trial to an end, but also stiffened the will of 
Republicans eager to proceed to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd -- a defender of Senate prerogatives as well as a former  
Democratic leader -- issued a statement during the day attacking the 
efforts by House prosecutors to question Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort ``is clearly a desperate attempt ... to pre-empt the  
coming vote by the Senate on whether or not to depose witnesses'' 
and violates a bipartisan agreement on trial guidelines approved 
earlier by the Senate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House floor, Republicans explained their move in far  
different terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to violate those rules and we don't think that  
we have,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``As anybody knows, if you have a witness that you're going to  
produce, you have a right to prepare that witness. It's as plain 
and simple as that.''

	Lewinsky Heads for D.C. Interview  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered Monica Lewinsky  
to submit to an interview to assist House prosecutors in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial or ``forfeit her protections'' under 
the immunity deal she struck with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
last summer. U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson said Ms. 
Lewinsky could do the interview with House managers directly or 
request that Starr's office be present. House officials said the 
former White House intern was flying to Washington today. The White 
House assailed the House prosecutors for taking the action without 
even informing the president's lawyers.

accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of increasing oil production, 
causing plummeting prices over the past year to the detriment of 
Arab states and the benefit of the Americans. Oil prices are now at 
a record low, a particular problem for Iraq, which is allowed to 
sell oil every six months to buy food and medicine.

centrist party. Netanyahu accused Mordechai of being driven by

Mordechai accused the prime minister of lying.

society's movers and shakers. John Paul said pastors must preach 
the Christian message to the rich and the powerful, not just the 
poor. The pope also pushed his church to battle ``social sins which 
cry to heaven,'' such as drug trafficking and corruption. He called 
for the church to speak out more against ``the culture of death'' 
that kills through abortion, euthanasia and the ``unnecessary 
recourse to the death penalty.''

<HEADLINE> Daschle Hurt by White House Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One consequence of the impeachment case  
against President Clinton is the strain it has placed on his 
relationship with Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	This was never a cozy friendship, and Daschle was deeply hurt by  
Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky, say 
aides to the South Dakota senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Professionally, Daschle has been an invaluable ally of  
Clinton's, blocking Republican initiatives, limiting congressional 
investigations and keeping the GOP leadership off balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a very good sense after you talk to Daschle where the  
Democratic caucus is. That has not always been that way in the 
past,'' said Leon Panetta, a former Clinton chief of staff and 
former House member. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lewinsky sex and coverup scandal has complicated things.  
</P>
<P>
	Daschle publicly accepted Clinton's denials of his relationship  
with the former White House intern. But the senator later demanded 
that the president stop the ``legal hairsplitting'' he was using to 
deny that he lied under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, Daschle rebuffed White House requests to organize  
support for Clinton in the Senate, and stopped his attacks on 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Daschle said Clinton had failed 
``a basic understanding of the standard of truthfulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now Daschle now is, in effect, a foreman for Democrats  
serving as jurors in the Senate impeachment trial, and Clinton 
needs his help more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Daschle said ``now is the time'' to dismiss the case  
and ``move on to the nation's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case carries risks for Daschle: how to punish Clinton, if he  
isn't removed from office, while making sure Democrats are not seen 
as defending the president's conduct or blamed for making the trial 
partisan. Also, both Democrats and Republicans are wary of what 
fallout there will be in the 2000 congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The party that appears to have turned this into a partisan  
battle potentially risks being seen as pursuing a particular agenda 
that is very different from the agenda of this country,'' said 
Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist who is advising Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said  
he thinks Daschle ``is off to a good start, keeping it bipartisan 
and keeping the focus on Clinton's offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has called Daschle ``a national resource'' who's ``good  
in a fight and ... also good at making a principled compromise.'' 
Their ties have been strengthened by Clinton's hiring of former 
Daschle aides, including John Podesta, now his chief of staff, and 
Larry Stein, the White House congressional liaison. 
</P>
<P>
	The improving relationship has paid dividends for Daschle.  
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, just as Starr's allegations against Clinton were  
being made public, the White House switched positions on farm 
disaster relief under pressure from Daschle. Then the president 
vetoed the Republican-backed measure, forcing GOP leaders to add 
$1.7 billion. One frustrated Republican called the minority leader 
``President Daschle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment trial, Daschle has stayed in constant  
contact with Podesta and spoken with Clinton several times, 
updating him on the proceedings as well as discussing farm 
problems, the State of the Union message and the Democrats' 
congressional agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has ``indicated an interest to me that he's following  
(the trial), but he hasn't been giving me anything other than his 
comments or reflections on how he perceives it's going,'' Daschle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain degree of autonomy and independence required  
here and I think they respect that,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has a daunting job ahead nevertheless.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the question of whether witnesses will be called for  
the impeachment trial, Daschle has to think about what happens 
after a vote on Clinton's conviction or acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, there is the problem of writing a resolution of  
censure that would pass the Senate. While there is wide support 
among Democrats for formally rebuking Clinton, according to 
Daschle, there are any number of ideas about how to do it, and many 
Republicans have indicated they do not think censure is 
constitutional.

<HEADLINE> NHL Old-Timers Revive Days of Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- It was a scene out of ``Slapshot,'' only  
three times the fun: 
</P>
<P>
	Gordie, Mark and Marty Howe skating through a rain of hockey  
sticks toward goaltender Pete Peeters on the first three-player 
penalty shot in hockey history. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeters stopped Mark and Marty, but not Gordie. And the ``NHL  
Heroes'' came back to tie the ``Sunbelt Heroes'' 2-2 in a 
fun-filled oldtimers game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was part of the NHL's ``All-Star Weekend'' to be capped  
by Sunday's All-Star Game at the Ice Palace, home of the Tampa Bay 
Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Linseman also scored for the NHL Heroes, who came back from  
a 2-0 deficit. Cammi Granato, one of the stars of the U.S. Women's 
gold medal-winning Olympic team, and Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne 
scored for the Sunbelt Heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all for fun right from the start, as the Sunbelt Heroes  
came out for introductions all wearing sunglasses. Referee Paul 
Stewart even wore a pair at one point, showing one player to the 
penalty box pretending to be blind and using a hockey stick as his 
cane. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, however, was able to see pretty clearly when he called  
``too many Howes on the ice'' to set up a penalty shot for Granato 
in the first period. Then when Granato, sister of the San Jose 
Sharks' Tony Granato, missed the first penalty shot, Stewart 
awarded another because goaltender Darren Pang ``tripped an 
American hockey champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She missed the second, as well, before connecting from the left  
side about 40 feet out with less than a minute left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Dionne made it 2-0 Sunbelt with a shot from the left circle with  
just eight minutes left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was his first goal of the season,'' the tongue-in-cheek  
announcer said over the loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunbelt's Rob Ramage later came out on the ice with a golf  
bag full of hockey sticks and handed one to Terry Crisp, the former 
Lightning coach who was playing one of the forward positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrong sportsmanlike conduct,'' the loudspeaker announcer  
thundered this time. ``All three Howes will take a penalty shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart then called for two more pucks and the Howes, who once  
skated on the same line in the old World Hockey Association, skated 
side by side from the neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunbelt players on the bench tossed a bunch of sticks on the  
ice and the trio stickhandled their individual pucks. They all shot 
at once -- and Gordie's got through. 
</P>
<P>
	There was then an ``oxygen timeout'' for the elder Howe, in his  
70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Linseman's slap shot from the top of the left circle with a  
little over a minute to go brought a sober end to the game, which 
featured two 12-minute periods and a continuously running clock.

	Attorney: Lewinsky Will Interview  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The attorney for Monica Lewinsky said the  
former White House intern will submit to an interview with House 
prosecutors. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, acting on House 
prosecutors' behalf, won the emergency interview order from a judge 
today. Soon after, Lewinsky flew to Washington as prosecutors in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial pressed to do the meeting 
quickly. A Starr spokesman said he would be willing to make 
Lewinsky available to White House questioning. Meanwhile, Sen. Tom 
Harkin, D-Iowa, asked Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to block 
the interview.

Trent Lott said today that Senate Republicans would submit written 
questions to President Clinton to resolve inconsistencies in the 
case. Within an hour, the White House said its lawyers -- not 
Clinton -- would respond. The developments came as Clinton's

witnesses.

choosing host cities -- on the eve of a watershed meeting that could 
determine the future of the Olympics. IOC officials are considering 
recommending expulsions of at least seven of their own members, an 
unprecedented action. The credibility of the International Olympic 
Committee -- and perhaps the future of the games themselves -- was at 
stake as officials concluded their investigation into the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal, which has set off the biggest corruption 
crisis in the organization's 105-year history.

their growing concern with the situation. Milosevic, meanwhile,

a massacre last week of 45 ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE>  Text of Starr's Motion for Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of motion by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel  
Monica Lewinsky to be debriefed by House managers: 
</P>
<P>
	The United States of America, by Kenneth W. Starr, Independent  
Counsel, respectfully submits this motion for an order requiring 
Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the terms of her Immunity Agreement 
(the ``Agreement'') with the Office of the Independent Counsel 
(``OIC''). Ms. Lewinsky has refused an OIC request that she be 
debriefed by the House of Representatives, as required by the 
Agreement. The United States respectfully requests that this Court 
order Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the Agreement by allowing herself 
to be debriefed. 
</P>
<P>
	I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND   	
</P>
<P>
	As this Court is no doubt aware, the United States Senate is  
currently conducting an impeachment trial of the president of the 
United States. According to public reports, it is expected that the 
House will be required to submit to the Senate its motion to 
witnesses as early as Monday, Jan. 25. Again according to public 
reports, some potential witnesses have spoken with the House 
managers as the managers attempt to determine which witnesses 
should be mentioned in their motion to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 21, 1999, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.  
Hyde, on behalf of the House of Representatives, as represented by 
its duly-appointed Managers, asked for the OIC's assistance in 
having Ms. Lewinsky debriefed by the House. The House stressed that 
it needs this debriefing to occur no later than Sunday, Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	That same day, the OIC sent a letter to Ms. Lewinsky's counsel  
requesting that Ms. Lewinsky allow herself to be debriefed by the 
House managers. At approximately 1:20 p.m. this afternoon, Ms. 
Lewinsky informed the OIC that she does not intend to comply with 
this request. 
</P>
<P>
	II. THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT PLAINLY REQUIRES MS. LEWINSKY TO BE  
DEBRIEFED BY ANY INSTITUTION THAT THE OIC SPECIFIES. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky will be fully debriefed concerning her knowledge of  
and participation in any activities within the OIC's jurisdiction. 
This debriefing will be conducted by the OIC, including attorneys, 
law enforcement agents, and representatives of any other 
institutions as the OIC may require. Ms. Lewinsky will make herself 
available for any interviews upon reasonable request. 
</P>
<P>
	By the plain terms of the Agreement, Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to  
be debriefed by representatives of any institution, when so 
required by the OIC. She is also required to ``make herself 
available for any interviews upon reasonable request.'' The duly 
appointed House Managers represent the House of Representatives, 
which plainly is an institution. The OIC has unambiguously 
requested that Ms. Lewinsky submit to such debriefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Accordingly, Ms. Lewinsky must allow herself to be debriefed by  
the House Managers or she will have violated the Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has the right to have her ``debriefing  
. . . conducted by the OIC.'' The OIC, of course, is fully willing 
to conduct these debriefings, if Ms. Lewinsky so desires. The 
suggestion in her counsel's letter that this provision is void if 
the OIC is ``acting as an agent for others,'' is contrary to the 
Agreement, as there is no such limitation on Ms. Lewinsky's duties. 
A party to an agreement may not invent clauses to a contract that 
are not contained therein. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the OIC is not acting as an agent for the House  
Managers. The OIC has its own, continuing duty to provide the House 
with information relating to impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's counsel's other suggestion -- that a debriefing  
would be contrary to Senate rules -- is equally without merit. 
Senate Resolution 16 states, in relevant part: 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate agrees to allow either the House or the  
President to call witnesses, the witnesses shall first be deposed 
and the Senate shall decide after deposition which witnesses shall 
testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is plain that depositions may not be conducted  
absent a vote of the Senate, nothing in this resolution restricts 
the ability of the House to debrief witnesses in a non-deposition 
setting. Indeed, it would be strange for the Senate to prohibit the 
House and the President from doing the investigation necessary to 
determine whether they wish to call witnesses and which witnesses 
to list in their motions. 
</P>
<P>
	III. THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT AN ORDER REQUIRING MS. LEWINSKY TO  
COMPLY WITH THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT OR FORFEIT ITS PROTECTION. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Agreement, this Court has the authority to determine  
whether Ms. Lewinsky has ``violated any provision of this 
Agreement.'' A declaratory judgment will ordinarily be granted only 
when it will either serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal 
relations in issue or terminate and afford relief from the 
uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding.'' In this case, a declaratory judgment will resolve the 
uncertainty arising from this controversy between the OIC and Ms. 
Lewinsky by settling whether she has the right to refuse to be 
debriefed without forfeiting the protections of the Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, declaratory judgment is a common remedy when a party to  
a contract intends conduct that may be a breach.: ``(A) party to a 
contract is not compelled to wait until he has committed an act 
which the other party asserts will constitute a breach, but may 
seek relief by declaratory judgment and have the controversy 
adjudicated in order that he may avoid the risk of damages or other 
untoward consequence.'' Accordingly, this Court has the power to 
issue a declaratory judgment before Ms. Lewinsky's actions become 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
	IV. CONCLUSION   	
</P>
<P>
	The Immunity Agreement plainly requires that Ms. Lewinsky allow  
herself to be debriefed by any institution at the request of the 
OIC. Ms. Lewinsky has the right to insist that the OIC conduct the 
debriefing, but she must comply with the plain terms of the 
Immunity Agreement. Accordingly, the United States respectfully 
requests that this Court enter an order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to 
submit to debriefing by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its motion to  
call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House has stressed its 
need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend. Accordingly, the United 
States respectfully requests that this Court act on this motion as 
an emergency matter. Specifically, we request a hearing on this 
matter today.

<HEADLINE>  Text of Starr's Motion for Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of motion by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel  
Monica Lewinsky to be debriefed by House managers: 
</P>
<P>
	The United States of America, by Kenneth W. Starr, Independent  
Counsel, respectfully submits this motion for an order requiring 
Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the terms of her Immunity Agreement 
(the ``Agreement'') with the Office of the Independent Counsel 
(``OIC''). Ms. Lewinsky has refused an OIC request that she be 
debriefed by the House of Representatives, as required by the 
Agreement. The United States respectfully requests that this Court 
order Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the Agreement by allowing herself 
to be debriefed. 
</P>
<P>
	I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND   	
</P>
<P>
	As this Court is no doubt aware, the United States Senate is  
currently conducting an impeachment trial of the president of the 
United States. According to public reports, it is expected that the 
House will be required to submit to the Senate its motion to 
witnesses as early as Monday, Jan. 25. Again according to public 
reports, some potential witnesses have spoken with the House 
managers as the managers attempt to determine which witnesses 
should be mentioned in their motion to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 21, 1999, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.  
Hyde, on behalf of the House of Representatives, as represented by 
its duly-appointed Managers, asked for the OIC's assistance in 
having Ms. Lewinsky debriefed by the House. The House stressed that 
it needs this debriefing to occur no later than Sunday, Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	That same day, the OIC sent a letter to Ms. Lewinsky's counsel  
requesting that Ms. Lewinsky allow herself to be debriefed by the 
House managers. At approximately 1:20 p.m. this afternoon, Ms. 
Lewinsky informed the OIC that she does not intend to comply with 
this request. 
</P>
<P>
	II. THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT PLAINLY REQUIRES MS. LEWINSKY TO BE  
DEBRIEFED BY ANY INSTITUTION THAT THE OIC SPECIFIES. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky will be fully debriefed concerning her knowledge of  
and participation in any activities within the OIC's jurisdiction. 
This debriefing will be conducted by the OIC, including attorneys, 
law enforcement agents, and representatives of any other 
institutions as the OIC may require. Ms. Lewinsky will make herself 
available for any interviews upon reasonable request. 
</P>
<P>
	By the plain terms of the Agreement, Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to  
be debriefed by representatives of any institution, when so 
required by the OIC. She is also required to ``make herself 
available for any interviews upon reasonable request.'' The duly 
appointed House Managers represent the House of Representatives, 
which plainly is an institution. The OIC has unambiguously 
requested that Ms. Lewinsky submit to such debriefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Accordingly, Ms. Lewinsky must allow herself to be debriefed by  
the House Managers or she will have violated the Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has the right to have her ``debriefing  
. . . conducted by the OIC.'' The OIC, of course, is fully willing 
to conduct these debriefings, if Ms. Lewinsky so desires. The 
suggestion in her counsel's letter that this provision is void if 
the OIC is ``acting as an agent for others,'' is contrary to the 
Agreement, as there is no such limitation on Ms. Lewinsky's duties. 
A party to an agreement may not invent clauses to a contract that 
are not contained therein. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the OIC is not acting as an agent for the House  
Managers. The OIC has its own, continuing duty to provide the House 
with information relating to impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's counsel's other suggestion -- that a debriefing  
would be contrary to Senate rules -- is equally without merit. 
Senate Resolution 16 states, in relevant part: 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate agrees to allow either the House or the  
President to call witnesses, the witnesses shall first be deposed 
and the Senate shall decide after deposition which witnesses shall 
testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is plain that depositions may not be conducted  
absent a vote of the Senate, nothing in this resolution restricts 
the ability of the House to debrief witnesses in a non-deposition 
setting. Indeed, it would be strange for the Senate to prohibit the 
House and the President from doing the investigation necessary to 
determine whether they wish to call witnesses and which witnesses 
to list in their motions. 
</P>
<P>
	III. THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT AN ORDER REQUIRING MS. LEWINSKY TO  
COMPLY WITH THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT OR FORFEIT ITS PROTECTION. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Agreement, this Court has the authority to determine  
whether Ms. Lewinsky has ``violated any provision of this 
Agreement.'' A declaratory judgment will ordinarily be granted only 
when it will either serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal 
relations in issue or terminate and afford relief from the 
uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding.'' In this case, a declaratory judgment will resolve the 
uncertainty arising from this controversy between the OIC and Ms. 
Lewinsky by settling whether she has the right to refuse to be 
debriefed without forfeiting the protections of the Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, declaratory judgment is a common remedy when a party to  
a contract intends conduct that may be a breach.: ``(A) party to a 
contract is not compelled to wait until he has committed an act 
which the other party asserts will constitute a breach, but may 
seek relief by declaratory judgment and have the controversy 
adjudicated in order that he may avoid the risk of damages or other 
untoward consequence.'' Accordingly, this Court has the power to 
issue a declaratory judgment before Ms. Lewinsky's actions become 
irreversible. 
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld the murder

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Ordered To Give Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge Saturday ordered Monica  
Lewinsky to submit to an interview sought by House prosecutors in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial or ``forfeit her 
protections'' under her immunity deal with Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats assailed Starr for intervening in the dispute. Ms.  
Lewinsky's attorney said she would comply with the judge's order 
but Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, asked Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist to block the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, acting on House prosecutors' behalf, won the emergency  
order from U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who said Ms. 
Lewinsky could do the interview with House managers directly or 
request that Starr's office be present. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky flew to Washington on Saturday as the House  
prosecutors pressed to do the interview quickly. ``We'll comply 
with it,'' her attorney, Jacob Stein, said of Johnson's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're, as I see it, duty bound to assist the House of  
Representatives and their managers in the process,'' Starr told TV 
crews staked out at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Charkes Bakaly, said later that: ``Under the same  
legal analysis that Judge Johnson ruled that we had to make Monica 
Lewinsky available for the House, we would be willing to make her 
available to the White House. If the White House were to ask us to 
do that, we would honor that request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House did not immediately take up Starr's offer. ``We  
are respecting the will of the Senate and abiding by its 
procedures, unlike the House managers,'' spokesman James Kennedy 
said late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, congressional sources who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said House prosecutors hoped to interview Ms. Lewinsky 
Sunday afternoon, but that final plans had not been made. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, former Clinton political adviser Dick  
Morris said he had agreed to meet with the House impeachment 
managers Sunday afternoon at a House office building. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers and Senate Democrats were outraged that House  
prosecutors sought to interview Ms. Lewinsky before the Senate 
decides whether witnesses will be called in the impeachment trial, 
and that they would not be allowed to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin's letter to Rehnquist said, ``such questioning would  
violate the Senate's sole authority under ... the Constitution to 
try impeachments'' because Senate trial rules require witnesses to 
be interviewed with both sides present. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said he was asking Rehnquist to use his authority as the  
presiding officer in the Senate trial to prevent Ms. Lewinsky from 
being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel Charles Ruff said during Saturday's  
question-and-answer period in the trial: ``No other lawyer that I 
know of gets to have a prosecutor sitting in the room with them and 
saying 'talk to these people or your immunity deal is gone and you 
go to jail.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff also suggested Starr had wrongly injected himself into the  
Senate impeachment trial and had become ``the moving force in the 
development of the truth and the facts,'' a role the Constitution 
had reserved for the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time that Starr has been accused of injecting  
himself in the impeachment drama. Starr's ethics adviser, Sam Dash, 
abruptly resigned to protest the prosecutor's decision to testify 
at House impeachment hearings late last year. Dash said Starr had 
wrongly become an advocate of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr denied those allegations. His office offered no comment  
Saturday, although House prosecutors firmly defended their request 
and Starr's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are they afraid of? Are they afraid of our talking to  
Monica Lewinsky?'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the House 
prosecutors, said. ``We're not doing anything abnormal. We are 
exercising our privileges, our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the 13 Republican House  
prosecutors, said the interview was necessary for the prosecutors 
to decide whether to submit Ms. Lewinsky's name to the Senate as a 
possible trial witness. Clinton has denied the House impeachment 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice growing out of his 
affair with the young woman and efforts to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky can resolve some of these crucial conflicts'' in  
previous testimony, McNulty said. ``This is lawyering 101 -- any 
good lawyer would talk to a witness before deciding to put her on 
the witness stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson ordered that Ms. Lewinsky ``allow herself to be  
debriefed by the House managers, to be conducted by the Office of 
Independent Counsel if she so requests, or forfeit her protections 
under the immunity agreement between Ms. Lewinsky and the OIC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minority Leader Tom Daschle and other Senate Democrats wrote  
House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde demanding that prosecutors stop 
efforts to interview Ms. Lewinsky and any other witness until ``the 
Senate has given you the authority to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle also denounced the House managers for ``their outright  
refusal to allow representatives of the Senate to be at the 
meetings'' or to get transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of secrecy, this unwillingness to cooperate with the  
Senate ... is as clear a demonstration of raw partisanship as I 
have seen to date on the Senate side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde responded that the House prosecutors had the authority to  
interview Ms. Lewinsky. ``It is not unfair, and it is not contrary 
to the rules of the Senate,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde sought Starr's help in a letter Thursday that cited Ms.  
Lewinsky's immunity agreement and said her lawyers had refused to 
make her available for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 28 immunity agreement said Ms. Lewinsky ``will testify  
truthfully before grand juries in this district and elsewhere, at 
any trials in this district and elsewhere, and in any other 
executive, military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers argued in a letter Friday to Starr that the immunity  
agreement ``does not require Ms. Lewinsky to be interviewed by the 
House Managers or any congressional body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's role in dealing with congressional witnesses with  
immunity deals is not new. In June 1995, his office sat in on an 
interview with Whitewater figure Webster Hubbell that was being 
conducted by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
At the time, Hubbell was a cooperating witness with Starr under the 
terms of a plea bargain.

<HEADLINE> Senators Argue Over Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial was  
thrust into turmoil today by House prosecutors' secret effort to 
force Monica Lewinsky to submit to questioning, prompting a White 
House attack on the maneuver from the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial reconvened, White House Counsel Charles Ruff,  
sarcasm in his voice, ridiculed a claim by the House prosecutors 
that they were merely seeking a routine interview with a potential 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had gone to court  
on behalf of the House, Ruff said, ``Can you imagine what that 
little conversation is going to look like, held in the independent 
counsel's office, with the people there who have the capacity to 
put Ms. Lewinsky in jail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK, to have one  
side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's 
office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity 
agreement if she doesn't fly across the country for this little 
chat? I think not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., dismissed the criticism, and  
suggestions Ms. Lewinsky would be mistreated. ``The White House 
counselors do not want to talk about the facts, the obstruction of 
justice. Just like in the house, they want to talk about the 
process, everything but the obstruction of justice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time the president tried to talk to (Oval Office  
secretary) Betty Currie, I don't think the president invited the 
independent counsel in. ... I didn't necessarily expect him to,'' 
said Hutchinson, one of the House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of Ms. Lewinsky dominated the opening moments of the  
trial session, a second day set aside for senators to pose 
questions to legal teams for and against Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling on Ms. Lewinsky came at the request of the House  
prosecutors. They were helped by Starr's office, which supported 
the claim that the young woman's immunity agreement obliged her to 
grant an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with her testimony actually here. It has  
everything to do with the right of anyone to prepare their witness. 
It is normal practice to do this,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not yet decided whether to call witnesses at  
Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But a legal source said U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson ruled today that Ms. Lewinsky had to submit to an interview 
with Starr and his staff to assist the trial and that House 
prosecutors could attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Johnson  
ruled that House prosecutors themselves had no right under her 
immunity deal with Starr to force Ms. Lewinsky to interview with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he opposed the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an inappropriate intervention of the judiciary in the  
proceedings of the Senate,'' Kerry said. ``It is a separation of 
powers problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the trial, senators began a second day of probing the  
two legal teams, submitting written questions through Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the House prosecutors,  
pleaded with senators not to end the trial and ``leave this 
confusion behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you leave us confused about whether or not this is a crime  
or not, the impact is far greater than if you rule that this is a 
crime but the political death penalty is not called for,'' he said, 
arguing senators should allow the trial go through to a final vote 
of the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial faces two crucial decisions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., a senior senator, said he will  
introduce a motion to dismiss the trial, providing senators a quick 
opportunity to end the case without hearing witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the move would fail and the question of calling  
witnesses then would be considered. The House move was an attempt 
to learn what Ms. Lewinsky would say at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and White House lawyers took turns Friday  
responding to some 50 written questions submitted by senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's announcement startled senators, who knew there would be a  
motion to dismiss but did not suspect it would be offered by a 
Democrat who has been no friend of the White House in the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said it was time to ``end this sad and sorry time for our  
country'' and declared that the 67 votes needed for Clinton's 
conviction and removal from office were ``not likely to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he made his decision ``not because I believe that the  
president did no wrong,'' but because ``it is necessary that we 
begin now the process of healing and reconciling the differences'' 
caused by Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, suggested his own exit strategy but  
said it would only be initiated after a decision on calling 
witnesses -- and after it was certain the two-thirds majority for 
conviction would not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	His resolution would adjourn the trial with language that would  
characterize the House impeachment vote as ``the ultimate 
condemnation for the president's despicable actions,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said approval of an early vote to dismiss the trial would  
be ``cavalier treatment'' of the House's case alleging perjury and 
obstruction of justice by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said, ``I don't know of any  
Republicans who will vote to dismiss'' and abruptly end the trial. 
Byrd's motion could lose on a party-line vote in a Senate 
controlled by Republicans, 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., called Byrd's announcement ``a  
significant move. He's highly respected on both sides of the aisle. 
The White House lawyers have raised a lot of doubts about the 
charges.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Vow Cleanup Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- On the eve of a watershed meeting  
that could determine the future of the Olympics, IOC leaders 
Saturday promised a major house-cleaning to root out corruption and 
reform the system for choosing host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day,'' executive board delegate Jacques Rogge  
said as IOC officials considered recommending expulsions of at 
least seven of their own members, an unprecedented action. ``But we 
will do what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The credibility of the International Olympic Committee -- and  
perhaps the future of the games themselves -- was at stake as 
officials concluded their investigation into the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal, which has set off the biggest corruption crisis in 
the organization's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fairly difficult times for the IOC,'' Australian  
board member Kevan Gosper said. ``I can assure you we will emerge 
stronger as a result of this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee led a chorus of support for embattled  
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has faced increasing 
calls from outside the organization to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important he stay in that position,'' USOC executive  
director Dick Schultz said. ``He certainly has our support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders also sought to control the damage from the latest  
revelations in the unfolding crisis -- that Australian officials 
used financial inducements to help Sydney win the right to stage 
the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the facts I have, I have no reason to believe that was  
bribery,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a sense of calm before the storm as IOC officials  
locked themselves inside their marble bunker on the shores of Lake 
Geneva to consider what action to take against members implicated 
in the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members were cited for accepting cash payments,  
scholarships, free medical care and other favors -- reportedly 
totaling close to $800,000 -- stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are cases among them that are just unacceptable, brutal  
corruption, when simply money was asked for,'' said Rogge, a 
Belgian who sits on the inquiry panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 13, Finland's Pirjo Haeggman and Libya's Bashir  
Mohamed Attarabulsi, resigned this week. Samaranch said another 
seven could face expulsion orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Chateau de Vidy, the IOC's headquarters, barriers  
were set up and police and security guards kept a close watch on 
scores of journalists gathered in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC cars whizzed past the media throng into an underground  
parking lot, allowing the inquisitors and the accused to enter the 
building through a private entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement, the IOC said the inquiry panel was in  
the ``final stages'' of its deliberations and would continue late 
into the night to complete its report before Sunday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the commission returned to their hotel early  
Sunday after meeting for more than 15 hours. None of the members 
would comment on the day's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said six members appeared before the commission in  
person to defend themselves. They were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who didn't appear will be judged on written replies  
submitted earlier to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will report its findings and recommendations to  
the executive board, including proposed expulsions and plans for 
overhauling the bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's final decisions will be announced Sunday night by  
Samaranch. The body is expected to recommend a ban on visits to bid 
cities by IOC members. There was apparently no agreement yet on 
whether the final selection of host cities should be left to a 
small body rather than the full IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations will be put to a special meeting of the  
general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	If members found guilty of corruption refuse to resign, their  
case will go to the assembly, where a two-thirds vote is required 
for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gosper said he saw nothing ``sinister'' in the  
$70,000 inducements offered by Australia's Olympics chief to two 
African IOC members. The payments were offered the night before 
Sydney beat Beijing by two votes in the 1993 election for the 2000 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates released  
documents showing annual $5,000 payments to Olympic committees in 
Kenya and Uganda from 1994 through 2000. The funding was contingent 
on Sydney winning the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper on Friday described the reported offer as going ``beyond  
goodwill'' and said it could lead to calls for the games to be 
stripped from Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he said he was ``comfortable'' with the payments  
after speaking with Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information has now been clarified,'' he said. ``While it  
has added a new dimension (to the scandal), I don't think there's 
anything sinister about that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unusual in any bid process for encouragements,  
incentives, to be part of the bid as long as they are out in the 
open,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said Sydney was caught in the same ``slippery slope'' as  
all bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put all the blame on IOC members or bid cities,'' he  
said. ``It's the system that creates the atmosphere that allows 
these things to happen. We've got to change the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC will discuss the Australian payments on  
Sunday and could order a full-scale investigation of Sydney's bid. 
He said he will propose that the board reaffirm that the games stay 
in Sydney and Salt Lake despite the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also said Samaranch retains the full confidence of the  
executive board and rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever we need a good president, an experienced president, we  
need him now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the 80-year-old Swiss executive board official who  
blew the whistle on alleged widespread corruption last month, also 
defended Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should he go?'' he said. ``If he goes, then I would have  
to go. All the honest people would have to go. It's the honest 
people who should stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shultz said he met with Samaranch for 45 minutes Saturday to  
lend his support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not uncommon when you have things like this, that people  
think this is a moment of weakness, that they can put a few chinks 
in the armor,'' he said. ``Let's just hope that's not happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the USOC had built up a constructive working  
relationship with Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to dance with who brung you, so to speak,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake, Olympic organizers braced for the IOC report and  
scheduled a news conference for Sunday. Among those taking part 
will be Frank Joklik, who resigned as president of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee two weeks ago as the scandal unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just awaiting for the report as is everyone else,'' SLOC  
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the selection of the next Olympic host city -- for the  
2006 Winter Games -- moved a big step forward as an IOC evaluation 
panel released its report on the six contenders, all from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the Swiss city of Sion was strong in sporting  
terms and had a sound financial base, excellent infrastructure and 
good environmental credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	It also generally praised the Italian bid from Turin but said  
its venues were too far apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Less glowing were evaluations of Klagenfurt, Austria; Helsinki,  
Finland; Poprad Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2006 host city will be picked in June.

<HEADLINE> How Olympics Got Tainted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- John Coates already was worried about  
Sydney's chances to win the 2000 Olympics when he flew to Africa. 
Once he landed in Mali, he found the bid was in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee, had  
seen Melbourne and Brisbane lose prior bids because they didn't woo 
IOC delegates aggressively enough -- especially African members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in Mali, and we had met at the airport and driven into  
the capital, and it was explained to me that the Chinese government 
is paying for this new highway,'' Coates said Saturday. ``Australia 
has some foreign aid, but not in that realm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He realized then, in 1993 and with the vote coming up, that  
Sydney might well lose, Coates told reporters in a lengthy 
explanation of how to win an Olympic bid against stiff competition 
from cities such as Beijing or Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney's ``clean, green'' Olympics bid, under pressure from  
developing-country IOC delegates and with big money at stake, 
became not so clean. And the green became the color of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates adamantly said that $70,000 in inducements he eventually  
pledged to try to secure two African votes on the night before the 
International Olympic Committee balloting was aid to sports and not 
a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the payments were contingent on Sydney winning the  
games. And his detailed descriptions and acknowledgement of 
five-figure cash offers aimed at swaying votes offer an 
extraordinary glimpse of the darker side of bidding for the world's 
biggest sports event, which can pump billions of dollars into a 
city's economy and boost the status of an entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is such payments and other gifts and benefits to IOC members  
from bidding cities that is at the heart of the Olympics' biggest 
corruption scandal, with recommendations of member expulsions and 
major reforms expected from a special meeting in Switzerland this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he visited Africa, Coates said, China was offering  
Cameroon ``variations to loan repayments,'' had built an addition 
to a hospital and offered other aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever we went, China, in many cases, had been before,''  
Coates said. ``I was also aware that Bob Scott, who was heading up 
the Manchester bid, had had a run-through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young had toured Africa  
dispensing U.S. foreign aid commitments in exchange for support for 
Atlanta's successful bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics. He offered 
no source for such information and no other evidence to corroborate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that others were offering more,'' he said. ``What  
we were doing was no different to what governments do with aid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coates called the Sydney bid committee to tell it to get serious  
if it wanted to host the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drafted the original strategies, and early on had identified  
that we had to do something in Africa,'' he said. ``I came to grips 
with that because I knew that's how Atlanta had achieved it, so I 
didn't feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the Australian public understands from this that there  
are developing countries and developing-nation Olympic committees 
who, under this system, are leveraging their IOC member's vote. I 
think that should be changed, but that is a process we went into 
with our eyes wide open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach Young in Atlanta on Saturday were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	Coates and the Sydney bid committee already had agreed to host  
two athletes from each of 11 African countries for three months of 
training at the Australian Institute of Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they decided to extend the offer for each year up to 2000 if  
Sydney won the games -- at a cost of about $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we did was within the guidelines, we did it just as China  
did it through their government aid and consulates and just as 
Manchester did it through the Millennium Foundation (fund), we did 
it through cooperation agreements with the Australian Olympic 
Committee,'' Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the crucial decision approached in September 1993, Sydney  
appeared to be losing ground to Beijing. Berlin and Manchester were 
by then out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw our votes being eaten away,'' Coates said.  
</P>
<P>
	He offered the Kenyan and Ugandan delegates free lodging in  
London at the Dorchester, one of the city's most expensive hotels, 
in order to meet with them privately before the vote in Monte Carlo 
-- away from Beijing's lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of trying to get them to lunches,  
dinners, whatever, and talk to them, and it was just very, very 
competitive,'' Coates said. ``That was the political game we were 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel room offer was declined, but Coates did not give up.  
</P>
<P>
	At a dinner in Monte Carlo Sept. 22, 1993, the night before the  
final vote, Coates decided not to sit at the head table in order to 
dine with crucial IOC members Charles Mukora of Kenya and Maj. Gen. 
Francis Nyangweso of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very concerned that night before the vote,'' Coates  
said. ``I just felt an unease, I knew these guys and I just didn't 
think the next day I was going to be able to count on them to vote 
for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, on the spot, he offered them $35,000 each for their  
respective national Olympic committees -- if Sydney won the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Sydney beat Beijing for the right to host the 2000  
Olympics, 45-43, in a secret ballot. The money was to be paid 
through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said there is no way of knowing whether Kenya and Uganda  
tipped the balance for Sydney: ``I'll die not knowing if those two 
voted for us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sydney had played the money marathon right and prevailed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't win it on the beauty of the city and the sporting  
facilities we had to offer, and we were never going to,'' Coates 
said. ``I wasn't going to die wondering why we didn't win.''

<HEADLINE> All-Stars Duel in Skills Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Bondra was the fastest skater by the  
slimmest of margins and Dominik Hasek scored as well as protected 
the net to lead the World All-Stars to victory Saturday night in 
the NHL SuperSkills Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek stopped five of six shots on the final round of the  
night-closing Breakaway Relay event to enable his team to hold off 
the North American All-Stars 13-11 at the Ice Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hasek was the only goaltender to score in the Goalies  
Goal competition, lifting the puck over a barrier in front his own 
net and sending it into the goal at the other end of the ice on the 
second of his two attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised I won the competition,'' the Buffalo Sabres star  
said, adding that he used what he described as a double-curved 
stick. ``I was surprised I hit the net. Usually it takes me five or 
six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other five goalies in the competition scored,  
although Carolina's Arturs Irbe and Nikolai Khabibulin of Phoenix -- 
both of the world team -- hit the post on at least one of their 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Ed Belfour came closest to scoring for North America,  
hitting the right post on his second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek may have considered his shot lucky, but others have come  
to expect such things from him. The only goal he allowed in the 
last round of the Breakaway Relay came on a rebound shot by 
Philadlephia's Eric Lindros. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing that he does surprises me,'' Anaheim's Teemu Selanne  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's Bondra circled the ice in 14.64 seconds to beat San  
Jose's Marco Sturm by one-hundredth of a second for fastest skater. 
Al MacInnis, of St. Louis, won the hardest shot event (98.5 mph) to 
edge Philadelphia's John LeClair (98.3 mph). 
</P>
<P>
	The world team won the Rapid Fire event, allowing five goals  
while scoring seven against North American goalies. Boston 
defenseman Ray Bourque was first in the accurate shooter 
competition for a first time, sharing the top spot this time with 
Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick of Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> McGinnis Won't Be Bears Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- There's one rule of football that  
doesn't change, from the Pop Warner leagues to the pros: Never, 
ever let go of the football until you've crossed the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	Guess Chicago Bears president Michael McCaskey didn't think that  
rule applied to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still fuming that McCaskey announced his hiring before they had  
a deal, Dave McGinnis withdrew from consideration for the Bears 
coaching job Saturday and went home to Arizona. It was further 
embarrassment for McCaskey and the Bears, still reeling from one of 
the worst personnel moves in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad for me,'' McGinnis told reporters at O'Hare  
Airport as he and his wife, Kim, waited to board a flight back to 
Phoenix. ``Again, I want to express, the city of Chicago, the 
Chicago Bears are very, very special. Obviously, we just couldn't 
reach an agreement. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears, meanwhile, weren't saying anything except to confirm  
that McGinnis had withdrawn. They'd said more than enough Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The debacle began Friday morning when the Bears announced they'd  
hold an afternoon news conference to introduce McGinnis, the 
Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator and a former Chicago 
assistant, as their new coach. They even changed the message on 
former coach Dave Wannstedt's voice mail to say, ``You have reached 
the office of head coach David McGinnis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was just one, slight problem: The Bears and McGinnis  
didn't have a deal. In fact, McGinnis reportedly was driving to 
Halas Hall for what he thought were further negotiations when he 
heard on the radio that he was the new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey tried -- unsuccessfully -- to smooth things over. An hour  
after the news conference was supposed to start, Ted Phillips, the 
Bears vice president of operations, said there had been a delay. 
After another 90 minutes, team spokesman Bryan Harlan said 
negotiations had broken down and McGinnis had left the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Oops.  
</P>
<P>
	``It started, obviously, with the announcement made before we  
had anything signed,'' McGinnis said. ``And it went downhill from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even a call from team chairman Ed McCaskey helped. McCaskey  
and his wife, Virginia, the daughter of founder George Halas, are 
friends of the McGinnises and have visited them in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after another meeting Saturday morning with Michael  
McCaskey, McGinnis called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the Chicago Bears. They're going to get a good guy in  
here to coach, I promise you,'' said McGinnis, who reportedly plans 
to stay with the Cardinals. ``They're going to be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the humiliation from McCaskey's overeagerness is going to  
overshadow the Bears for a long, long time. McGinnis is someone the 
Bears consider family. He was the linebackers coach for 10 years. 
He's friends with the McCaskey family. He even called the Bears job 
``anyone's dream'' on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If McCaskey, who once wrote a book called ``The Executive  
Challenge: Managing Change and Ambiguity,'' could blow McGinnis' 
hiring, what might happen with someone else? 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey doesn't have a football background -- he's a former  
professor at the Harvard Business School -- yet refuses to hire a 
general manager. He told Mark Hatley, the Bears vice president of 
player personnel, to put a list of potential coaches together and 
start interviewing, even though it was cutting into prime scouting 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the nine NFL teams that had coaching vacancies, only the  
Bears are still looking for someone. The Bears haven't said whether 
they'll choose from their remaining finalists -- Buffalo offensive 
coordinator Joe Pendry, Green Bay offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis 
and Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick Jauron -- or start over.

<HEADLINE>  Schmitt Clinches 7th Ski Jump Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAPPORO, Japan (AP) -- Martin Schmitt of Germany clinched his  
seventh victory of the season as he came from behind Saturday to 
win the first of this weekend's two ski jumping World Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt showed his best for the day in the second series,  
landing a 130.5-meter jump and earning a total of 261.9 points on 
the large hill of Mount Okura. He was third with a 127.5-meter jump 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Schmitt's first triumph in seven World Cup events,  
including the last two which he had skipped because of a cold and 
swollen tonsils. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I had a better jump in the first leg in which I was in  
control throughout,'' said Schmitt. ``In the second try, I swayed a 
little at the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Hideharu Miyahira, who jumped 123.5 meters for fourth  
place in the first series, also flew 130.5 meters in the second 
round to finish as runnerup with a total of 260.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I had my best finish of the season, I look forward to  
having a better result tomorrow and subsequent events,'' said 
Miyahira. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Dieter Thoma, who made the day's longest jump of 135.5  
meters in the first leg, had an unimpressive distance of 120.0 
meters in the second round to place third at 253.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I finally have regained my style after the knee  
injury and operation last June,'' said Thoma, who is ranked 12th on 
the World Cup standings. He said it was his seventh operation on 
his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic large hill champion Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan was fourth  
with 246.4 points, followed by his compatriot Hiroya Saitoh who had 
a total of 241.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup leader Janne Ahonen of Finland jumped 119.0 and 119.5  
meters to finish eighth.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Keenan Questions Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A frustrated Mike Keenan says  
he's heard nothing from team management to convince him published 
reports he'll be fired as the Vancouver Canucks coach are not true. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Sun said Saturday that Keenan would be fired  
before the Canucks' next game -- Thursday against St. Louis -- and be 
replaced with Marc Crawford, the former coach of the Colorado 
Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm assuming it's a fait accompli,'' Keenan told radio station  
CKNW in Vancouver on Saturday night. ``I just wish someone would 
have the courtesy of making a phone call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks general manager Brian Burke, who was supposed to be in  
Tampa, Fla., for Sunday's NHL all-star game, didn't immediately 
return telephone calls. The Canucks had no comment on the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke didn't participate in a scheduled CBC television panel  
Saturday in Tampa and there was speculation he may be flying back 
to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tampa, Canucks forward Markus Naslund was in the dark as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reporter told me about it -- I don't know anything,'' said  
Naslund, whose World All-Star team will meet the North America 
All-Stars on Sunday. ``It's a tough situation, we're struggling so 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your team is not winning, something happens. You either  
make a trade or fire the coach. I can't comment until something 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who led the New York Rangers to a Stanley Cup  
championship in 1994, was hired as the Canucks coach in November 
1997 after Tom Renney was fired. In 63 games last year, he had a 
21-30-12 record and missed the playoffs for the first time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks are 15-24-6 this season and are battling for the  
final playoff spot in the weak Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan defended his record, noting the team has played all  
season without Pavel Bure, a 51-goal-scorer last year who sat out 
to back his trade demand. He was traded to the Florida Panthers 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also has been hurt by with injuries, losing Todd  
Bertuzzi (broken leg), Alex Mogilny (knee and kidney), and Mark 
Messier (concussion). 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us are happy with the record,'' Keenan said. ``We had  
three of our top four forwards out for most of the season. We 
stayed competitive. I think the players have worked extremely hard. 
I've been very proud of what they've been able to accomplish on 
most evenings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the season Burke has publicly supported Keenan, but did  
say he would evaluate his coach's performance after the Bure trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, without citing sources, said Burke is unhappy with  
Keenan because the team's young players aren't developing properly; 
that players have complained about not working on special teams 
during practice; and he doesn't take advantage of his assistant 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also suggestions of friction within the team because  
Keenan scheduled a team practice on the eve of the All-Star break, 
but allowed Messier, the Canucks captain, to skip the workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, 37, stepped down as the Avalanche's coach last spring  
after Colorado was knocked out of the first round of the Stanley 
Cup playoffs. Once considered one of the league's up-and-coming 
coaches, Crawford's star was tarnished when the Avalanche didn't 
play to their potential and he failed to coach Canada to a medal at 
last year's Winter Olympic Games in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, who played for the Canucks in the 1980s, was  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who also took the Philadelphia Flyers and Chicago  
Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup finals, expressed frustration that 
neither Burke, nor anyone with team owners Orca Bay Sports and 
Entertainment, had contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I, sitting here all day wondering if somebody is  
going to call us, is quite disturbing to say the least,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Impeachment Trial-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Saturday's impeachment trial against President  
Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``We were obviously dismayed at the role the independent counsel  
chose to follow. Rather than simply sending information to the 
House that might bear on possible impeachable offenses, but rather 
to drive his van up to the building and unload unscreened, 
undiluted boxes of information which thereafter made their way, at 
least in part, into the public domain.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been accused by manager Hutchinson and others of always  
talking about process. Of always falling back on process. Well, I 
suggest, senators, that process is what our justice system is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Process is what we've always relied on to protect everyone  
against the vaunted power of the state, in this case, not just the 
managers but the state embodied in the independent counsel.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Can reasonable people disagree with the conclusion that as a  
matter of law he must be convicted and removed from office -- yes or 
no?'' -- Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely.'' -- Graham, R-S.C.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our judgment, and I think a fair judgment, that we  
should be allowed and are permitted under any of the rules normal 
to all of this, to request of the Office of Independent Counsel the 
opportunity to talk to Monica Lewinsky, which we otherwise 
apparently were not going to be had, able to have, as in normal 
course of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me wonder, with all of the complaints that are going  
on here, from the White House attorneys, about this and their 
desire not to have witnesses, what they're afraid of. Are they 
afraid of our talking to Monica Lewinsky? Are they afraid of the 
deposition of Monica Lewinsky? Are they afraid of what she might 
say out here? I don't think they should be, but they appear to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not doing anything abnormal. We're exercising our  
privileges, our rights.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., House 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were a prosecutor and you had a prosecutorial arm, which  
you do in the case of the independent counsel Office, that had an 
immunity agreement, as there is in this case, you certainly would 
not hesitate if you had a recalcitrant witness who you needed to 
call, to utilize that immunity agreement.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no constitutional barrier certainly to the Senate's  
passing a censure motion, in whatever form it chooses, whether 
adopting language from the articles or creating language of its 
own. We might at the end of the day disagree with you about whether 
the language is justified or whether it accurately reflects the 
facts. But there is nothing in the Constitution I believe that 
prevents this body from undertaking that task.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone contends that if the president is  
acquitted that suddenly it's `Apocalypse Now' or the republic will 
be threatened from without or from within. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think erosion can happen very slowly, but very  
deliberately.'' -- Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., House manager. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We must confront the fact that the president is the  
commander-in-chief, and I believe that it is perfectly acceptable 
of the American people to demand of the military the highest 
standard, which also means that those of whom find themselves in 
positions of responsibility in the Pentagon, of whom are in 
civilian leadership, must also live by such exemplary conduct and 
standards.'' -- Buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Military leaders are required to provide a good example to  
those young recruits, yet when they look up the chain of command 
all the way to the commander in chief, they see a double standard 
at the top.'' -- Buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The independent counsel investigated this case for eight  
months. It developed every bit of evidence it could that was 
negative, derogatory or prejudicial, and it put them into those 
five volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did not pursue exculpatory leads. It did not follow up  
evidence that might lead to evidence of innocence, and it 
downplayed, when it came to write the referral, significant 
testimony which was exculpatory or helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the independent counsel's process was really  
epitomized by Ms. Lewinsky's statement that `nobody asked her to 
lie or had promised her a job for silence.''' -- David Kendall, 
presidential attorney.

<HEADLINE>  Chandler &AMP; Elway, Contrasting QBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- John Elway still has that all-American look,  
although his golden hair is darkening as he approaches 40. Chris 
Chandler at 33 is balding and a bit stoop-shouldered. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no better symbols of the Denver Broncos vs. the  
Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway will finish his career by starting at quarterback in a  
Super Bowl for a record fifth time; Chandler is a journeyman who 
has played for six teams, almost all bad, in 11 NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Chandler's new teammates wondered when the Falcons got him  
from the Oilers two years ago for almost nothing -- fourth and 
sixth-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he arrived here, we're all like, `We traded for him? He's  
going to be our quarterback?' '' said Jamal Anderson, the Falcons' 
All-Pro running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Jamal, he is your quarterback and you're happy to have him  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Chandler got Atlanta to the title game by completing  
27 of 43 passes for 340 yards, directing a 71-yard drive for the 
tying touchdown, then a 70-yarder for the winning field goal in the 
30-27 overtime win at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: A team that was a 100-1 to win the Super Bowl at the  
start of the season -- and 3-13 two years ago -- is in the NFL's 
ultimate game for the first time after 32 seasons in which it went 
184-298-5. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Chandler was better than Elway, at least  
statistically. His rating was 100.9, seven points higher than 
Elway's, and he surprised even himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still hard to realize that I've gotten this far,'' said  
Chandler, who never had been to a playoff game in his first 10 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast between Elway and Chandler starts from the  
beginning of their pro careers -- about all they had in common were 
Pac-10 backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway entered the NFL in 1983 from Stanford with so much  
potential that he was able to dictate his own terms. He told the 
Baltimore Colts, who had the No. 1 pick in the draft, that he 
didn't want to play for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts picked him anyway, then traded him to the Broncos.  
After a predictably erratic start, Elway has fulfilled every 
expectation, leading Denver to five Super Bowls, winning his first 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a guy in the NFL who  
symbolized his town like John Elway,'' said Shannon Sharpe, the 
Broncos' tight end. ``If you think of Denver, you don't think of 
skiing. You think of John Elway. It's always been John, and even if 
he retires, it will still always be John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was a ``maybe'' coming out of the University of  
Washington in 1988, a third-round draft pick by Indianapolis. His 
arm was strong and his head was good, but his mobility and 
durability were suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ensuing decade, he went from the Colts to the Bucs,  
Cardinals, Rams, Oilers and finally the Falcons, playing until this 
season on only one winning team -- the 1988 Colts, who were 9-7 -- 
and living up to his injury-prone reputation by never playing all 
16 games in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may have had something to do with his supporting cast,  
particularly the offensive line. Overall, the teams he played for 
in his first 10 seasons had a combined record of 62-98 and he often 
was a victim of front-office floundering. The Bucs, who gave up a 
first-round pick for him in 1991, released him outright six games 
into the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he couldn't  
stay in one piece,'' said George Young, the NFL's senior 
vice-president for football operations, who as general manager of 
the Giants had some interest in Chandler. ``When players get a rap 
for being injury prone, people finally give up on them or decide 
they don't want to take the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ask Chandler's father-in-law, John Brodie, who played  
quarterback for the 49ers from 1957-73, and you get a different 
perspective. They talk weekly and Brodie serves as unofficial coach 
and cheerleader for his son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see a quarterback and all the pieces come together it  
never comes together right away,'' Brodie said. ``It develops over 
a period of time and you never know the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early in his career, he had no support, no one was in his  
corner. Everyone was looking for him to fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was looking for Elway to fail and he hasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	He's combined athleticism, brains and a strong arm with the  
ability to be at his best under pressure. He's led 47 
fourth-quarter drives that have tied or won games for Denver, the 
most famous a 98-yarder that tied the 1986 AFC title game that sent 
the Broncos to their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, until last season, Super Bowls were the only blemish on  
Elway's record. He had lost three, all on Denver teams coached by 
Dan Reeves, who will lead Atlanta against the Broncos in next 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the AFC championship against the Jets, Elway was only  
13-of-34 for 173 yards, while Terrell Davis was carrying the Denver 
offense. The Broncos won 23-10 in what was almost surely Elway's 
final game at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he took a victory lap, acknowledging the fans who  
have watched him work his magic for 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel comfortable, taking that lap,'' Elway said.  
``But I'm glad I did it. I had a chance to see the fans and look 
into their eyes, to really concentrate on them. They were so 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one in Minnesota wanted a victory lap from Chandler after he  
saved the game for Atlanta. But Reeves drew some comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him after we went down there and tied the score, that  
ranks right up there with any of the big-time quarterbacks,'' 
Reeves said. ``He's done it with the pressure on him, made some 
big-time throws, did it after being hurt from the scramble, hung in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to see how well Chandler does under the ultimate  
pressure against a quarterback who in five years will be an almost 
automatic choice for the Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Drivers View Speeding As a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixty percent of American drivers think  
speeding by others is a threat to their personal safety, but they 
also admit to some risky road behavior of their own, according to a 
government survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent reported entering an intersection within the  
previous week just as the stoplight was turning red. A quarter 
reported not completely stopping at a stop sign. Twenty-three 
percent said they had driven more than 10 mph over the speed limit 
on an interstate in the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was the first comprehensive look by the government at  
speeding and unsafe driving conditions. It was released at the 
start of a two-day symposium on aggressive driving. Its findings 
prompted top transportation officials to declare their commitment 
to stricter enforcement of the nation's traffic laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can shift the paradigm on aggressive driving penalties just  
as we shifted the paradigm on drunken driving penalties,'' 
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater told the symposium 
attendees, largely lawyers, police officers and judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``No longer can these offenders expect a slap on the wrist.  
There will be serious judicial consequences for their actions,'' 
Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering a personal testimonial was Cheryle Adams, a pedestrian  
whose legs were crushed when two drivers ran a red light as she 
crossed a street in Washington in June 1993. To this day, Adams 
faces the threat of amputation of both limbs. The driver who hit 
her received a traffic citation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live with pain every day,'' Adams said, breaking into tears.  
``I think it is time to focus on enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration. It was conducted in two parts from Feb. 20 to April 
11, 1997. One sample focused on speeding and involved 3,000 drivers 
over age 16. The other focused on unsafe driving in general and 
also involved 3,000 drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The margin of error for the full sample was plus or minus 1.3  
percentage points. The margin for the partial survey on speeding 
was 2.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey asked drivers what kinds of unsafe behavior they  
usually encounter on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	They responded: cars weaving in and out of traffic, 24 percent;  
tailgating, 17 percent; driver inattention, 15 percent; unsafe lane 
changes, 10 percent; unsafe passing, 9 percent; ignoring stop 
signs, 8 percent; failing to yield, 6 percent; drinking and 
driving, 5 percent, and running red lights, 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that age and gender are two important  
factors in unsafe driving. In general, men were more likely than 
women to report committing all 21 types of unsafe behavior examined 
in the survey. At the same time, the proportion of drivers engaging 
in unsafe behavior declined as age increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest drivers, divided into sets of 16-20 and 21-24 years  
of age, reported the highest levels of stop-sign running -- 81 
percent and 71 percent, respectively -- and weaving between lanes -- 
63 percent and 60 percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ricardo Martinez, director of NHTSA, said the evidence shows  
the need for aggressive traffic enforcement. Often, he said, patrol 
officers are diverted from the roads to other venues in search of 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said the study shows the most dangerous people are  
often on the road.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Harkin's Letter to Rehnquist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Letter Saturday from Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to Chief Justice  
William H. Rehnquist regarding a federal district judge's ruling on 
interviewing Monica Lewinsky: 

</P>
<P>
	Dear Mr. Chief Justice:  

</P>
<P>
	I am writing you on a matter of significant constitutional  
consequence. I ask you, as presiding officer of this Court of 
Impeachment, to issue an order in protection of this court's ``sole 
power to try impeachment'' to prohibit any questioning by or on 
behalf of the House Managers of any witness pursuant to the January 
23, 1999, order of the District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. 
Such questioning would violate the Senate's sole authority under 
Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution to try impeachments and 
would be a clear violation of the procedures adopted unanimously by 
this Senate for the conduct of this trial. It is up to the Senate, 
not the Independent Counsel or any Article III district judge, to 
determine the procedures under which the House Managers or White 
House Counsel may interview witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In support of my request, I cite the Supreme Court's opinion in  
U.S. v. Nixon, wherein the Supreme Court held, and I quote: ``The 
first sentence in Article I, Section 3 is a grant of authority to 
the Senate, and the word 'sole' indicates that this authority is 
reposed in the Senate and nowhere else. ...Judicial involvement in 
impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of judicial 
review, is counterintuitive because it would eviscerate the 
'important constitutional check' placed on the Judiciary by the 
Framers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Independent Counsel may be interviewing Ms. Lewinsky as  
early as tomorrow morning, I ask that you give prompt consideration 
of this matter. Thank you for your consideration of my request. 

</P>
<P>
	Sincerely,  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Harkin  
</P>
<P>
	United States Senator  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Swiss City Praised for 2006 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss city of Sion received a  
glowing review Saturday from an IOC panel assessing the six bids 
for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee's Evaluation Commission said  
Sion was strong in sporting terms and had a sound financial base, 
excellent infrastructure and good environmental credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	The report generally praised the Italian bid from Turin but said  
its venues were too far apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It raised serious doubts about the multi-country bids involving  
Klagenfurt, Austria, and Helsinki, Finland, saying those posed 
major logistical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And it questioned whether Poprad Tatry in Slovakia and Zakopane  
in Poland had the necessary infrastructure and finances to host the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission issued its report under the shadow of the  
corruption scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to limit future chance for bribery, the IOC Executive  
Committee this weekend is expected to recommend overhauling bidding 
procedures for the games. Proposals include banning visits of IOC 
members to candidate cities and leaving the selection to a small 
group rather than the full IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new streamlined system would be submitted for approval by  
the general assembly at a special session March 17-18. If ratified, 
it would be in place for the selection of the 2006 host at the June 
IOC session in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiharu Igaya, chairman of the Evaluation Commission, said he  
was confident that the host city could be decided on the basis of 
the bid documents and evaluation report alone rather than by full 
site visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should be sufficient for them to give a fair judgment on  
which city could host it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, which lost out to Salt Lake City as host for the 2002  
Olympics, has long been considered a front-runner, slightly ahead 
of Turin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sports concept is well thought out, with the Olympic  
Village centrally located in Sion, the ice sports in the Rhone 
Valley and the skiing events in the mountains on either side of the 
city,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the transport plan was very good and there were adequate  
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion 2006 director-general Jean-Daniel Mudry said he was happy  
with the report. 
</P>
<P>
	On Turin, the report criticized the fact that organizers wanted  
to stage hockey and skating in Turin and other sports like skiing 
in the Suse valley in Pragelato. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the existing infrastructure, the Evaluation  
Commission believes that the sports concept should be more 
concentrated,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	It criticized the fact that most of the ice rinks in Turin would  
be dismantled after the event. 
</P>
<P>
	But Turin officials remained upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I learn from the report is that Sion is ready to host the  
games and that Turin is capable but needs more time,'' Marco San 
Pietro said. ``But it's a matter of months, not years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main fault of Helsinki was the proposal to stage the Alpine  
skiing events in Lillehammer in Norway because of the lack of 
mountains in Finland, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whilst the individual venues are excellent, the distance  
between Helsinki and Lillehammer and the fact that a large portion 
of the games will be held in Norway may lead to organizational and 
operational burdens,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the Klagenfurt bid -- which also includes  
neighboring Italy and Slovenia ``represents the original concept of 
an Olympic games beyond borders between Austria, Italy and 
Slovenia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This concept presents interesting aspects but also potential  
organizational difficulties,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the distances involved were too big, it said. If  
Slovenia still was outside the European Union in 2006 this would 
complicate border crossings and security, it pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Igaya said in general, joint bids posed a ``big challenge.''  
</P>
<P>
	The report found major problems with the bid of Poprad-Tatry.  
These included lack of guaranteed funding for the Olympic Village, 
insufficient quality venues and lack of a nearby international 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Evaluation commission believes that the costs of building  
infrastructure for and putting on the Olympic Games will be a 
significant challenge to the financial resources of both the public 
and private sectors in Slovakia,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports, hotel and transportation facilities all needed upgrading  
in Zakopane, the report said. It added that there also were 
questions about the budget.

<HEADLINE> Schmitt Clinches 7th Ski Jump Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAPPORO, Japan (AP) -- Martin Schmitt of Germany clinched his  
seventh victory of the season as he came from behind Saturday to 
win the first of this weekend's two ski jumping World Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt showed his best for the day in the second series,  
landing a 130.5-meter jump and earning a total of 261.9 points on 
the large hill of Mount Okura. He was third with a 127.5-meter jump 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Schmitt's first triumph in seven World Cup events,  
including the last two which he had skipped because of a cold and 
swollen tonsils. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I had a better jump in the first leg in which I was in  
control throughout,'' said Schmitt. ``In the second try, I swayed a 
little at the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Hideharu Miyahira, who jumped 123.5 meters for fourth  
place in the first series, also flew 130.5 meters in the second 
round to finish as runnerup with a total of 260.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I had my best finish of the season, I look forward to  
having a better result tomorrow and subsequent events,'' said 
Miyahira. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Dieter Thoma, who made the day's longest jump of 135.5  
meters in the first leg, had an unimpressive distance of 120.0 
meters in the second round to place third at 253.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I finally have regained my style after the knee  
injury and operation last June,'' said Thoma, who is ranked 12th on 
the World Cup standings. He said it was his seventh operation on 
his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic large hill champion Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan was fourth  
with 246.4 points, followed by his compatriot Hiroya Saitoh who had 
a total of 241.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup leader Janne Ahonen of Finland jumped 119.0 and 119.5  
meters to finish eighth.

<HEADLINE>  IOC Meets About Bribery Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The credibility and future of the  
IOC was at stake today as Olympic leaders began considering whether 
to expel members accused in the biggest corruption scandal in the 
games' history. 
</P>
<P>
	As the rapidly growing crisis spread to the 2000 Sydney  
Olympics, a special IOC panel met under tight security to conclude 
its investigation into bribery allegations surrounding Salt Lake 
City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Australia's top IOC official said he saw nothing  
``sinister'' in the $70,000 inducements offered by Australia's 
Olympics chief to two African delegates the night before Sydney won 
the vote for the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the facts I have, I have no reason to believe that was  
bribery,'' executive board member Kevan Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper said the IOC will discuss the Australian payments on  
Sunday and could order a full-scale investigation of Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement released in the evening, the IOC said it  
was in the ``final stages'' of its Salt Lake City inquiry. The 
six-member panel was to work late into the night to complete its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members were implicated in the Salt Lake scandal over  
cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and other favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Two members resigned this week, and IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said as many as seven others face the possibility of 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day,'' said Jacques Rogge, a Belgian member of  
the inquiry panel. ``But we will do what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are cases among them that are just unacceptable, brutal  
corruption, when simply money was asked for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-man commission will report its findings and  
recommendations to the executive board Sunday. The board will then 
propose expulsions and announce plans for overhauling the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who headed the internal  
investigation, declined to comment today as he headed into the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In extraordinary scenes, barricades were set up outside the IOC  
headquarters on the shores of Lake Geneva. Police and security 
guards kept a close watch on the scores of journalists gathered in 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials avoided the media crush by driving into the  
underground parking lot and entering the building through a private 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamine Keita, the IOC member from Mali who is among the 13  
delegates implicated, arrived in midmorning to appear before the 
panel to defend himself in person. Others appeared throughout the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news briefing early this afternoon, Gosper -- who is not on  
the inquiry panel -- said the commission would continue working 
throughout the day. He said there had been no further resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing ``due process reasons,'' Gosper declined to reveal the  
names of any of the IOC members who appeared to defend themselves. 
He said the executive board Sunday would propose ``appropriate 
action against any members who have clearly violated the rules of 
the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The International Olympic Committee will not tolerate  
improprieties of any kind,'' Gosper said. ``The IOC will act very 
decisively to ensure that all of our members strictly adhere to the 
IOC rules and to the oath they all swore to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fairly difficult times for the IOC,'' he said. ``I  
can assure you we will emerge stronger as a result of this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC was shaken Friday by revelations that Sydney bidders  
made $70,000 inducements for two African votes the night before 
they won the Summer Games for 2000 -- by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates released  
documents showing annual $5,000 payments to Olympic committees in 
Kenya and Uganda from 1994 through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the payments were offered to get votes from Kenya's  
Charles Mukora and Uganda's Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso the night 
before the IOC ballot in Monte Carlo on Sept. 22, 1993. The offer 
was contingent on Sydney winning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates told the 
Sydney Morning Herald. ``My view was it might encourage them to 
consider their votes for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney beat Beijing 45-43 in the secret balloting.  
</P>
<P>
	Gosper on Friday described the reported offer as going ``beyond  
goodwill'' and said, ``I can't rule it out that some may call for 
the games not to proceed in Sydney. I could see the published 
material being viewed as questionable conduct by the candidate 
city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper, in a clear damage control exercise, attempted to put  
a more positive spin on the case today. He said he was now 
``comfortable'' with the payments after speaking with Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information has now been clarified,'' he said. ``While it  
has added a new dimension (to the scandal), I don't think there's 
anything sinister about that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coates said he pledged the money to African officials  
because he thought Sydney's chances were ``slipping away.'' He said 
the payments were within IOC guidelines and were similar to plans 
used by bidding competitors from Beijing and Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said Coates was doing all he could up until the last  
minute to secure votes. He said the inducements stemmed from a 
legitimate assistance program for African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unusual in any bid process for encouragements,  
incentives, to be part of the bid as long as they are out in the 
open,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper reiterated he will propose that the executive board  
reaffirm that the games will go ahead in Sydney and Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the executive board may still decide to order an inquiry  
into the Sydney bid. If so, Gosper said the panel should be 
different from the one that looked into the Salt Lake scandal and 
should not be limited to executive board members. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite mounting calls from outside the IOC for Samaranch to  
resign over the widening scandals, Gosper said the president 
retains the full confidence of the executive board and general 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever we need a good president, an experienced president, we  
need him now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Wolves Deal With Gugliotta Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tom Gugliotta finally made up his mind  
Saturday, allowing Joe Smith and the Minnesota Timberwolves to move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days of confusion and one more round of discussions  
with Wolves owner Glen Taylor, Gugliotta decided to leave Minnesota 
for Phoenix and a six-year contract worth about $60 million, about 
$27 million less than he could have had in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	That baffled the Wolves, who gave Gugliotta a chance to revive  
his career four years ago and then made the biggest contract offer 
anyone in the NBA could have just two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing has been confusing, not only for us but I'm  
sure for him,'' coach Flip Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	And for Smith, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 overall pick in the 1995 draft, Smith agreed Friday to  
a relatively paltry one-year, $1.75 million contract in exchange 
for his own chance to re-establish himself as one of the NBA's 
bright young players. But he put off signing the deal -- ``Joe said, 
`Let's everybody wait,''' Kevin McHale said -- until he was certain 
there was no chance of Gugliotta staying put. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a relief, but going by their word I kind of forgot  
about (Gugliotta's situation),'' Smith said. ``I'm just trying to 
focus on getting better here and not worrying about who was coming 
back. I just had to make sure I was comfortable here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith still hadn't officially signed even after participating in  
some drills during both practices Saturday. But McHale, Minnesota's 
vice president of basketball operations, said the contract was ``on 
the fax as we speak'' after the night workout concluded. He 
guaranteed that Smith would play for the Wolves this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor talked Saturday with Gugliotta and his agent, Richard  
Howell, who had wanted the Wolves to help his client find an option 
other than Phoenix. Neither Taylor nor Howell returned telephone 
messages Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the hand-wringing over who would play power forward in  
Minnesota -- Gugliotta, Smith or both -- apparently was resolved. 
That left the Wolves with one of the most improved teams in the 
league despite the loss of Gugliotta, who was an All-Star two 
seasons ago before a foot injury cut his season in half a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Smith, Malik Sealy, Dean Garrett and Bobby  
Jackson has given Minnesota more talent, more depth and more speed 
than they had last May, when they nearly knocked off Seattle in the 
first round of the Western Conference playoffs without Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves also appeared to have team harmony, something that  
would have been in question if Gugliotta had stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going toward the championship, that's our goal,'' Taylor  
said Friday. ``To be the championship team you really have to have 
people -- players, coaches, everybody -- who want to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's puzzling decision to turn down an extra $27 million  
made it obvious there were significant issues that pushed him to a 
new organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It is widely believed that Gugliotta's biggest problem in  
Minnesota was a clash of styles with point guard Stephon Marbury, 
even though Saunders said he never sensed a rift he would have 
considered big enough to drive Gugliotta away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that Steph helped Tommy a lot as far as getting  
open,'' Saunders said. ``... I always kid Tommy, because one of his 
strengths is his ability to pass, he likes to have the ball in his 
hands. He likes to make plays, too. So Tommy is tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves were shocked a week ago when it became apparent  
Gugliotta seriously was considering other options, and Saunders 
said he never had a chance to talk with him about any conflicts. 
The coach seemed disappointed Gugliotta chose to leave instead of 
letting the organization try to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Wolves proved in the past by trading problem  
players like Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider that they were 
willing to do whatever it takes to promote good chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's the thing it boils down to,'' Saunders said. ``As a  
player, you have to have enough confidence in the organization to 
deal with situations. We've done it in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves also believe Howell hurt the situation by conjuring  
the prospect of a trade that would have sent Gugliotta to the Los 
Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell also represents Lakers backup center Elden Campbell, who  
is unhappy in Los Angeles and was mentioned along with Eddie Jones 
as a principal in a potential Gugliotta trade. The Wolves never 
would have made such a swap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when the Lakers thing was thrown out there -- and  
speaking to Richard, he thought that was very much of a viable 
option -- I think that intrigued Tommy,'' Saunders said. ``But I 
think all that did is it muddied the waters for everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Masters Has Norman, Strong Amateurs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There probably won't be any special invitations to the Masters  
this year, but that doesn't mean there won't be Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	The invitation list released Saturday by Augusta National Golf  
Club contains the most amateurs in 11 years, along with five 
Americans who might otherwise not have been invited except for 
sweeping changes in the qualification system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Masters announced last year it would take the top 50 players  
in the Official World Golf Ranking from the end of 1998, which 
allows Norman to return to Augusta for another try at the elusive 
green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	The change did not have a significant impact on the size of the  
field -- 90 of the 99 players on the initial invitation list are 
expected to play, which is about the same size it has been the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman almost certainly would have received a special invitation  
that Augusta National traditionally sends to international players 
at its discretion. Instead, he and four other foreign players got 
in through the world rankings -- Jumbo Ozaki, Carlos Franco, Thomas 
Bjorn and Shigeki Maruyama. 
</P>
<P>
	The rankings also provided five Americans a trip to Augusta --  
Loren Roberts, Brad Faxon, Bill Glasson, Brian Watts and Brandt 
Jobe. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first Masters for Watts, who grew up in Dallas  
but has played the Japanese tour for nearly his entire career and 
has done well enough to move into the top 50 in the world rankings. 
Watts got his biggest lift in the British Open, where his 
spectacular bunker shot on the 72nd hole at Royal Birkdale got him 
into a playoff with Mark O'Meara. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer is expected to play for the 45th consecutive year,  
which would break the record he now shares with Sam Snead. Jack 
Nicklaus, who tied for sixth last year at age 58, will end his 
streak of 40 consecutive Masters because of hip replacement surgery 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The six amateurs are the most in the Masters since 1988, the  
last year Augusta National invited Walker Cup or World Cup players. 
Since 1989, the only amateurs to get in are the U.S. Amateur 
finalists (Hank Kuehne and Tom McKnight) and winners of the British 
Amateur (Sergio Garcia), U.S. Mid-Amateur (John Miller) and U.S. 
Public Links (Trevor Immelman). 
</P>
<P>
	The additional amateur is Matt Kuchar, who thrilled the Augusta  
gallery last year with his charming smile and tied for 21st. Kuchar 
also would have qualified by virtue of his tie for 14th at the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Garcia staged a dramatic quarterfinal match in the U.S.  
Amateur, which Garcia won before the young Spaniard lost to 
McKnight in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The invitation list is not final. Players who win a PGA Tour  
event through the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta the week before the 
Masters would qualify, as would anyone who moves into the top 50 in 
the world rankings the week after the Doral Open. 
</P>
<P>
	And Augusta National could still offer a special invitation,  
although that's not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on the edge are Craig Parry, one of the biggest  
stars on the International team that beat the United States in the 
Presidents Cup. Parry, the third-round lead in the 1992 Masters, 
currently is No. 54.

<HEADLINE> Feds: Mom Killed Over Casino Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman bent on feeding her gambling addiction  
suffocated her 7-week-old daughter to collect on a $200,000 life 
insurance policy, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would do anything to get money with which to gamble --  
including the unthinkable,'' prosecutor Ronald Safer told jurors 
Friday as the trial of Dina Abdelhaq began. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abdelhaq, 34, is charged with scheming to defraud Allstate  
Insurance Co. of $200,000 in life insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The infant ``was killed in a way designed intentionally to  
create the false appearance that she had died of Sudden Infant 
Death Syndrome,'' the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abdelhaq is not charged with murdering her young daughter,  
Tara, who was found dead in her crib in 1995. Bob Benjamin, a 
spokesman for the Cook County state's attorney's office, which 
would bring such charges, declined to comment on the case during 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abdelhaq, who denies killing Tara, took out a life insurance  
policy about a month before her daughter died. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner's office has listed the cause of Tara's  
death as undetermined. Another Abdelhaq daughter, Lena, died under 
similar circumstances about a year before Tara was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim that Ms. Abdelhaq tried to disguise Tara's  
death as sudden infant death syndrome, or crib death. Lena's death 
was initially listed as SIDS by the medical examiner, but the cause 
of death was changed to undetermined after Tara was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that Ms. Abdelhaq, an unemployed welfare  
recipient, is a gambling addict. Her attorney, Scott Frankel, told 
jurors that his client has a gambling problem ``the like of which 
you may never have seen.'' In one instance, he said, she sold off 
her mother's jewelry at a pawn shop near two riverboat casinos in 
the Joliet area. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frankel said that Ms. Abdelhaq is not a killer. He said the  
medical examiner had not found any signs of homicide in the case of 
either of the two girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't, there isn't and there never will be any evidence  
that Dina Abdelhaq murdered her children,'' Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the jury that the root of the case was that ``the  
Allstate Insurance Company didn't want to pay the $200,000.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Choose New Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three of Al Gore's political allies joined the  
leadership of the Democratic National Committee today as the vice 
president prepares for the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Andrew, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party and the  
DNC's convention site selection committee, replaces Steve Grossman 
as national chairman. Grossman resigned Dec. 2 to spend more time 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew will be in charge of daily operations at the DNC.  
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, one of the nation's leading black  
politicians, and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., will co-chair the 
committee. They will work part-time, dealing with Democratic 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, Grossman's co-chairman and the  
party's main spokesman, continues in that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Romer said the appointment of Archer and Sanchez sends a  
positive signal to the black and Hispanic communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a conscious decision on our part so we can be more  
effective reaching our constituency bases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton selected the leadership team, and the DNC  
officially approved the group today. The choices, made in 
collaboration with Gore, reflected Clinton's desire to help his 
vice president succeed him in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew said the team would be neutral on presidential candidates  
until the primary process is finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee has one chairman, Jim  
Nicholson, who was given a second two-year term Friday.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Won't Have To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered Monica Lewinsky  
to submit to an interview with prosecutor Kenneth Starr to assist 
the Senate impeachment trial, a legal source said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S.  
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that House prosecutors 
had no right under Ms. Lewinsky's immunity deal with Starr to force 
her to submit to their questioning. But Johnson ruled that Starr 
could force Ms. Lewinsky to answer questions from his staff and 
allow the House prosecutors to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors led by Rep. Henry Hyde obtained Starr's  
help Friday in attempting to force Ms. Lewinsky to talk to them, 
touching off a legal battle in Johnson's court. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky, said her legal team  
was considering an appeal. ``We're taking that question under 
advisement,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors and the lawyers for Ms. Lewinsky went to  
court late Friday arguing over whether she had to cooperate. Hyde 
had written Starr seeking his help with Ms. Lewinsky, who rejected 
being interviewed by the House team. 
</P>
<P>
	Two House sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hyde  
cited Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement with Starr in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 28 agreement said Ms. Lewinsky ``will testify  
truthfully before grand juries in this district and elsewhere, at 
any trials in this district and elsewhere, and in any other 
executive, military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Friday to Starr, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers contended  
that the immunity agreement with him ``does not require us to be 
interviewed'' by the House impeachment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate itself has provided its own rules for witness  
interviews. As we understand them, there must be a deposition with 
equal access. As of now, the Senate has not voted for 
depositions,'' her attorneys wrote. ``Ms. Lewinsky will of course 
respond to a subpoena to appear and testify before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House has urged the Senate to allow witnesses in Clinton's  
impeachment trial, a controversial issue that could be fought out 
next week along sharp partisan lines. Most Republicans have backed 
the call for witnesses and virtually all Democrats have opposed 
live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	One Senate Democratic official said Democrats oppose Hyde's  
request to interview Ms. Lewinsky because it could delay the trial 
and was not part of a bipartisan agreement covering conduct of the 
proceedings. Majority Leader Trent Lott had no immediate reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers have not yet submitted their witness list. But  
House prosecutors during the Senate trial have said repeatedly that 
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony could help clarify who is telling the 
truth about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and any 
cover-up efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House officials said the impeachment prosecuting team  
sought Starr's help after Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers refused earlier 
this month to make her available.

<HEADLINE> Sunday Special: John Cullen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On the night before he went for the X-ray, John Cullen played  
hockey for the Tampa Bay Lightning and even scored a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hacking cough was still there, the shortness of breath,  
the pain in his jaw and his teeth. Something was wrong and Cullen 
was going to the doctor to find out about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had a chest cold,'' he said. ``We were two points  
out of the playoffs. I didn't want to say anything. But my wife 
called the team and told them I wasn't doing well, so they ordered 
the X-rays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's no big deal. X-rays are a way of life for hockey players.  
Cullen had spent nine years in the NHL. Play hockey that long and 
there will be X-rays now and then. 
</P>
<P>
	None was like this one, though.  
</P>
<P>
	When the radiologist showed Cullen the picture of his chest, it  
was frightening. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a black shadow in the middle,'' he said. ``I'll  
never forget that night. They said it could be this and it could be 
that. But a tumor? No way. They said there was no way it could be a 
tumor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that was exactly what it was.  
</P>
<P>
	At age 32, Cullen had non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer that  
affects the lymph nodes. Now, almost two years later, he remembers 
what it was like to hear that diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a pro athlete, your life is good,'' he said. ``And then,  
all of a sudden, you're talking about CAT scans and biopsies and 
you have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you hear that word, it's life-altering. It floors you. My  
mother died at 46 from a melanoma. I knew what it meant. When I was 
on the ice, I had to battle for every inch of ice. I was going to 
battle this, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 4 1/2 months, Cullen underwent chemotherapy three  
times a week. That was followed by a month of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	And then came the bad news. The chemo had failed to rid his body  
of all the cancer. Now, Cullen would face a bone marrow transplant. 
His chances of survival, set at 90 percent when he was first 
diagnosed, dropped to 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a second, you think of the worst,'' he said. ``Then you  
forget it and say, `No way.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of the bone marrow treatment, Cullen was being  
wheeled in for another radiation treatment when he passed out on 
the hospital floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two words you don't want to hear in a hospital are `code  
blue,' '' he said. ``I was code blue, but I couldn't hear the words 
because I was unconscious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Cullen survived. And when he did, he set out to fulfill  
one of the pledges he made to the Lightning when he was first 
diagnosed. He swore he would play hockey again. After a year off 
the ice, he suited up for the exhibition season in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Players facing an 82-game season that stretches from October to  
April aren't anxious to add extra ice time. Cullen, however, was 
thrilled with the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my 12th NHL training camp,'' he said. ``You don't get  
excited playing exhibition games at that stage. For me, though, it 
was like the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Cullen zipped a shot past Dominik Hasek, the NHL's best  
goalie, it was a magic moment. ``You couldn't write a script better 
than that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the team but soon reality set in. The Lightning asked  
Cullen to accept an assignment to their minor league team in 
Cleveland, figuring he'd turn it down and retire. Instead, he 
reported and had seven points in one game. Then two games later, 
after coming down with bronchitis, Cullen decided he'd had enough. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately returned to Tampa Bay as an assistant coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud I came back to play,'' Cullen said. ``I'm glad to be  
coaching. I'm just starting, just trying to see what it's all 
about. I'm trying to help. It's good to be able to stay close to 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the NHL All-Star Game is in Tampa. There will be an  
on-ice ceremony with the league and players association making a 
donation of more than $500,000 as part of the league's Hockey 
Fights Cancer campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody will be prouder of that gesture than the Lightning's  
assistant coach, a guy who knows all about the fight.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Budget Surplus Plan / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Echoing the major initiatives from his State  
of the Union address, President Clinton said today that America's 
current good fortune should be used to help resolve potential 
future financial problems in Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his weekly radio address, reiterated his proposal to  
use the budget surplus to shore up the troubled Social Security 
system, add money to the Medicare trust fund and create savings 
accounts for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot let the hum of our prosperity lull us into  
complacency,'' he said. ``Instead, we must use this moment of 
promise to meet the long-term challenges we face as a nation, to 
meet out historic responsibility to the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would transfer 62 percent of the projected federal  
budget surpluses over the next 15 years -- $2.7 trillion -- to the 
Social Security account to keep the program solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, 25 percent would be invested in the stock market  
in hopes of higher returns. The president also called for using one 
out of every six dollars of the surplus to double the life of the 
Medicare system, the health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 11 percent of the surplus -- $500 billion -- would  
be devoted to new government-subsidized retirement accounts. 
Individuals would receive a flat tax credit to make contributions 
into the so-called Universal Savings Accounts. The government would 
then provide more tax credits to match a portion of the worker's 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	``By providing this new tax credit for retirement savings, we  
can make it possible for all Americans to have a stake in the 
remarkable economic growth they have worked so hard to create,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposals already have drawn fire from some congressional  
Republicans, who want a portion of the surplus to pay for a tax 
cut. ``I didn't work this hard to get a balanced budget to ... 
spend it all on new programs,'' Senate Budget Committee chairman 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M, said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton stressed today that Americans will receive ``the  
kind of tax relief'' they need in the form of credits through the 
savings account program. 
</P>
<P>
	After Social Security is secure, other money would be used to  
boost military readiness and education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we squander the surplus, we'll waste a once-in-a-lifetime  
opportunity to build a stronger nation for our children and our 
grandchildren,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Clemens: Astros Still a Possibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- With spring training a month away, Cy Young Award  
winner Roger Clemens hasn't ruled out suiting up for the Houston 
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I would say that anything is possible and in that  
regard, the Astros are a possibility,'' Clemens told the Houston 
Chronicle in Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to play in Houston. But we'll have to see where it  
goes from here. ... If I'm in Toronto, I'll be happy there, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens appeared to take his name off the market Dec. 22 when he  
rescinded a Dec. 2 request to be traded by the Blue Jays. That 
triggered talks with the Astros, New York Yankees, Cleveland 
Indians and Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that door is shut by any means,'' Clemens said.  
``I did voice some displeasure over the way things were handled and 
how things were turned around on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens complained last month about the way matters were handled  
by Astros president Tal Smith and general manager Gerry Hunsicker. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens said Friday he doesn't want to hold a grudge against the  
Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset (last month) because of some of the things that  
were said, and I came home early from vacation because of the 
situation,'' Clemens said. ``I felt it was necessary to tell the 
Astros that I wasn't happy about the way the situation was 
handled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker declined to comment on Clemens' statements, citing  
baseball's rules against tampering with players under contract with 
other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens won his fifth Cy Young Award last season after going  
20-6 with a 2.65 ERA.

<HEADLINE> McGwire To Visit Cards' Fan Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- McGwire mania has begun anew, and spring  
training is almost a month away. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days ahead of the pope, who comes to St. Louis for a  
two-day visit starting Tuesday, St. Louis gets another famous 
visitor Sunday when Mark McGwire makes his first visit to town 
since shattering the major-league home run record. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is the headline attraction for the Cardinals' two-day  
winter fan charity event. Fans who swarmed a downtown hotel also 
could buy raffle tickets with a one-in-70 shot at receiving an 
autograph from McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pretty awesome,'' said new relief pitcher Ricky  
Bottalico, surveying the crowd during a break in his far less 
intense autograph session. ``Everybody knows this is a great 
baseball town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just wait until Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I'm here today and not tomorrow,'' left-hander Kent  
Mercker said. ``You probably won't be able to walk around 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the opening day of the two-day event, the man who  
turned No. 70 into $2.7 million was among the attractions that also 
included manager Tony La Russa and more than a dozen players. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Ozersky, 26, a research scientist at Washington University  
who sold the ball to an anonymous bidder for $2.7 million earlier 
this month, held court with those curious about how his good 
fortune had changed his life. The Cardinals blocked off a one-hour 
slot for Ozersky, who figured nobody would be that interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was there the whole hour,'' Ozersky said. ``It was amazing,  
people asking me question after question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unassuming Ozersky wore a checkered shirt and hiking boots  
to his appearance. He plans to return to work Feb. 1 and said his 
bank account, which will be bulging once the New York auction house 
clears the transaction, will be about the only evidence of any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still the same person,'' Ozersky said. ``It's definitely  
changed my life but it hasn't changed my values. Money doesn't buy 
you happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes life easier, but I'm no different from any of the  
ballplayers. How do they handle themselves? Do they change when the 
reap the benefits?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and Ozersky have never met, although that could happen  
since both are on the program for Sunday. Last season McGwire was 
dead set against the notion of fans profiting from his 
achievements, but Ozersky pointed out that he allowed the ball to 
be displayed for about a month at the Cardinals' Hall of Fame 
before putting it on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows of me and I know people that conversed about him and  
I,'' Ozersky said. ``From what I heard, most of it was positive 
with his references to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Present and former players signed autographs for fees ranging  
from $5 (Bottalico, Pat Kelly, Kent Bottenfield, John Frascatore, 
Lance Painter, Mike Shannon) to $25 (Lou Brock, J.D. Drew, Bob 
Gibson, Willie McGee and Ozzie Smith), with the price doubling to 
$50 for signatures on bats, jerseys and other equipment. The event 
raised $267,000 last year and the director, Dr. Ed Lewis, expects 
to top that this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh man, I've signed a lot,'' said new shortstop Edgar  
Renteria, who commanded $15 per signature. ``But that's good. It's 
great seeing all these people.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Clash Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As lawyers, lawmakers and prosecutors sparred  
on in the Senate trial, President Clinton and Republicans clashed 
Saturday on the more traditional political battleground of tax and 
budget policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In dueling radio broadcasts, Republicans derided the president's  
new budget plans as an empty bag of goodies. Clinton suggested GOP 
plans for a 10 percent income tax cut would ``waste a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'' to shore up Social Security and 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The president used his weekly radio address to rehash the  
centerpiece of his State of the Union address that will be formally 
submitted to Congress in his budget next month: a proposal to 
dedicate the billions of dollars in federal surplus to shoring up 
the troubled Social Security system, add money to the Medicare 
trust fund and create so-called ``USA'' savings accounts for 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Families would receive tax credits to contribute to their  
accounts and save for retirement as a way of supplementing Social 
Security. ``That's the kind of tax relief America needs,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking for the Republicans in their radio speech, Minnesota  
Sen. Rod Grams said Clinton's ``targeted tax cuts'' are really 
meant to ``try to dictate social conduct, rewarding only a few with 
too few dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the president's State of the Union address, Grams said:  
``There was something in that speech for everyone. Well, almost 
everyone. The speech lasted 77 minutes and contained 77 new 
spending proposals, but there was nothing in it for the American 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans are advancing an across-the-board, 10  
percent cut in the personal tax rate. ``You see, Republicans 
believe individuals and families should make their own spending 
decisions,'' Grams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Clinton: ``Social Security first, then saving Medicare  
and giving tax relief to help all Americans save in the new USA 
accounts. ... If we squander the surplus, we'll waste a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a stronger nation for our 
children and our grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Thorn Apple Valley Recalls Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who have purchased meat products  
manufactured at Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant in 
the last six months are being urged to return them because of 
concerns of possible contamination with the Listeria monocytogenes 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department announced the recall Friday night. It  
includes all meat and poultry products bearing the codes ``EST 
13529'' or ``EST P13529'' anywhere on the package. The recall 
includes dozens of brand names, based on information collected by 
the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service and provided by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The department suspended operations at the Arkansas plant on  
Dec. 31 because of its noncompliance with sanitation requirements. 
Operations there remain suspended. That plant has a production 
capacity of 400,000 pounds of hot dogs per day, according to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	No consumer illnesses have yet been linked to the products,  
which were distributed nationwide and shipped to foreign countries, 
including South Korea and Russia, and manufactured after July 6, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the potential of foodborne illness, we urge  
consumers who have purchased the suspect product not to eat it and 
return it to the point of purchase,'' said Margaret Glavin, 
associate administrator of the FSIS. 
</P>
<P>
	Between July and December 1998, government inspectors collected  
20 ready-to-eat samples from the plant. Five tested positive for 
Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, which can cause high fever, severe 
headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Based on the findings and 
conditions at the plant, the agency concluded there may be a public 
health risk associated with the product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said it has no evidence, however,  
linking the product to a nationwide listeriosis outbreak that is 
under investigation. About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by 
listeria are reported in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people usually can fight off the bacterium with no more  
than flu-like symptoms. But listeria can kill, by causing 
meningitis or blood infection. Most at risk are pregnant women, the 
elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerned about illnesses they suspect are related to  
these products should contact their physicians immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third major recall in a month of meat products.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. recalled more than 28,000  
pounds of deli meat because of concerns of possible contamination 
with the Listeria bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs  
and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food 
poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers seeking information about the Thorn Apple Valley  
recall may contact the company at 1-800-316-2855. Consumers with 
food safety questions may phone the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 
at 1-800-535-4555. The hotline is staffed from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
EST Monday through Friday. Recorded information is available 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The brand names of the hot dogs and lunch combinations included  
in the Thorn Apple Valley recall are: 
</P>
<P>
	Hot Dogs: Borman Franks, Spartan Franks, Tops Franks, Always  
Save Franks, Wilson Franks, Piggly Wiggly Franks, Gunnoes Franks, 
Fairgrounds Franks, Best Franks, Colonial Franks, Nepco Franks, 
Hannaford Franks, Wilson Farms Franks, Big Uns Franks, Carters 
Franks, Iowa Gold Franks, Herrud Franks, Corn King Franks, Winn 
Dixie Franks, Schnucks Franks, Flavor King Franks, Thorn Apple 
Valley Franks.

	Lunch combinations: Schnucks Bologna with American Cheese,

<HEADLINE> Jauron Hired After Bears' Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- This time, the Chicago Bears made sure  
they had a deal before announcing their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Jauron, the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville  
Jaguars, agreed to contract terms late Saturday, team spokesman 
Bryan Harlan said. The move came less than 12 hours after Dave 
McGinnis flew home to Phoenix, still upset that team president 
Michael McCaskey had announced his hiring before they had an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron will be introduced at a Sunday news conference. He  
succeeds Dave Wannstedt, fired almost four weeks ago. The hiring 
also closes out an active offseason, in which nine NFL teams 
changed coaches and the expansion Cleveland Browns brought in their 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed with Dick when he came in for his  
interview and thought he would make an outstanding head coach,'' 
McCaskey said in a statement. ``He is an excellent teacher and is 
regarded as one of the more innovative coaches in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's excited about the opportunity to coach this team and lead  
us back to the playoffs,'' McCaskey added. ``I'm confident he'll do 
a great job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, 48, has been in the NFL for 23 seasons as either a  
player or coach. He spent the past four seasons in Jacksonville as 
the Jaguars' defensive coordinator after nine years as the 
defensive backs coach for the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by the Detroit Lions out of Yale, Jauron was named to  
the Pro Bowl after the 1974 season. After the Lions waived him in 
1978, he was picked up by the Cincinnati Bengals and played for 
them until he suffered a knee injury in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron's hiring caps an embarrassing two days for the bumbling  
Bears. The team called a Friday afternoon news conference to 
introduce McGinnis, the Arizona Cardinals' defensive coordinator 
and a former Chicago assistant, as their new coach. They even 
updated their voice mail to say, ``You have reached the office of 
head coach David McGinnis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was one big problem: McGinnis hadn't been offered the  
job yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an internal foul-up,'' McCaskey said earlier Saturday  
at a news conference after McGinnis left. ``We made a mistake on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to explain any further.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't intend for it to happen,'' he said. ``It's something  
we did internally and I don't want to get into it. We made a 
mistake, and I don't want to go into detail about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis was upset about the premature announcements and called  
off talks Friday afternoon. The team had to first delay and then 
cancel the planned news conference to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
	Team chairman Ed McCaskey, a personal friend of McGinnis and his  
wife, Kim, even called McGinnis on Friday night to try and smooth 
things over. But after another meeting with Michael McCaskey on 
Saturday morning, McGinnis withdrew his name and left town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad for me,'' McGinnis told reporters at O'Hare  
International Airport. ``Again, I want to express, the city of 
Chicago, the Chicago Bears are very, very special. Obviously, we 
just couldn't reach an agreement. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreement had nothing to do with money or the contract.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care to go into it now and probably never will. It's  
between me and Dave,'' McCaskey said. ``These things happen. 
Sometimes, they are a pathway to consideration of other things and 
that's what happened in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey moved quickly to repair the damage. He got in touch  
with potential coaches as soon as McGinnis left and said at 6:30 
p.m. CST he hoped to get something done ``very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three hours later, the Bears announced Jauron's hiring.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have some repair work to do with the fans,'' admitted  
McCaskey, a former professor at the Harvard Business School who 
once wrote a book called, ``The Executive Challenge: Managing 
Change and Ambiguity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think getting the right man is a key step in the process,''  
McCaskey said earlier Saturday. ``And we'll get him.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Sign Pitcher Karchner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs reached agreement with relief  
pitcher Matt Karchner, meaning the club will have not have to go to 
salary arbitration this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was reached late Friday night and terms weren't  
disclosed, said Cubs spokeswoman Sharon Pannozzo. 
</P>
<P>
	Karchner made $300,000 last season and had asked for $925,000  
when he filed for arbitration. The Cubs countered with an offer of 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Karchner was acquired from the Chicago White Sox last July 29 in  
exchange for minor league pitcher Jon Garland. He appeared in 61 
games for the two teams combined and went 5-5 with a 5.15 ERA. In 
29 games for the Cubs, he was 3-1 with a 5.14 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Karchner finished the 1997 season and started last season as the  
White Sox closer. But he struggled after coming off an injury last 
summer before he was traded across town.

<HEADLINE> Costner Gives Up Part of Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Costner showed he knows how to play the  
game when it came to making his new baseball movie. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``For Love of the Game,'' a romantic comedy filmed mostly  
at Yankee Stadium, ran into preproduction budget snarls, Costner 
gave up his usual $20 million guaranteed salary in exchange for a 
cut of the first-dollar gross, Premiere magazine reported in its 
February edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Although details weren't reported, Costner's typical deal gives  
him 15 percent of the gross up to $100 million, from which point 
his percentage gradually increases; if a movie makes $175 million, 
Costner earns 22.5 percent, the magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing internal production memos, the magazine also reported  
that the hidden costs of hiring Costner included $4,500 a week for 
a trainer-nutritionist, a $40 an hour wardrobe assistant and $3,000 
a week for a body double stand-in. While on location, each member 
of Costner's support team received an average of $100 per diem in 
walking around money as well as first-class housing accommodations.

<HEADLINE> North Seeks Recognition in Hula Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- It's the big names against the no-names  
Sunday in the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The South team features Heisman Trophy winner, running back  
Ricky Williams of Texas, Kansas State quarterback and Heisman 
runner-up Michael Bishop and All-America cornerback Chris McAlister 
of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The North is led by Missouri quarterback Corby Jones, Ohio State  
running back Joe Montgomery, who starred in last week's East-West 
Shrine game, and Notre Dame linebacker Bobby Howard. All are good 
players, but not in the class of the South's big three. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my team all week we're underdogs, nobody expects us to  
win,'' North coach Lloyd Carr of Michigan said. ``I think it 
motivates us. Guys like Williams and Bishop are coming off great 
seasons, but football is a team game and anything can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While attempting to mold unfamiliar players into a unit in one  
week, the coaches will try to showcase the players to the 
approximate 100 NFL scouts in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to give each kid a chance to show what he can  
do,'' South coach Mike Price of Washington State said. ``You want 
to give each the opportunity to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr is impressed with how the players are focusing on football  
despite the many distractions of Maui, but realizes the game could 
get sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a thing of art, but one thing I think is  
that you'll see two teams that play very hard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wants to make more than a token appearance in the game,  
even though his agent doesn't want him to play and risk injury. 
Williams said part of the reason he came back to Texas his senior 
season was to play in the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be a part of something like this my whole  
career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop will start at quarterback for the South, Jones for the  
North. Both must prove they can be quarterbacks at the pro level, 
and overcome talk they likely will end up as running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can show them if given the opportunity ... help  
myself out a little,'' Jones said. ``If they already have their 
minds made up, maybe there's nothing I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player who wants to show he can play the position he  
played in college is Oregon State defensive end Inoke 
Breckterfield. At 5-foot-11, 249 pounds, he's been told to consider 
linebacker or fullback if he wants a shot at the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play wherever they need me,'' he said. ``I have the drive  
and I have the want. The height's not there, but I hope they 
overlook that.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- American magician David  
Copperfield and Brazilian singer Milton Nascimento have called off 
tours in Brazil because of the drop in its currency, according to 
the O Estado De Sao Paulo newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the currency, the real, against the dollar has  
plunged by about 30 percent since Jan. 12, leaving many artists 
with the choice of facing an effective pay cut or calling off 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian ballet company, The Bolshoi, has decided to renegotiate  
its contract and will go ahead with a tour in May, said the daily. 
</P>

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The presidents of El Salvador and  
Nicaragua urged Guatemala on Saturday to ease border restrictions 
it imposed to prevent immigrants passing through the country on 
their way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions ``are a step back in Central American  
integration,'' Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said at a 
news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala was among four Central American nations participating  
in an agreement allowing their citizens free movement across 
borders. But Guatemala tightened border controls Nov. 15, saying 
there were too many illegal immigrants passing through on their way 
to Mexico and, eventually, America. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Central Americans heading north increased after  
Hurricane Mitch hit the region in late October and early November, 
causing billions of dollars in damage and killing more than 9,000 
people, according to official figures.

<HEADLINE> Wilson Wins 1st World Cup Moguls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) -- Olympic moguls skier Alex Wilson  
of Buffalo, N.Y., given a boost by a teammate's first World Cup 
victory the night before, battled through a snowstorm Saturday for 
his first World Cup moguls victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson earned 26.31 points from the judges for his final run at  
Heavenly resort to edge Richard Gay of France by .18. Caleb Martin, 
who took up moguls skiing 10 years ago after moving from Rumford, 
Maine to Telluride, Colo., reached his first World Cup podium, 
finishing third in 26.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting acro-skier Steve Roxberg of Lakeville, Minn., collected  
his first World Cup on Friday night, Wilson said, ``Roxy definitely 
inspired me. I'm glad, though, I didn't have to wait 11 years, like 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He shrugged off the storm, which dumped snow continuously  
through the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in the East and skiing back there is always  
interesting,'' he said. ``I try to deal with it in a positive way. 
Any time there are various conditions, I say, `Let's go.' When I 
got up and saw the snow, I wanted it to dump all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish skier Minna Karhu made it two consecutive moguls wins  
after taking the season opener two weeks ago in Quebec. Ann 
Battelle of Steamboat Springs, Colo., third in the first two meets 
of the winter, was top American in fourth place with Michelle Roark 
of Denver in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Jonny Moseley of Tiburon, Calif., who began his  
career skiing in the Lake Tahoe region, had been expected to 
compete. However, he's still nursing a sore back and may miss 
another week of skiing.

<HEADLINE> Ortlieb Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- Former Olympic and world downhill  
champion Patrick Ortlieb announced his retirement today, two days 
after a terrifying crash put him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	From his hospital bed in Innsbruck, the 10-year veteran of the  
Austrian team said he would not resume World Cup competition no 
matter how well his recovery went. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to ski again, but I will definitely not  
compete on the World Cup circuit again,'' said Ortlieb, who has 
four career World Cup victories. ``I am 32, and I had planned to 
retire at the end of the season anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the decision has been taken out of my hands, and all good  
things must come to an end,'' Ortlieb said. ``If I can return to 
100 percent, and have the quality of life I enjoyed before the 
accident, that's all I ask.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb sustained a compound fracture of his right thigh and a  
dislocated right hip on Thursday in a practice run for a downhill 
doubleheader Friday and today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian ace, who won the Kitzbuehel downhill in 1994, lost  
his balance in the final corner of one of the most treacherous 
courses on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into the Hausbergkante corner at a speed of about 60 mph,  
Ortlieb cartwheeled and smashed into the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	He received treatment on the spot before being taken by  
helicopter to a local hospital. Ortlieb was later flown to a 
hospital in Innsbruck for emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice run was interrupted while Ortlieb received  
treatment. Frederic Marin-Cudraz of France also crashed later at 
the same spot and was taken to the hospital with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard that it happened to me on the Streif,'' said  
Ortlieb. ``I won here, and have been down at least 40 times without 
any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact it decided to hit me makes it even harder. It is at  
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb's crash came at the same spot where Canada's Brian  
Stemmle partially tore his shoulder ligaments in a spill Wednesday, 
ending his season. Stemmle was nearly killed on the Streif 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb won the Olympic downhill title at the 1992 Games in  
Albertville, France, and the world champion title in 1996 in Sierra 
Nevada. He was fourth at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortlieb also crashed badly at Wengen, Switzerland, last weekend,  
injuring his back and neck.

<HEADLINE> Bears Tap Jauron As Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- This time, the Chicago Bears made sure  
they had a deal before announcing their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Jauron, the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville  
Jaguars, agreed to contact terms late Saturday, team spokesman 
Bryan Harlan said. The move came less than 12 hours after Dave 
McGinnis flew home to Phoenix, still upset that team president 
Michael McCaskey had announced his hiring before they had an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron will be introduced at a Sunday news conference. He  
succeeds Dave Wannstedt, fired almost four weeks ago. The hiring 
also closes out an active offseason, in which nine NFL teams 
changed coaches and the expansion Cleveland Browns brought in their 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed with Dick when he came in for his  
interview and thought he would make an outstanding head coach,'' 
McCaskey said in a statement. ``He is an excellent teacher and is 
regarded as one of the more innovative coaches in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's excited about the opportunity to coach this team and lead  
us back to the playoffs,'' McCaskey added. ``I'm confident he'll do 
a great job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, 48, has been in the NFL for 23 seasons as either a  
player or coach. He spent the past four seasons in Jacksonville as 
the Jaguars' defensive coordinator after nine years as the 
defensive backs coach for the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by the Detroit Lions out of Yale, Jauron was named to  
the Pro Bowl after the 1974 season. After the Lions waived him in 
1978, he was picked up by the Cincinnati Bengals and played for 
them until he suffered a knee injury in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron's hiring caps an embarrassing two days for the bumbling  
Bears. The team called a Friday afternoon news conference to 
introduce McGinnis, the Arizona Cardinals' defensive coordinator 
and a former Chicago assistant, as their new coach. They even 
updated their voice mail to say, ``You have reached the office of 
head coach David McGinnis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was one big problem: McGinnis hadn't been offered the  
job yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an internal foul-up,'' McCaskey said earlier Saturday  
at a news conference after McGinnis left. ``We made a mistake on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to explain any further.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't intend for it to happen,'' he said. ``It's something  
we did internally and I don't want to get into it. We made a 
mistake, and I don't want to go into detail about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis was upset about the premature announcements and called  
off talks Friday afternoon. The team had to first delay and then 
cancel the planned news conference to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
	Team chairman Ed McCaskey, a personal friend of McGinnis and his  
wife, Kim, even called McGinnis on Friday night to try and smooth 
things over. But after another meeting with Michael McCaskey on 
Saturday morning, McGinnis withdrew his name and left town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad for me,'' McGinnis told reporters at O'Hare  
Airport. ``Again, I want to express, the city of Chicago, the 
Chicago Bears are very, very special. Obviously, we just couldn't 
reach an agreement. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreement had nothing to do with money or the contract.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care to go into it now and probably never will. It's  
between me and Dave,'' McCaskey said. ``These things happen. 
Sometimes, they are a pathway to consideration of other things and 
that's what happened in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey moved quickly to repair the damage. He got in touch  
with potential coaches as soon as McGinnis left and said at 6:30 
p.m. CST he hoped to get something done ``very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three hours later, the Bears announced Jauron's hiring.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have some repair work to do with the fans,'' admitted  
McCaskey, a former professor at the Harvard Business School who 
once wrote a book called, ``The Executive Challenge: Managing 
Change and Ambiguity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think getting the right man is a key step in the process,''  
McCaskey said earlier Saturday. ``And we'll get him.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Submit Clinton Questions </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial  
dissolved into partisan debate Saturday, as lawmakers and lawyers 
alike dueled over a surprise attempt by House prosecutors to 
question Monica Lewinsky before the Senate decides whether to call 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	With party lines hardening, Majority Leader Trent Lott announced  
at day's end that Senate Republicans would submit written questions 
to Clinton as early as Monday to resolve ``some of the 
inconsistencies'' in the case. Within an hour, the White House said 
its lawyers -- not Clinton -- would respond. 
</P>
<P>
	As opposing attorneys clashed over the Lewinsky-interview issue  
in the well of the Senate, a Republican spokesman predicted that an 
attempt by Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd to dismiss all charges 
``will certainly fail'' when the roll is called early in the week. 
Republicans hold a 55-45 majority -- but that is well short of the 
two-thirds majority needed to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Senate, meeting for a rare second straight Saturday,  
White House Counsel Charles Ruff assailed the maneuver of House 
prosecutors in enlisting assistance from Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr in their effort to interview Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine what that little conversation is going to look  
like, held in the independent counsel's office, with the people 
there who have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail? 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we really say that it's just normal, just OK, to have one  
side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's 
office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity 
agreement if she doesn't fly across the country for this little 
chat? I think not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., rejected suggestions Ms. Lewinsky  
would be mistreated. ``The White House counselors do not want to 
talk about the facts, the obstruction of justice. Just like in the 
House, they want to talk about the process, everything but the 
obstruction of justice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the House managers attempting to make plans to interview  
Ms. Lewinsky Sunday afternoon, Starr's office offered to make her 
available to White House lawyers under if same terms if they 
requested a meeting. In a related development, former Clinton 
adviser Dick Morris said he had agreed to meet with the House 
managers Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of rapid-fire developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Lott told reporters at day's end about the plan to seek  
written answers from the president. He did so after Clinton's 
attorney, Gregory Craig, said during the trial session, ``Now we 
would be happy to take questions and get responses to you, consult 
with the president and Mr. Ruff, if you'd like to submit them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig approached senators who had posed the question after the  
trial adjourned for the day and told them Clinton would not answer 
the questions himself but his lawyers could on his behalf if the 
senators could agree on a procedure, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in the rules that provides for senators to  
put questions directly to the president and it won't happen,'' 
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart later said. ``Been there, 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee submitted 81 written questions to  
the White House earlier in the impeachment drama, and many 
lawmakers expressed disappointment at what they said were unhelpful 
responses. Some Republicans said later the president's replies to 
those questions reinvigorated the drive to impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. John Breaux, D-La., suggested that the motion to dismiss  
the charges could be crafted to include language censuring the 
president, perhaps by saying he had ``brought dishonor'' on his 
office. Republicans privately dismissed the idea, and said they 
were determined to press ahead with the plan for preliminary 
questioning of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Republican officials were directed to begin work on a proposed  
timetable and set of guidelines governing any depositions to be 
taken from potential witnesses. No details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa sought at the end of the  
day's trial session to ask Chief Justice William Rehnquist to stop 
the effort to question Lewinsky. Lott adjourned the Senate at that 
point, and Harkin handed a letter to Rehnquist's aide. 
</P>
<P>
	In their comments, both Ruff and Hutchinson were responding to  
questions posed by senators through Rehnquist, who is presiding 
over Clinton's trial on articles of impeachment alleging perjury 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor erupted as U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson  
ordered Ms. Lewinsky to appear for questioning, either by House 
prosecutors, or by lawyers from Starr's office on the prosecutors' 
behalf if she wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky flew back to Washington from California to comply.  
She arrived at the Mayflower Hotel, walking in wearing a baseball 
cap and surrounded by jostling TV cameramen. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, quietly wrote Starr on  
Thursday seeking his help in bringing Ms. Lewinsky to the table 
after her lawyers had refused to make her available voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his own remarks on the Senate floor, Hyde responded to a  
question posed to him with a ringing defense of the effort he is 
leading to convict Clinton and remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are issues of transcendent importance that you have to  
be willing to lose your office over,'' he said. ``I can think of 
several that I'm willing to lose my office over. Abortion is one. 
National defense is another. Strengthening, not emasculating the 
concept of ``equal justice under law'' is a third, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling was the latest on a series of rapid fire  
developments that left even senators struggling to keep up with the 
ebb and flow of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I notice a shift every half day in terms of people thinking it  
will go on for months, or it's going to be over in a few hours,'' 
Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	What's today's line? he was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to go on for a while.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lott dispatched his spokesman, John Czwartacki, to tell  
reporters that an early morning closed-door meeting had produced 
``remarkable unity'' against a Democratic bid to dismiss the 
charges and in favor of deposing witnesses. The trial, he said, 
appears to be entering a ``phase which may be partisan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said the House prosecutors'  
maneuver was the most ``clear demonstration of raw partisanship 
that I have ever seen,'' and 44 Democratic senators urged the House 
to reverse course. The president's lawyers will be locked out of 
the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked, through Rehnquist, whether the prosecutors would  
provide the Senate with a transcript of their planned questioning 
of Ms. Lewinsky, and permit one Republican and one Democratic 
senator to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans said no.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Byrd had unexpectedly announced on Friday he  
would lead the effort to dismiss. Overnight, his announcement 
seemed to have strengthened the resolve of Democrats eager to bring 
the trial to an end, but also stiffened the will of Republicans 
eager to proceed to depose witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd -- a defender of Senate prerogatives as well as a former  
Democratic leader -- issued a statement during the day attacking the 
efforts by House prosecutors to question Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House floor, Rep. Bill McCollum, of Florida said, ``As  
anybody knows, if you have a witness that you're going to produce, 
you have a right to prepare that witness. It's as plain and simple 
as that.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Citrus Growers To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore announced that more  
federal aid is on the way to help California recover from last 
month's crop-killing freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen counties have been declared federal disaster areas by  
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Gore said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The designation, not as high as a presidential disaster  
declaration, clears the way for loans and other programs for 
farmers and related businesses in the nation's leading agricultural 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days of bitter-cold temperatures in late December caused an  
estimated $656 million in damage. The lemon crop was wiped out and 
oranges are nearly a total loss. Packing houses shut down, and 
unemployment claims have reached 4,471 and counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis said he has also asked Gore to help secure a  
presidential disaster declaration, which would open the door to 
unemployment insurance for farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department's declaration will provide emergency  
low-interest loans from the USDA of up to $500,000 and aid to 
farmers who are not covered by federal disaster insurance.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Sign Forward Jason Caffey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Forward Jason Caffey signed a seven-year  
contract with the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract weren't released but newspapers put its  
value at $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're elated to have resigned Jason -- obviously one of our top  
offseason priorities -- and make him an integral part of our future, 
general manager Garry St. Jean said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He demonstrated during his brief stint with the Warriors last  
season that, when presented with the opportunity, he can be a very 
special player in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caffey, a free agent, was acquired from Chicago in a trade last  
February. He averaged 10.9 points and 5.9 rebounds for the Warriors 
and 7.3 and 4.3 overall, improving in his last five games as a 
starter to 19.6 points and 7.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	That impressed the Warriors, St. Jean said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We thought he was a young, physical talent who played with a  
lot of heart,'' he said. ``That evaluation kept expanding after he 
came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caffey, 25, is a former Alabama standout who earned championship  
rings with the Bulls during his first two years in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8, 256-pound Caffey was traded in exchange for  
seldom-used David Vaughn, but quickly showed a drive that St. Jean 
said he hoped was infectious. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to create an identity for your team, he certainly  
has a lot of the qualities you want people to think you possess,'' 
St. Jean said.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Renew Tax Cut Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are making a 10 percent  
across-the-board income tax cut their top priority in Congress, 
Sen. Rod Grams said today in the GOP radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams, R-Minn., said Republicans found President Clinton's State  
of the Union lacking because it made no mention of broad tax relief 
despite new projections for a budget surplus reaching $4.4 trillion 
over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come the average taxpayer won't get even a penny of it  
back under the president's plan?'' Grams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has outlined a series of tax credits targeted at  
stay-at-home parents, disabled workers, curbing urban sprawl and 
other social needs. But Grams said those proposals ``try to dictate 
social conduct, rewarding only a few, with too few dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The across-the-board tax cut is simple,'' he said. ``You don't  
have to be a tax lawyer or an accountant to understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the reduction would boost economic growth  
by helping workers become more productive and would be fair because 
all income groups would be treated equally. The cut would take 
effect with earnings that began Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``You generated that surplus,'' Grams told listeners.  
``Washington shouldn't stand first in line to get your money.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Hopeful for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats introduced their new leadership team  
Saturday and boasted of an issues advantage that has won over the 
public. Across town, Republicans talked of how to position their 
party for victory in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties' top activists plotted their future course as the  
impeachment trial of President Clinton ground on in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood here is very positive, because we've been talking  
about our agenda and our message and looking forward to the 
elections of 2000,'' said GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson. He identified 
the top issues as saving Social Security, fixing the nation's 
schools, bolstering the national defense and cutting taxes. 
Republicans tutored their officials on communication and talked 
about bringing minorities into the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we stay on our message and show performance, we win,''  
Nicholson said. ``Look at our 31 very popular elected Republican 
governors. The reason is the same in each state. They have an 
agenda; they stay on the message; then they perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said he didn't think Republicans would be punished for  
``voting their conscience'' on impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among Democrats was almost giddy as general chairman  
Roy Romer introduced a new team that will head the party for the 
2000 campaign. He emphasized Democratic positions on issues from 
Social Security to health care to crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats have some very high ground,'' Romer boasted to  
reporters, noting the party has an advantage in polls on whom the 
public trusts to handle issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/Time poll released Saturday gave Democrats a 34 percent to  
26 percent edge over Republicans among people asked who they 
thought could do a better job of handling the nation's problems. 
The poll of 1,024 people taken Wednesday and Thursday had an error 
margin of plus or minus 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Romer introduced the new leadership team of the Democratic  
National Committee, including new national chairman Joseph Andrew, 
chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party and a close ally of Vice 
President Al Gore. Andrew replaces the resigned Steve Grossman as 
national chairman. Romer stayed on as general chairman and lead 
spokesman of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, one of the nation's leading black  
politicians, and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Hispanic from California, 
will co-chair the committee. They will work part-time, building 
Democratic constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Grossman, who ran the daily operation at a time when Democrats  
have been under severe financial strain, reported the party is 
making progress paying its debts. The party still owes $7 million, 
he said, but said that could be ``wiped out in fairly short 
order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romer drew some laughs when he read to the executive committee  
from a Washington Post article about frustrated conservatives at a 
weekend meeting in suburban Virginia of the Conservative Political 
Action Committee (CPAC). 
</P>
<P>
	A Christian conservative was quoted: ``The American people are  
messed up'' because they aren't more angry with President Clinton 
over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Romer commented: ``That's an 
interesting way to view the political system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative commentator frustrated with the GOP's attempts to  
soften its image was quoted: ``The Republican Party is a stupid 
party'' Romer: ``Now I think that's overdoing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Republican National Committee meeting, Pennsylvania Gov.  
Tom Ridge warned fellow Republicans to refocus their message on 
education, the environment and urban affairs, or they will lose the 
White House again. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican vice presidential prospect, Ridge said the party  
must talk about issues in ways that matter to average people, not 
conceding a single vote, a single issue or a single region. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are the party that concedes votes, concedes people,  
there is no hope of becoming or retaining the majority party,'' 
Ridge said. ``Let Democrats be the party of division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the CPAC meeting in Crystal City, Va., religious activist  
Gary Bauer won a straw poll of presidential aspirants with 28 
percent of the vote. He was followed by Texas Gov. George W. Bush 
with 24 percent. Billionaire publisher Steve Forbes had 10 percent, 
followed by Elizabeth Dole with 8 percent. Alan Keyes had 6 
percent, followed by former Vice President Dan Quayle and 
``undecided'' with 5 percent each. 
</P>
<P>
	Round out the field were Rep. John Kasich and commentator Pat  
Buchanan with 3 percent each and Sen. John Ashcroft with 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 1,000 of the 2,200 attending the convention  
participated in the straw poll.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Reeling from Brown Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peter Magowan seemed to be speaking for half the  
major league owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Dodgers misled everybody in baseball,'' the San  
Francisco Giants boss said. ``I feel somewhat stabbed in the back 
by what they told us and what they've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a month after Kevin Brown agreed to a $105 million,  
seven-year contract with Rupert Murdoch's Los Angeles Dodgers, 
baseball is reeling from the fallout from a deal that has 
galvanized small-market teams into demanding change. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitive imbalance dominated hallway talk earlier this month  
at the owners' meetings in Carlsbad, Calif. Even though the next 
round of collective bargaining likely won't begin until after the 
2001 season, salary-cap talk filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're midway through a baseball deal that doesn't work well  
for a number of teams,'' said Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta 
Braves and the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last agreement, players agreed to a 35 percent luxury tax  
on the teams with the five highest payrolls, a figure that drops to 
34 percent this year. But the amount given to players by baseball's 
big spenders has slowed only slightly because the tax starts at 
such a high level -- the midpoint between the fifth- and 
sixth-highest payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the tax would have no impact whatsoever and that has  
proven to be the case,'' Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger among the low-revenue teams has been brewing for years.  
With Brown's contract, it burst into the open at its highest level 
since the end of the 232-day strike that wiped out the last two 
months of the 1994 season, the World Series and the first three 
weeks of the '95 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many teams have raised ticket prices in order to maintain high  
payrolls -- the top regular ticket at Yankee Stadium has gone from 
$25 in 1996, to $35 in '97 to $45 in '98 to $50 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, teams are adding premium seats. The Yankees last  
year built an extra 60 first-row seats that sell for $16,000 a 
season ($197.53 per game). The Mets are adding 90 premium seats 
that will sell for $150 and $100 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impacting the affordability of baseball to the fans,''  
San Diego Padres president Larry Lucchino said. ``It's impacting 
families. It's impacting the competitive balance that's at the 
heart of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 12 teams with payrolls of $48 million or higher last  
year, eight made the playoffs and all but one had a winning record. 
The Baltimore Orioles, who spent a major league-high $74.2 million, 
were the exception, stumbling to a 79-83 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 18 teams who spent less than $48 million, only three  
had winning records: San Francisco (89-74), St. Louis (83-79) and 
Toronto (88-74). And the Giants and Cardinals each spent more than 
$47 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, you get what you pay for.  
</P>
<P>
	``The symbolism of a $100 million contract has brought it into  
focus, but it's been building for a long time,'' Lucchino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' association, which negotiated the landmark  
agreement creating free agency in 1976, successfully withstood 
assaults during a 50-day strike in 1981, a two-day strike in 1995, 
a 32-day lockout in 1990 and the 1994-95 strike, which caused a 20 
percent drop in attendance that hasn't entirely been erased. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Donald Fehr has repeatedly told commissioner Bud  
Selig the problem has nothing to do with players. In his view, it's 
all about the refusal of high-revenue teams to share more of their 
money with their low-revenue partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Fehr made clear the owners' hope for a salary cap in baseball is  
a pipe dream. While NBA owners negotiated a salary maximum of $14 
million, baseball would have to lose one or two seasons to get its 
players to even consider a similar provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen anything so far that suggests we're going  
to,'' Fehr said Thursday. ``Baseball players have historically 
behaved in very different ways than basketball players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union and agents have warned teams not to even think of  
asking for a salary cap. Some agents have said players already are 
beginning to get ready for another long war -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least through today, the memories of what we went through  
four years ago remain reasonably vivid,'' Fehr said. ``If that 
remains when we get to bargaining, that should have a beneficial 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners hope the increased competitive imbalance will cause  
players on the have-nots to push for change. The popular phrase of 
this offseason seems to be ``young and exciting.'' It seems to be a 
euphemism for ``100-game loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, Florida, Kansas City, Minnesota, Montreal, Oakland  
and Pittsburgh all appear likely to start the season with payrolls 
of $20 million or lower and have little hope to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to envision scenarios in which the Chicago White Sox,  
Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle, Tampa Bay and 
Toronto can contend for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	That's half the major leagues eliminated or virtually  
eliminated. And spring training is still a month away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gotten worse each year,'' Pirates outfielder Brian Giles  
said. ``The players have to be willing to sit down and work out 
something that will work for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're on a winning team, you don't think about those  
things. But reality hits (when a player comes to a smaller market). 
... The players have to sit down with the owners so we don't have a 
mess like we did four years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is a distinct minority viewpoint among the players'  
association, a group that has seen its militant defense of the free 
market raise the average salary from $51,501 in 1976 to $1,398,831 
last season. For them, players can choose wherever they want to be 
after six seasons in the major leagues. If they're stuck on a 
low-revenue team early in their career, that's the price to be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the most important word in sports is hope, that fans  
have the hope that their team has a chance to be competitive,'' 
Magowan said. ``Something has to be done. I don't think fans want 
to know two-thirds of the teams have no chance to win. For players 
on these teams, what are they playing for? For themselves? To 
entertain? Or do they want to compete?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magowan and former Oakland Athletics president Sandy Alderson,  
now executive vice president of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office, have said low-revenue teams have seen they 
can't win with $40 million payrolls and are slicing them to $20 
million. That frees up even more good players for the high-revenue 
teams to gobble up, increasing competitive imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig hasn't given any solutions, other than saying he is going  
to enforce the rule requiring teams not to have debts of more than 
40 percent of their net worth. Given increased corporate ownership, 
it's not clear how he intends to enforce the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than that, his primary action has been to establish a  
committee to examine the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to need a lot of planning,'' Houston Astros owner  
Drayton McLane said. ``It didn't get in this shape overnight -- it 
took years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, the Dodgers say they're blameless, that they  
paid what others were willing to pay for Brown -- a notion scoffed 
at by Lucchino. Other teams have blamed Murdoch for raising the 
cost of all future players. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, we're trying to run the business on a  
stand-alone basis,'' Dodgers president Bob Graziano said. ``We felt 
we needed to make a commitment to winning, and that's what we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Minnesota, Montreal and Oakland facing uncertain futures,  
some in baseball are talking for the first time in years about 
contraction -- rather than moving a team, folding it and dispersing 
its players. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one fewer team to split broadcast money with. There's no  
prime city for a move -- unless Charlotte, N.C., reverses course and 
decides to finance a ballpark, or someone is willing to move into 
Northern Virginia and pay for a court fight with Orioles owner 
Peter Angeles, who would try to block a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who will lead owners in the next round of negotiations,  
says his priority is to avoid a strike or lockout. But he doesn't 
say how. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can take another work stoppage,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Basketball Star's Death Stuns Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NACOGDOCHES, Texas (AP) -- Katrina Price was not a quitter. She  
was anything but a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
	When her mother died of cancer during her senior year in high  
school, Price didn't even miss a practice. She wrote ``Mom'' on a 
royal blue ribbon, strapped it to her right ankle and led Waco La 
Vega to the league basketball finals. She also graduated second in 
her class. 
</P>
<P>
	When her father died of a heart attack during her senior year at  
Stephen F. Austin State University, Price missed one game, strapped 
on a black ``Dad'' ribbon above a black ``Mom'' band and became a 
third-team All-American. A few months later, she received her 
bachelor's degree and teaching certificate with a 3.7 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Price signed with the ABL, but her team folded and she ended up  
as a reserve shooting guard for the Philadelphia Rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the entire league went under in late December, but Price  
still hoped to play in the WNBA or overseas or perhaps become a 
coach. In the meantime, she enrolled in graduate school at Stephen 
F. Austin and took a job as a substitute teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court and off, Price handled adversity like it was an  
open 10-foot jumper, hitting nothing but net every time. The 
tighter the situation, the better she was. 
</P>
<P>
	At least that's what everyone thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Just before 7 a.m. last Monday at an apartment she shared with a  
sister, Price died of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun blast to 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there were no witnesses, police are investigating the  
death as a homicide but believe it was suicide. The 23-year-old 
Price left a letter for her family, which is keeping it private. 
</P>
<P>
	The first reaction was that her death had to be an accident. Or  
a mistake. Or even untrue. Those closest to her are still burdened 
by questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would a bright, talented woman from a large close-knit  
family suddenly give up? Why did she quit on life? 
</P>
<P>
	Was it because of basketball? Sure, there were no guarantees the  
WNBA would want her. But at least she'd have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knew of any money woes, bad relationships or health  
problems. Autopsy results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like she had debts she'd accrued or had an expensive  
lifestyle to keep up,'' agent Fred Schreyer said. ``Having talked 
to her the week before, I never heard anything in her voice that 
would indicate she was in a different mental state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Price occasionally mentioned being depressed in the  
past month, those closest to her didn't consider it serious, more a 
case of the blues caused by her stalled career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, everyone has some days when they are down, but it was  
never something we couldn't build back up,'' said Glenda Shead, the 
second-oldest of the nine Price girls. ``There was nothing nobody 
wouldn't have done for her, and she knew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price may have felt like a failure because the ABL was the first  
league she didn't dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	After starring in high school and college, she averaged only 2.7  
points per game for the Rage while backing up four-time Olympian 
Teresa Edwards. Although Price understood her role, she didn't 
necessarily like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That can be hard to deal with,'' said La'Keisha Frett, one of  
Price's closest teammates. ``But KP worked hard. Teresa even said 
at a team meeting that she never heard KP complain, and for Teresa 
to say that tells you a whole lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Price may have felt she let people down by not taking the  
ABL by storm. After all, one sister said Price, the eighth of the 
nine girls, ``was our hero. ... She was Michael Jordan to her 
nieces and nephews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever her problems, Price hid them well. Shead and Price had  
a long talk after the ABL folded and there were no signs of 
anything unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd already climbed so many mountains,'' Shead said. ``I was  
hoping she had climbed this one and we'd go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another mountain that seemed conquered, but might not have been,  
was the loss of her parents, something Price rarely discussed. 
After each death, she focused instead on basketball. Now, the sport 
no longer was a refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	The routine of practices and games was gone, and she was without  
an outlet to release the energy that drove her to score 20 or more 
points in all seven NCAA tournament games she played. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was not busy playing basketball anymore, and I think she  
had some time to think about everything that had happened to her,'' 
Shead said, adding that two grandparents died in the years between 
their mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Price died is just as stunning because she didn't know  
much about guns. Family and friends want to know where Price got 
the shotgun. All police say is that it wasn't stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	But knowing more about the weapon won't erase the haunting image  
of the 5-foot-10 Price holding out her arms and firing the fatal 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a picture I'm trying to get out of my head,'' Stephen  
F. Austin coach Royce Chadwick said. ``I'm trying to remember the 
times she carried us on the court or when she was doing charity 
work for the Alzheimer's association or the March of Dimes. I don't 
want to picture her holding a rifle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone who knew her wants to remember the woman nicknamed  
``Sugar'' with a basketball in her hands or just enjoying life. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people gathered at the La Vega auditorium Thursday  
night to honor Price. They recalled her glory days as a basketball, 
volleyball and track star as well as her academic achievements, 
community work and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ABL folded Dec. 22, Price took it in stride. She was  
already home for the holidays and she seemed as happy as ever, 
showering relatives with shirts, caps and other goodies from the 
company paying her to wear their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an Adidas Christmas,'' one sister said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the holidays, Price flew back to Philadelphia to clean out  
her apartment while two sisters drove there to bring her home. In 
between, Price was unsure of her next move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd talk to her once and she'd say she'd try to teach,'' Frett  
said. ``Then she'd say she was going back to school. Then it came 
up that she said she'd play overseas if she got the chance. But it 
wasn't like, `Oh my gosh, what am I going to do?' It wasn't 
frantic. I was doing the same thing in my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price decided to pursue a master's degree in education, so she  
moved in with younger sister Lucy, a Stephen F. Austin undergrad. 
</P>
<P>
	Price then was hired as a substitute aide at a county school for  
troubled youths on Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Several days later, she was in the stands with Shead watching  
the Ladyjacks lose 85-84 to Northwestern State. After the game, the 
school's career scoring leader waited outside the locker room to 
console her friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``She put her arm around me and said, `Don't worry about it,  
coach. They played good, they played hard. It'll be OK. Everything 
will be all right,''' assistant coach Roxanne White said. ``That 
was Price's way. She was always positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Price called Josh Belson, her strength and conditioning  
coach in college, to discuss training with him. Belson noticed that 
Price seemed worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was concerned with not being able to figure out what she  
wanted to do,'' he said. ``She was adamant about not wanting to go 
overseas. I don't think she wanted to be halfway across the world, 
that far away from her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to play somewhere in the States, but she was  
concerned she wouldn't be able to make the WNBA. She knew she'd get 
a shot, but with all the players from the ABL also trying out, she 
wasn't sure how she'd get looked at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belson encouraged her, saying that the WNBA might draft her on  
potential alone, and she agreed it was worth trying. They decided 
to start working out last Monday at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seemed like she was looking forward to it,'' Belson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Price never made it.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, friends and family are thinking about their last encounters  
with Price, searching for signs and wondering what they could have 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to find a way that I could have gone back and made  
a difference in some way, shape or form because she was a great 
person,'' Chadwick said. ``She does not need to not be here. It 
doesn't make sense.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Begins Voter Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Vowing to register 2 million new voters,  
Jesse Jackson began a southern registration drive Saturday at the 
site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, reminding King's followers 
he was a man of action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not killed for dreaming. He was killed fighting for  
public policy and we must honor that tradition,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition expects to register 2 million  
new voters by April 4, the 31st anniversary of King's assassination 
in Memphis in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive gets underway in earnest Sunday and Monday in  
Mississippi. Jackson said he will swing through all southern 
states, from Virginia to Texas, and will encourage voters to elect 
candidates who support equal opportunity and economic justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increased voter participation affects the quality of  
leadership,'' Jackson said. ``So we go back south where the same 
whites and blacks who can play ball together, who go to the 
military together can now define there economic interests 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He singled out Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., as an example of the  
kind of officeholder who should be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lott is No. 1 in the Senate. Mississippi is No. 1 in infant  
mortality,'' Jackson said. ``Is his interest Mississippi? His 
obsession is tearing Bill Clinton down rather than lifting 
Mississippi and the South up. The people must have something to say 
about that and we intend to register people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters from Mississippi in a conference call  
earlier in the week that he wished Jackson would not conduct a 
voter registration drive in such a ``negative way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) anything that can be done to get more people to vote is  
great,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said Republican attacks on President Clinton and his  
critic's insistence on impeachment have angered many people and may 
help efforts to register more voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who spoke to about 100 supporters at The Lorraine  
Motel, now the National Civil Rights Museum and site of King's 
assassination, said the drive will honor King's struggle to ensure 
all Americans benefit in the country's political and economic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we include more people, we include more talent, more  
markets, more brains, more productivity,'' he said. ``Inclusion 
leads to growth and when there's growth, everyone wins.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Braces for IOC Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake organizers braced for the  
International Olympic Committee's report on bribery accusations 
surrounding the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee plans to discuss the report  
at a news conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just awaiting for the report as is everyone else,'' SLOC  
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel in Lausanne, Switzerland, is considering whether to  
expel members in the biggest corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Saturday its six-member panel was completing its  
Salt Lake City inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	After the commission gives its report, the executive board will  
propose expulsions and announce plans for overhauling the Olympic 
bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members were implicated in the Salt Lake scandal  
regarding cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and other 
favors. Two of them resigned this week, and IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said as many as seven others might face removal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake organizing committee's two top executives resigned  
two weeks ago. One of them, SLOC president Frank Joklik, will be at 
Sunday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains the committee's head until a replacement is found.  
Robert Garff, chairman of the SLOC Board of Trustees, also plans to 
attend the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff has been meeting with committee board members and Gov.  
Mike Leavitt in deciding how the search for Jolik's successor will 
be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all know the dimensions of this,'' Leavitt said.  
``We have to find the right person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said he has been ``thinking as hard and as fast as I  
can'' to come up with a new leader for the Salt Lake committee, but 
so far has no front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the latest accusations is that the son of a prominent IOC  
member asked Salt Lake bid executives for a payment of $30,000 to 
$35,000 the day before the city lost the 1998 Nagano Winter Games, 
a source close to the bid process told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo said he  
might be able to influence four votes, but did not promise them, 
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake boosters did not pay the money to Jean-Jacques Ganga  
and the next day in Birmingham, England, Salt Lake lost to Nagano 
by four votes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the IOC commission, an SLOC ethics panel, the  
U.S. Olympic Committee, the Justice Department and the Utah 
attorney general are investigating.

<HEADLINE> New York To Retrain Welfare Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bowing to legal pressure from advocates for the  
poor, the city has agreed to retrain hundreds of welfare-agency 
workers in the proper procedure for helping people seeking food 
stamps and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes will include closer monitoring of welfare centers,  
revisions in application forms and the posting of signs that detail 
the public's rights to government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes came to light Thursday during testimony in federal  
court as part of a class-action lawsuit filed against the city by 
the Legal Aid Society and the Welfare Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials acknowledged that welfare workers have repeatedly  
violated the law by sending some people to food pantries instead of 
screening them for emergency benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Other workers refused to consider applications by immigrants or  
women who showed up without their husbands. Still others were 
rejected if they tried to apply for benefits after 11 a.m., workers 
testified.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Court Overturns Sentencing Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Corrections officers had to release 18  
inmates after a truth-in-sentencing law that took effect in 1985 
was declared unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections Department spokesman Nic Howell said the inmates  
were given street clothes and money they earned working in prison, 
put on a bus for home and ordered to report to their parole 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are gone,'' he said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2,600 criminals were sentenced under the overturned law,  
which ended the practice of granting prisoners one day off for 
every day of good behavior -- in effect, cutting their sentences in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth-in-sentencing required murderers to serve their full  
sentences and many other violent felons to serve at least 85 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court held that lawmakers passed the measure as part  
of a sweeping package of unrelated legislation, violating a 
constitutional ban on mixing together different subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers passed a revised version of the truth-in-sentencing  
measure after an appeals court found the original version 
unconstitutional, and that new law remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	But the flawed version was used between 1995 and 1998, and 2,570  
people were sentenced under it, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those people now qualify for ``day-for-day'' reductions in their  
sentences. The ones released Friday had the shortest sentences -- 
presumably the least dangerous criminals.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is splitting into  
four new divisions, three of which will have headquarters outside 
the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said the reorganization will  
make it easier to focus on specific needs of taxpayers large and 
small. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organizing around specific customer segments is a major step  
toward modernizing the IRS,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four operating divisions were announced Friday. Their  
locations are: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wage and Investment Income, covering 88 million tax filers,  
headquartered in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Small Business and Self-Employed, 40 million filers,  
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Large and Mid-Size Business, 170,000 filers, to-be-announced  
site in central New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tax Exempt, 1.5 million filers, New Carrollton, Md.

<HEADLINE> Will &AMP; Grace: Kiss Not Just a Kiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- During a season when networks seemed to be  
reworking the same tired formulas, NBC brought forth a male-female 
sitcom in which sex was not a factor between the two leads. The 
reason: He's gay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will &AMP; Grace,'' starring Eric McCormack and Debra Messing,  
drew tolerable ratings in an unfavorable Monday time slot and has 
improved following a switch to Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. (EST). Recent 
ratings indicate that the audience is responding positively to the 
odd pairing -- and to Will's flamboyant friend, played by Sean 
Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	So is the gay community.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both the characters of Will and Jack are fair portrayals of  
gay men,'' says Scott Seomin, entertainment spokesman for the Gay 
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, based in Los Angeles. 
``One of our callers expressed a big concern that Will was not gay 
enough and Jack was too flamboyant and campy. I had a question: 
'How many Jacks have you known?' 
</P>
<P>
	``As for Will, he had just ended a relationship with a man.  
Unlike 'Ellen,' the story is not about his coming out. He already 
is out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our callers ask: 'Are we going to see him affectionate to  
other men?' To show him in bed with a man or kissing a man would 
turn off a large part of the audience. After all, the show is 'Will 
&AMP; Grace,' not 'Will and the Men He Dates.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-born McCormack, who is married and previously appeared  
in macho TV roles in ``Lonesome Dove'' and ``The Outlaw Years,'' 
takes all this in stride. During an interview at CBS Studio Center, 
he can recall no qualms when the series was offered to him. 
</P>
<P>
	His initial reaction? ``What a great idea!'' McCormack says.  
``I've read some great sitcoms in the past two years. The only 
problem was that they didn't stand out. ... The writing was sharp, 
but the idea was never going to jump out of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibilities of ``Will and Grace'' delight McCormack.  
``There's a hook here. Hopefully we can get beyond the hook. But 
the hook -- gay man-straight woman -- will land us somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the situations that happen to Will and Grace happen  
to Paul and Jamie on 'Mad About You.' But we're not married. All of 
a sudden, even the most banal sitcom cliche can be turned two or 
three degrees and become an original take on something,'' McCormack 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked in the mirror and said, 'I could conceivably be  
playing a gay man for seven years. Is that a problem?' No. Because 
gay or straight, Will is me: the way he speaks, the way he feels, 
the way he communicates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCormack doesn't dodge criticisms that Jack is too gay and  
Will, a successful Manhattan lawyer, not gay enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``If gay men really want the rest of the world to understand  
them, one of their messages should be: Hey, there's as much variety 
in our community as there is in yours. I think we show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And concerning a kiss between two men:  
</P>
<P>
	``Before we were even on the air, a lot of the press decided  
that the 'kiss' was this milestone that represented how daring and 
true NBC was going to be. I'm not sure why a kiss matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What matters is knowing that eventually, in the  
not-too-distant future, Will is getting out there, the way a 
straight character on 'Friends' would. After eight, nine, 15 
episodes of characters sitting around yakking, joking, you start to 
think, 'Is Chandler (Matthew Perry) ever going to have a date? It's 
time for the character to have a date.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Same with Will. He's gotta have a date. But why do they have  
to show a big kiss? ... It's titillation, something to put on the 
front page. What we're concerned with is who is the guy he goes out 
with, what happens on the date. 
</P>
<P>
	``A kiss isn't funny. And this is a comedy.''

<HEADLINE> Baby Bjorn Infant Carrier Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Owners of Regal Lager's Baby Bjorn infant  
carrier should contact the company for a repair kit to prevent 
their infants from falling through the leg opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marietta, Ga., company is recalling about 240,000 of its  
fabric infant carriers for repair, after receiving nine reports of 
infants slipping through the leg openings and falling to the 
ground. Six of the infants suffered skull fractures, the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Baby Bjorn'' Infant Carrier is a soft-fabric, front  
carrier sold in navy-blue, black, denim, green and other colors. 
The name ``Baby Bjorn'' is printed on the front and strap of the 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants who are under 2 months of age are at greatest risk, the  
CPSC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The carriers were sold nationwide by juvenile specialty stores  
and mail-order catalogs from January 1991 through December 1998 for 
about $75. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should immediately stop using these carriers for  
children under 2 months of age. All carriers need to be repaired. 
The company is offering consumers a free repair kit to attach to 
the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	All consumers should call Regal Lager toll-free at 877-242-5676  
anytime to receive the retrofit kit. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers sold after Dec. 1, 1998, are not included in the  
recall.

<HEADLINE> Paintings Stolen From Brit Gallery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORK, England (AP) -- Two men armed with a shotgun raided an art  
gallery in northern England and stole 20 paintings valued at $1.6 
million, gallery officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stolen paintings included a Turner watercolor dating from  
the 1820s. 
</P>
<P>
	Curator Richard Green said the masked men entered the York City  
Art Gallery Friday evening and tied up four employees. The thieves 
removed the works by smashing displays and cutting pictures out of 
the frames, he said. The employees were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have 20 works taken leaves a huge dent in our collection,''  
Green said. ``It is a very black day.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Starr's Motion for Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of motion by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel  
Monica Lewinsky to be debriefed by House managers: 
</P>
<P>
	The United States of America, by Kenneth W. Starr, Independent  
Counsel, respectfully submits this motion for an order requiring 
Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the terms of her Immunity Agreement 
(the ``Agreement'') with the Office of the Independent Counsel 
(``OIC''). Ms. Lewinsky has refused an OIC request that she be 
debriefed by the House of Representatives, as required by the 
Agreement. The United States respectfully requests that this Court 
order Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the Agreement by allowing herself 
to be debriefed. 
</P>
<P>
	I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND   	
</P>
<P>
	As this Court is no doubt aware, the United States Senate is  
currently conducting an impeachment trial of the president of the 
United States. According to public reports, it is expected that the 
House will be required to submit to the Senate its motion to 
witnesses as early as Monday, Jan. 25. Again according to public 
reports, some potential witnesses have spoken with the House 
managers as the managers attempt to determine which witnesses 
should be mentioned in their motion to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 21, 1999, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.  
Hyde, on behalf of the House of Representatives, as represented by 
its duly-appointed Managers, asked for the OIC's assistance in 
having Ms. Lewinsky debriefed by the House. The House stressed that 
it needs this debriefing to occur no later than Sunday, Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	That same day, the OIC sent a letter to Ms. Lewinsky's counsel  
requesting that Ms. Lewinsky allow herself to be debriefed by the 
House managers. At approximately 1:20 p.m. this afternoon, Ms. 
Lewinsky informed the OIC that she does not intend to comply with 
this request. 
</P>
<P>
	II. THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT PLAINLY REQUIRES MS. LEWINSKY TO BE  
DEBRIEFED BY ANY INSTITUTION THAT THE OIC SPECIFIES. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky will be fully debriefed concerning her knowledge of  
and participation in any activities within the OIC's jurisdiction. 
This debriefing will be conducted by the OIC, including attorneys, 
law enforcement agents, and representatives of any other 
institutions as the OIC may require. Ms. Lewinsky will make herself 
available for any interviews upon reasonable request. 
</P>
<P>
	By the plain terms of the Agreement, Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to  
be debriefed by representatives of any institution, when so 
required by the OIC. She is also required to ``make herself 
available for any interviews upon reasonable request.'' The duly 
appointed House Managers represent the House of Representatives, 
which plainly is an institution. The OIC has unambiguously 
requested that Ms. Lewinsky submit to such debriefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Accordingly, Ms. Lewinsky must allow herself to be debriefed by  
the House Managers or she will have violated the Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has the right to have her ``debriefing  
. . . conducted by the OIC.'' The OIC, of course, is fully willing 
to conduct these debriefings, if Ms. Lewinsky so desires. The 
suggestion in her counsel's letter that this provision is void if 
the OIC is ``acting as an agent for others,'' is contrary to the 
Agreement, as there is no such limitation on Ms. Lewinsky's duties. 
A party to an agreement may not invent clauses to a contract that 
are not contained therein. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the OIC is not acting as an agent for the House  
Managers. The OIC has its own, continuing duty to provide the House 
with information relating to impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's counsel's other suggestion -- that a debriefing  
would be contrary to Senate rules -- is equally without merit. 
Senate Resolution 16 states, in relevant part: 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate agrees to allow either the House or the  
President to call witnesses, the witnesses shall first be deposed 
and the Senate shall decide after deposition which witnesses shall 
testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is plain that depositions may not be conducted  
absent a vote of the Senate, nothing in this resolution restricts 
the ability of the House to debrief witnesses in a non-deposition 
setting. Indeed, it would be strange for the Senate to prohibit the 
House and the President from doing the investigation necessary to 
determine whether they wish to call witnesses and which witnesses 
to list in their motions. 
</P>
<P>
	III. THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT AN ORDER REQUIRING MS. LEWINSKY TO  
COMPLY WITH THE IMMUNITY AGREEMENT OR FORFEIT ITS PROTECTION. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Agreement, this Court has the authority to determine  
whether Ms. Lewinsky has ``violated any provision of this 
Agreement.'' A declaratory judgment will ordinarily be granted only 
when it will either serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal 
relations in issue or terminate and afford relief from the 
uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding.'' In this case, a declaratory judgment will resolve the 
uncertainty arising from this controversy between the OIC and Ms. 
Lewinsky by settling whether she has the right to refuse to be 
debriefed without forfeiting the protections of the Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, declaratory judgment is a common remedy when a party to  
a contract intends conduct that may be a breach.: ``(A) party to a 
contract is not compelled to wait until he has committed an act 
which the other party asserts will constitute a breach, but may 
seek relief by declaratory judgment and have the controversy 
adjudicated in order that he may avoid the risk of damages or other 
untoward consequence.'' Accordingly, this Court has the power to 
issue a declaratory judgment before Ms. Lewinsky's actions become 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
	IV. CONCLUSION   	
</P>
<P>
	The Immunity Agreement plainly requires that Ms. Lewinsky allow  
herself to be debriefed by any institution at the request of the 
OIC. Ms. Lewinsky has the right to insist that the OIC conduct the 
debriefing, but she must comply with the plain terms of the 
Immunity Agreement. Accordingly, the United States respectfully 
requests that this Court enter an order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to 
submit to debriefing by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its motion to  
call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House has stressed its 
need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend. Accordingly, the United 
States respectfully requests that this Court act on this motion as 
an emergency matter. Specifically, we request a hearing on this 
matter today.

	Sen. Wants Lewinsky Order Blocked  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic Senator Tom Harkin wants Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist to block an interview of Monica Lewinsky 
by House prosecutors. This comes after a federal judge today 
ordered Lewinsky to meet with House prosecutors involved in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, acting on House prosecutors' behalf, won the emergency 
order. Democrats assailed Starr for intervening in the dispute. 
Lewinsky's attorney said she would comply with the order.

	Clinton To Get GOP Questions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says  
President Clinton will be getting written questions from GOP 
senators as early as Monday to resolve ``some of the 
inconsistencies'' in the impeachment case. Meanwhile, the trial 
dissolved into partisan debate today, as lawmakers and lawyers 
dueled over a surprise attempt by House prosecutors to question 
Monica Lewinsky before the Senate decides whether to call 
witnesses. Also, a Republican spokesman predicted that an attempt 
by Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd to dismiss all charges will fail.

	US Defends Policy After Iraq Clash  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A National Security Council spokesman says  
today's confrontations between four U.S. military planes and Iraqi 
forces will not stop U.S. enforcement of ``no-fly'' zones. In the 
incident, American warplanes bombed two Iraqi defense sites after 
encountering the Iraqi jet. The U.S. planes, patrolling the 
``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq, detected the Iraqi jets 
``darting in and out'' of restricted airspace, a U.S. official 
said. It was the latest in a string of test-of-will clashes since a 
mid-December bombing campaign by British and American forces. Iraq 
has demanded that the United States and Britain end what Saddam 
calls their ``illegal'' patrols in the restricted zones set up over 
northern and southern Iraq.

	Battle Looms in Congress Over Taxes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite assurances of bipartisanship, a fierce  
struggle is brewing between Democrats and Republicans over the 
GOP's proposal for a 10 percent income tax cut that would swallow a 
chunk of the budget surplus. Still smarting from losses in the 1998 
elections, Republicans are determined to push through a significant 
cut so they're not viewed by voters as a party obsessed with 
impeaching President Clinton. Democrats are just as adamant that 
the surplus -- now estimated at $4.4 trillion in the next 15 years -- 
should be used mainly to keep Social Security and Medicare from 
insolvency as the huge baby boom generation retires.

	Three Burned to Death in India  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Rampaging Hindus burned to death an  
Australian missionary and his two sons as they slept in a jeep in 
eastern India today, the first deaths in a recent spate of 
Hindu-Christian violence. Graham Stewart Stains, a secretary of the 
Evangelical Missionary Society, and his sons were attacked by 
activists from the radical Bajrang Dal, a group affiliated with the 
ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, police said. 
Police arrested five members of Bajrang Dal, said Binay Beheera, 
the provincial police inspector-general, quoted by the Press Trust 
of India. Police were searching for other activists.

	Pope Prods Church on Fighting Evil  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II today turned his church's  
attention to the evils of exploitative capitalism, issuing a major 
statement that also called upon the church to reach out to 
society's movers and shakers. In a document intended to change the 
direction of the Roman Catholic church, John Paul said pastors must 
preach the Christian message to the rich and the powerful, not just 
the poor. The pope also pushed his church to battle ``social 
sins,'' such as drug trafficking and corruption. But more 
generally, the missive reflects the pope's concerns about 
unfettered capitalism.

scheduled a 7 p.m., EST, news conference to announce the 
acquisition of a player. Gugliotta, considered the best of the free 
agents still uncommitted, reportedly was en route to Phoenix, where 
he is expected to sign a six-year contract worth about $60 million.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Named to Board of Ashley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has been  
appointed a non-executive director of Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, 
the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson holds 2 million shares in the company, the company  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was announced Thursday, when the British fashion  
and furnishing retailer's chief executive, Victoria Egan, announced 
her resignation and new figures showed sales had dived over 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the company fell 4 percent on the back of the  
resignation and financial figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded by an entrepreneurial woman of the same name, Laura  
Ashley made it big selling English country fashions and was heading 
for a listing on the stock exchange just its namesake founder died 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubles soon began. Laura Ashley tried to sell a new line  
of modern classics, but customers weren't buying, and efforts to 
recover have thus far failed.

<HEADLINE> Parking Meters Still Outlawed in ND </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Keeping one of the annoyances of the big  
city at bay, North Dakota legislators voted to retain the largely 
rural state's ban on parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate voted 27-21 on Friday to keep the ban, which  
was pushed in the late 1940s by a rural legislator angry over a 
dozen parking tickets he got when he came to town. 
</P>
<P>
	The close vote came after arguments from supporters like Sen.  
Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, who sees nothing wrong with letting city 
and county governments regulate parking with meters. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents like Sen. Jerome Kelsh, D-Fullerton, said  
governments shouldn't be able to collect money for parking on 
public streets, likening parking meters to charging city drivers a 
toll to use rural roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Meters aren't forbidden everywhere in North Dakota, just on  
public streets. There are some metered lots on college campuses.

<HEADLINE> Activists Deny Encouraging Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Defendants in a federal lawsuit that  
accuses anti-abortion activists of illegally threatening doctors 
say free speech never killed anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	But the principal defendant said the murders of two abortion  
doctors was justified, and he did not condemn the killers -- both 
former anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's justifiable,'' Charles Wysong said Friday, referring to  
the murders of Drs. John Britton and David Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed by Planned Parenthood and others, seeks $200  
million. It claims the American Coalition of Life Activists -- of 
which Wysong was once regional director -- and other activists 
crossed the line between free speech and threats with a series of 
``wanted'' posters and an Internet site called ``The Nuremberg 
Files,'' which lists list names and addresses of abortion doctors 
and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet site has drawn attention in particular because a  
New York abortion doctor on the list was killed by a sniper last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster called ``The Deadly Dozen'' was distributed at an  
anti-abortion rally, charging a dozen doctors with ``crimes against 
humanity'' and offering a $5,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Wysong said Friday that such literature wasn't intended as a  
threat -- but merely as a means to expose abortion doctors to public 
scrutiny and encourage local opposition to clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Force is not going to end abortion,'' Wysong said. ``We don't  
need to use violence. We have been able to use free speech methods. 
But they are trying to take away our free speech rights by using 
this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Murch, another former director for the American Coalition  
of Life Activists, testified that he repeatedly rejected violence 
in discussions with other abortion opponents about tactics and 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied that anti-abortion fliers and posters produced at  
his commercial printing shop in Springfield, Mass., were crafted to 
threaten the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Jones said he would like to see  
closing arguments in the case begin early next week.

<HEADLINE> South Has North Feel in Hula Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- Mike Price coaches a team in a state  
whose neighbor to the north is Canada. So does Michigan coach Lloyd 
Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	How Price was picked to coach the South team in Sunday's Hula  
Bowl is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ha! I don't know how they decided that one!'' Carr said.  
</P>
<P>
	The game features the likes of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams of Texas, Kansas State quarterback and Heisman runnerup 
Michael Bishop and first-team All-America cornerback Chris 
McAlister of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Carr, all three will be with Price on the  
South. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my team all week we're underdogs in this game, nobody  
expects us to win,'' Carr said of his team, whose biggest name is 
Missouri quarterback Corby Jones. ``I think it motivates us a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the obvious of trying to mold a disparate group of  
players into a unit in a week, the coaches are looking for ways to 
showcase players before the nearly 100 NFL scouts in attendance 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to give each kid a chance to show what they can  
do,'' said Price, the Washington State coach. ``You want to give 
each kid the opportunity to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr is impressed with how the players are focusing on football  
when on the field, despite the many distractions of Maui, but 
realistic enough to know the game could be sloppy at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a thing of art, but one thing I think is  
that you'll see two teams that play very hard,'' he said. ``That's 
the sense I get from the way they're practicing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop will start at quarterback for the South, Jones for the  
North. Both have to prove to scouts they can be quarterbacks at the 
pro level, despite talk they likely will end up as running backs by 
whatever teams draft them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can show them if given the opportunity,'' Jones  
said. ``Game time comes, maybe I can show them something, help 
myself out a little bit. If they already have their minds made up, 
maybe there's nothing I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wants to make more than a token appearance in the game,  
even though his agent doesn't want him to play and risk injury. 
Price joked he wouldn't play Williams ``more than 60 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said part of the reason he came back to Texas for his  
senior season was to play in the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to be a part of something like this my whole  
career,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Americans Were Impressionists Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not all impressionists were French.  
</P>
<P>
	Art fans flocked to the recent show at the National Gallery of  
Art of paintings by van Gogh, a Dutchman, which has now moved to 
Los Angeles. It follows a highly successful show there of Picasso, 
a Spaniard. Both artists were much influenced by the French 
impressionists. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Washington gallery has put up an exhibit, opening  
Sunday, that shows not-so-famous American impressionists were well 
in the running a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Horowitz, a practicing New York lawyer at 82, and his  
wife Margaret have been looking at pictures together since they 
were students at Columbia University 60 years ago. Most times, they 
used their own money to buy; sometimes they had to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of their collection can be seen in the exhibit of 49  
pictures, called ``American Impressionism and Realism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a mistake to think older American art is cheap, Horowitz  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people of the generation before Horowitz's loved Childe  
Hassam's exuberant painting of the bright flags that hung over a 
parade to celebrate the end of World War I. Christie's, the art 
auction house, sold that one last Dec. 2 for a record $7,922,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassam's work is prominent in the collection. A Hassam of  
poppies on an island off Portsmouth, N.H., is on the cover of the 
exhibition catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the one painting that always seems to be of special  
interest to collectors of French impressionist paintings,'' 
Horowitz said. He and his wife have promised to leave it to the 
National Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 49 works are by John Singer Sargent, famous at the  
end of the 1800s as a formal society-and-celebrity painter. He 
wrote a friend he was sick of doing what he called ``paughtraits.'' 
So his watercolors of two gondoliers resting by a Venetian palazzo, 
and a couple of young women relaxing under a willow tree, are in 
the laid-back style of his Paris impressionist friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French invented impressionism,'' said Nicolai Cikovsky  
Jr., who organized the impressionist exhibit. ``By 1890, when 
impressionism came to the United States, it was a worldwide 
phenomenon. There were English, Canadian, German, Italian 
impressionists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The French loved painting natural scenes, outdoors, and natural  
people doing things naturally. Americans took to their passion for 
color, outdoor painting and informality. 
</P>
<P>
	Claude Monet, the arch-impressionist, was a lifelong friend of  
Sargent. Other American painters spent time at Giverny, near Paris, 
where Monet had his studio. One, Theodore Butler, married a 
stepdaughter of Monet, Suzanne Monet-Hoschede.

<HEADLINE> Family Feud Revisited in Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Amid all the winning, Dan Reeves, Mike Shanahan and  
John Elway formed a dysfunctional family in Denver. In the end, it 
destroyed Reeves' relationship with his quarterback and offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	It also laid the groundwork for the Broncos powerhouse that  
plays the Reeves-coached Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the three apparently patched up their differences during a  
round of golf at Augusta during Masters week last year, the past 
has not been forgotten entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away,'' Reeves  
said. ``You never forget those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how did this family feud get started?  
</P>
<P>
	The problems date back to the beginning of Elway's NFL career in  
1983, three years before the Broncos won the first of the 
quarterback's five AFC titles. 
</P>
<P>
	From the outset, the top overall pick in the '83 draft wanted  
Denver to run a gambling, pass-oriented attack. In Reeves, who 
masterminded much of the Dallas Cowboys' innovative offense with 
Roger Staubach at quarterback, Elway seemed to have a philosophical 
ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Reeves turned conservative in his play-calling. And he  
rode Elway for his mistakes, even though the quarterback was a 
rookie. When Reeves benched Elway for a playoff game against 
Seattle (a 31-7 loss) in favor of Steve DeBerg, Elway even told his 
wife that he might not go back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Reeves hired Shanahan, first as receivers coach in 1984,  
then as offensive coordinator in '85. Elway began to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike knew how to get the best out of him,'' Reeves said.  
``There was just a respect there and it's obviously still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, '87 and '89, thanks greatly to Elway's magic, Denver  
went to the Super Bowl but lost each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway began to feel shackled. He wondered why his coach didn't  
give him more input. Shanahan was rehired in 1990, but Elway 
believed Reeves didn't allow Shanahan to open up the offense. Why, 
in Elway's words, was Reeves ``so inflexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, in turn, said he felt ``blindsided'' by Elway's public  
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The feud soon turned nasty after Reeves fired Shanahan, saying  
it was apparent to him his assistant and his quarterback worked out 
what plays to call before games. That, to Reeves, was a direct 
challenge to the head coach's authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly knew at the time it wasn't going to help the  
relationship,'' Reeves said. ``I knew they were really, really good 
friends, and still are. But if I was going to do what I thought was 
best, I had to go ahead and make that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Shanahan: ``Dan wanted to run the offense, and he wanted  
complete control. He didn't want somebody with my type of 
personality around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who argued with Reeves for much of 1991 on who should  
have play-calling duties, again began thinking of leaving after 
Shanahan was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to enjoy playing football,'' Elway said. ``I get beat  
up too much, so I need to enjoy it. I get tired of getting caught 
up in the controversy, because I don't look at myself as a 
controversial guy. That wears on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get mad and you get upset, and everything flashes through  
your mind. Then I think you step back and get a good view of 
everything and try to put all the ducks in a pond. I think it was a 
natural reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned for the 1992 season, and Denver fell apart after he  
was injured in the 11th game. The Broncos wound up 8-8 and owner 
Pat Bowlen fired Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen and Elway insisted the player had no input in the  
decision. But such claims looked suspicious when Elway criticized 
his former coach at training camp in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have been back here if Dan Reeves had been here,''  
Elway said. ``It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It 
wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first six years, seven years were OK. ... The last three  
years have been hell. I felt like they never did anything 
offensively to make us better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who was hired to coach the New York Giants after leaving  
Denver, said, ``Let's just say it wasn't heaven for me either. I 
hope maybe one of these days he'll grow up and mature a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, meanwhile, won a Super Bowl as San Francisco's  
offensive coordinator in 1994, then was hired to succeed Wade 
Phillips as Broncos coach. Elway was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three years, the Broncos have been the AFC's best  
team. Last year, Elway and Shanahan crossed paths with Reeves when 
Denver went to Atlanta and beat the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	All three have tried to downplay the bitterness, but talk of the  
feud is inevitable as the teams prepare for the Super Bowl. Reeves, 
in fact, bared his soul about it at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that I will ever get over the full situation,''  
Reeves said. ``That changed a lot of people's lives. I don't know 
that Mike will ever get over that, what it caused his wife and 
children. Same thing with me. It caused a lot of pain for my wife 
and children. It's something that won't ever go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, however, doesn't seem to be as deeply affected.  
</P>
<P>
	``Time cures a lot of problems,'' he said. ``Some things don't  
seem so important or as big a deal as they did at the time. Time 
moves on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Shanahan: ``Dan was probably one of my closest friends at  
one time. Any time you end the way we did, there's always a little 
on the inside of you that rubs each of us the wrong way. But we're 
both mature enough to handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They'll all be a big part of each other's lives for the next  
week. Expect cordiality, not venom.

<HEADLINE>  Tampa Bay Relishes All-Star Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- It was Florida as advertised, sunny with the  
temperature in the upper 70s. It's hard to imagine the NHL All-Star 
game getting a warmer reception anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's brightest stars descended on Tampa Friday for a  
weekend of festivities that might have been greeted by indifference 
just a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But since expanding into the Sunshine State in the 1990s, the  
NHL's popularity in the deep south has grown steadily with 
transplanted northerners and native Floridians alike embracing the 
Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of more than 20,000 will pack the Ice Palace Sunday for  
the league's 49th All-Star game. Fans also will get a taste of 
history and what it takes to play at the highest level from 
tonight's Heroes of Hockey game and Skills Challenge, the main 
attractions of All-Star Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Gordie Howe is among the 32 former NHL stars who  
will play in the so-called ``old timers'' game, a characterization 
that many of the players reject. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heroes game, which is great,'' said former Tampa Bay  
player John Cullen, who retired early this season after overcoming 
a bout with cancer. ``Because these guys all are heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game isn't the first to be held in a warm-weather  
city. Los Angeles had the event in 1981 and San Jose was the site 
two years ago. Despite having the team with the NHL's worst record 
and home attendance numbers at the break, Tampa Bay is excited 
about having the midseason showcase in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The stop in Florida not only rewards the Lightning for building  
the Ice Palace, which opened two seasons ago, but also represents 
an extension of the league's commitment to increase its exposure in 
non-traditional hockey markets. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL FANtasy, a large interactive hockey theme park that took  
more than a week to set up in the Tampa Convention Center, has been 
a hit with youngsters and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the activities the league scheduled as part of the  
festivities were clinics, autograph sessions and a discussion panel 
focusing on the history of black players in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists included Willie O'Ree, Tony McKegney and Herb  
Carnegie, former athletes who related their experiences as pioneers 
in a sport where the overwhelming majority of players are white. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Ree broke the color barrier in 1958, while McKegney played  
junior and pro hockey for nearly 20 years before suiting up with or 
against another black player. Carnegie was a minor league standout 
in the 1940s who never got a tryout with a NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sickening and heartbreaking because all I wanted was a  
chance,'' Carnegie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's all-star game will feature representatives from each of  
the league's 27 teams, including Tampa Bay's Wendel Clark -- a 
14-year veteran selected for the first time since his rookie 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas and Detroit each had four players selected, although  
injuries have knocked two Red Wings out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Yzerman, the starting center on the North America team,  
broke his nose Thursday night against Carolina, and will be 
replaced on the roster by Luc Robitaille of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Uwe Krupp, injured previously, will be replaced in  
the World team starting lineup by Teppo Numminen of the Coyotes.

<HEADLINE> Girl Steers School Bus to Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VINELAND, N.J. (AP) -- Thirteen-year-old Cindy Volpe got an early  
driving lesson when her 79-year-old bus driver passed out behind 
the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver Felice Leone clutched his chest and fainted while heading  
to St. Francis of Assisi school. With his foot still on the gas 
pedal, the bus began to swerve toward oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy said she went to check on Leone because he was not  
responding to her question about a lost book bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was playing or joking,'' she said of the Friday  
incident. ``He grabbed his chest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy then grabbed for the steering wheel and forced the bus  
onto the curb. It stopped before it hit a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, which had five other students, then began to roll  
backward, but a bus driver who was following Leone's bus stopped, 
jumped onto the bus and put it into park. The driver said Leone 
radioed her before he passed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Leone, who was diagnosed with a heart condition a few years ago,  
was treated and released from a hospital.

<HEADLINE> Explosion in NJ Boiler Room Burns 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- Six men trying to light a broken-down  
boiler were set afire when the boiler exploded, sending them 
running and rolling down a parking lot ramp in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic Jorge Lau heard a loud bang Friday afternoon and ran  
toward the parking ramp with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a fellow on fire on the ramp,'' he said. ``There  
were five others falling on the ground already, like in a puddle of 
water. They were trying to put themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lau used the extinguisher to smother the fire on the first man.  
</P>
<P>
	``The one on the ramp asked me to take his coat off,'' Lau said.  
``When I took his coat off, the skin came off, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men, three supervisors from the city Department of Public  
Works and three oil company subcontractors, were trying to ignite 
the boiler to heat the building, which has office space and a 
garage for sanitation trucks, deputy Fire Chief James Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were taken to a hospital burn unit where four were in  
critical condition and two were stable, spokeswoman Robin Lally 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Actress Fights Weapons Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Actress Helen Mirren, star of  
the British television series ``Prime Suspect,'' campaigned 
Saturday against European weapons sales to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking as a representative of the British development  
organization, Oxfam, Mirren said she came to observe first-hand how 
weapons destroy people's lives in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``European countries are very culpable for the spread of arms  
throughout the world, and it's time to stop them,'' Mirren said. 
``My role here is as a conduit for people to be able to tell their 
stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirren has spent the past week visiting violence-torn  
communities in South Africa. She said she planned to lobby the 
British government to tighten laws on arms trades.

<HEADLINE> Wu-Tang Clan Rapper Posts Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ODB, a performer with the rap group Wu-Tang  
Clan, has posted $150,000 bail after spending a week in jail for 
allegedly firing a gun during an encounter with undercover police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old, whose real name is Russell Jones, is charged  
with attempted murder in the first degree, attempted murder in the 
second degree and criminal weapons possession. The principal charge 
carries a maximum penalty of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Jones fired at undercover officers after they stopped  
his sport utility vehicle for a routine traffic violation Jan. 15 
in Brooklyn. The officers fired four or five shots back, but no one 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a founding member of Wu-Tang Clan, has had several  
run-ins with the law, including four arrests in the past year for 
such offenses as menacing security officers, alleged shoplifting 
and threatening a former girlfriend.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Renew Tax Cut Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are making a 10 percent  
across-the-board income tax cut their top priority in Congress, 
Sen. Rod Grams said today in the GOP radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams, R-Minn., said Republicans found President Clinton's State  
of the Union lacking because it made no mention of broad tax relief 
despite new projections for a budget surplus reaching $4.4 trillion 
over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come the average taxpayer won't get even a penny of it  
back under the president's plan?'' Grams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has outlined a series of tax credits targeted at  
stay-at-home parents, disabled workers, curbing urban sprawl and 
other social needs. But Grams said those proposals ``try to dictate 
social conduct, rewarding only a few, with too few dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The across-the-board tax cut is simple,'' he said. ``You don't  
have to be a tax lawyer or an accountant to understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the reduction would boost economic growth  
by helping workers become more productive and would be fair because 
all income groups would be treated equally. The cut would take 
effect with earnings that began Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``You generated that surplus,'' Grams told listeners.  
``Washington shouldn't stand first in line to get your money.''

<HEADLINE> Whale Carcass Washes Ashore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Beachgoers in this chic Southern California  
town have a fragrant reminder of the flip-side of the ocean's 
natural beauty: a 40-foot whale carcass rotting on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The stench from the decomposing gray whale has had locals and  
tourists plugging their noses for more than a week, even on cliffs 
overlooking the cove where the whale washed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can smell a hint of it when the wind shifts just right,''  
said Tom Gattegno, one of about 100 people gathered at La Jolla 
Hermosa Park above the beach to gawk at the dead whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts have failed to move the 25- to 30-ton whale off the  
beach at Devil's Cove in La Jolla, a tony seaside village about 
seven miles north of downtown San Diego. A lifeguard boat trying to 
haul it back to sea couldn't budge it. When the Coast Guard tried 
with a bigger boat, the tow rope broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that option isn't even possible anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Late last week, vandals hacked off the whale's tail -- the only  
place to attach a tow rope -- and spray-painted graffiti on the 
whale's body. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a bizarre act,'' said Lifeguard Chief B. Chris Brewster.  
``What could possibly motivate someone to cut off the whale's tail 
and leave it there, other than to thwart our efforts to remove 
it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed idea of airlifting the carcass away with a helicopter  
was nixed as too dangerous. Brewster is now considering someone's 
offer to cut the whale up and haul the pieces away for $5,000.

<HEADLINE> Contestants Mix Scrabble, Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Like any Scrabble player worth his  
tiles, Elliott Schiff knows plenty of two-letter words. It was what 
he did with them that had jaws dropping at the fourth annual 
Scrabble Talent Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiff, 27, a supermarket cashier from Allentown, Pa., sang  
``The Star Spangled Banner'' using only two-letter words sanctioned 
for use in the word game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aa ab ad ae ag, ah ai al al an ar,'' he sang, perfectly  
matching the cadence of ``Oh, say can you see/by the dawn's early 
light.'' Ninety-six words later, he was done. 
</P>
<P>
	So it went Friday at the Atlantic City Scrabble Tournament, as  
players at the three-day event took a break from their timers, tile 
bags and vowel movements for a bizarre annual tradition: a midnight 
talent show featuring Scrabble-themed jokes and song parodies 
(``Stuck At The End With The Q''). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not your average talent show. If you're not a Scrabble  
player, you won't get some of the jokes,'' said Bruce Adams, 41, a 
postal worker from Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of quiet, concentrated playing, the tournament  
participants noshed on hors d'oeuvres and drank champagne before 
jamming into a Holiday Inn meeting room for the talent show. 
</P>
<P>
	First up: Shel Silverstein, 60, of Brooklyn, N.Y., a retired  
accounts payable clerk who brought down the house with imitations 
of Alfred Hitchcock, Marlon Brando and Rodney Dangerfield. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hitchcock, he put on a thick British accent and stuck his  
belly out, solemnly mimicking the way the director introduced 
segments in the ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' television show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight's story is entitled `The Disgruntled Scrabble Player.'  
You see, our friend played `quidnunc' on a triple letter, triple 
word score and got 244 points. His opponent, a highly rated sore 
loser but not a highly rated player, plunged a knife into his 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams put new lyrics to the song ``Cabaret'':  
</P>
<P>
	``Stick your hand out and say `Good luck'/It wouldn't kill you  
to smile, you schmuck/Come to the Scrabble-ray, old chum/There's no 
need to cry `Oy vey,' old chum. Just come to the Scrabble-ray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Diane Furstman, 35, of Brooklyn, N.Y., budget  
director for the New York City Department of Corrections, a former 
talent show winner who did her first-ever stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Want to improve your Scrabble average? Get a new lover, she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fair to middling players, they meet someone and it's like  
Scrabble Viagra. Va-voom!'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another contestant told one about the Pope getting to Heaven and  
being disappointed with his spartan accommodations. He sees a 
Scrabble player's posh room nearby and complains to St. Peter. The 
reply: ``We've got 60 popes up here. We've only got one Scrabble 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was Sal Piro, 48, of New York, an actor whose day job  
is president of the International Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in pancake makeup, badly applied red lipstick, a pink  
fright wig and leopard-skin pajamas, he portrayed a bag lady sent 
off the deep end by too many Scrabble losses.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates How To Debate </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, often called the world's greatest  
deliberative body, may not get a chance to debate whether to 
dismiss or call witnesses to President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., initially indicated  
Saturday he believes those are procedural questions and don't need 
Senate debate before up-or-down votes, but later said there were 
``many options'' under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of no debate brought howls of protest Saturday from  
Democrats, including Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
``To say to senators, 'We're going to deny you the right to speak 
about the motion to dismiss,' is mind-boggling,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another question is whether any debate would be open to the  
public. Senate rules now say that all impeachment debate is closed, 
but several Democrats are pushing for a two-thirds vote to change 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that affects every citizen in this  
country,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how much support that effort has, but a bipartisan  
group led by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, will seek a vote 
to open final deliberations on the two articles of impeachment -- if 
the proceedings get that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he was reluctant to open final deliberations, when the  
Senate will be in the mode of a jury. Otherwise, he said, ``I hope 
we can find a way to go forward with votes and the discussion that 
does take place to be open.'' 
</P>

	After expressing misgivings a day earlier, Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist overruled Senate Parliamentarian Robert Dove's 
interpretation of the rules on whether the 13 House managers can 
object to questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dove had advised Rehnquist on Friday that the managers could  
object only to an answer, which the chief justice commented was 
``kind of an unusual thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue came up again Saturday, Rehnquist decided it made  
no sense at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., stood to object when a question was  
posed about something he said on ABC's ``This Week'' program about 
the perjury and obstruction of justice allegations against 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators objected to Hutchinson's objection, and  
Rehnquist said he had ``second thoughts'' about the 
parliamentarian's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice, noting that the rule came from President  
Andrew Johnson's 1868 impeachment trial, said the correct position 
is that the managers have no right to object to anything. 
</P>
<P>
                           	 *--------

	Several well-known spectators were spotted Saturday at President  
Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	One was Ann Richards, the former Democratic governor of Texas,  
who is perhaps best known for her 1988 Democratic National 
Convention speech in which she said President George Bush was out 
of touch because ``he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' 
She's also done television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Another was Eunice Kennedy Shriver, whose brother, Sen. Edward  
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is among those deciding Clinton's fate in the 
Senate. Mrs. Shriver is founder of the Special Olympics and wife of 
Democratic 1972 vice-presidential candidate and former Peace Corps 
director Sargent Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
	Also there was Tim Mathison, who played the caddish Otter in  
``Animal House,'' as a guest of Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland spokesman Robert Gibbs said Mathison has been visiting  
the senator for three days. The two are friends who met through a 
mutual buddy, actor Tom Berenger, Gibbs said.
