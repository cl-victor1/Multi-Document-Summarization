   The punk on the phone is laughing as he tells me he's only 17

<P>
   ``What's funny, man, is that on one page of the paper they got
your whiny (expletive) &UR; anti-gun column and a few pages back there's
classifieds where I can get anything I need,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one a few weeks ago. Called up a dude and went to his
house and paid my money. He didn't ask me how old I was and I
didn't say and everything was cool. So, &UR; you're one of those guys
who talks but then, you know, makes money off guys like me. That
makes you . . . what?''
</P>
<P>
   A hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, hanging up just as I was about to tell him he
was a foul-mouthed sonnyboy with no understanding of free
enterprise, no knowledge of journalism, no manners, and only one
little thing going for him:
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The same day Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were massacring
classmates at a Littleton, Colo., high school, weapons ranging from
9mm pistols to antique Lugers to Winchester rifles were available
for purchase _ without restriction _ through the Republic's
classifieds.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every day.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be Rambos can buy firearms through the East Valley's
Tribune, through Tucson's Arizona Daily Star, through just about
every newspaper or classified publication in the state. &UR; Not to
mention Web sites, gun magazines and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, anonymous and hair-trigger quick.
</P>
<P>
   There's no background check required in person-to-person sales,
as there is for someone walking into a gun shop. It's a deal with
no questions asked, except maybe, ``Cash or check?''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona law defining who can buy a weapon and who can't
includes a passage reading, ``This section does not apply to
private firearm sales or transfers which are not subject to any
federal law or any other law of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, any Tom, Dick or Harry can sell a weapon to any
Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   (Technically, it's against the law to sell weapons to minors
without the written consent of a parent or legal guardian. But as
the smart-mouth on the phone told me, if nobody asks . . .)
</P>
<P>
   This loophole was brought to you by the Arizona Legislature, the
same caring, thoughtful people who _ on the day of the Littleton
killings _ passed a law that would have prohibited Arizona cities
from enacting gun control ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull vetoed it. For now.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, newspapers throughout the state happily take the money
of small-time gunrunners, then squawk on their editorial pages
about the proliferation of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Republic advertising director David Alley told me, ``What we try
to do is to allow the law to be our guide. Our motive there is that
it's a lot cleaner. If it's legal, then we'll do it. If it isn't,
we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other publications in Arizona seem to agree, happily
serving as a middleman in the gun business at a time when kids are
killing kids and two local cops have been shot down in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers turn down ads for cigarettes, topless bars and other
things they find objectionable. Why not guns? At least when it
comes to personal sales.
</P>
<P>
   Pawnshops and retailers are different. At least they need to do
background checks. It's not much. But it's something.
</P>
<P>
   After a bloodbath like the one in Colorado, newspaper writers
want to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   We point the finger at TV and movies and video games. We blame a
lack of parental supervision and the absence of school discipline.
We try to pin it on music videos or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the punk on the phone was right. Until we take a
long hard look at our own industry's participation in the gun
trade, we've got no business shooting off our mouths. &QL;

PERMISSIVE U.S. CULTURE MAKES KILLING TOO EASY 
</HEADLINE>
 SHOOT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The sleep of reason produces monsters,'' observed the Spanish
painter Francisco de Goya.
</P>
<P>
   The monsters who slaughtered more than a dozen classmates and
teachers in Littleton, Colo., were the products of a culture in
which reason has been comatose for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   The killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, were raised in a
society in which rules and standards are in such constant flux as
to be non-existent. Morals are a matter of spin, values a matter of
choice, and violence is glorified in movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we read things such as this in a news story: ``Authorities
may never know what sent two young men on a shooting spree at
Columbine High School.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe authorities will never know. But you do.
</P>
<P>
   You know that guns did not send them in. The killings brought an
immediate cry for the banning of handguns in the United States. Yet
Klebold and Harris used sawed-off shotguns and pipe bombs _ weapons
that have long been illegal to possess. How the teenagers got the
guns is a pressing question, but simply calling for more weapon
bans will not stop slaughters inflicted with banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
   You know they were not sent in by virtue of feeling
``different.'' The ``different'' charge was trotted out a lot in
the hours after the tragic news hit. Klebold and Harris were part
of a ``shady group,'' shunned by other students and even taunted by
them. It's tempting to let this stand as adequate. How to explain,
however, a widely published yearbook picture of the ``Trench Coat
Mafia'' in which the killers are not among the 13 youths pictured?
Why didn't those 13 other ``different'' kids participate in the
killings?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the killers had a gun obsession, and certainly they
were different. But others love guns to distraction, find
themselves outside the loop of class popularity and do nothing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Just what sent these two into the creation of a hell on Earth?
</P>
<P>
   A culture that underwrote their hatred as just another lifestyle
choice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, reportedly a favorite of
t1R-Z6lers, helped send them in, even if only indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate every (expletive) that's in your way,'' goes one of
Manson's typical lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, shoot, shoot, (expletive),'' goes another.
</P>
<P>
   So, Klebold and Harris shot, hating with racist venom the usual
victims of American hatred but generously including jocks as well,
plus anyone ``in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, of course, the killers sent themselves in. They, and
not countless other people who listen to shock rock and other forms
of violent music, decided to murder. If moral action is going to
have any meaning at all, people _ even teenagers _ must take
responsibility for their own actions, despite their families, their
upbringing, their financial status, their culture, their
government.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it's not precisely that easy. Klebold and Harris chose
evil, but the culture was at their ears whispering, ``Why not?''
The young killers' feelings of envy and hatred were validated by a
culture that allowed quasi-artistic expression of those feelings. A
different moral and aesthetic environment, a different voice at
their ears _ one of conscience and personal responsibility perhaps
_ and 15 people might be alive who are today dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's a curious society that holds cigarette manufacturers
responsible for the deaths of people who choose to smoke but smiles
at images of violence and at incompetently written songs that urge
hatred and shooting because, after all, that's ``art.'' (But,
``is'' it? I can find you plenty of qualified people who will tell
you it ain't. And if it's art simply because the artist says so,
why isn't everything art if so called _ including cigarettes? I
digress, although not much.)
</P>
<P>
   What's missing here is Goya's Reason. We think of reason only as
``being reasonable,'' or equate it with logic. But Reason was
something much bigger, more needful. It was the obvious and natural
link between feeling and act, between value and fact.
</P>
<P>
   Reason was _ and still is, where it persists _ the capacity to
see connections and distinctions. It doesn't put material things
such as guns in one corner and feelings and art in another. It sees
them as interconnected, interdependent. And it knows what you know:
that as a society believes, so will it act. It is not surprised by
mass murders in a culture that glorifies and ``artistically''
encourages mass murder, any more than you are.
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be more obvious? Yet pragmatic Americans will
continue to pooh-pooh notions of cultural culpability. And that's
too bad for the parents who have packed the last lunch, bought the
last pair of jeans, forgot to say ``I love you'' for the last
time. &QL;

SHERIFF (Phoenix, Ariz.) _ It was a sculpture when it was outside
the artist's home. But when the metal spider was plopped outside
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's front door Saturday, it turned
into a possible bomb and needed to be blown apart. ``It's not a
bomb, but it's still a threat, and I'm getting tired of these
threats,'' an angry Arpaio said. By RICHARD RUELAS. Story will move

LITTLETON (Littleton, Colo.) _ Rusty Schlyer cannot sleep. Every
time he closes his eyes, the image comes back. He is alone in the
main hall of Columbine High School. In slow motion, a boy wearing a
black trench coat and a black mask rounds a corner. He has a rifle
on his hip. Then the rifle coughs. ``That's when I always wake

still shellshocked town of 50,000, and folks sighed with some
relief. They had survived the first anniversary of what had been
the nation's deadliest school massacre. Then the Littleton, Colo.,
shootings came last week and set back the fragile healing, sending
shock waves through this pretty little section of northeast
Arkansas. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

ELWAY NEVER MISPLACED LOVE FOR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They say bad news comes in threes. So there was no
surprise, just sadness, when the word leaked out that John Elway
plans to follow Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   We have been bracing ourselves for Elway's farewell since the
blustery January day when the former Granada Hills High product
broke into a victory lap after guiding the Denver Broncos to a
second straight Super Bowl, his sentimental jog around Mile High
Stadium revealing his hand, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to go out; with 173 passing yards in a 23-10 win over
the New York Jets in the AFC Championship game before a home crowd
that loved him to tears and with an MVP performance two weeks later
in a 34-19 victory over Atlanta in Super Bowl XXXIII at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elway leaves with 51,475 passing yards and 300 touchdowns. Los
Angeles may field a Super Bowl champion of its own _ as opposed to
simply helping to school the MVP of one _ before anyone approaches
Elway's tally of forty-something fourth-quarter comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a clutch performer is intact and so, to the
end, was his zeal for his sport. Like Jordan and Gretzky, it was
the process Elway loved and not just the prizes. To the very end,
he'd sooner lose a game than miss a practice. He was one superstar
who never misplaced his helmet, his shoes and socks, his priorities
or his passion.
</P>
<P>
   There's a story we never tire of re-telling of Elway, his body
sore and battered, walking stiffly out of the locker room at Mile
High Stadium after a win over Seattle. Heading toward the exit, he
spotted 15 kids playing a game of toss on the darkened field and
spontaneously joined them.
</P>
<P>
   He ached to play, though certainly not for all the attention it
brought him. It was the game Elway loved, not the accompanying
fame, though once resigned to the latter he handled himself with
untold grace.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of quarterbacks entering the NFL as Elway
leaves it. Like hockey's No. 99 leaving in `99, there's a certain
symmetry to Elway's departure; the best of the 1983 quarterback
crop (he was the winningest member of a class that included Dan
Marino and Jim Kelly) going as the most heralded class of
quarterbacks since then arrives. Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb, Akili
Smith, Cade McNown and Daunte Culpepper have their collective work
cut out for them if they are to clear the bar that Elway and Co.
raised to a ridiculous height, really.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just Elway's numbers that will be hard to surpass.
The way he carried himself off the field was just as exceptional.
As far as football took him, Elway managed never to lose sight of
his roots. He remained grounded even as his celebrity took off.
</P>
<P>
   He donated his time and money to Granada Hills High, kept up the
friendships he forged in high school and remained ever-mindful of
all the people who had helped him along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky and Jordan were much the same way. Indeed, in the slot
machine of professional sports, Elway, Gretzky and Jordan were
three cherries in a row. They were that all-too-rare combination of
talent and unpretentiousness, their larger-than-life image on the
athletic field giving way to an almost bashfulness off it.
</P>
<P>
   They wore their celebrity with a certain dignity that seems
sadly missing among so many of today's rising sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   Elway caused a furor in 1983 when he signed a rookie contract
that made him the highest-paid player in the league, at $1million
per year. It was years before the good fans of Denver deigned to
admit that maybe he damn well deserved it. Tim Couch, this year's
No.1 draft pick, wrangled a $12.2million signing bonus and all of
Cleveland rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   The money to be made in professional sports is so mind-boggling
nowadays, it has turned mere mortals into demigods and their
support systems into disciples who mainly worship the almighty
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the adoration of star athletes takes root early. It goes
well beyond all the column inches devoted to their exploits in the
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most disturbing things we read in the aftermath of
last week's Columbine High shooting tragedy in Littleton, a suburb
of the city that Elway largely built, was the pronouncement of one
former member of the `Trenchcoat Mafia' _ the same clique to which
the two alleged shooters belonged _ that the athletes at the
school, a sports powerhouse, openly defied authority.
</P>
<P>
   If athletes were targeted as victims, well, frankly, some
students weren't surprised. That athletes commanded special
treatment was driven home to some of their nonplaying peers last
year when five athletes at the school reportedly were arrested on
felony burglary charges that were later reduced, in all but one of
the cases, to misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were outraged,'' the student was quoted as saying.
``It comes down to the same belief at a lot of schools: The jocks
could get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, it wouldn't be the only example of a high school jock
culture gone horribly astray, just the latest. Not long ago author
Bernard Lefkowitz painted a chilling picture of perverse
entitlement in ``Our Guys, The Glen Ridge Rape and the Secret Life
of the Perfect Suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so far removed from the days we fondly remember,
when standout athletes were a source of pride in their community,
not fear. They were the self-starters and the overachievers and the
ones most likely to help carry our groceries outside to our car.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in the San Fernando Valley has a disparaging word to
say about Elway, we haven't heard it. For three glorious years in
the 1970s and for 16 years in the pros, he embodied a bedroom
community's dreams and ideals. He was our fair-haired boy, our
adopted son and he remained one of us through rich, richer and
richest.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere there's a kid with a cannon for an arm who says he
wants to be just like John Elway when he grows up. All we can hope
is that he means that in every way.

SPIDER SCULPTURE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS THREAT TO SHERIFF

   It was a sculpture when it was outside the artist's home. But
when the metal spider was plopped outside Maricopa County Sheriff
Joe Arpaio's front door Saturday, it turned into a possible bomb
and needed to be blown apart.
</P>

   The iron insect went out with a loud kaboom around 10:30 a.m.
Saturday after being pummeled with water. The Sheriff's Office bomb
squad said the spider sculpture was hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he saw the spider, bomb or no bomb, as a direct
threat on his life.

   ``It's not a bomb, but it's still a threat, and I'm getting
tired of these threats,'' an angry Arpaio said outside his
northeast Phoenix home, where the metal spider lay in pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he'd add to the team of investigators looking into
death threats he's received.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the threat might be linked to a Web site whose
operators claim to sympathize with the shooters in the Littleton,
Colo., massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site listed Arpaio as a hero _ and Arpaio fired off a
nasty e-mail ordering his name off the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiders live in webs, don't they?'' Arpaio said, linking the
two events. ``I knew when I sent that e-mail that I would get some
sort of retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives tracked down the man who made the spider, Thomas
Hall, 37, who said the sculpture was stolen from his front lawn
Saturday, probably by a man with whom he was feuding over a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he gave the man's name to deputies, but the deputies
hadn't talked with him by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who lives in the 3300 block of East Saint John Road, said
his friend probably wasn't trying to make any kind of statement
against Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was just trying to create a hassle for me,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Office said it couldn't take any chances and
needed to make sure the insect artwork wasn't set to explode.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The ordeal began around 7 a.m. when Arpaio's wife, Ava, peeked
out the window before getting ``The Republic'' and saw the
2-foot-long insect on the sidewalk, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came in and told me, `There's a bomb outside,' '' Arpaio
said. ``I looked out . . . and that looked very menacing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Office SWAT team hustled the Arpaios out the back
door and Phoenix police started evacuating neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the spider, with a black metal body, brown metal legs
and grilles for eyes, sat staring into the Arpaio home.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb robot, sent over by the Department of Public Safety,
scooted up to the sculpture and shot a projectile into it, causing
a loud bang.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in a scene out of a science-fiction movie,
a bomb squad officer dressed head-to-toe in a protective suit knelt
down and peered into the spider's innards with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat it like it's going to get us,'' said Deputy Phil
Harris, who went nose-to-nose with the metal spider.
</P>
<P>
   The remote-controlled robot tipped the spider over on its back,
setting it rocking on the asphalt. It then used a water cannon to
shoot off its hind end.
</P>
<P>
   Other bomb squad officers poked around the remains and found
nothing dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a prank,'' Chief Deputy Sheriff Dave Hendershott
said, ``it was a damn expensive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deputies about five miles away combed around the spot
where the spider was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a machinist whose yard is decorated with the iron artwork
he started making five years ago, said the spider theft comes in
the middle of an ugly domestic dispute. He said this as he loaded
his possessions into a pickup truck, leaving behind his
``soon-to-be-ex old lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall described the man he thinks placed the spider in front of
Arpaio's house as a ``drinking buddy I'm not seeing eye-to-eye with
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the man didn't have any particular beef with Arpaio.
But he didn't like the spider too much.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies took Hall to the scene where he could see his destroyed
creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was cool, because the legs were all up in the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he told the Sheriff's Office he wants the remains of
his spider back. He said he hopes the water cannon made a good-size
artistic hole in the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my art would get me in the paper someday,'' he said. &QL;

ELWAY NEVER MISPLACED LOVE FOR GAME

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They say bad news comes in threes. So there was no
surprise, just sadness, when the word leaked out that John Elway
plans to follow Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   We have been bracing ourselves for Elway's farewell since the
blustery January day when L.A.'s former Granada Hills High product
broke into a victory lap after guiding the Denver Broncos to a
second straight Super Bowl, his sentimental jog around Mile High
Stadium revealing his hand, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to go out; with 173 passing yards in a 23-10 win over
the New York Jets in the AFC Championship game before a home crowd
that loved him to tears and with an MVP performance two weeks later
in a 34-19 victory over Atlanta in Super Bowl XXXIII at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elway leaves with 51,475 passing yards and 300 touchdowns. Los
Angeles may field a Super Bowl champion of its own _ as opposed to
simply helping to school the MVP of one _ before anyone approaches
Elway's tally of forty-something fourth-quarter comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a clutch performer is intact and so, to the
end, was his zeal for his sport. Like Jordan and Gretzky, it was
the process Elway loved and not just the prizes. To the very end,
he'd sooner lose a game than miss a practice. He was one superstar
who never misplaced his helmet, his shoes and socks, his priorities
or his passion.
</P>
<P>
   There's a story we never tire of re-telling of Elway, his body
sore and battered, walking stiffly out of the locker room at Mile
High Stadium after a win over Seattle. Heading toward the exit, he
spotted 15 kids playing a game of toss on the darkened field and
spontaneously joined them.
</P>
<P>
   He ached to play, though certainly not for all the attention it
brought him. It was the game Elway loved, not the accompanying
fame, though once resigned to the latter he handled himself with
untold grace.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of quarterbacks entering the NFL as Elway
leaves it. Like hockey's No.99 leaving in `99, there's a certain
symmetry to Elway's departure; the best of the 1983 quarterback
crop (he was the winningest member of a class that included Dan
Marino and Jim Kelly) going as the most heralded class of
quarterbacks since then arrives. Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb, Akili
Smith, Cade McNown and Daunte Culpepper have their collective work
cut out for them if they are to clear the bar that Elway and Co.
raised to a ridiculous height, really.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just Elway's numbers that will be hard to surpass.
The way he carried himself off the field was just as exceptional.
As far as football took him, Elway managed never to lose sight of
his roots. He remained grounded even as his celebrity took off.
</P>
<P>
   He donated his time and money to Granada Hills High, kept up the
friendships he forged in high school and remained ever-mindful of
all the people who had helped him along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky and Jordan were much the same way. Indeed, in the slot
machine of professional sports, Elway, Gretzky and Jordan were
three cherries in a row. They were that all-too-rare combination of
talent and unpretentiousness, their larger-than-life image on the
athletic field giving way to an almost bashfulness off it.
</P>
<P>
   They wore their celebrity with a certain dignity that seems
sadly missing among so many of today's rising sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   Elway caused a furor in 1983 when he signed a rookie contract
that made him the highest-paid player in the league, at $1 million
per year. It was years before the good fans of Denver deigned to
admit that maybe he damn well deserved it. Tim Couch, this year's
No. 1 draft pick, wrangled a $12.2million signing bonus and all of
Cleveland rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   The money to be made in professional sports is so mind-boggling
nowadays, it has turned mere mortals into demigods and their
support systems into disciples who mainly worship the almighty
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the adoration of star athletes takes root early. It goes
well beyond all the column inches devoted to their exploits in the
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most disturbing things we read in the aftermath of
last week's Columbine High shooting tragedy in Littleton, a suburb
of the city that Elway largely built, was the pronouncement of one
former member of the `Trenchcoat Mafia' _ the same clique to which
the two alleged shooters belonged _ that the athletes at the
school, a sports powerhouse, openly defied authority.
</P>
<P>
   If athletes were targeted as victims, well, frankly, some
students weren't surprised. That athletes commanded special
treatment was driven home to some of their nonplaying peers last
year when five athletes at the school reportedly were arrested on
felony burglary charges that were later reduced, in all but one of
the cases, to misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were outraged,'' the student was quoted as saying.
``It comes down to the same belief at a lot of schools: The jocks
could get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, it wouldn't be the only example of a high school jock
culture gone horribly astray, just the latest. Not long ago author
Bernard Lefkowitz painted a chilling picture of perverse
entitlement in ``Our Guys, The Glen Ridge Rape and the Secret Life
of the Perfect Suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so far removed from the days we fondly remember,
when standout athletes were a source of pride in their community,
not fear. They were the self-starters and the overachievers and the
ones most likely to help carry our groceries outside to our car.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley has a disparaging word
to say about Elway, we haven't heard it. For three glorious years
in the 1970s and for 16 years in the pros, he embodied a bedroom
community's dreams and ideals. He was our fair-haired boy, our
adopted son and he remained one of us through rich, richer and
richest.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere there's a kid with a cannon for an arm who says he
wants to be just like John Elway when he grows up. All we can hope
is that he means that in every way.

JOHNSON TO TEAM: DON'T TRY TOO HARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson called a
team meeting prior to Saturday's game against St. Louis to tell the
players to relax and not try to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The Dodgers entered the game against the Cardinals
hitting .190 with runners in scoring position. The Dodgers lost
three of their first four games on the six-game homestand and were
9 of 43 (.209) with eight RBI with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle isn't getting a hit, it's getting a good pitch,''
Dodgers hitting coach Rick Down said. ``You can't get yourself out.
You have to be patient and swing at a pitch you can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson: ``The pitchers are trying to be too fine, the
hitters are trying to shoulder too much of the burden. I'm learning
about the makeup of the team, but everyone in the lineup wants to
do it. Sometimes you can put too much on yourself. Then, it's not
much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna update: Right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna arrived at
Dodger Stadium and said he was experiencing no pain in his elbow.
He'll start a rehab assignment today at Single-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers aren't all that happy about Osuna's decision to put
off surgery to remove a bone spur in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would have been my choice, in my opinion, I would have
it done and he'd be back in six to eight weeks,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``All we can do is recommend what to do.
I wish he would have told us before he changed his mind (about
having surgery). If he does (wind up needing surgery) we probably
backed (his return) up two weeks, but you have to give the player
the option.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Osuna returns (he's eligible May 3) you can bet the
Dodgers will make sure he's thrown and thrown and thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to increase the work load for him and see how he
holds up,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Souvenir trade: Michael Lerner of Simi Valley, who caught the
second grand-slam home run ball by St. Louis' Fernando Tatis in the
third inning Friday, met the third baseman after the game and
traded the ball for a signed game-worn jersey.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lerner, Dodger Stadium officials ushered him out of
the left-field pavilion as fans mobbed him with monetary offers. He
was escorted to meet Tatis, telling the Cardinals slugger he
``wanted the ball to go to the Hall of Fame where it belongs,''
Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis took off his No.23 jersey and gave it to Lerner, who said
it would be on display at Lenny Dykstra's Car Wash in Simi Valley
beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner almost didn't make it to the game. He discovered he
accidentally brought tickets for Sunday's game and considered
driving home, but didn't want to deal with the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running around the parking lot and this guy sold me
these tickets,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the jersey,Tatis autographed a half-dozen
baseballs for Lerner and his three children. In the end, the balls
may be his only memento from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next stop after the car wash will be Cooperstown,'' Lerner
said. ``I will gladly give it up if they ever call me and want to
put it in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Free agent right-hander Mike Maddux was
at Dodger Stadium for the second day in a row and is hopeful the
Dodgers will offer him a contract. ``I get a good feeling. If I
didn't have a good feeling, I have two kids at home who enjoyed
having daddy around last week,'' said Maddux, a former Dodger who
was released by Montreal 11 days ago.... For the sixth straight
game in which a left-hander started against the Dodgers, Paul
LoDuca started behind the plate. The switch-hitting Todd Hundley
hasn't started against a lefty-hander since facing Randy Johnson
opening day.... Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek was in the starting
lineup for the first time in four games.

TIME MAY NOT HEAL ALL WOUNDS IN LITTLETON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Rusty Schlyer cannot sleep. Every time he
closes his eyes, the image comes back.
</P>
<P>
   He is alone in the main hall of Columbine High School. In slow
motion, a boy wearing a black trench coat and a black mask rounds a
corner. He has a rifle on his hip. He looks at Schlyer. ``Through''
him.
</P>
<P>
   Then the rifle coughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I always wake up,'' said Schlyer, 16, who dodged
the shots by leaping behind a pillar. ``I've had about one solid
hour of sleep in the last three days.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been less than a week since two heavily armed students
burst into the school with guns and bombs, killing 13 and wounding
23 before they took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors, the healing could take a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrow and grief are pouring in from all over the world, from
President Clinton to the pope. Money is being raised, blood donated
for the wounded. Armies of counselors have descended.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly it will take the power of time to soothe the
wrenching pain. The tragedy has ripped ragged holes in people's
everyday lives. There are also smaller tears, little things that
mean a lot.
</P>
<P>
   For one family, it's a guitar that may never be played again.
For another, it's the red Acura with the dented door, which must be
driven home from the parking lot by someone else, since the young
girl who owned it is among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The school play has no star, the girls' basketball team no
coach, the volleyball team no captain. The football team has lost
No. 80, whose jersey was placed among the flowers and notes that
littered the ground near the scene of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never be 100 percent,'' said Jerry Parmer, a local
crisis counselor. ``There is a certain element in Dallas that has
not recovered from the Kennedy assassination. Littleton is always
going to be the city where they killed 15 people in a school.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be reminded at anniversary time. Or by another school
shooting in some other innocent town.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton is an Anywhere, USA, in the shadow of the Rocky
Mountains, dominated by bike trails, housing tracts, strip malls
and office parks.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen's dark trappings _ swastikas, the ``Goth'' scene and
electronic blood sports _ seem out of place in the affluent
community nestled against rolling foothills and built on old
farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to take some time to sink in for a lot of
people,'' said Doug Holden, a local attorney and spokesman for
Foothills Bible Church. ``It's hard to believe that something like
this can happen here in this community. This is something that will
never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say one way to start the healing process is to bulldoze the
school and start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to knock down the school,'' Schlyer said. ``If
they don't . . . I can't go back in there. I want them to knock
down the school and build a memorial right on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, 16-year-old Ben Oakley, wants exactly the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back as soon as possible,'' he said. ``I want
them to clean up all the blood, but I want to see the damage. I
want to see the holes in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It's something I really want to face. It's
something I really need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of the shooting are everywhere. Blue and silver
ribbons _ the colors of Columbine High. Black umbrellas. Closed
schools. Canceled sporting events. A crush of TV satellite trucks
and other media at a corner near the school.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more sinister reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley said he was in nearby Southwest Village mall Wednesday
night when a teen in a black trench coat looked at him _ and
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wearing my soccer shirt, he knew I was in sports,'' he
said. ``I just couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The school assailants, known as the ``Trench Coat Mafia'' for
the black trench coats worn by them and their friends, targeted
athletes especially. Oakley is on the Columbine varsity soccer
team.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with his grief, Oakley has clung to his friends. He's
only been home long enough to tell his parents he's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Parents) don't know what we feel,'' he said. ``They didn't go
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hohn, a 17-year-old student, said she was doing fine, but
her calm ``pops in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   She saw a picture of a slain friend on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something I did not need to see,'' Hohn said. ``I
just totally broke down and started crying. He had a chance, and
they took that chance away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hohn said they should gut the school, replace the carpeting, the
lockers, everything. She believes the library, where much of
carnage occurred, should be razed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any kid is going to be able to set foot in
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Kenny Castro, looked almost dazed as he
discussed the death of his best friend, Matt Kechter, a football
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder,'' Castro said. ``He wasn't doing anything
to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he's angry at the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, and part of him wants revenge. But he would never carry it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do that, it would mean that they would have won,''
Castro said, adding that the shooting will bring the school, and
its sports teams, together as they never thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep saying it,'' he said, wearily repeating the
school's sports chant. ``We are Columbine. We are Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   As a late spring snowstorm blanketed Littleton, students and
parents braved the weather to return to the site of the massacre,
to lay flowers, teddy bears and posters on growing makeshift
memorials to 12 dead students and one dead teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Tents were erected to protect the memorials from the steadily
falling snow. ``In The Arms of Angels,'' one sign read. Nearby were
13 small crosses, 9 blue and 4 pink, representing the nine males
and four females killed.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Oliver and her church members made blue and silver
ribbons and a 20-foot poster signed by the congregation. When they
brought the poster to the site, it was snowing, so they needed a
plastic cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Kinko's, and it should have cost $40,'' she said.
``They wouldn't let us pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrimage has deeper meaning to counselors, who say it's a
healthy part of grieving. People must band together, talk about the
tragedy, and work their way through it.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the site means ``that it happened,'' Parmer said. ``It
is not a bad dream. It is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like a person, a community goes through the stages of
grief: denial, acceptance, anger and resolution. In the days after
the shooting, many are just in denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to believe that things like this can happen,''
he said. ``This is outside our reality. Most kids live in worlds of
their own, and that world has been shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people ask counselors the same thing: ``Why did it happen
here? Why did it happen anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing they can do, Parmer says, is to talk about what
happened. And stick together.
</P>
<P>
   While district officials repair the school, plans are for the
Columbine students to return to school Thursday at nearby Chatfield
High School, which will house Chatfield students in the morning and
Columbine students in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County School District officials said they have no
intention of tearing down the school, though it might take some
time to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with eight or nine hundred of the students last night,
and they said, `Do not let them take Columbine from us,' ''
Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis goes beyond the students and their parents. The whole
community is recoiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are very upset about it,'' said Rochelle
Brunsdon, a Jefferson Center for Mental Health counselor. ``The
first thing we want to do is normalize these feelings. To tell
them, in general, strong feelings are a normal response to strong
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the first task of counselors is to help people regain
control of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question to ask is `What do I need to do myself
right now? What will make me feel better?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That helps in the short term, Brunsdon said, but only the
passing of the seasons will help in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be changes forever. How can a place that lived in a
sense of safety and security . . . ever regain that sense of
permanent security?''
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hohn has an idea. It starts with students going back to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us go in and put new memories in there,'' she said, ``and
cover up the bad ones.'' &QL;

USC BEATS PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Trevor Julian likes Provo, Utah. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to do there,'' the Harvard-Westlake High
graduate and USC volleyball player said seriously. ``We can go see
the Mormon Tabernacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The best reason to love Provo is because that's where the
Trojans are heading after beating George Roumain-less Pepperdine
15-7, 11-15, 15-9, 15-6 Saturday in a Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation first-round playoff match at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The MPSF tournament continues Thursday at the site of the
highest remaining seed, which is Brigham Young University.
</P>
<P>
   Roumain, the reigning national Player of the Year, sprained his
ankle in practice last week and watched as the Waves beat Loyola
Marymount to secure a home playoff match.
</P>
<P>
   But Roumain, sitting on the bench, was unable to cheer the Waves
back this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely a different team,'' Julian said. ``They
don't have their go-to guy. They need that big go-to guy. Our game
plan was to let Roumain get his kills and shut down the other
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference was evident. With Roumain, Pepperdine swept USC
in three games March 2. Without Roumain, the Waves were outhit by
USC 88-67.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (16-10) have plenty about which to celebrate. Brook
Billings led everyone with 36 kills and then received a large
wrapped box afterward that was his birthday gift.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, USC coach Pat Powers was gushing about Billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a saddle on Brook and rode him,'' Powers said. ``He's
got saddle sores.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian and Eli Fairfield got 14 kills apiece, and they ran
around hugging everyone in sight. Not a good idea, Fairfield said
afterward, because he and Julian have head colds and sore throats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You forget about it once you're out there,'' Fairfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they get another chance to play healthy. The Trojans,
who hadn't made the playoffs in four years, move on to Thursday's
semifinal against Long Beach State, which has defeated the Trojans
all three times they have faced this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been defeating ourselves,'' Powers said. ``We played
our last five matches on the road (actually seven counting
Saturday), and we won four out of five.''
</P>
<P>
   Pono Kahale, playing in Roumain's place, led with 20 kills,
followed by Pierce College graduate Keith Barnett with 16 kills and
Scott Wong with 15 kills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got down in this game and didn't have George to bring us
back,'' Kahale said.

MASSACRE DISRUPTS MENDING IN JONESBORO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ March 24 came and went in this still
shellshocked town of 50,000, and folks sighed with some relief.
</P>
<P>
   They had survived the first anniversary of what had been the
nation's deadliest school massacre, when two boys with high-powered
rifles murdered five and wounded 10 at the local middle school.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Littleton, Colo., shootings came last week and set back
the fragile healing, sending shock waves through this pretty little
section of northeast Arkansas where folks pepper their talk with
quotes from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord is dragging his feet about getting down here and
fixing it,'' said Cookie Kinman, a waitress at a local waffle house
where the motto is ``People make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just awful. People are pretty tore up all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton killings resurrected Jonesboro's ongoing mystery:
How could something so bad happen in a place so good?
</P>
<P>
   The killers in Littleton killed themselves, leaving no
opportunity to question them.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Jonesboro, the killers _ Andrew Golden, then 11, and
Mitchell Johnson, then 13 _ were so young, so emotionally and
mentally immature, that they still have not answered why they did
it.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, now 12 and 14, will remain in an Arkansas youth prison
until they are at least 18, when they will be eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golden has been described as a troublemaker. Folks say
Johnson is a choir boy who may have been upset over the breakup
with a girlfriend or angry with a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no end for us. There is no closure at all,'' said
Gretchen Woodard, Johnson's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pain, all the tragedy, all the heartache just comes
again in waves,'' said Woodard, who visits her son every chance she
is allowed: two hours every second and fourth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``My son can't tell you why. It's his burden for the rest of
his life. The (March 24) anniversary devastated him. No one
understands the guilt that Mitchell deals with.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard is still raising Mitchell's brother, Monte Johnson, 12,
and stepsister, Jessie Woodard, 3. She is married to a
heavy-equipment operator.
</P>
<P>
   The family still lives in the same double-wide mobile home and
keeps the same phone number as before the shootings. They have not
been hit with threatening mail or phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The media are ``a double-edged sword'' to Gretchen Woodard. The
notoriety left her deluged with thousands of well-wishing letters
from around the world. At the same time, she winces every time she
sees some commentator ascribe a new theory to her son's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Jonesboro shootings, the Arkansas Legislature
lowered the age at which a child can be prosecuted as an adult to
10, from 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, a 10-year-old child can spend his life in prison. Are we
going to give up on our children after age 10? That breaks my
heart,'' Gretchen Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golden, who pleaded innocent, was silent at his
sentencing, and has not publicly commented about the killings.
Mitchell Johnson pleaded guilty and said he was sorry for what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jonesboro residents remain bitter and confused over the
pair's failure to explain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby McCluskey, whose daughter, 14-year-old Crystal Barnes, was
among those wounded in the Jonesboro shootings, cried in front of
her television Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who last year was shot in the back and leg and
confined to a wheelchair, refused to watch as events unfolded in
Littleton. After an hour, McCluskey switched it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry that it happened again,'' McCluskey said. ``I don't
know why they're doing this; that when they get mad, they go out
and shoot somebody. I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Crystal Barnes worked hard to rehabilitate
her broken body. By the time school started in the fall, she was
out of her wheelchair and even off her crutches.
</P>
<P>
   McCluskey, who works at a local uniform company, said she talks
with her children every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't talk to your kids on a day-to-day basis, if they
aren't comfortable talking to you about normal things, they aren't
going to come to you with their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Off U.S. 63, on a shady lane past groves of pines, churches,
cemeteries and the ``fancy pigeon'' farm, news reporters are
greeted at the Westside School with a warning sign, threatening
them with prosecution and directing them to the office.
</P>
<P>
   Bullet holes are no longer visible. A fence now separates the
school from the woods where the boys fired their rifles.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial garden, pavilion and amphitheater will be completed
this fall. Inscribed will be the names of the dead students _
Brittney Varner, Natalie Brooks, Stephanie Dawn Johnson, Paige Ann
Herring _ and the teacher, Shannon Wright, who shielded other
students from being shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a setback for all of us,'' said Dick Young, the
no-nonsense superintendent of the Westside Consolidated School
District.
</P>
<P>
   Young rejects how school shootings in recent years have been
characterized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not `school violence,' but the violence of our
communities coming into our schools.'' If society fails to deal
with violence, crime in the schools ``will occur over and over and
over again,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Like others here, Tim Morgan, pastor of the First Free Will
Baptist Church, is struggling to find meaning in the killings.
Quoting the Bible, he said, ``All things work together for good to
those who love God.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is the good?
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Hubert Brodell, a 70-year-old former insurance salesman
who has led the Jonesboro community for 12 years, said his town of
50,000 people is closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the healing ceremony (two weeks after last year's
shootings), it was one of the best things that ever happened to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two ministerial alliances merged into one. Security and
counseling were increased at the schools. More police patrol the
neighborhoods. Crisis intervention teams were formed for other
emergencies in a town that lies along ``Tornado Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our town has handled it exceptionally well,'' said Brodell,
who keeps a photo of himself and President Clinton, sports a tie
with donkeys and gold stars and posts a sign on his door that says
``Please come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodell remains mystified how Andrew Golden, whom he had known
since the boy was knee-high, could pull a trigger on other
children.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor stopped for a cup of coffee early Wednesday with the
boy's grandfather, Doug Golden. But the two old friends don't talk
about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't discuss it. It's hard enough for everybody,'' Brodell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Jonesboro hosted a nationally televised
town-hall meeting for ``Nightline.'' Emotions ran high during the
two-hour show, which drew more than 300 people, including Gretchen
Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite prompting from host Ted Koppel, she declined to
apologize to Mitchell Wright, widower of murdered teacher Shannon
Wright, for her son's actions. Ballistics tests showed the teacher
was killed by Woodard's son.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said that it was not her intention to cause anyone any
pain but that she had already repeatedly apologized to the
community at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, life was getting back to normal,'' said Wright, who
this month married a local TV news anchor. The two met during news
interviews following last year's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, we got a reality check. There are people who think
I shouldn't have gotten married again. But God brought us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Young, who remained silent during the program,
said as he left the church that he was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stirred up emotions that were becoming lightened. We'll
have to deal with that tomorrow. But they (ABC-TV) made their
money,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the program, Mark Stebnicki, professor of psychology
at Jonesboro's Arkansas State University, said his community had
been ``re-traumatized'' by the Littleton shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community will never be the same. We can't make Littleton
or Jonesboro go away,'' Stebnicki said. ``But what people do is
learn how to adapt and cope.'' &QL;

SPURS STORM PAST FADING LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Not that anyone needed another indicator of how
far the Los Angeles Lakers have fallen, but the San Antonio Spurs
happily provided an up-to-date perspective Saturday on The Decline
of '99.
</P>
<P>
   It's this simple: No Lakers team with Shaquille O'Neal in the
lineup had ever lost to the Spurs, home or away, in good times or
bad, in sickness or in health, since O'Neal donned the purple and
gold. Never.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday. And oh, did the Spurs make up for lost time and
lost games.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dominating performance, netting a lopsided result, the
Spurs embarrassing the visitors 108-81 in front of a raucous 31,972
at the Alamodome. San Antonio got 21 points from Tim Duncan, 16
from the usually dormant David Robinson and 36 points from the
bench to expose all the reasons why these teams are moving rapidly
in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs won for the 25th time in their past 29 games. The
Lakers lost their fifth in the past seven games and fell to 12-12
since the Eddie Jones-Glen Rice trade that reshaped the team at
midseason.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an indication that they're playing very good
basketball and we're still in a learning process with this
ballclub,'' coach Kurt Rambis said of the 27-point loss, which tied
for worst of the season (see Trail Blazers, Portland, April 13).
``We were doing a few good things the last couple ballgames. We
took a step back today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more than a step. The Lakers surrendered 69.2 percent
shooting in the first half and fell into a 15-point halftime
deficit, and the defense never did arrive as the margin grew larger
in the final two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It's in vogue now for the Lakers to cite their countless roster
moves this season as the source of their disarray. It's a valid
argument to a point, and they've decided to concentrate on simple
improvement, rather than wins and losses, over the waning days of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   But after a shellacking by a team they've owned for the better
part of two seasons, the excuses were pointless. They just owned up
to the obvious deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed with our effort,'' Rambis said. ``They
outworked us tonight. We're not going to go anywhere or do anything
if we get outworked.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, unaccustomed to losing in his hometown, gave his usual
26 points and 12 rebounds and even made 6 of 8 foul shots. But
after Glen Rice's 19 points, there was little support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the hottest team in the league right now, and they
just played with more urgency than we did, more determination,''
O'Neal said. ``Once again we had a lot of turnovers, they had a lot
of easy baskets. The first half they shot 70 percent. A team shoots
70 percent, you have to step it up on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's difficult to defend against turnover-fueled
fast-break layups, of which there were many. The Lakers committed a
reasonable 13 turnovers, but they went for 14 points, and the Spurs
converted eight turnovers into 12 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers stuck around for only the first quarter, trailing
25-23 heading into the second period. They tied it at 25-all, but
never got that close again. With the Spurs leading 31-30, San
Antonio launched a 14-2 run that provided a permanent cushion and
played stifling defense the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs wound up scoring 16 points above their average while
holding the Lakers to their fourth-lowest output of the season, and
18 points below their average.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers were faced with the irritating question.
Are they really 27 points behind the Western Conference's elite, a
group of which they are supposed to be a part?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really use points for a barometer,'' Derek Fisher
said. ``The way that we play shows us how far, even if we lost by
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gap is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now they're at the highest level of
confidence,'' Fisher said, ``and we're somewhere in the middle or
maybe the lowest. That has a big effect on the way you play when
you're out there on the floor.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Team meetings in April are rare, but these are the
Los Angeles Dodgers and the expectations are enormous. And they've
been playing dreadful lately, culminating in Friday's loss to St.
Louis in which the Cardinals' Fernando Tatis hit two grand slams.
In the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep too good,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, Johnson should be refreshed today.
</P>
<P>
   His pep talk worked, at least for a day, as the Dodgers beat St.
Louis 6-1 Saturday in front of a soldout crowd of 53,964 at Dodger
Stadium. And they did it the way it was diagrammed on the
blackboard during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ismael Valdes (2-0) allowed one run on six hits in
tossing the Dodgers' first complete game of the season. He struck
out 10 and walked two and got offensive support from Eric Karros
and Eric Young, who each hit first-inning homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also got key hits from Gary Sheffield and Devon
White to pad their lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good control and I was getting ahead of the hitters, in
and out,'' Valdes said. ``I was feeling pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The only obstacle for Valdes may have been Johnson, who thought
about yanking him in the eighth inning because of a blister
problem. Valdes left his last start with a blister on the middle
finger of his pitching hand. This one was closer to his nail and
had little affect on his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the mound and I said, `Nice going,''' Johnson said.
``He pleaded with me, `No, let me finish.' The trainers, he must
have them in his pocket, because they said it was the normal thing
he got.''
</P>
<P>
   It was such a night for the Dodgers that catcher Paul LoDuca can
again sleep comfortably. After beginning the season without a hit
in 19 at-bats, he broke through with a seventh-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   The only downer for the Dodgers was third baseman Adrian
Beltre's failure to get a hit. His hitting streak stopped at 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals left-hander Donovan Osborne (0-2) was the losing
pitcher, giving up four runs in five innings. Tatis homered again,
his seventh, but it was a solo shot in the seventh inning and had
little bearing on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think meetings are more therapeutic for the manager than
they are for the players,'' Johnson said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The dividends were on display early, beginning with the fifth
pitch Young saw from Osborne. The second baseman, who went 3 for 4,
drilled his first homer of the season to give the Dodgers a 1-0
lead. It was the 10th time he's led off the first inning with a
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield then drew a one-out walk and Karros hit an 0-1 pitch
over the left field fence as the Dodgers went ahead 3-0. It was
Karros' fourth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game the Dodgers (9-9) had scored four runs in the
first inning all season. It was also the first time they scored
more than one run in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valdes did a good job,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said.
``He was sharp and he pitched up and in and out. He mixed it up
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Valdes retired the first seven Cardinals, allowed a
double to Joe McEwing and then didn't allow another hit until Ray
Lankford led off the sixth with a pinch-hit double.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes wasn't bothered by it. He struck out Darren Bragg and
Edgar Renteria and retired Mark McGwire (0 for 3, walk) on a fly
ball to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five innings he was painting inside, outside, and
throwing strikes on anything he wanted to,'' LoDuca said. ``He
painted McGwire on one. To be honest, he threw one bad pitch, and
that was the one Tatis hit out. It seemed like with two strikes we
could have called any pitch we wanted because he was throwing
strikes with everything.''

GALAXY HOLDS OFF CLASH

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It had been a long five-game season for the
Los Angeles Galaxy, punctuated by the dismissal of coach Octavio
Zambrano on Wednesday. But at last, the free-flowing Galaxy machine
that notched record after record last season made its 1999 debut
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Newly hired UCLA coach Sigi Schmid asked assistant Ralph Perez
to handle the match against San Jose, opting to observe this one
from a Rose Bowl suite high above the field.
</P>
<P>
   After the Galaxy failed to get a shot on goal in the first half,
Schmid couldn't take it any longer. He made his sideline debut in
the second half and his presence was more than enough to spark Los
Angeles to a 1-0 victory over the Clash.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first regulation victory for the Galaxy this season
and ended its three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy president Tim Leiweke made the coaching change because he
said fans in Los Angeles deserved ``instant gratification and
results.''
</P>
<P>
   For a day at least, Los Angeles had both.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Caligiuri scored the game-winner in the 58th minute, ending
a 183-minute scoring drought for Los Angeles, which had only scored
three goals in its first five games.
</P>
<P>
   Midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos slipped a pass down the
right side for Caligiuri, who was finishing an overlapping run down
the flank. Caligiuri settled the ball softly in front, then
finished to the left side past San Jose goalkeeper David Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had a chance to make it 2-0 in the 75th minute, but
Cienfuegos missed a penalty shot after Kramer guessed correctly to
his right.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact the Galaxy didn't manage a shot on goal in the
first half, it appeared more spirited from the opening whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The only changes Perez made to the starting lineup involved
moving midfielder Clint Mathis to the front line with Cobi Jones
and starting Ezra Hendrickson in place of struggling Daniel
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th minute, Jones turned on Clash defender Mauricio
Wright, then dropped a beautiful pass in front of the net to
Caligiuri, but the former UCLA graduate couldn't direct his shot on
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri showed his playmaking skills minutes later. Settling
outside the penalty box, he saw Greg Vanney sneaking behind San
Jose's defense toward the penalty spot. He rewarded Vanney with a
beautiful pass behind the defense, but Vanney missed an easy
opportunity 8 yards straightaway, spraying his shot to the right.

TROPHY TROUT EASE THE CHILL OF OPENING DAY IN EASTERN SIERRA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Brett Pauly is the Daily News Outdoors Editor. Daily News
staff   writer Jeremy Bagott contributed to this story.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ It wasn't the prettiest thing, with
light snow and near freezing temperatures dampening some spirits
throughout much of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot warmer in the car,'' Jeffrey Puerto, 8, said
Saturday as his father, Dan, targeted trout _ outside _ at Crowley
Lake. ``I'm waiting for the sun to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey got his wish for only short periods during the first day
of trout fishing in the Eastern Sierra, as the sun broke through
mostly overcast skies and windblown snowflakes at the popular
fishing site north of Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   But a propensity of trophy trout seemed to erase any
cold-weather worries. No fewer than four trout topped the 7-pound,
10-ounce heaviest trout weighed in during the 1998 opener, and a
glut of rainbows and browns were caught in the 5- to 7-pound range.
The day's whopper was a 10.41-pound rainbow landed at Convict Lake
by L.A.'s Charles Hennessey, according to early reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of the day is all the good fishing,'' said Mike
Thompson of Riverside, as he dangled Power Bait beyond a stringer
of three 15-inch rainbows at Bridgeport Reservoir. ``The worst part
is a little bit of snow and the temperature. I like it when I get
up and it's 80, not 30.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual angling extravaganza attracts throngs of visitors,
long estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 or more, some 80 percent of whom
are thought to be from the Southland. It is a celebration of the
end of a six-month seasonal closure of trout fishing in creeks,
rivers and lakes from Independence in Inyo County north to
Bridgeport and throughout the remainder of Mono County.
</P>
<P>
   While fishing is the common thread between visitors and regional
anglers alike, it also serves as a springboard to camaraderie and
social gatherings, some of which have been put on hold since last
fishing season _ or even last year's Eastern Sierra trout opener,
always slated the final Saturday in April. It's about swapping
stories, family time, making new friendships and rekindling old
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Married 10 years, Deborah and Ron Paules of Simi Valley
northwest of Los Angeles have enjoyed the last six trout openers
together. They usually ice-fish with a group in the Mammoth Lakes
Basin, but some in the party canceled and the couple found
themselves casting bait at Upper Twin Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to fish, but I probably like sitting here reading a
book better,'' said Deborah Paules. ``It's like everybody else; you
think you are going to catch the big hungry one who has been
waiting all season to eat !ital!my!off! Power Bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is, we haven't got a fish yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they don't get their fishing tackle mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby a family was still chatting about a fishing pole that was
lost hours earlier when an overzealous trout took off with the
hook, line and sinker; the outfit was caught a short time later by
another angler ... with the offending trout still hooked.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was mild in mostly windless but cloudy Bishop and
the Owens Valley, with a high of 59, a low of 41 and scattered
rain. At higher elevations, including Crowley Lake, Mammoth Lakes
and the Mono Basin, highs ranged from 36 to 45 and lows 16 to 23;
it snowed lightly for much of the day, with an inch sticking in
Mammoth Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   At Crowley, the most popular of all opening-day destinations,
fireworks were set off at 5:10 a.m. to signal the season's start,
replacing the traditional pre-dawn flare. The weather apparently
had little impact on safety issues, as the sheriff's offices of
Inyo and Mono counties reported no boating incidents or
fishing-related emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the weather and the slow early-morning fishing he
experienced at Grant Lake, Monte Rompal of North Hollywood said,
``I like it up here, just to get out of the Valley. It's the
atmosphere. It doesn't matter what size fish or how many you
catch.'

DETROIT DEALS HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Detroit Red Wings are certainly sitting
pretty with a 2-0 series lead over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks heading
into today's game at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wings weren't flying nearly so high until they acquired
Wendel Clark, Chris Chelios, Ulf Sammuelsson and Bill Ranford at
the NHL trading deadline. Detroit was 3-7-2 in the 12 games before
the blockbuster deals were made on March 23. The Red Wings had only
74 points at the 70-game mark _ the Ducks were one back with 73.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom said the deals were crucial if the
Red Wings were going to be legitimate contenders for a third
consecutive Stanley Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we weren't going anywhere if we kept playing like we
did in January and February,'' he said. ``I didn't think our team
was peaking like it had the last two years. (After the trades)
everybody was more excited again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those four guys came in and our team really got re-energized,
got our jump back. Everybody started playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit captain Steve Yzerman knew the team wasn't going well,
but he'd like to believe the Red Wings weren't a bunch of dead
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think so,'' he said when asked if Detroit would
have been one of the favorites without making the deals. ``But the
trades have improved the team.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about that. The Red Wings won their first eight
games after the trading deadline passed and are now 11-2-1 since
the new players were added.
</P>
<P>
   Not so special: The Ducks' special teams carried them during the
regular season, so it figured special-teams play would be crucial
to any success Anaheim might have against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Red Wings are winning the battle. Detroit is 4 of 15
on the power play, while the Ducks are 2 of 10 with the man
advantage, and one of Anaheim's goals was scored in garbage time of
Game 2. Meanwhile, Detroit was 3 of 6 in the first 30 minutes of
Friday night's game before finishing 3 of 9.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs: Today's opening period figures to be crucial once
again. In the first period of the first two games the Red Wings
have outshot the Ducks 35-16 and outscored them 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   No blame game: Ducks defenseman Kevin Haller wasn't about to
bad-mouth fellow defenseman Ruslan Salei, who was on the ice for
all five Detroit goals Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the same situation,'' said Haller. ``A couple
were just bad luck. You've just got to forget about it. He's a good
player. I'm not going to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg tried to take the diplomatic route
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't at his best, he made some mistakes that cost us,''
said Hartsburg. ``But he's young and you've got to coax him along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten better all year, but this is a new step.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting mad: After watching the Ducks sit back and take Detroit
abuse for almost 2{ periods on Friday, Stu Grimson finally went out
of his way to stir something up with Chelios and then Darren
McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit coach Scotty Bowman thought the Ducks were trying to
send a message, but Hartsburg acted as if that wasn't the way to
send it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if that's what we needed,'' he said. ``We just
need more guys to compete.''

FOX, HARPER BACK IN MIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Rick Fox returned from the infirmary and Derek
Harper returned from an involuntary extended breather Saturday, but
both key Los Angeles Lakers veterans were far from returning to
peak performances.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, out three games with a sore right knee, played 17 minutes,
making 2 of 6 shots for four points and two rebounds. Harper,
benched for four straight games and most of a fifth because coach
Kurt Rambis felt he needed rest, played 19 minutes and scored two
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what I saw in Harp,'' Rambis said. ``He brought a lot
of energy and effort. Rick seemed to be testing it a little bit, a
little bit unsure, but that's the nature of coming back from an
injury. There's a psychological barrier to break through because
you have to deal with the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was more painful for Harper than going from starter to
48-minute bench warmer, a rarity in his 16 years in the league. He
never felt he needed the rest and said the time off probably hurt
more than helped at this point, disrupting his rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't lie to you _ I don't have any rhythm,'' he said. ``I
haven't played for (10 days).''
</P>
<P>
   As for his health, which was Rambis' concern, Harper said: ``I
feel fine. It's not about me, though. If Fish (Derek Fisher) and Ty
(Lue) can get it done, so be it. But you wanna play, and you're
competitive. Whoever goes out there, we've got to find a way to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis still hasn't committed to any of his three point guards
as the starter for the playoffs, which begin in two weeks. He felt
it was time to get Harper, the steadiest of the trio, back in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me the other day in practice that his step is back,
he's spryer now than he was,'' Rambis said. The starting job ``is
not completely settled, but I always like what (Harper) did against
the starters for the most part whenever he was fresh, and Fish
coming off the bench and Ty being a speciality kind of guy. But
it's all subject to how we're playing and what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Healed: Fox, his hair slicked back Mafia-style before the game,
joked that his 'do was a tribute to trainer Gary Vitti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian trainer put me back on the court, so I slicked my
hair back in honor of him to thank him for once again repairing my
injuries,'' Fox quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, the Lakers needed Fox back. Kobe Bryant was logging
40-plus minutes without Fox to spell him and with only rookie Ruben
Patterson available as a sub. Fox also had been on a hot streak
before the injury _ averaging 11.9 points in his previous 10 games,
including 19- and 24-point outings against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick gives us a nice punch off the bench, and it's good to be
able to bring him in and get some time,'' Rambis said.

THIS TIME, RED SOX HAVE ENOUGH PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was the smell of blood in the air when Rheal
Cormier emerged from the Red Sox bullpen Saturday to face Cleveland
Indians strongman Jim Thome, whose ribs had been visited by a
Cormier fastball the night before. That pitch, thrown in
retaliation after Darren Lewis had been plunked by Jaret Wright,
touched off the second of two bench-clearing brawls between the
teams Friday night and resulted in the ejection of both players.
</P>
<P>
   Was another round of mayhem on deck?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the fans were (thinking that),'' Cormier said with a
smile after the Sox beat the Indians, 9-4, to end a three-game
losing streak. ``I was thinking, `Oh, God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to the Fenway Park crowd of 29,481, any hint of
hostilities already had ceased between Thome and Cormier, hours
before the lefthander retired Thome on a liner to shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, then induced Wilfredo Cordero to tap into a force
play, ending the seventh inning and preserving what at the time was
a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Cormier had given Thome a ride back to the
Indians' hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking out to my car,'' Cormier said, ``and (Thome) was
waiting for a cab. He came over to me and said, `No hard feelings,
it's part of the game.' So yeah, I gave him a ride back to his
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier had become hunting buddies with Thome a year ago in
spring training with the Indians, the first team to give him a
chance after he underwent tendon-transfer surgery on his left
elbow. Cormier, who pitched only once in 1997, never made it to the
big leagues with the Indians last season, as he hurt his left
shoulder overcompensating for his surgically repaired elbow.
</P>
<P>
   But on his second go-round with the Sox, who three years ago
traded Cormier to the Expos for Cordero, of all people, then
re-signed him this winter for a modest $500,000, Cormier so far has
exceeded expectations out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that starter Bret Saberhagen experienced a recurrence
of his own shoulder miseries, Cormier rescued the Red Sox in a game
in which they'd seized leads of 3-0 and 4-1 against Cleveland
starter Dave Burba, only to see rookie Tim Harikkala give it right
back after Saberhagen departed at the start of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   A double by Jose Offerman and a two-out RBI single by
Garciaparra, one of 10 two-out hits that produced seven Boston
runs, had restored the Sox to the lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But Cormier's fellow lefty, reliever Mark Guthrie, allowed an
infield hit to Robbie Alomar and walked Manny Ramirez in the
seventh before manager Jimy Williams called for Cormier to face
Thome, who already had doubled and scored Cleveland's first run and
had singled home the tying run off Harikkala in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where he's such a good hitter, and such a
tough out, because he stands right on the dish,'' Cormier said. ``I
threw him a fastball inside, and he hit it to Nomar, who was
playing in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier, whose off-field glasses make him an unlikely-looking
combatant for the farm-grown Thome, grinned as he noted that he'd
thrown a fastball to Thome Friday night, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one wasn't as far inside,'' Cormier said. ``That one got
away from me. This one had a little better location. It didn't move
as much. I think I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who sent more runners across the plate Saturday
than they have all season, weren't satisfied to leave their lead as
it was. They added three runs in the seventh, which began with a
home run by Mike Stanley and also featured an RBI double by Darren
Lewis and a run-scoring single by Offerman, and one more in the
eighth, when a sure-handed fan leaned over the center-field wall
and gathered in Troy O'Leary's sixth home run and third in five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who also singled and scored in the first, broke an
0-for-22 slump. O'Leary's six home runs leave him second only to
Jose Canseco in the American League. He had 12 home runs by the end
of May last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good team we're facing,'' said Saberhagen, who said a
knot in the back of his shoulder stiffened in  &UR; yesterday &LR; 's cool
wind, prompting him to pull himself out of the game three outs from
being eligible to be the winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``To score nine runs against them is a good feeling. Especially
after a tough one like  &UR; last night &LR; , and all the b.s. that went on,
to come out and swing the bats early.''

LONG BEACH STATE BEATS UC IRVINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ This time Long Beach State left nothing to
groan about later.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked 49ers were fired up, showing enthusiasm on
every kill, ace, or dig, as they repaid UC Irvine an old debt,
15-7, 15-10, 15-6, in front of 1,409 in the first-round volleyball
match of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament at the
Pyramid Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers advanced to the semifinals to play USC at 4 p.m.
Thursday in Provo, Utah. The Trojans beat Pepperdine Saturday,
15-7, 11-15, 15-9, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Brigham Young swept Pacific to host the semifinal and
final rounds, the latter scheduled for next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McKienzie led Long Beach with 25 kills, Jim Polster had 17
kills plus eight digs and five blocks, and Matt Prosser had 12
kills and eight blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers hit .361 and held the 10th-ranked Anteaters to a .174
attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was a much different match than three weeks ago when UCI hit
.480 to upset the 49ers, who at the time were enjoying their first
No. 1 ranking since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Long Beach reduced its service errors from 27 to 12 and
outdug UCI, 38-23, this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and did what we talked about doing all week
long,'' Long Beach coach Ray Ratelle said. ``Certainly the biggest
difference was our serving. We served strategically and it worked
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who improved to 21-2, took control early in Game 1,
and were able to keep the Anteaters at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that this is the playoff,'' said Curtis Jackson. ``We
can't hold anything back. We were all embarrassed after the first
match. We came out and we really wanted to prove something.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach trailed 4-0 in Game 2, but rallied to take the lead,
7-6, on a back row kill by McKienzie.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers opened the third game 4-0 and UC Irvine never really
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   McKienzie had 10 kills apiece in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely weren't losing tonight,'' he said. ``We were
coming out of this gym with a win tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was the 12th in a row at the Pyramid this season for the
49ers, who finished undefeated at home for the first time since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers showed more emotion and confidence than in any match
since they defeated top-ranked BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've been lacking,'' Prosser said. ``We've been
playing tentative in matches and we didn't do that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Rafter, who led UCI with 26 kills in the first meeting,
was held to five on 24 attempts. Erick Helenihi paced the Anteaters
(14-11) with 12 kills.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State also got 62 assists from Chris Seiffert, and
seven kills and a team-high 11 digs from Jackson.

SCORING STARS NEED TO FIND WAY TO NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Bruins got their satisfactory split here,
heading home in a 1-1 series tie with the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   But why doesn't that seem more troubling than satisfying?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't depend on Tim Taylor's line and Ken Belanger, and
Byron Dafoe every night,'' said a shrugging Pat Burns, after his
club lost hold of a 2-1 lead in the third period and went on to
suffer a 3-2 loss in OT. ``Guys like (Jason) Allison and (Sergei)
Samsonov, we need those guys to score some goals for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember that two-line offense that was all the hubbub in the
Hub as the regular season ended? There were only traces of it here
in the first two games _ traces that could end up the root cause of
defeat unless some of the Boston shooters wake up and smell the
net.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Rob DiMaio and Belanger were the unassuming scorers.
In Game 2, the names were more customary _ Samsonov and Steve
Heinze _ but the Boston attack that showed some serious bite down
the stretch showed up here with much of that bite missing.
</P>
<P>
   Allison has to play better, and his game showed some signs of
reviving in Game 2, but he is by no means alone. Wingers Dmitri
Khristich and Anson Carter have been non-factors. The Bruins need
Khristich cranking off his sizzling slapper. They need Carter
driving to the net, following up for rebounds. In 137 minutes 5
seconds here, those two key wingers barely could be found in the
Boston attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest surprises in the first two games, from Boston's
perspective, were Belanger and Landon Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger was a brute force in the opener, a powerful forechecker
and hitter, and it earned him a spot at left wing on the opening
line Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. In the end, he received fewer minutes that he
did in Game 1, but that was, in part, because Burns was trying to
kickstart his more offensive-minded shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, skill comes out,'' Burns said after the morning
workout. ``It's your skilled players that win series.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Boston forwards, it was the 24-year-old Wilson who
looked the most comfortable in Game 2. He had presence. Shift to
shift, he finally was showing reason why the Bruins gave up a
first-round draft pick to bring him to Boston. Samsonov scored the
first goal, but it was a brilliant move by Wilson on the right
wing, pulling up on a dime to elude ex-Bruin Glen Wesley, and then
snapping off a hard wrister at Arturs Irbe, that set up Samsonov
for the gimme.
</P>
<P>
   Save for the always-dependable checking lines _ DiMaio with
Taylor and P.J. Axelsson, Wilson's performance was the most
outstanding thing in a Black-and-Gold uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets his nose dirty and plays playoff hockey,'' said Burns,
matter-of-factly, as if Wilson always rolls out that kind of game.
``That's why he's playing. I'm not going to put guys on the boards
who aren't doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later you've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up on the standout list was DiMaio, who looks like the
little John Hancock building when standing next to the big John
Hancock building that is Keith Primeau. DiMaio almost looked happy
getting smacked by Primeau, because it gave him added license to
smack back. On one shift, the powerful Primeau trapped DiMaio near
the Carolina bench and kept him pinned unnecessarily against the
boards. DiMaio kicked and fussed, and then swatted at Primeau,
almost following him right on to the Carolina bench as the 'Canes
captain left the ice. As the series continues, that Mutt-and-Jeff
matchup should grow even more intense. Primeau is the big man on
campus and DiMaio keeps cutting holes in his varsity sweater.
</P>
<P>
   But the chore for Burns and his Bruins now is to get back the
touch of the first two lines, with Allison and Joe Thornton as the
pivots. The coach was rolling numbers to the end here, looking for
the right combination of wingers to package around his two big
centers and revive an offense that earlier this month looked
playoff primed and ready. Suddenly, the big shooters are popguns.
</P>
<P>
   It got slightly better as Game 2 progressed. The Bruins landed
only three shots in the first period, only Carter and P.J. Axelsson
hitting the net among the forwards. They managed a total 18 shots
over the rest of regulation _ less than a shot every two minutes _
and then landed three in OT. Khristich, a huge key to the offense,
didn't land a single shot in Game 2 and squeezed off only one in
Game 1. He only seemed to find his legs late in the third period,
with OT approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Two games gone and the Bruins are even in the series, playing
with an offense that is more wrong than right. That is both the bad
news and the good. Turn it around now and it's only a forgotten
footnote. Fail to get it going and it will be their signature to a
disappointing season.

CAROLINA IS FINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Their season series was even. Their play in
most of Game 1 was even. So it seems appropriate that the Bruins
and Carolina Hurricanes are dead even in their Eastern Conference
quarterfinal round as the games move to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sheppard was the difference Saturday night as he scored his
second goal of the game, beating Byron Dafoe at 17:05 of the first
sudden-death overtime period to lift the 'Canes to a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Steve Chiasson took the first shot and Dafoe made the
save. Then Martin Gelinas's shot rapped off the post and Sheppard
banged it home from the edge of the crease, sending the
disappointed Bruins home with a split.
</P>
<P>
   ``The D-man on the point took a shot and I made the save,'' said
Dafoe. ``I went to cover it and (Gelinas) chipped at it. It went
through and hit the post and then (Sheppard) got the rebound and
put it in the open net.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Boston's stated goal was to win one game
on Carolina ice heading back to the FleetCenter. The bad news is
that they had a 2-1 lead midway through the third period but
couldn't keep a lid on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played us hard  &UR; tonight &LR; ,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``We
had them, 2-1, then we turned the puck over and it was 2-2 and we
got ourselves in a dilemma. We give them credit. Our guys tried
hard, we just couldn't find a way. No excuses, no blaming. We get
back home and it's our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second, the Bruins broke through on their fourth
shot of the contest. Just before the Boston goal, the Hurricanes
had a great scoring chance when Primeau drilled a shot from the
left circle that bounced up in the air. Dafoe tried to bat it with
his stick but missed and the puck fell to the ice. With the
Hurricanes coming after it, defenseman Darren Van Impe cleared it
out of the zone and the Bruins took off.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Landon Wilson, who played only four shifts for a
total of two minutes in the first period but was one of Boston's
best players the rest of the way, fired a shot from the left circle
as he was falling forward. Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe made the
stop but left wing Sergei Samsonov was there on the doorstep for
the rebound and Boston had a 1-0 lead at 2:56.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem to take any steam out of the persistent
Hurricanes' attack. In fact, Boston's advantage lasted less than
five and a half minutes when the Hurricanes put an end to Dafoe's
playoff shutout streak at 88:23.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Paul Coffey, who didn't play in Game 1 because of a
strained hamstring, started the play and Gelinas took it from
there, backhanding a short relay over to Sheppard. Sheppard,
gunning down the right side of the slot, blasted the puck over the
glove of Dafoe at 8:24 to pull Carolina even, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the Hurricanes played most of the game with four
defensemen because Marek Malik (quadriceps contusion) and Nolan
Pratt (groin strain) were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze, who had been benched for more than 19 minutes of
the third period in Game 1 because Burns didn't think he was
getting enough from his second-line left winger, vowed to do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   His goal at 8:32 of the third period gave Boston a 2-1 lead.
Heinze scored his first goal in eight postseason contests dating
back to the six-game series against the Washington Capitals when he
didn't register a point.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jason Allison dished a pass to right wing Anson Carter in
the slot. Carter fired a shot that trickled through Irbe's pads.
Heinze charged into the crease and rapped it into the net inside
the right post.
</P>
<P>
   At 14:28, the Hurricanes pulled even when Robert Kron scored.
Kron, who had been a healthy scratch for Game 1, filled in for
injured center Ron Francis, who sprained his ankle in Game 1.
Heinze said Kron's goal was his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a short trip from being a hero to a goat in the
playoffs,'' said Heinze. ``I make a mistake on the boards, a
giveaway, and they come right back and tie it up, 2-2. (Kron)
tipped it. I lost my stick and couldn't get to his hands. He just
redirected the puck between (Dafoe's) legs.''
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, the 'Canes nearly scored on a fluke at the 1:55
mark when former Bruins' defenseman Glen Wesley, taking a page out
of Ray Bourque's book, gunned the puck at the net from center ice.
It nearly went through Dafoe's legs but he got to it in time.
</P>
<P>
   Rob DiMaio nearly won it at 5:48 when his shot ricocheted off
the right post. Then, Sheppard did win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' said Dafoe, ``we gave them life.''

WOMEN'S WORLD CUP GETTING SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
 WORLD CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Joy Fawcett remembers coming home from
China with her teammates eight years ago, World Cup trophy in hand,
and realizing that nobody but the federation, family, and friends
knew they had been over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one reporter at the airport when we got off the
plane,'' she says. ``I thought, `Did we really do this? And what
does it mean?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the US women's soccer team is wondering this time.
More than 400,000 people will buy tickets to this summer's
quadrennial tournament in seven American cities, with an aggregate
billion worldwide likely to watch on TV and 1,200 media
representatives on hand. And this time, Fawcett &AMP; Co. are expected
not only to win but to ``leave a legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of the role model aspect involved and we
understand that,'' says keeper (and University of Massachusetts
grad) Briana Scurry. ``We'd be a bit naive not to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   All the US women need do is glance at the tournament advertising
(``THIS IS MY GAME. THIS IS MY FUTURE. WATCH ME PLAY'') or the Nike
ads pushing female self-confidence and empowerment through sports
or listen to the mob of girls (and, increasingly, boys) screeching
for postmatch autographs to know what their role is. To not merely
win _ but inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes high expectations can undermine performance, but I'd
like to think that the expectations are realistic and obtainable,''
says coach Tony DiCicco, whose squad takes on top rival China again
Sunday at Giants Stadium in a tuneup. ``Everyone on the team has
bought into what we have to do. So we're taking all this as a
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   High expectations are flattering, but the Americans have come to
realize there is pressure that comes with them. It means they've
been noticed. When they beat the Chinese for the Olympic gold medal
before 76,000 spectators three years ago, NBC didn't televise the
match. This time, ABC will air both the US-Denmark opener here and
the final in the Rose Bowl and ESPN will show the other 30
tournament matches, all but five of them live.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Watch Me Play'' slogan comes with an unspoken subtext: And
See How Far I've Come. The women's game has evolved dramatically
since the inaugural Cup in 1991. It's faster, more skilled, more
physical, more tactical. And the Americans, who are 111-14-7 over
the past eight years and unbeaten in their last 50 at home, are the
world's dominant side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win,'' says Fawcett, ``you can see it in our
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   But the winning is only one part of their mission, and the
players accept that. If women's soccer is to keep growing here, if
a top-level professional league is to get off the ground, the US
squad also has to entertain, to play a bold and inventive and
stylish game that will fill seats and keep the sport on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we step on the field,'' says Mia Hamm, ``we want to
put on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   So the nine-match ``Road to Pasadena'' exhibition series has a
barnstorming flavor to it, with the Americans turning up everywhere
from Orlando to Portland, Ore. During the Cup, they'll play in six
cities, including Foxborough. And they won't be performing in
small-college or municipal stadia but in Soldier Field, Jack Kent
Cooke Stadium, and the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The women's game has come to full flower in America, and the
stars _ Hamm, Michelle Akers, Kristine Lilly, captain Carla
Overbeck, Fawcett, and Scurry _ have marquee status.
</P>
<P>
   Longevity, admittedly, has much to do with that. The 33-year-old
Akers scored the US team's inaugural goal in 1985, and she still
starts in the midfield. Lilly holds the world record for caps
(172), and Hamm is only four goals short of setting a global mark
of 108.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans can put eight women on the field who have 100 or
more caps. No other country can do (or ever has done) that. Ten
players competed in the 1995 World Cup, and seven played in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to duplicate that experience,'' concedes DiCicco,
whose toughest decision is usually whom to leave on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The US reserves probably could have qualified for the tournament
on their own. And except for their duels with the Chinese and
Norwegians (the defending Cup champions), the Americans' most
demanding tests usually come in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play us every day,'' says Scurry. ``You couldn't face a
more difficult team.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrimmages tend to be cutthroat, with the 100-cappers not just
having to fight to retain their spots _ but expecting to.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the best qualities about our veterans,'' says
DiCicco. ``They do expect to start, but they don't expect to be
given anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm may have hundreds of thousands of age-groupers wearing her
jersey, but she knows that some fellow Carolina alumna will be
right at her ankles as soon as she touches the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to expect that someone's going to come at you with a
hard tackle,'' Hamm says. ``They won't let you have a free ball,
and that's the way it should be. We understand that it's not
personal when we're out there on the field. We're just trying to
make each other better.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't 1991 anymore, and the road to Pasadena is no victory
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see the other countries getting better,'' says Fawcett.
``We don't have to be told what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the Americans and the rest of the world has
narrowed markedly, and they know that better than anyone. ``The
Brazilians weren't a good team eight years ago,'' says DiCicco.
``Now, they're a very good team. North Korea, where did they come
from? We'd never heard of them, and suddenly they're right with the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they didn't have to qualify for the Cup as hosts, the
Americans haven't had to go play a win-or-go-home match since the
Olympic final. When the Chinese knocked them off for the Algarve
Cup in Portugal last month, it was a ringing reminder that they
still have to be at the top of their game to stay on top of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Yanks sought to drive home a point to the Chinese
three nights ago in Hershey, when they stormed downfield and scored
the winning goal three minutes into added time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese were ready for the tie,'' said Scurry. ``That's
the difference between them and us. We don't play for ties.''
</P>
<P>
   The US women don't have that luxury. The men, who finished last
in last year's World Cup in France, have a timetable that has them
being a ``legitimate contender'' by 2010. The women's timetable
calls for them to win here and now. It doesn't say anything about
putting on a show or leaving a legacy. This time, it's assumed.

PEERS CALL ELWAY ONE OF NFL'S BEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is fitting that he is going out on top, because that
is where John Elway belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone had any doubts about John being ranked up there with
the best that have ever played this game,'' said his former coach,
Dan Reeves, Saturday, ``then the last two Super Bowls should have
washed all of that away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had proven that he could win the biggest games of them all,
so there was nothing left to prove. He has done it all. The
National Football League will miss him. And fans in Denver, and all
around the country, will miss him. He was an incredibly exciting
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway will make it official in the next few days that he will
retire from the Denver Broncos after a glorious career in the NFL,
with five Super Bowl appearances, two world championships, and a
Most Valuable Player award from last January's win over Reeves's
Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   He has had one of the greatest careers of anyone who ever has
played the game, and he will have a special place in the Hall of
Fame in Canton, Ohio, five years from now, the first year he will
be eligible to be voted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``John deserves to be ranked up there with the very best ever,''
said Jets coach Bill Parcells, who lost the AFC Championship game
last year in Denver. ``He is certainly in the top four or five
quarterbacks of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I saw him. It was his rookie season
and we were on the field before the game for warmups. He threw a
couple of deep comebacks and I said to myself, `Gee whiz, this kid
looks like he is going to be special.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one of the best arms I've ever seen, and a great
combination of talent. He had size, strength, durability, and
courage. I always told our players when we went up against him, `If
you just let him stand in the pocket, and we don't get anyone in
his face, we are going to lose.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him playing a game, and if the other team wasn't
doing anything to stop him from stepping up and throwing in the
pocket, I knew they were going to lose. If you just let him stand
there and freeze, it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first Super Bowl and his first Super Bowl, he had a great
first half against us, but then our defense got after him, flushed
him out of the pocket, and allowed us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the championship game we did a good job of shutting him
down in the first half, but then he did a good job of beating us in
the second half. But he's had a whole history of bringing his team
back to beat people in games.''

   Elway seemed born to play football. His father Jack, now
retired, was an outstanding college coach. Young John could do
anything athletically. Coming out of high school, he had a football
scholarship to Stanford, and signed a baseball contract with the
New York Yankees. He played baseball in the minors for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited John out of high school and coached him all four
years at Stanford,'' says Jim Fassel, the New York Giants' coach
who has remained close to Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a great competitor. In college I knew he was going to
be a great player in the NFL. He had incredible talent and a great
desire to compete. In 1994, I was asked to come back to present
John into the Stanford Hall of Fame. Someone asked me what I
thought was the greatest play I had ever seen John make. They all
thought I was going to say this unbelievable throw he made against
USC one day when he threw a rocket from his own 40-yard line, on a
line, over Ronnie Lott's head to our receiver, Kenny Margerum. Lott
was on the 10. Margerum was in the end zone. You should be able to
run 20 yards in the time it takes a football to travel that far.
But John threw it so hard, Ronnie could not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, though, that was not my favorite John Elway play.
It came in baseball. He was a sophomore playing right field against
Arizona State. They had a man on second and the batter hit a single
down the right-field line. Just inches inside the line. John raced
to the line, gloved the ball, turned and threw a strike to home
plate to get the runner. I have never seen anything thrown as hard
as that ball was. It was so stunning the players on both sides came
out of the dugout, and the fans came right out of their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John is the greatest quarterback ever to play this
game, and he's just as great as a person. We still talk on the
phone a lot. I spoke with him the Tuesday morning after the Super
Bowl and he was totally relaxed, as if nothing great had happened.
It's a tribute to him and his family, and the way he was raised,
that John has conducted himself the way he has on and off the field
throughout his entire playing career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During that first year,'' says Reeves, who coached Elway for
most of his career, ``we played the Colts in Denver. We were behind
by two or three touchdowns in the second half, and he brought us
back to win. And then I was lucky enough to be part of most of
those incredible comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has great leadership qualities. He does not ask anyone,
like another player on the team, to do something he would not do
himself. He had tremendous focus. He was like Michael Jordan. When
the game was on the line, he wanted the ball. He lived for those
moments. That's why he has more comeback victories than anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could write a book about all of the memories I have of him
as a player. He did something special in almost every game he ever
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he is retiring now, but my guess is that he
just found it too difficult to keep getting himself ready to play
the season, the way he did in the past. It was the same way with
Roger Staubach. Roger and John both were great workout guys in the
offseason. Tremendously dedicated. At the end, Roger told me he
just couldn't make that commitment anymore, and if he couldn't, he
didn't think he could play up to the standards he set for himself.
My guess is this is what has happened to John.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, after he won his first Super Bowl, most thought
Elway was going to retire. But he came back with the hopes of
winning back-to-back Super Bowls, and creating an atmosphere to
help get his good friend, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, a new stadium
in Denver. Both happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking with John about retiring,'' his agent,
Marvin Demoff, one of the very best and a solid guy, told me in
March at the annual league meetings. ``John is very tempted to go
back and try for three in a row. No one has ever done that. That is
the temptation. But I've been telling him there is also a
possibility that won't happen, and not to go out on top would be a
shame. Now would be the perfect time. He doesn't need any money. He
is in good health, and not beat up. There is nothing left to
prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond being a great player, Elway is also quite a guy. I
remember asking linebacker Bill Romanowski, when he first joined
the Broncos three years ago, what he thought of Elway, and Saturday
he said the same things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't act like John Elway,'' said Romanowski. ``He
doesn't act like a star. He's just one of the guys like everyone
else in the locker room. There is no pretense. No big ego. All the
players like him because they know how much he wants to win. John
is just one of the guys. I've been with him when people asked him
for autographs and he never turned one down. Never. He would stand
there and sign for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is really going to miss him in the locker room. He
had great leadership ability. He was so intense. Before his last
Super Bowl, I never had seen him that intense. I've been with him
for three years and he wanted to win that one more than any other
game. We had two weeks of practice before the game, and at the
beginning, he was too fired up. He was overthrowing everything in
practice. You could see he wanted that game too much. But on about
Wednesday before the game, he settled down, and everything was
great after that. It was really great playing with the guy, he's a
super person.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday I asked Jim Saccomano, the public relations director of
the Broncos and a man who has been by Elway's side throughout his
career, for his favorite memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand first what a nice person he is,''
Saccomano said. ``John does not like to hurt people. He wants to be
nice to everyone. Sometimes we have to hold him back from doing too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into Green Bay a few years back to play the Packers,
and we stayed in a hotel in Appleton, Wis. There was a wedding in
the hotel the same day. We came from the airport to the hotel, and
John went right into production meeting with the television crew
doing the game. When it was over, we came through the lobby, and a
bridesmaid from the wedding party stopped John and asked if he
could take a picture with the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying he couldn't, he hadn't been to his room, it was
just impossible. John said he was sorry, but he couldn't. He
stepped into the elevator and closed the doors. Six seconds later,
the doors opened and John said `OK, let's do it.' They went right
to the bride and groom, took all of the pictures they wanted to
take, and then left. Years later, some writers heard the story,
found the couple, and asked them about it. They said it was one of
the greatest moments of their lives. That was John just being
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, and I said this a few years before he ever won a
Super Bowl, John Elway is the best quarterback I have ever seen,
and that covers almost 40 years in this business. If you put Elway
on the same team with the others considered as the greatest, he
would have had them beat in size, arm strength, mobility,
durability, and courage. If they were all young, and in their
prime, trying out for the same team, Elway would be the starter.

IT'S A FIRST FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Revolution's fortunes appear to have changed.
Not only did their 3-2 victory over D.C. United Saturday night keep
them unbeaten in regulation time this season, they won for the
first time at RFK Stadium since Major League Soccer started in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   This game was a redemption after three seasons of mistakes and
misfortune. Player-coach Walter Zenga provided a dominant presence
in goal, and the Revolution battled for two first-half goals by
Ivan McKinley and one by Giovanni Savarese, then held off a
desperate D.C. rally in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had displayed defensive organization and Zenga
had been spectacular in four previous games. This time, though, New
England also kept possession in midfield and dictated some of the
tempo, signaling a major change in the team's comportment _
especially significant since D.C. United previously seemed to be
able to score at will against the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is very good because, for me, D.C. is the best
team in the league,'' Zenga said. ``We are starting over, and
tomorrow we will go back and keep trying to improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi are providing a
positive influence, even overcoming a 10-hour trip caused by flight
delays at Reagan National Airport, which Zenga said allowed them
``many more hours to talk about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A revamped midfield with Jair and Kris Kelderman flanked by Mike
Burns and McKinley provided much more composure than the Revolution
had shown. This poised approach limited the effectiveness of
United's Marco Etcheverry. And the Revolution, though without Edwin
Gorter (food poisoning), Imad Baba (groin), and John Harkes (knee),
took advantage of the absence of United defensive midfielders
Richie Williams (ankle) and Geoff Aunger (suspension).
</P>
<P>
   United took the lead as Etcheverry outmaneuvered Dan Calichman,
then Richard Goulooze slipped in the recently resodded goal area,
and Roy Lassiter took Etcheverry's pass and rounded Zenga in the
27th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, McKinley volleyed a Kelderman pass from the
left into the top of the net to tie. Then, the Revolution gained
momentum as Savarese made a sliding, left-footed finish of a Ted
Chronopoulos cross for a 2-1 edge in the 37th minute. McKinley
headed over Brian Kamler in the 45th minute, and United seemed
dispirited at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   United remained in first place with 7 points in the Eastern
Conference and the Revolution moved into second place with 6
points. The Revolution improved their record to 2-12-2 against the
two-time MLS Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution's midfield game disintegrated in the
second half, their defensive determination kept them in command
until A.J. Wood's 87th-minute score.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Revolution had striker Tony Kuhn and defender Manny
Motajo in the midfield, but the only fatal defensive breakdown
occurred when Brian Dunseth missed a sliding tackle on Wood in the
penalty area, allowing him an open blast past Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley (stomach muscle tear), Jair, and Savarese had been
benched as the Revolution reverted to a siege mentality. Johnny
Torres provided some spark, though, as he was fouled from behind by
Carlos Llamos, who was ejected by referee Rich Grady in the 76th
minute, and eventually dribbled out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could feel that we were going to win before the game in the
locker room,'' Calichman said. ``There was an electricity.
Sometimes, you can just feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, when we got behind, we still kept playing good football,
we kept fighting.''

CREAM STARTING TO RISE IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mark James told reporters not to get excited. Things
would be back to normal, he said, and there would be no need to
even talk about a playing captain for the 1999 Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he probably doesn't want to say he told us so, but . . .
he told us so.
</P>
<P>
   James is 45 and still plays full-time on the European PGA Tour.
He'll also captain the European team at The Country Club in
September, so when he somehow put together a few good tournaments
and jumped to 19th in the standings, reporters got interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Englishman stopped them short. It is impossible to be a
playing captain with the pressure involved these days, he said. The
last playing captain was Arnold Palmer in 1963. Besides, said
James, he hadn't a clue as to why he had shot the scores he had.
</P>
<P>
   He had a second-place finish in the Madeira Island Open a few
weeks ago, which, coupled with a third at Dubai and a 20th at
Qatar, gave him three strong finishes in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday, James perhaps showed why we won't see him
playing come September. He made double-bogeys on two par-5s, tossed
in six bogeys, made just one birdie, and ended up dead last with an
81 in the first round of the Spanish Open. All of that on a course
that yielded 43 scores of 69 or better.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, James's team has a better feel to it than it
had a few weeks ago. Thanks to strong efforts in the Masters, Jose
Maria Olazabal (a win) and Bernhard Langer (T-11th) have jumped
into the top 10 in the European standings, at least for now putting
a halt to talk of rookies that was dominating Ryder Cup
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   James faced the questions when he came to Boston: How did he
envision working with a team with so many rookies in the mix? And
this was last November. The same questions were posed to Tony
Jacklin, a former European captain, when he was in Boston in March.
They answered politely, but they had every right to laugh and say
there was a long, long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   There still is, but Europe is looking at a better veteran
presence than it was a few weeks ago. Not only has the number of
rookies dropped to five in the top 10, but veterans Per-Ulrik
Johansson (21st), Costantino Rocca (28th), and Ian Woosnam (30th)
have given a little kick-start to their games and moved up in the
standings. With a stretch of big events on the horizon _ Benson &AMP;
Hedges, Deutsche Bank, Volvo, English Open, German Open _ don't be
surprised if some big names come through and give the European team
even more of an experienced face by mid June.
</P>
<P>
   But short of an amazing rebound, don't figure on Nick Faldo
being in the picture. He has been a European fixture since making
his Ryder Cup debut in 1977, but he is a shattered shell of what he
once was _ the most feared match-play competitor in the world.
Though he does not hide his desire to be on the 1999 Ryder Cup
team, Faldo understands his work is cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too much strength in depth for me to hand a wild card
to someone playing on a wing and a prayer,'' James told Golf World.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Nick, you want a spot on the team? You'd better
earn it. Which is what Faldo intends on doing. He missed the cut at
this week's Spanish Open, but will be at the Benson &AMP; Hedges,
Deutsche Bank, and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``One really good week and I'm right back in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It figures that one of James's captain's picks will go to Jesper
Parnevik, so he would prefer to see his veteran players
automatically qualify so that he would have more latitude. Perhaps
to pick Sergio Garcia?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that seems a long shot, but the kid has plenty of flair
and he's proven tough anywhere he has played, not just in Europe.
He nearly won a couple of Nike events in 1998, and he made it to
the semifinals of the US Amateur at a grueling course (Oak Hill)
last summer. Garcia's performance at the Masters (low amateur at 7
over) and his impressive pro debut at the Spanish Open (67-73)
began with birdies on three of his first four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Like his idols, Seve Ballesteros and Olazabal, Garcia has a feel
for the short game that you cannot teach. Unlike his idols, Garcia
can hit it into the next ZIP code without trampling through woods.
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia, unlike James, is someone the captain would probably
want to play.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Charlie Lanzetta is the head professional at Rockland Golf
Course and a senior rules official with the PGA of America. At last
week's PGA Seniors Championship, Lanzetta had the unhappy task of
approaching John Bland after the final round. Bland had just shot
71 to finish at 7-under 281, good enough to tie for seventh.
``John, can I ask you about the 11th hole?'' asked Lanzetta. As
Bland related the sequence of shots, Lanzetta cringed. So, too, did
Bland, for the South African realized he had goofed. Big time.
Bland had hit his second shot into a hazard guarding the green and
after searching unsuccesfully, he took a drop and played his fourth
shot onto the green. Then he found his original ball and played
that one through, recording that as his score. Chalk it up as
another serious example of a player not knowing the rules _ or at
least drawing a blank when it comes to exercising judgment. Once
you put another ball in play, you cannot play the original. Credit
Bland for at least owning up to the gaffe. ``My fault,'' he said.
``I know better.'' When told it was a very costly ruling, Lanzetta
held up his hands and said, ``I don't want to know, don't tell
me,'' and walked away. Despite what some players may think, rules
officials do not enjoy this part of the job. For the record, the
mistake cost Bland $52,000.

<P>
   If you caddie on the PGA Tour, be advised not to make travel
plans too far in advance. Certainly, this has been the season of
breakups, starting with Tiger Woods's firing of Mike ``Fluff''
Cowan. Next, Mark O'Meara canned longtime caddie Jeff Higginbotham,
and that was followed by the unsettling episode at the MCI Classic
at Hilton Head, S.C., last week when Parnevik released Lorne
Duncan. What is bothersome about the latest move is that it came on
the heels of Parnevik's disqualification at Harbour Town amid
reports that he blamed Duncan. A spectator reported that he saw
Parnevik remove his glove and use it to wipe his line on the green,
which is a violation. An official approached Parnevik, who said he
couldn't remember doing that, but Duncan confirmed it had happened.
Parnevik, who would have missed the cut anyway, was immediately
DQ'd for signing an incorrect scorecard and Duncan was quickly
fired. After shooting 65 Thursday to take the lead at the Greater
Greensboro Chrysler Classic, Parnevik denied that he had fired
Duncan for that reason, though his explanation rang hollow.
``Sometimes, even though you're very good friends with someone,
it's better to just part,'' Parnevik told reporters. ``You're
always looking for a change.'' Even if the change means punishing
an honest man . . . So who is carrying for Parnevik at Greensboro?
Lance Ten Broeck, who has been on and off the Tour for about the
past 100 years, it seems. Parnevik and Ten Broeck are good friends
. . . Don't be alarmed if you don't see Cowan with Jim Furyk at
Greensboro. When they agreed to a partnership just before the
Masters, Cowan informed Furyk that he had already planned a
vacation to Scotland. Furyk's caddie at Greensboro is Jeff Manson,
an old friend from college . . . Then there's Jeff Maggert, who
gave some time off to his regular caddie, Brian Sullivan, and did
what could be considered a very dangerous thing: He hired his
girlfriend, Michelle Austin, to carry for him at Greensboro . . .
And who says Faldo doesn't have a heart? When he discovered that
his caddie, Fanny Sunesson, had a sore back, Faldo jumped into
action. No, he didn't volunteer to lug the bag himself. He ordered
a lighter bag, one with a pop-up stand; it was delivered in time
for this week's Spanish Open. Now, if he could only cut down five
or six shots a round to lighten her workday . . . His swing has
always been a curious one, but after winning the PGA Seniors
Championship last week, Allen Doyle knows he'll be asked about it
even more, and most in the media will fall back on the story line
that he's a former hockey player with a slapshot golf swing. ``I
should have brought a damn hockey helmet and put it on coming down
the 18th hole,'' said Doyle after his major triumph. ``Then I'd
really be known for something.'' . . . He shows up to socialize,
see some old friends, and get in two rounds of golf. That's why
Freddie Haas attends the PGA Seniors Championship. Last week, he
opened with a 95 (ouch), but came back to shoot his age _ 83 _ at
PGA National's Champions Course in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. ``I
felt like 83,'' said Haas after 36 holes on a grueling course.
``Most of the time I feel 75, except on this course. When we go to
other courses I would have broken 80.''

<P>
   Some would say that the first taste of serious local competition
takes place May 3-4 with MGA State Four-ball qualifying, but it
would be a gross oversight to ignore the recent Seagulls Tournament
at Hyannisport. The annual event was won by the teen-age stars from
Dennis Pines, Kenny Lewis and Michael Carbone, who prevailed in a
stellar field. Lewis, it seems, is quite comfortable at
Hyannisport, with victories in last year's Seagulls and the 1997
and 1998 Cape Cod Amateur. He is 18-0 in matches at Hyannisport in
that stretch. In the final, Lewis-Carbone defeated Joe Keller and
Paul Heffernan, 4 and 2. In the semifinals, they beat their Dennis
Pines mentors, Joe Walker and Kevin Carey, 1 up. Brendan Hester and
Chris Tufts teamed for a 64 to win medalist honors.

   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Flyers, as expected, opened the playoffs
without their behemoth team captain, Eric Lindros. A collapsed lung
earlier this month led him to two surgeries within a week and the
need to regenerate nearly half his blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros says he is thinking about a possible second-round
return, which for anyone who has had a severe chest cold _ never
mind a collapsed lung _ sounds like either unbridled optimism or a
death wish. If there had been a team flight after the Flyers' game
that night in Nashville, Lindros has told friends, he likely would
have been aboard and might not have been able to make it to a
hospital. As it was, he nearly had to be dragged from his hotel
room, crumpled over in pain, to seek life-saving medical assistance
in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Bruins netminder Eddie Johnston, now scouting the
Bruins-Hurricanes series for the Penguins, recently recalled his
own tap dance with the undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was off to the best start of my career,'' EJ recalled,
thinking back more than 30 years ago. ``I had three shutouts, and
my (goals-against) average was under 1.00. I couldn't have been
playing any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But during warmups one night at the old Olympia in Detroit,
Johnston was dropped by a Bobby Orr slapper. After a brief visit to
a local hospital, he hopped a flight home a couple of days later,
unaware that Orr's shot had fractured his skull. He believes the
flight came close to killing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in tough shape when I came off the plane,'' recalled
Johnston, a noted workhorse in his day, an era when injury was a
badge of honor, stitches were military-like stripes of honor. ``A
friend was at the airport to pick me up, and he didn't even
recognize me. I was a mess. Luckily, he took me right to the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnston, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital
quickly diagnosed that he had a blood clot in his head, and surgery
was avoided only when, after 10 days, medication helped dissolve
the clot. His hospital stay lasted nearly six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been out sooner than that,'' recalled Johnston.
``But some of the guys, (Phil) Esposito, (Gerry) Cheevers, came in
to see me one day and I got all messed up again. I don't know what
happened, I got excited or something. Whatever it was, I needed two
more weeks to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different back then. A guy got a concussion, came back
to the bench looking goofy, didn't know where he was, and just took
a seat. He kept playing. The next day, he didn't know what
happened, couldn't remember anything, but that's just the way it
was _ no one thought anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through Johnston's hospital stay, Hall of Fame netminder
Glenn Hall (in the Blues net in '70 when Orr scored the Cup winner)
stopped in for a visit. Seeing his pal in the hospital bed gave
Hall reason to reconsider the way he was doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a mask on that night,'' said Johnston, ``and he never
took it off.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The betting around Los Angeles is that Kings general manager
Dave Taylor, who canned Larry Robinson as head coach last week,
will plant a familiar face behind the bench. If so, that probably
would give ex-Bruins coach Butch Goring, once a key King, the edge.
Other names in the mix: Dave Lewis (two Cup rings as Scotty
Bowman's understudy in Detroit) and Ted Nolan, last seen getting
the hook in Buffalo after winning Coach of the Year honors. Keep in
mind, if the 'Canes don't make it out of the first round vs. the
Bruins, or don't make a respectable show of it, Nolan's name could
pop up as a possible replacement for Paul Maurice. Nolan was once a
Whalers assistant . . . Someone must have put too much spice in
Owen Nolan's tomato juice. Once thought to be an Avalanche
cornerstone, drafted first overall in '90 when the franchise was in
Quebec, the San Jose right wing fired off a couple of beauts last
week as their playoff series approached. Nolan: ``We definitely
have more character on this team. (The Avalanche) have two solid
lines, maybe the top two lines in the league. After that they don't
have anything.'' On one Patrick Roy: ``He's either unbeatable or
things just go flying by. He's either on top of his game or lets in
the weakest goals.'' Nothing like needlessly firing up the enemy .
. . Kudos to the Avalanche, Sharks, and the NHL front office for
postponing the start of the series last week, following the horror
in Littleton, Colo. For those who missed it: The series was
switched to a 2-3-1-1 format, opening in San Jose rather than
Denver. Avalanche GM Pierre Lacroix lives only a half-mile from
Columbine High and, in days past, often took strolls to the
schoolyard with his wife in the evening . . . Just as the season
was ending, Nashville came to terms with its prized draft pick,
center David Legwand, the No. 2 pick overall in last year's draft.
The deal is worth just short of $3 million over three years, as
allowed by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, but he could bank
$8.9 million if he hits all of the incentives. He played in
Nashville's last game of the season. ``You watch the way he
plays,'' said Nashville coach Barry Trotz, ``it looks like he's
floating around the ice. Once he gets stronger . . .''

   Don't be surprised if the Lords of the Boards consider getting
the season off to an earlier start. Today's player is typically in
exceptional shape and doesn't need three weeks of training and
exhibition games. A Sept. 30 start would guarantee that Game 7 in a
Cup final wouldn't go past June 9 or 10. Game 7 could be June 19
this year, which is less than a week before the June 25 expansion
draft to stock Atlanta . . . Chicago center Alexei Zhamnov, among
those Blackhawks who came to life (25 points over 18 games) after
Dirk Graham got canned as head coach, will switch from No. 36 to
No. 13 next season. It will be his third number since going to
Chicago in the Jeremy Roenick swap. Question is, no matter what
number he's wearing, will he ever show up as a No. 1 center? Look
for head coach Lorne Molleken to try career center Doug Gilmour as
one of Zhamnov's wingers next season . . . The final tally in D.C.:
The Capitals lost no fewer than 511 man-games to injury. Said
another way, that's akin to having six guys missing from the lineup
every game. The injuries, said coach Ron Wilson, ``poisoned our
season.'' After making it to the finals last spring, the Capitals
now are faced with a huge rebuilding project, similar to the youth
movement the Bruins embarked on two years ago . . . Not everyone is
convinced that Mario Lemieux's group has the money to carry the
Penguins, but the league believes the group is fiscally viable. The
NHL needs to know soon, if only for the sake of scheduling, whether
the Penguins are going to be in Pittsburgh next year, a matter
that, in part, rests with US bankruptcy court. The court already
has prohibited Roger Marino from shopping around for a possible
out-of-town landing spot for his debt-ridden club . . . Islanders
netminder Wade Flaherty made his way into the trivia books with
Wayne Gretzky's retirement. He gave up the Great One's final goal.
``I guess if your name is down as a trivia answer,'' mused
Flaherty, ``that's the name you want beside it.'' Former Vancouver
netminder Glen Hanlon let up Gretzky's first NHL goal. ``Someone
had to get him on his way,'' said Hanlon . . . A couple of weeks
before making up his mind to retire, Gretzky made a point of noting
to John Davidson, his pal on the Rangers' broadcast team, that next
season's training camp will start before Labor Day. Initially, J.D.
took that as a positive sign that No. 99 would return. In
reflection, he saw it was just part of the thinking that went into
Gretzky's decision-making process . . . Walter Gretzky, Wayne's
dad, hung outside the Ranger dressing room prior to his son's last
game. Now retired at age 60, the senior Gretzky keeps busy in
Brantford, Ontario, helping to coach a 12-year-old traveling team.
``A lot of times, coaches on the other clubs ask if I'll say a few
words to their kids,'' said Walter. ``I always tell them the same
three things: 1. listen to your coaches; 2. play as hard as you
can, because then, no matter what, no one can criticize what you
did out there _ because you did your best; 3. enjoy yourself, have
fun . . . because if you're not having fun then you're not going to
get better.''

   Word around campus is that North Dakota coach Dean Blais decided
to stay put for a four-year deal worth upwards of $1 million, which
included annual pay of $150,000 and the university paying off his
mortgage . . . On the subject of debt load, don't you love it when
arena owners who are also club owners (like here in the Hub)
dismiss the revenue from luxury box sales, lamenting that those
dollars go directly to the bank to pay off the arena mortgage?
Eventually, the building gets paid off, and it's the arena/club
owner who is left holding that equity. Ignoring that revenue would
be like the Average Joe telling the IRS each year that a huge chunk
of his annual pay should be disregarded because that money went to
pay a mortgage. No wonder the Players' Association rolls its eyes
every time players and owners get around to money talk . . . When
Ranger captain Brian Leetch took center ice last Sunday in the
Gretzky ceremonies, the sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden
bellowed a thunderous, ``Sign him! Sign him!'' As of July 1, the
31-year-old Leetch is an unrestricted free agent, and New York Post
hockey columnist Larry Brooks recently mused that the Bruins might
take a run at the ex-BC Eagle. Seems like a real stretch, because
when the smoke clears, Leetch's deal figures to be worth $8
million-$10 million a year. The Bruins still smart from the harsh
reality of paying old guys big bucks back in the Kevin Stevens-Adam
Oates era and they're not about to go down that path again . . .
Montreal assistant coach Dave King has a two-year offer on the
table to coach Jokerit, the elite Finnish club in Helsinki where
the likes of Jari Kurri and Teemu Selanne spent their youth. ``I'm
not coaching there unless Jari and Teemu are playing there,'' joked
King. If King leaves the Habs, look for ex-Bruins coach Rick
Bowness to take his spot in Montreal. Alain Vigneault, the Habs'
head coach, was an assistant in Ottawa when Bowness was head coach
. . . In Games 1 and 2 of the Senators-Sabres series, both won by
Buffalo, Sabres netminder Dominik Hasek stopped 85 of 88 shots for
an eye-popping .966 save percentage. And after missing Game 1 of
the series with the lingering effects of a concussion, ex-Bruin Joe
Juneau collected a pair of assists in Buffalo's 3-2 win in overtime
Friday night . . . Mike Smith, the associate GM in Toronto, still
hasn't heard what Ken Dryden, the Leafs' president and GM, has
planned for him next season. Smith's deal is up when the season
ends, and with jobs such as the Minnesota Wild front office
available, he'll have to move promptly if Dryden isn't quick to
extend his deal.

NEW YORK CIRCULAR FILE A NOT-SO-MERRY GO-ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's a recent but nevertheless rich history of
corporate intrigue in the New York Knicks organization. This past
week's dismissal of Ernie Grunfeld was simply the latest chapter.
If Claude Rains were still around, he'd say he was shocked,
shocked, to see such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches come and go. General managers come and go, albeit at a
less rapid clip. Coaches and general managers go at each other in
New York _ and then they go, or at least they have in the last
dozen years. That's why the next hire Dave Checketts makes has to
be someone who not only has the cachet, but also can handle both
jobs. (M.L. Carr is available.)
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Grunfeld and Jeff Van Gundy are good, earnest
men who simply were not entirely sympatico. The most visible source
of their contretemps probably was the Charles Oakley-Marcus Camby
trade, but it has to be deeper than that. One is now gone and the
other is likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of teams have coaches who don't like their general manager
or vice versa. George Karl was just fined $25,000 for his incessant
trashing of Seattle GM Wally Walker. Jerry West was happy to show
Pat Riley the door when Riley's act began to wear thin in Los
Angeles. Chris Ford made no secret of his total disillusionment
with Carr, even though he never publicly said a word.
</P>
<P>
   Most general managers, however, seem to stick around. Witness
Elgin Baylor and Wes Unseld, two terrific players whose
off-the-court records are lamentable. Willis Reed survived for
years in New Jersey with a mediocre record. He's still there,
albeit without the power he once wielded.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks, it seems, have had more than their share of
dirty laundry airings; it is ever thus in the Big Apple. In the
last 12 years, there have been four public, bitter fights between
the Knicks coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the coach was Hubie Brown. He and GM Dave DeBusschere
were always at each other's throats and their mutual distrust and
contempt was an open secret. Hubie, of course, wanted to trade
every guy on the roster, was rarely happy, and was fond of saying,
``Potential will get you fired.'' DeBusschere eventually fell in
January 1986 after four forgettable years. His successor, the
hapless Scotty Stirling, lasted only a year and change.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1986-87 season, Stirling agreed to exchange the
Knicks' No. 1 pick in 1987 for Seattle's No. 1 pick and Gerald
Henderson. Brown, whose team was going down the tubes and certain
to get a high pick, went ballistic. Brown also was dismissed three
weeks later after starting out 4-12.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the designated Sonics pick (which belonged to
Milwaukee) turned out to be No. 18, which was used to select Mark
Jackson, who went on to become Rookie of the Year. Seattle drafted
Scottie Pippen with New York's pick in a prearranged deal with the
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Stirling was history in May 1987, and that led to the next big
dust-up. The Madison Square Garden suits wanted Jimmy Rodgers as
the coach, but Boston wouldn't let him go without compensation. So
the Knicks turned to Rick Pitino, who was hired even though general
manager Al Bianchi was not the man who made the choice. There
almost instantly was friction between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, an old-schooler, was a frequent critic of Pitino's
system, saying it was great for the regular season but would get
exposed in the playoffs. He was correct. Pitino felt his system did
work _ and that he couldn't work with someone who openly questioned
it. He was correct. He left for Kentucky after two years. Bianchi
eventually got buddy John MacLeod into New York, but both soon
flamed out.
</P>
<P>
   The last big blowup, while technically not a fight between coach
and general manager, was nevertheless a classic power struggle.
Riley wanted more power. Checketts wanted things to remain as they
were. The two, once pals, turned into mortal enemies when Riley
bolted for Miami. Grunfeld was technically the general manager, and
this was before Checketts started to spread himself so thin that he
now worries about things like ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks haven't been the same since. Since Riley left, New
York has had three second-place finishes and has not gotten past
the second round of the playoffs. The Knicks will be lucky to even
make the playoffs this year, a staggering thought for a team with a
$68 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The next guy will inherit a train wreck. The Knicks are old,
capped out, and have few desirable players who aren't dramatically
overpaid. Things may actually get worse before they get better.
Whoever the next guy is, he must get along with the boss. With
Checketts's hand in so many pies, the new guy would be wise to look
in the mirror when he looks for his boss.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   More than a few people in Cleveland are watching the Celtics'
late-season slide with great interest. While the Cavs haven't
announced officially that they will take Boston's pick in this
year's draft, it's all but a done deal with the Celtics'
plummeting. ``I would say yes,'' Cavs GM Wayne Embry said this past
week when asked if he'd take the pick if things continued along
these lines. Folks in Cleveland feel they got the better of the
Andrew Declercq-Vitaly Potapenko deal. First, they basically
exchanged one backup center for another. The one they got may not
be as talented, but he's the perfect backup and he's cheap by NBA
standards. They also got out of adding another fat contract to the
mix. ``Affordability was a key for us,'' Embry said. ``We've got
two big ones already (Shawn Kemp and Zydrunas Ilgauskas) and some
more ahead.'' Now, you add a top six pick and it makes it look like
larceny from Cleveland's point of view. The Celtics, meanwhile,
undeniably have a better presence in the middle. Time will tell on
the pick. This will be the first time since 1979 that the Celtics
will not have a first-round pick (unless they trade for one). The
only other team with a longer track record of having a
first-rounder each year is Sacramento, which has had one every year
since 1972 . . . Observation of Patrick May, age 10, upon getting a
copy of the Celtics' team picture last Wednesday at the
76ers-Celtics game: ``They left out the guy with the best name
(Popeye Jones) and the best hair (Pervis Ellison).'' We know why
Pervis wasn't there; he's been diligently rehabbing in Washington
all season. But where was Popeye? . . . If, as expected, Paul Silas
has the ``interim'' tag removed from his job description, it will
mean that he has gone 16 years between official gigs. (He coached
the Clippers from 1980-83.) We checked and couldn't find anyone who
waited longer between head jobs, with one interesting exception:
Silas's last boss in Charlotte: Dave Cowens. You may recall, though
most of us would like to forget, that Cowens was the Celtics'
player coach for the final 68 games of the 1978-79 season. He
resurfaced in Charlotte in 1996, a stretch of 17 years between head
jobs. The only other ones who come even close are the late, great
Red Holzman, and the equally great Bill Russell. Holzman left the
Hawks in 1957 and didn't surface again until he took over the
Knicks in 1967. Russell left Seattle in 1977 and returned 10 years
later for a brief, ill-advised, and wildly unsuccessful stint in
Sacramento. Pitino went eight years between NBA jobs . . . The
Players Association will hold its nose as it moves to stop the
ridiculous $25,000 fine levied on Latrell Sprewell for remarks made
by his agent. First, like everyone else, they've had it with
Sprewell. Second, Sprewell's new agent, Bob Gist, isn't thought of
highly in the union offices; they feel he's a bit of a hanger-on.
But there's a much larger issue at work. ``This is unprecedented,''
said union attorney Ron Klempner. ``It's a lot more than just the
fine.'' The union just got through resolving grievances for two
players (Pooh Richardson, Stanley Roberts) who were fined for
ripping their coach. But to fine a player for something his agent
said? Most players would be broke if that were standard procedure.
``We've never had anything like this before,'' Klempner said. ``The
player disavowed the remarks unequivocally. I would hope the Knicks
would work it out themselves.'' The union also is going to closely
watch the Celtics' ``voluntary'' summer workouts and see whether
players who show up do so ``voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyus Edney was named MVP of the recent European Final Four in
Munich after leading his team (Zalgiris Kaunas) to an 82-74 victory
over Kinder Bologna. In 35 minutes, Edney had 14 points, 6
rebounds, 6 assists, and a steal. Why can't the Celtics get guys
like that? Zalgiris, which is sponsored by Lithuanian stars Arvydas
Sabonis and Sarunas Marciulionis, qualifies for the McDonald's Cup
next October in Milan . . . The battle has begun. The Raptors sent
out a video touting Vince Carter for Rookie of the Year. Don't they
know that writers are immune from such blatant bribery attempts?
(Next time, make it a coffee cup, T-shirt, or mouse pad, guys.) Via
faxes to writers, agent Mark Bartlestein is promoting client Randy
Brown for Most Improved Player . . . Amazing to see Rick Mahorn not
only play, but play important minutes last week against the
Celtics. He's 40 years old. He said he thought the Celtics might
have interest in him this year, but there were no calls. That's a
shame. He would be a perfect fit on the Celtics, although he did
admit that he'd have trouble adjusting to Pitino's frantic coaching
style. Mahorn also is reminded of how old he is every time he sees
teammate Allen Iverson. He went to high school with Iverson's
parents.

TIME FOR CARROLL TO BECOME AUTHORITY FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The scene looked the way it's supposed to
look.
</P>
<P>
   There was Pete Carroll huddled with Bob Kraft and Bobby Grier in
the war room on draft day, exposed to ESPN cameras, apparently
fighting for the Patriots to select Ohio State linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer with the 28th pick in the first round instead of
filling another need, running back.
</P>
<P>
   If Carroll is indeed fighting for what he wants and needs to
lead the Patriots out of their two-year slide, then he's doing the
right thing. Kudos to Grier and Kraft if they went along with their
coach's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   It must be, after all, Carroll's team. It can't be Bobby Grier's
team. It can't be Bob Kraft's team.
</P>
<P>
   It will be, after all, Carroll's neck on the line if the players
others have recommended falter next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this outward show of authority by Carroll _ and the
toughness he has shown with players not attending the strength and
conditioning program _ happens more than we think it does, but it
appears to have happened all too little the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was a young coach getting his second chance at
the big time, put in an absolute no-win situation replacing Bill
Parcells. There was reason for him to stay within the parameters of
the system Kraft created: personnel director Grier ran the show and
Andy Wasynczuk was in charge of the money, salary caps, etc.
Carroll's job was to coach the players Grier got for him.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe what we're seeing is not what is happening. Maybe
Carroll is still coaching Grier's players. The Patriots will tell
you it's a committee decision every time they draft a player or
sign a free agent. That may be true, but it's also evident that
Carroll never wanted to lose his starting center (Dave Wohlabaugh)
and his starting weak-side linebacker (Todd Collins). And as much
as he spoke of Tedy Bruschi being able to fill in for Collins and
Heath Irwin for Wohlabaugh, draft day proved that really wasn't the
case. The Patriots needed to draft Damien Woody, and Carroll knew
he needed Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   With the coach entering his very critical third year, management
needs to empower Carroll. Just letting him stay on one more year is
not enough. If they don't let the coach have a major say in
personnel, letting Parcells go to the enemy will look even worse in
time.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll needs to work with players he's comfortable coaching,
hire and fire his own staff, and put together his program, not
someone else's. He needs to operate in his own style.
</P>
<P>
   He can no longer afford ``evaluations'' of his performance,
especially by his own players. That fiasco at the end of last
season showed a lack of respect from management.
</P>
<P>
   Some who left the organization felt that Carroll was not acting
like a coach who had a guaranteed five-year deal. If he didn't, one
could see why Carroll would be handcuffed. After all, take the
guarantee out of Rick Pitino's deal with the Celtics and his power
is taken away and he has no spaghetti sauce to sell. Take the
guarantee out of Pat Burns's deal with the Bruins, and he's going
to do things to please Harry Sinden and Jeremy Jacobs rather than
doing things his way.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee approach is to work in New England, Grier and
Wasynczuk must answer Carroll's calls if they are within reason.
That's the way it is around the league where the committee approach
is successful. When Mike Ditka wanted Ricky Williams and said he'd
be willing to give up all of his draft, Bill Kuharich sprang into
action. When Dennis Green wants something, he gets it. When Mike
Holmgren asked for something in Green Bay, Ron Wolf got it done if
he could. Even in the days when Parcells had to answer to George
Young in New York, Young faithfully executed his coach's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of the committee approach working.
Carroll knows X's and O's as well as anyone. He knows talent. Now,
he needs complete authority and respect to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are telling all who will listen that Terry Glenn
was not involved in trade talks during the draft. The Patriots have
to be very careful about Glenn's confidence level, especially after
Glenn and his agent, Jim Gould, had a big powwow with Carroll last
week concerning a plan to keep Glenn healthy through the season.
Glenn recommended ways to be used in practice that will keep his
legs fresh. Whether Carroll goes along with it is another issue . .
. Troy Brown, who never used to miss offseason workouts, is staying
away this offseason. The receiver, who missed six games with an
ankle sprain and was never right the second half of last season,
isn't pleased that the team has not addressed a contract extension.
Brown may be supplanted from punt-return duties by rookie Kevin
Faulk . . . Not only is the draft itself competitive, but the
aftermath can get nasty, with teams vying for free agent rookies
among the undrafted players. Bonuses last year got up to $40,000,
which is more than what many seventh-round picks get. And every
team likes to claim it found a prize that slipped through the
draft. The Steelers think they got a player who could be Slash II:
South Carolina quarterback Anthony Wright. ``He may be the next
Randall Cunningham,'' said former NFL quarterback John Reaves, who
was Wright's coach at South Carolina two years ago. ``He's got a
great arm. He can throw a ball 70-75 yards on the run.'' . . . Just
a few days before drafting Akili Smith in the first round, the
Bengals called in quarterbacks Jeff Blake, Neil O'Donnell, and Paul
Justin for physicals, an unusual request for this time of year. A
day after Smith was drafted, O'Donnell was cut, and two days later,
Justin was gone. Justin is scheduled to visit with the Washington
Redskins Sunday . . . Carl Pickens is still out there, saying he
will sit out the year rather than play for the Bengals as their
franchise player. Pickens had some interest from the Dolphins, but
they have backed off and signed Tony Martin, who may be on trial
for laundering drug money before the season is over . . . The meat
of Lamont Warren's contract with the Patriots is backloaded. The
first two years of the five-year deal are worth about $1.5 million,
which is about all the Patriots will spend for Warren . . . Ditto
Larry Whigham. While the deal is worth $4 million over four years,
Whigham received a $650,000 signing bonus . . . The veterans are
starting to fall around the league, and this is where the Patriots
could pick up some defensive line help in the coming weeks. The
Colts are talking as though defensive end Al Fontenot could be on
the streets soon. Fontenot makes $900,000 . . . Jevon Kearse, who
is projected by many as a linebacker in the NFL, will start his
career as a defensive end for the Titans. The Titans see him as the
next Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jets seriously considered former Rams quarterback Chris
Miller, who has been out of football three years, and Eric Zeier
(who signed with Tampa Bay) to be their backup before settling on
Scott Zolak. Word is Parcells got a little sick of trying to find
Mr. Perfect for the job and decided to go with the devil he knew.
Zolak is driving up from Florida and should be on Long Island
Tuesday to sign his incentive-laden deal . . . The Patriots would
have loved to take Temple quarterback Shaun King in the third
round, but Tampa scooped him in Round 2 . . . The Patriots are one
of the teams keeping a close eye on Lawrence Phillips in NFL
Europe. Phillips is playing for former Boston College coach Jack
Bicknell in Barcelona. So far, Phillips has run well and has
behaved himself . . . Bill Walsh had questioned backup quarterback
Jim Druckenmiller's arm strength and the decision to take him in
the draft a year ago and had already decided to give the backup job
to Jeff Garcia, the Canadian Football League star QB in the
post-Doug Flutie era. Walsh had tried unsuccessfully to trade
Druckenmiller, and now that is impossible, as Druckenmiller was
charged last week with raping a Virginia Tech coed . . . Once the
Los Angeles Whatchamacallits are named the 32d NFL team, each of
the other 31 will get about $20 million in franchise fees. On top
of $18 million per team when the Browns were born, it's a nice deal
for a little competition and having to go through an expansion
draft to give up players you don't want anyway . . . If Ben
Coates's contract isn't redone by the Patriots, don't be surprised
if he finishes his career in Los Angeles . . . Bobby Ross wanted
Barry Sanders to take part in the Lions' minicamp this weekend, but
Sanders, a 10-time Pro Bowler, stayed consistent with his policy of
not attending voluntary workouts . . . If teams value offseason
strength and conditioning programs so much, why don't some of the
colder-climate teams _ New England and Green Bay, for instance _
get together and set up a training site in Florida? Run it from
mid-March through the end of May and see how many players show up.
If a lot do, then the expense is worth it; if not, then close it
up. For years, it has been the teams in warm-weather situations _
Tampa, Miami, Arizona _ who get the best attendance . . . Ricky
Williams is going to be a very high-priced spokesman for Puma,
which is getting back into the sports marketing business with a
bang . . . Look for Irving Fryar to sign with the Oakland Raiders
within a month. Fryar would like to be reunited with Jon Gruden,
who was a coach in Philadelphia when Fryar was there . . . Miami
coach Jimmy Johnson has said he wouldn't be against going into the
season with two rookie running backs. Rob Konrad of Syracuse and
North Andover has an excellent shot at starting at fullback, along
with Mississippi State's J.J. Johnson. A camp full of running backs
could mean the end for Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Stanley Pritchard,
Roosevelt Potts, Tyrone Wheatley, and perhaps even John Avery . . .
Former Patriots offensive coordinator Larry Kennan said one of the
most common concerns scouts had in Tim Couch's workouts was how he
threw the ball out of the shotgun because Couch was strictly a
drop-back guy at Kentucky. Couch more than answered those questions
. . . Grey Ruegamer was the second center taken in the draft by the
Dolphins, in the third round. The Arizona State tough guy has a
little Conrad Dobler in him. In fact, he's so tough his mother told
the Miami Herald that he castrated sheep on his friend's farm with
his teeth. Ruegamer allegedly helped in the castration of 800 sheep
over a three-day period last May. This guy is playing alongside
Kevin Gogan? It might be worth the price of admission to see Chad
Eaton vs. Ruegamer in those Dolphins-Patriots games.

BAFFERT CAN FILL IN WITH EITHER FILLY 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Silverbulletday or Excellent Meeting? Excellent Meeting
or Silverbulletday? What's trainer Bob Baffert to do?
</P>
<P>
   Baffert not only has the top two 3-year-old colts in General
Challenge and Prime Timber _ co-favorites at 7-1 to win Saturday's
Kentucky Derby in the advance wagering sponsored by Churchill Downs
_ but also the top two 3-year-old fillies mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling the long road to the Derby, Baffert has wandered
all over the place when it comes to the fillies. First, he said he
would run neither filly in the Derby if his colts came through.
Then, he pointed Excellent Meeting toward Friday's Kentucky Oaks,
which left the question open about the Derby chances of
Silverbulletday, who won the Eclipse Award as the top 2-year-old
filly of 1998. Then, he began talking about how small
Silverbulletday is, and, all of sudden, Excellent Meeting became a
Derby candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Baffert can do what he wants. The two fillies lead all
of the colts in money earned in graded stakes, which determines
entry into the Derby (Silverbulletday with $1,721,170 and Excellent
Meeting with $1,164,224). He knows he needs only one of them to win
the prestigious Oaks; to run them both would be classic overkill.
</P>
<P>
   The egos of owners may come into play here. Silverbulletday is
owned by Mike Pegram, who also owns Real Quiet, last year's Derby
winner, and Excellent Meeting is owned by the Golden Eagle Farm of
John and Betty Mabee, who also own General Challenge. Pegram has
said that Silverbulletday belongs in the Oaks, but she has been
working sensationally at Churchill, and Pegram loves publicity. So,
who knows? The Mabees sold Worldly Manner, who was trained by
Baffert, to Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum of Dubai for $5 million when
Worldly Manner was a 2-year-old. Worldly Manner is now 9-1 in early
wagering to win the Derby, but the Mabees could form a powerful
entry with their colt and filly, who is the only one to defeat
Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who likes to act a little wacky at times, surprised
trainer Nick Zito at Churchill last Monday when he suggested that
Zito send Wood Memorial winner Adonis, a Derby hopeful, out to work
with Excellent Meeting. Thoroughbreds work with members of their
own stable, they don't fraternize with the enemy. Zito was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him they don't pay off in the morning,'' said Zito.
``He was serious. He said, `Let's work them together. I want to see
if I have a Derby horse.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting went out and blazed 5 furlongs in :59 4/5,
while Adonis went the same distance on his own in 1:04 1/5. Using
the ancient standard that a fifth of a second equals 1 length,
that's a difference of 22 lengths. Adonis was only out for an
airing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted him to get a feel for the track and make sure
he came out of the Wood OK,'' said Zito. But it was an audition for
Excellent Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that Adonis didn't go with her,'' said
Baffert. ``She did it real easy. The mile and one-quarter (the
Derby distance, while the Oaks is a mile and one-eighth) with
Silverbulletday might stretch her a little bit, but Excellent
Meeting, well, she was really good today. I have to see what
develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baffert's colts, who ran 1-2 in the Santa Anita
Derby, with General Challenge defeating Prime Timber, are also
doing great at Churchill. On Thursday, General Challenge, whose
sire, General Meeting, is also the sire of Excellent Meeting, went
6 furlongs in 1:12, while Prime Timber went 1:12 3/5.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner and Aljabr, who will represent the Godolphin
Stable of Sheik Mohammed in the Derby, cleared quarantine and got
their first feel of the Churchill surface Thursday, as each took a
casual gallop of 1 1/4 miles over the oval. ``They both went very
well,'' said Tom Albertrani, assistant to head trainer Saeed bin
Suroor. ``They went out a little bit on their toes, but they did
better than expected for the first day. I'm sure that, in another
day, they will be more relaxed.'' . . . Trainer Elliott Walden, who
will saddle Blue Grass winner Menifee in the Derby (8-1 in the
advance betting), hopes to have Ecton Park start, too. Ecton Park,
who has been working with the addition of blinkers, has $100,400 in
graded earnings but needs a couple of defections to get into the
projected field, which is limited to 20. If Ecton Park, a son of
Forty Niner, does start, he will be ridden by Robbie Davis, ``If he
doesn't get in, we'll probably go in the Illinois Derby (May 8),''
said Walden . . . Trainer D. Wayne Lukas announced that Chris
Antley, who has overcome personal problems to begin riding again
this year, will handle Lexington Stakes winner Charismatic in the
Derby. Antley won the 1991 Derby aboard Strike the Gold, who was
trained by Zito. Charismatic will give Lukas two entrants, with Cat
Thief considered the stronger of the two.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Downs will open its gates at 10:30 a.m. on Derby Day,
with the simulcast of the first race from Churchill at 11:30, and
the Derby set for 5:37 p.m. Suffolk will run its first live race at
noon. With a paid admission, patrons will receive a souvenir Derby
glass and a pass valid for the month of May. Suffolk will accept
advance Derby wagers starting Friday . . . K One King, who was
purchased for $1.7 million by Allen Paulson so his wife, Madeline,
could run a horse in the Derby, worked five panels in 1:02 at
Churchill Monday under Alex Solis. ``He relaxed the first part of
it, and then picked it up around the turn,'' said Solis. ``I was
impressed with him.'' . . . Epic Honor, fourth in the Lexington,
has $180,000 in graded earnings and could have qualified for the
Derby, but his connections have sensibly decided to take him to the
Illinois Derby.

CLIPPERS BEAT GRIZZLIES
</HEADLINE>

By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the NBA equivalent of high noon between computer nerds.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Saturday's official starting time was more like 8 p.m. -
the extra half hour had been tacked on in case any basketball fans
who were avoiding the Sports Arena decided to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, at one end of the street, sporting a pocket protector
autographed by Bill Gates, we introduce the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   And ... staring back from the home end of the street through
eyeglasses held together by masking tape ... give it up for the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams parked in the lottery. The loser would be sitting in
the driver's seat for the homestretch of the NBA Draft derby and
the opportunity to select yet another college prospect who - at
best - may be the poor man's answer to Class of '97 valedictorian
Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers - seemingly unconcerned with courting lottery
Ping-Pong ball disaster - recovered from a catnap at the start of
the second half, and defeated Vancouver, 105-96, in front of 13,493
on ``ROTC Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I hit the wall,'' said Clippers forward Maurice
Taylor, who added a few bricks (he missed 15 of 24 field-goal
attempts), but finished with a team-high 25 points. ``I was dead
tired, but coach got on us, told us we had to fight for this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had enough haymakers left to knock down eight
fourth-quarter points, as the Clippers (9-35) earned the decision
in the fifth game for each team over a seven-night span. His
driving layup with 4:44 left to play but the Clips up for good at
95-93, and dropped the Grizzlies to 8-37.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we came on in the fourth quarter showed that we really
wanted this game,'' Taylor said following the Clippers' sixth win
in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Just call it draft dodging.
</P>
<P>
   A truly madhouse ride to the rescue was provided by Clipper
forward Rodney Rogers. The Clippers' swing forward escaped from the
bench to score a season-high 19 points and collect seven rebounds.
He also provided enough defensive sinew to slow down Vancouver star
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, whose game-high 27 points included just seven
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to always be ready to play,'' said Rogers, whose
minutes have been trimmed by the meteoric rise of forwards Maurice
Taylor and Tyrone Nesby. ``From the first guy, to the last guy ...
you never know when you're going to be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' heroics included the second of back-to-back 3-point
flips that pulled the Clippers even at 93 with 5:15 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do something,'' he said. ``We had blown the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, there's a stunner.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers usually play hard and mean well, but their 58-52
halftime lead completely vanished in about two-and-half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers bailed out his pals, while backup point guard Troy Hudson
filled in for Sherman Douglas, who was chugging around the court on
fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson had just enough in his playmaking tank to get everyone
home safely.

WOOD WINS AT IRWINDALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Persistence finally paid off for Timmy Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The Chino Hills resident, who had been involved in some untimely
incidents during his first two races at Irwindale Speedway, more
then made up for it by winning the NASCAR Super Late Model feature
before 2,500 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Jim Smith in Legends, North Hills T.K.
Karvasek in Super Stock and Troy Decuir in Mini-Stockars.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who started on the pole, is the fourth different winner in
Super Late Model, joining Winston West regular Brendan Gaughan,
Greg Pursley and track points-leader Rod Johnson of Chatsworth. It
felt great, especially after crashing two weeks ago and having a
tire go flat (last week), said Wood, who held off second-place
Brian Barron by .163 seconds at the stripe. We felt if we could
just get some luck we had the car to win.
</P>
<P>
   It was close for Wood, who led all 50 laps of the feature race,
which included 16 caution laps that effected seven cars.
</P>
<P>
   Barron, who at one point slipped several car lengths behind
Wood, made several challenges over the final four laps. He got
within the Wood's back bumper but could never get around, failing
on his final attempt coming off turn four on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   He put a lot of heat on me, Wood said. My tires were starting to
go away. I was concerned. I'm just glad we were able to hold him
off.
</P>
<P>
   Duarte's Dennis Arena, who began the race in fifth place in the
track's point standings, finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Decuir had a much easier time, winning the 20-lap Mini-Stockar
feature by 3.557 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Decuir, who started third, grabbed the lead on Lap 5 and
stretched his advantage to nearly 500 feet before coasting well
ahead of Bory Molina and Rudy Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The Legends feature was one of the most exciting races of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-lap event featured four lead changes, including two over
the final five laps.
</P>
<P>
   Escondido's Seth Hicks, who finished fourth, controlled the race
from the start. He took the lead on Lap 3 and held the advantage
until lap 18.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside's Randy Anderson, who started eighth, drove to the
inside of Hicks on turn 3 and outraced him to the start-finish line
for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was unable to hold off Smith, however.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who started second, slipped by Anderson on the back
stretch of Lap 22 before holding off Andderson by .474 seconds at
the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Schug, who won the trophy dash, was third.

PADRES' POWER BEATS D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Which team led the major leagues in home runs and
which was barely in double figures?
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were the club hitting the ball out of the yard
with regularity, and the San Diego Padres were not. On Saturday
night, their roles were reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres sent five into the outer reaches of Qualcomm Stadium,
four on first pitches, and coasted to a 7-2 victory over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 61,674, lured in part by free T-shirts
marking the Padres' 1998 National League championship, was the
biggest regular-season draw in Padres history.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, whose five-game winning streak ended, fell to 10-8. The
defending National League champion Padres improved to 8-9. The
teams will wrap up their three-game series at 1 p.m. today. The
Diamondbacks then will travel to Houston, the next stop on their
13-game, four-city trip.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Sanders hit two homers for the Padres, and Tony Gwynn,
Phil Nevin and Greg Myers hit one apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams continued his early season surge for
Arizona, collecting two hits, including his league-leading seventh
of the season and third in three games. He has 306 for his career,
tying Fred Lynn for No. 78 on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has 34 homers, San Diego 16.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Omar Daal was the initial target of the San Diego
sluggers, giving up two home runs. He also walked three in five
innings, throwing 108 pitches. He was charged with the loss, his
first after two victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been spoiled by the way Omar has been pitching,''
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said. ``He got deep in a lot of
counts, and that can force you to give the hitters good pitches to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal acknowledged that his con trol wasn't at the level he
desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was behind in the count to about every hitter,'' he said.
``I only walked three, but I've walked too many this season (13 in
26 innings). I will cut down on those, there's no question about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks lit the board first in the first inning against
right-hander Woody Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Tony Womack singled to right, stole second (his
sixth steal of the season), moved to third on a groundout to second
base by Jay Bell and scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The lead didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who would probably win by a landslide if he decided to
run for mayor, ignited the groundswell of support from the packed
house with a two-out homer off Daal in the first inning to tie it
at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Another two-out homer, this one by Sanders, gave the Padres a
2-1 lead in the third inning. Sanders also hit a homer in the
eighth off right-hander Darren Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks answered in the fourth when third baseman Matt
Williams out-Williamsed right-hander Woody Williams by hitting a
1-1 pitch into the left field stands with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego got help from its former center fielder, Steve Finley,
to take a 3-2 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin singled up the middle with one out, but the ball went
under Finley's glove. It didn't roll too far away, but it was
enough for Nevin to take second. Finley's successor in center for
the Padres, Ruben Rivera, doubled past a diving Matt Williams at
third to bring Nevin home.
</P>
<P>
   Daal held the Padres scoreless in the fifth. Showalter called on
right-hander John Frascatore to start the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin wasted no time with Frascatore, hitting his first pitch
over the fence in center field for a 4-2 lead. Rivera hit his
second double of the night into the right-field corner, and Myers
hit the first pitch from Frascatore for his first homer of the
season and a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres came perilously close to increasing their lead in the
seventh off right-hander Vladimir Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn led off with a double to left-center, giving him 4,001
career total bases. He is the 54th player in major league history
to accomplish that feat. He also has hit safely in 16 of the club's
17 games.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Rivera beat out a slow roller down the third-base
line for his third hit. Nunez walked Myers to load the bases but
got Chris Gomez on a swinging third strike to get out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Dan Miceli entered the game for the Padres in the
top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a one-out single to Kelly Stinnett and a two-out
single to pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn but struck out Tony Womack for
the third out. &QL;

DOAN PLAYS HERO IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You couldn't see him, but he was out there. In fact,
he was smack dab in the middle of the circus at center ice. Buried
beneath flailing arms and waving sticks, he was in the epicenter of
the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Doan couldn't believe it. Probably still can't. Not even
today.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-luck forward for the Coyotes, the kid with the
candy store smile and altar boy personna, will never forget it. And
neither will his teammates, his coaches or another wild Whiteout
crowd at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Doan delivered in the biggest way imaginable Saturday, reaching
into the crease to sweep in a dramatic, game-winning goal in
overtime as the Coyotes beat the St. Louis Blues, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty lucky,'' said Doan, who finished the
regular-season with only six goals. ``The puck just happened to be
sitting there. (Dallas Drake) did all the work and threw it in
front, and I only had to move it an inch to get it over the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to be out there when it happened, though. It's
huge. It's hard to explain the way that you feel when you get the
opportunity to play in overtime and you get the opportunity to
score. It's pretty exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, too, is this Western Conference first-round playoff
series. Had the Blues taken this game as they did the opener, it's
likely that the Coyotes' 12-year streak of first-round exits would
continue. Especially with the team lacking the services of injured
star Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. Game 5 is here next Friday night. The Whiteout will
live at least for that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right back in this thing now,'' Drake said. ``It's all
tied up and anything can happen. They got a split, and now we go to
St. Louis for two games, but home ice doesn't mean a whole heck of
a lot in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant something Saturday. All you had to do was look up into
the rafters of the arena and watch the streamers float down from
upstairs the second Doan scored at the 8:58 mark of OT.
</P>
<P>
   During the celebration at mid-ice, something else came from
upstairs. A phone call from the video review booth. Officials
needed to confirm that Doan wasn't in the crease when he tapped it
past Grant Fuhr. After a few anxious moments on the Coyotes' bench,
referee Dave Jackson signaled goal and the place went nuts again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was good when (Jackson) skated away from the box and
was getting ready to throw his arm out to call it,'' said Coyotes
left wing Keith Tkachuk, who again didn't score but set the tone
with tough-as-nails play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my head down, just praying to hear the whistle,'' Drake
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who were outshot, 34-28, headed straight to St.
Louis after the game for Game 3 at noon today in the Kiel Center.
Game 4 is there Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get reset and refocused,'' said Blues defenseman
Chris Pronger. ``We've got to get ready for (today) because it's
going to come along pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin, who came up with some mammoth saves among
his 30-stop performance _ including a point-blank stop from former
Coyote Mike Eastwood early in overtime _ will be back in nets for
Phoenix today if he's able.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Blues defenseman Al MacInnis almost fractured the
entire bunch himself. His slap shot knocked Juha Ylonen out of the
playoffs with a broken right foot. He had another early goal on the
power play and set up two other scores, giving him two goals and
four assists in two games. But Drake, dropping to the second line
with Ylonen and Doan, countered with a goal and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Teppo Numminen also stepped up with a power-play goal, ending an
0-for-10 skid in the postseason for the maligned, man-advantage
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed something from Game 1 to Game 2, and it did afford
us some more scoring opportunities,'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said of the power play. ``Hopefully, it will get us some more goals
going into Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes thought they had won in regulation. Defenseman Keith
Carney gave them a 3-2 lead with 5:34 left, when he wristed in a
long shot from the high boards, scoring unassisted on the play.
Drake thought it was over. Otherwise, he wouldn't have taunted
Pronger, who has been a 6-foot-6 thorn in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just jabbering,'' Drake said, ``I don't even know what I
said to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake had to eat those words with 3:18 left in regulation as
Pavol Demitra's goal tied the score at 3 and sent it into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to Doan, now Drake can tell Pronger that he'll meet
him in St. Louis, that the series isn't over and the short-handed
Coyotes aren't dead yet. Anything can happen. Roenick, for example,
was seen scarfing down a plate of food with his teammates after
Saturday's game _ and he was supposed to be sucking his meals
through a straw for the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a lot better,'' JR said. ``We all are right about
now.'' &QL;

CAPTAIN COYOTE, TEAMMATES DIG DEEP

<P>
   PHOENIX - They pounded away at the ghosts and, in the end, came
up with a gut-wrenching exorcism in the face of impending failure.
An afternoon when the inner substance of a hockey team came alive,
prevailing over injury and logic and creeping death.
</P>
<P>
   And so a series is saved, and a series is born.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have clawed back into the playoffs. Resisting defeat
because defeat would have meant the end. Winning because there was
no other choice. Led by a man who has moved past the numbers and
finally assumed the mantle of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, exhale. Has any victory been more rewarding?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Keith Tkachuk said. ``This is it. This is the
win we needed, the one we haven't had in this organization. The
game where everyone put aside everything else and did whatever it
takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ever wanted to gauge the maturity of a hockey team, this
was the moment. An afternoon when they survived another quick
deficit. A second period when they offered up two shots on goal,
with another bad goal surrendered by Nikolai Khabibulin. An
afternoon when they finally grabbed the lead after 114 minutes of
playoff hockey, only to give it back immediately with alarming
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon when they grinded to victory in spite of their
past.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this doesn't mean that a stigma has been jettisoned
back to Winnipeg. But it does mean that a much-maligned
organization is learning a thing or two about survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug deep,'' Dallas Drake said. ``We dug all the way to our
toes.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ever wanted to gauge the maturity of Tkachuk, if you ever
wanted proof that his new priorities are more reality than
rhetoric, this also was a defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   When the Coyotes left the ice after regulation, they sat in
silence, catching their breath, trying to focus on the moment. Not
a word was said, but when they came back on the ice, the
determination spewed from the captain. Held to one shot on goal
over the first three periods, Tkachuk was everywhere, flying around
the ice, blasting shots at Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still couldn't get one to go in, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No, but he led the way. And everyone else followed. An afternoon
when the ``C'' on his sweater never fit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to explain the feeling out there,'' said Shane
Doan, author of the game winner. ``Every shot, you could feel your
heart pounding. Every time the puck landed on your stick, you felt
like you had a chance. One time, Niki was on his back making a
save. Unbelievably intense. But we just had to have it. And Keith
set the tone for us.''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it by the numbers, but Tkachuk is in the midst
of a wonderful series. The match-up with Chris Pronger is already a
classic, but Pronger has landed in the penalty box three times
while Tkachuk has kept his cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, it probably would've been different,''
Tkachuk said. ``But you get older, you grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Three years ago, the numbers would've mattered to a
scoreless Tkachuk. Now, he understands that it's all about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a force in overtime,'' Keith Carney said. ``He set an
example, and guys followed. And that's just what we need from
Keith.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing how quickly the course of a series can change. For most
of the game, it was evident that the Blues had found a comfort
zone, skating with little fear of the Coyotes, gaining more and
more confidence with each shift. Before Saturday, the Coyotes had
lost four of their last five playoff games at America West Arena,
and the ``Whiteout'' had no effect on the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't ready for the team that took the ice in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the Coyote team we need the rest of the playoffs,''
Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   And now the pressure has shifted. There is a 19-hour turnaround
until Game 3. And a St. Louis team that must regroup with a
36-year-old goalie and two defenseman who logged a combined 77
minutes of ice time on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, they came in here and stole home-ice advantage,''
Drake said. ``But hopefully, we have a little momentum now.''
</P>
<P>
   A little momentum. And a much-needed burst of life. &QL;

NO FINAL COMEBACK FOR ELWAY  
 LAST-MINUTE HEROICS MADE HIM A LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE Schoenfeld  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Art Modell sat on his perch atop Cleveland Stadium
and watched Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway make his life
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the authority on John Elway,'' said Modell, owner of the
Cleveland Browns until moving the franchise to Baltimore in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Modell was there in 1987 when Elway and the Broncos took over on
their 2-yard line, trailing, 20-13, late in regulation of the AFC
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, they were on the 1{-yard line in the mud,'' Modell
said Saturday. ``He takes them 98{ yards to tie the game. He just
killed us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen every quarterback ever produced of note _ Sid
Luckman, Sammy Baugh, Johnny Unitas _ and nobody impressed me as
much as John Elway, especially his ability to come from behind.
He's the best two-minute quarterback I've ever seen. He's the
all-time comeback king.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who directed 47 game-saving drives, decided on Friday to
retire after 16 seasons. A formal announcement will be made early
this week at a news conference in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the 1980s, Elway broke the Browns' hearts with
late comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   His 98-yard, game-tying drive in '86 still is known
affectionately as ``The Drive.'' The Broncos then won in overtime
to advance to Super Bowl XXI.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence, his ability to run out of the pocket, his
ability to see the field was remarkable,'' Modell said. ``It was
third and long, he'd find a way to get that first down. He'd stop
the clock. He'd get everyone in the right position. He had so much
confidence in his ability to move the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, vice president-player personnel director of the
Cardinals, spent three seasons with Elway in Denver from 1993 to
1995. But before that, he competed against him when Ferguson worked
for the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a threat from the day he walked on the (NFL) field,''
Ferguson said. ``It wasn't beating the Broncos. You had to beat
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody (in scouting) used to say, `Is he an Elway-type
player?' That was the ultimate compliment. You were describing the
best. Not many can say they are an Elway-type player.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway finished his career with more victories (148) than any
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted
for 54,882 yards, second only to Miami's Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first quarterback to start five Super Bowls, winning
the last two, including a 34-19 victory over Atlanta last January.
He completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards and a touchdown, earning
the Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take everything in consideration, he's the best to play
the position,'' said New York Giants Coach Jim Fassel, the former
Cardinals offensive coordinator, who coached Elway for two years at
Stanford and then again in Denver from 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had an unbelievable career. I don't know if anyone
went to the Super Bowl more and he won two titles. He has done a
lot for the game and is a great example, a role-model type guy.
That's why I always admired him. His comebacks, durability,
competitiveness, arm strength . . . you put all that package
together with longevity, I think you can build a strong case that
he's the best to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes have ever been more popular in the town in which
they played.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who will be 39 in June, gets about 4,000 letters from
fans each month.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a rookie, Denver newspapers tried to follow him into
a barbershop to photograph him getting sheared. It was big news in
Denver each October what Elway gave out on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver woman once called Elway's secretary and asked if her
husband, who was about Elway's size, could borrow some of his
clothes for their trip to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, Vanessa, worked for John Elway Nissan,'' said
Ferguson of the seven car dealerships in Denver Elway once owned.
``His businesses were so successful. He wasn't afraid to do what it
took to be the best in whatever he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a tremendous honor to be in the same locker room
with him. I lived with his dad (Broncos director of pro scouting
Jack Elway) when I first got to Denver, and I got to know John
personally. He's a great competitor and a fun guy to be around. The
leadership role people wanted from him was not his cup of tea. He
just wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Many forget the Broncos didn't draft Elway. The Baltimore Colts
did, but Elway refused to play there, so the Colts traded him to
Denver for quarterback Mark Herrmann, rookie offensive lineman
Chris Hinton and a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the worst mistakes the Baltimore Colts ever
made, and they know it,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's NFL career didn't start out great. He completed only 1
of 8 passes, was sacked four times and intercepted in his first NFL
game, a season-opening loss at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, a national TV commentator said, ``I don't care
how hard it is to adjust to the NFL, that is pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He led the Broncos to Super Bowls following the 1986, '87 and
'90 seasons, but they were routed each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took so much criticism from the media and others,''
Ferguson said. ``People in Seattle called him, `Mr. Ed,' for his
toothy smile. For him to roll most of that off his shoulders, he's
just a really, really class person.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1997, Elway won a Super Bowl crown in the Broncos'
31-24 victory over the Green Bay Packers, ending a 13-game AFC
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos won again the next year and some thought Elway would
want to return to try to help them become the first team to win
three consecutive Super Bowl crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he decided he needed to spend more time with his wife
and four kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see him go out on top,'' Ferguson said. &QL;

SUNS GRATEFUL DROP-OFF IN TICKET SALES MINIMAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The predictions promised nothing. There would be no
Antonio McDyess. There would be no visit from Michael Jordan. There
would be only echoes and empties. Empty seats. An empty arena. And,
eventually, empty coffers.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't quite worked out that way in the NBA's post-Jordan,
post-lockout, air ball era. In fact, the Suns are surprised _
probably relieved _ that the America West Arena box office hasn't
suddenly turned into a temple of doom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidly, the fallout is less than I thought it would be,''
Suns President Jerry Colangelo said. ``The whole league was
predicting doom and gloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the number of empty seats at America West Arena and
elsewhere are enough to signal an alarm. There is no disaster. But
one looms if complacency is the response to a mere decline.
</P>
<P>
   First, the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns averaged 18,885 in ticket sales through their first 21
home games. For the first time since 1990, they fell 138 short of
averaging a sellout. Their decade-long string was broken on Feb. 9
against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Going into today's game against Houston, six other games fell
short of a sellout _ Cleveland, Vancouver, twice against Dallas and
twice against Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have climbed a couple of spots in attendance rankings
to seventh from ninth last year. Translation: The Suns haven't
slipped as much as the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another important factor. Unlike the National
Football League, the NBA does not include no-shows in the crowd
figure that is at the bottom of box scores each day. That number
simply represents the number of tickets sold. Nonetheless, no-shows
have been evident all season at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo says the no-show count is up about 100 a game from
last season. In the Suns' heyday six years ago, no-shows amounted
to a handful of people, who always could get a premium price for
their tickets on the streets outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The no-show count is important because it indicates the level of
interest. Corporations own many of the season tickets, but if they
can't give them away, the product might have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   For the Suns, there are reasons specific to themselves and the
Valley, as well as to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Here are just a few:
</P>
<P>
   All Suns home games have been televised by Cox, Channel 45 or
Channel 12. Pay-per-view, as we remember it, is dead. Why purchase
a seat in the upper deck if you can watch the game, up close and
personal, from the comfort of your living room couch for free or
for the cost of basic cable?
</P>
<P>
   Competition for the sports dollar never has been so intense with
the Diamondbacks, Cardinals, Coyotes and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape continues to evolve,'' said Colangelo, who added
to the competition with the introduction of the Diamondbacks.
``There is the advent of hockey, but that has really had no impact
on the Suns. That's a cult following, a very loyal and vocal one.
But there's little crossover between NHL and Suns fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball presents another interest, and there's the resurgence
of the Cardinals. But they play eight home games. It's limited.
With the Diamondbacks, there's annual attendance of 3 million.
That's a different factor. The Suns recognize that the competition
is keen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seats themselves, differences have been noticed. In part,
the crowd has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of no-shows,'' said Irving Shuman, who
purchased the first block of season tickets for the franchise's
inaugural season, 1968-69, at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. ``Also, a
lot of people around me are strangers. I think there were some
people who gave up their tickets because they were frustrated by
the greed exhibited by the players and owners during the lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuman wasn't exactly an ardent fan in the season's early weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disenchanted,'' he said. ``I was one of those who
thought that the season shouldn't be played at all. But now, I'm
beginning like what I see. I'm still a basketball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo and the rest of the league are counting on customers
such as Shuman, who said his interest was reignited by the
consistently brilliant play of Suns guard Jason Kidd. A slight
increase in television ratings from last season indicates a loyal
fan base that missed the game during its absence.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, now, is not to turn off those customers with a
ragged style of play. It has bogged down into a half-court,
post-up, stand-around, slam-dunk, two-man game. On some nights,
field goal percentages look like mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo has noticed. He said he already is asking for change
in informal talks with NBA Commissioner David Stern. The old city
game is in need of urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to quicken the game, we need to bring back more
freedom in the open court,'' said Colangelo, a former chairman of
the Competition and Rules Committee, whose suggestions include a
wider lane, more vigilance on the three-second call and a quicker
shot clock. ``Coaches with lesser talented teams are able to keep
scores down with a half-court style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has diminished the beauty of the game. I'm pushing for
immediate change. We don't need to experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The empty seats may provide the evidence. &QL;

D-BACKS DISAPPOINTED IN EARLY ATTENDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While the Diamondbacks have been getting into a good
groove on the field this season, BOB has a touch of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Bank One Ballpark for Arizona's first 10 games of
the 1999 season is off 25 percent from last year's inaugural season
_ or 11,815 fans per game.
</P>
<P>
   The average per game has dropped to 34,370 this year, compared
with 46,185 for the first 10 games last year when BOB and the team
were brand new _ and ticket prices were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dropoff, going into this weekend's games Arizona was
ninth in the major leagues in average attendance per game and sixth
in the National League. Leading the major leagues was the Colorado
Rockies, at 43,021 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance figures are somewhat difficult to compare this early
in the season because of the disparity in the number of home games,
and because some teams may have had more attractive opening
homestands than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been somewhat surprised and disappointed by the numbers
to date,'' said Jerry Colangelo, managing general partner of the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials knew attendance would be off because season-ticket
sales fell by about 9,000 to 27,000 in the wake of a 12 percent
rise in prices. But they hadn't planned on this much of a decline.
</P>
<P>
   Theories explaining the dropoff range from the Cactus League's
banner March to season-ticket prices to school being in session and
the novelty of Major League Baseball wearing off.
</P>
<P>
   The Cactus League drew nearly a million fans this spring, and a
baseball burnout factor may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said no other major league team is in a market that is
exposed to so much baseball in the month leading up to the season.
While Florida has more teams training there overall, they are
scattered around the state. The Valley alone has seven teams for
spring and Tucson three.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo also is disappointed in attendance for games when
Randy Johnson is the starting pitcher. Part of the attraction in
signing Johnson to a lucrative contract was a projected spike in
ticket sales for his games, but that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the smallest crowd in last season's first 10 home games
was 42,876. This season the team has drawn only one crowd over
40,000, and that was on opening day when the announced attendance
was a sellout of 46,929, but empty seats were evident in the upper
deck corners.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise attendance low was set against the Phillies on
Monday, when the announced attendance was 29,704.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson's first outing, against the Los Angeles Dodgers on a
Thursday night, the attendance was announced at 36,105. His second
start, on Tuesday against the Phillies, drew 30,546.
</P>
<P>
   Total attendance for the season so far is off more than 118,000.
That's a lot of $8 beers.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of concessions can't really be blamed for an
attendance decline. Prices remain the same this year as last, and
more items are available. Fans are still free to bring in their own
food and non-alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the paying customers grumble about the ushers and their
supervisors' strict policies around the concourse and attitude
toward fans who might want to just hang out by the railing or in
center field for an inning. But Colangelo and others say those fans
are a tiny part of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Director of Security George Bevard said it's a ``double-edged
sword'' when you have policies that please most fans but not all.
</P>
<P>
   At the Team Shop, the paying customers are still in a buying
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Namberg, vice president of the shops, said business is good
and the sales are way ahead of projections.
</P>
<P>
   Namberg had figured sales would be off about 18 percent this
season because attendance would fall, but total sales haven't
dropped at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we couldn't meet opening day last year, but this
year's opening day was the third biggest retail day we've ever
had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends are as good as last year, but weekdays have been soft
with school still in session.
</P>
<P>
   And Colangelo thinks it will be children and families sitting in
$10 seats who deliver higher attendance figures as school winds
down and the season evolves _ perhaps into the Diamondbacks
contending in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of tickets remaining for games this season are
in the $10 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are going to get better,'' he said. ``The team is
competitive.'' &QL;

KNICKS JOB IS BEST BET FOR JACKSON

<P>
   Nothing was surprising about the demotion last week of  &UR; Ernie
 &UR; Grunfeld from Knicks general manager to a post as assistant to
 &UR; Dave
 &UR; Checketts, president of Madison Square Garden, which controls the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing was curious.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld has made some bad personnel decisions, including the
trade of forward  &UR; Charles Oakley to Toronto, which removed all the
toughness from the once-feared Knicks. But why not wait until the
end of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Checketts became the acting general manager, and
he's going to travel with the team and stay in close contact in the
remaining weeks of the season to determine for himself whether
 &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Van Gundy is going to be the head coach beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the rumblings have begun again about  &UR; Phil Jackson, who
is practicing his Zen on the presidential campaign trail for former
Sen.
 &UR; Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Could Jackson be the new coach? The new GM? Both?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no change in Phil's schedule,'' Jackson's agent,
 &UR; Todd
 &UR; Musburger, told the ``Chicago Sun-Times.'' ``He continues with his
(corporate motivational) speaking engagements and he continues
working for his good friend, Senator Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches of Los Angeles Lakers, New Jersey Nets, Washington
Wizards and Charlotte Hornets all have interim tags.  &UR; Rick Pitino
in Boston and  &UR; Brian Hill in Vancouver also could be in trouble, so
Jackson will be back.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks job always has been the one coveted by Jackson,
who played there.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Checketts wants to see the Knicks in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization has to be completely focused now on (the
last) eight games and on making the playoffs,'' Checketts told New
York reporters upon announcing Grunfeld's reassignment. ``The
reason I did what I did was, frankly, so that for those eight games
and hopefully the playoffs, I can be involved in a day-to-day way,
and this summer, understand fully what the issues of this club are
and where we go next.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts dropped several hints in his comments about the mess
that suggest Grunfeld and Van Gundy weren't on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether Grunfeld should be held accountable for the
club's struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mean the dynamics of what an organization can go
through in a season _ not just player moves, but everybody having a
mission, a strategy, agreeing on where we're headed, and supporting
decisions and making them together _ yes, I would hold him
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't clearing Van Gundy just yet, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll only say the organization has not functioned very well
together,'' he said when asked about Van Gundy's role. ``It was
just more like a continued direction with critical people
throughout the organization (who) did not support the mission. And
there was division, clearly. For that, I hold him and myself
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts said he'll reserve judgment on why the Knicks have
foundered until the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know, but the ma[QQreason I did this (demote
Grunfeld) was so that I really know,'' he said. ``I've been
watching this team just like you. But now I want to be close, and
in the circle of what's going on before I make any more
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing the job &QL; 
Is there any doubt that  &UR; Paul Silas has earned a contract from the
Charlotte Hornets?
</P>
<P>
   The club was 4-11 when  &UR; Dave Cowens quit in frustration. The
team's second-best player,  &UR; Anthony Mason, was out for the season.
And the club's star,  &UR; Glen Rice, was milking an elbow injury in
hopes of being traded.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the deal that sent Rice to the Lakers for  &UR; Elden
Campbell and  &UR; Eddie Jones made Silas a better coach right away. But
he used that deal as the impetus to turn the club around.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets are 17-10 since then, and they had a nine-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's  &UR; Alvin Gentry, a friend of Silas' who went through the
same `interim'' situation and earned the Pistons job, can relate to
what Silas is going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious to anyone he can manage players,'' Gentry said.
``Three weeks ago, no one in this league thought they'd be (.500).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough (being in an interim position). The way you walk on
the court, the way you sit on the bench, the way you call timeouts
_ you know everything is being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to just do the job, but there's never a comfort
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas, who has been down this route before, said he's doing the
job just as he would if he had a 10-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect people to respect me,'' he said. ``I give it, and I
expect it in return.''
</P>
<P>
   He's getting it from around the league. And since owner  &UR; George
Shinn and prospective co-owner  &UR; Michael Jordan reportedly have
agreed that Silas should get a new contract, what's the holdup? &QL; 
He's back &QL; 
Nets center  &UR; Jayson Williams, who underwent 4{ hours of surgery to
repair his fractured right leg, getting a metal plate, four screws
and a bone graft from his hip, is a long way from playing again.
But at least he has had time to work on his comedy routine.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was hurt when he collided with teammate  &UR; Stephon
Marbury, who also hit the floor. Marbury's mom,  &UR; Mabel, rushed onto
the court to check on her son.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had heard his leg snap, but that wasn't his first
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to move out the way and not get stepped on by Mrs.
Marbury,'' he said. ``That was my first reaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he had thoughts on the wheelchair he was in, which was
rigged to hold his leg straight out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contraption was just invented. We didn't have a
wheelchair long enough for my leg, so my brother, Victor, told me
to sit on the crutch, so that's what this is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't no modern science. Victor's not that smart. He only
got out of the seventh grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Williams recalled his propensity for predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling you (media) guys that an ambulance would
have to take me out of here. And it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one prediction I predicted right in eight years here. I
picked championships, a playoff series over the Knicks, and that an
ambulance would take me out of here before I give up. And sure
enough, here come the sirens.'' &QL;

POSTPONING SERIES WAS CORRECT MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NHL did the right thing by postponing the Colorado
Avalanche-San Jose Sharks series in the wake of last week's
shooting tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
which killed 15 people and left more than 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The series began Saturday, four days after it was scheduled to
open in Denver. It also was moved to San Jose for the first two
games, another wise move, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado fans weren't ready to celebrate playoff hockey.
Avalanche players weren't into it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy got to us,'' Colorado Coach  &UR; Bob Hartley said.
``There are many dads on our team. I'm a dad, and it's been pretty
tough to focus on hockey. . . . But we want to dedicate our games
to Columbine High School.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche players will wear school patches on their sleeves
throughout the playoffs, a nice move as well.
</P>
<P>
   On not playing at home until Games 3, 4 and 5, Hartley said,
``Looking at what this community has gone through, I think worrying
about home ice would be very selfish.'' &QL; 
Trivia time
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Guy Bush served up the last home run to  &UR; Babe Ruth on
May 25, 1935. Any idea who the goalie was when  &UR; Wayne Gretzky
scored his last goal?
</P>
<P>
   It was  &UR; Wade Flaherty of the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your name is going down as a trivia answer, that's the name
you want it beside _ Wayne Gretzky,'' Flaherty said. ``It's pretty
cool. You're like the guy who gave up  &UR; Mark McGwire's 62nd home
run. You're one of those guys who most people ask about but don't
remember. But I will.'' &QL; 
Bubba in Nashville
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true. The expansion Nashville Predators, who have done
virtually everything right in their first season, went above and
beyond the call of duty by acquiring a hockey player who's name is
Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday,  &UR; Andrew ``Bubba'' Berenzweig, a senior defenseman and
captain at the University of Michigan, went to Hockey Tonk town
from the Islanders in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the June
NHL entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick a team to play for, it would be Nashville _
and my name definitely has something to do with that,'' said
Berenzweig, who helped Michigan to two NCAA championships. ``It
almost seems like destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenzweig, a fifth-round pick by the Islanders in '96, said
he's gone exclusively by the first name of Bubba since he was a
toddler. Good thing, too, seeing as how the Predators actually have
a ``Bubba-cam'' during home games, when they periodically scan the
crowd searching for a face to fit the name.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bubba: ``The only one who still calls me Andrew is my
grandmother.'' &QL; 
Who are you?
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Ducks of Anaheim goalie  &UR; Guy Hebert must hate to see
 &UR; Brendan
 &UR; Shanahan in the playoffs. Two years ago, Hebert ripped a groin
muscle making a save on the Detroit Red Wings forward and was lost
for the rest of the second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 of this year's first-round match-up, Shanahan got
shoved from behind and his skate whacked Hebert in the face mask.
After 10 minutes, Hebert had to leave the game because of
grogginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the locker room, and I wasn't sure who I was,''
Hebert said. ``Guys were telling me I was  &UR; Dominik Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert returned, only to lose both Games 1 and 2, allowing a
playoff-high eight goals _ two by Shanahan. &QL; 
Loose pucks
</P>
<P>
   San Jose forward  &UR; Owen Nolan got the Sharks' series with the
Avalanche off to a flying start by taking several pre-playoff
verbal shots at Colorado players. Among other things, Nolan said
the Avalanche ``don't have anything'' on the third and fourth lines
and that  &UR; Patrick Roy isn't so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's either unbeatable or things just go flying by him,''
Nolan said. ``He's either on top of his game or he lets in the
weakest goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy wasn't about to let Nolan get under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get involved in that,'' Roy said. ``For me,
it's extremely important to focus on what I have to do and play
well. There's no need for me to answer back. I don't feel you start
things like that before a series starts. I don't feel I have to
prove anything to Owen Nolan whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The four players Detroit picked up at the trading deadline _
 &UR; Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark and  &UR; Bill
 &UR; Ranford _ entered the postseason having played in a combined 414
playoff games. The entire roster on the Mighty Ducks had appeared
in just 399.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of surprise scratches early in the postseason saw
Carolina sit veteran defenseman  &UR; Paul Coffey and Buffalo park
assistant captain  &UR; Rob Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Former Coyote  &UR; Jim McKenzie has been sporting painted toenails
lately _ a dark shade of purple _ courtesy of his 5-year-old
daughter,  &UR; Taylor. She wanted to pain them pink for the Ducks'
playoffs, but the big fella thought that was pushing it just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year deal Nashville gave to prospect  &UR; David
 &UR; Legwand, the second overall pick in last year's draft, is
potentially worth $9 million _ the second-biggest entry-level
contract ever in the NHL. The largest deal belongs to Tampa Bay's
 &UR; Vincent Lecavalier, the No. 1 pick last year, who can conceivably
earn as much as $15 million if certain incentive clauses are
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Sly move by Sabres Coach  &UR; Lindy Ruff, having the team blow off
morning skate on the day of Buffalo's playoff opener at Ottawa.
Instead, he gathered everyone and they went for a walk along a
canal to talk about the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them out of their rooms and thinking about the team
and each other,'' Ruff said. ``We just walked and talked about
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, they're talking about a possible sweep after grabbing
a 2-0 series lead over the favored Senators. &QL;

SURPRISE SCORERS GIVE COYOTES TIE IN SERIES  
 USUAL OFFENSE EITHER HURT OR HEAVILY GUARDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Tkachuk wore St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger and his
friends on his shoulders like an oversized, bargain basement suit.
The combination was so ill-fitting that Tkachuk couldn't make his
usual fashion statement on ice: Racking up lots of points.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, two of the Coyotes' top five scorers were out _ Greg Adams
because of a strained groin, along with Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   To say the Coyotes needed scoring help to maintain serious
playoff hopes went without saying. The answer came from four
unexpected sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes received goals from Dallas Drake, defensemen Teppo
Numminen and Keith Carney and forward Shane Doan to win, 4-3 in
overtime, and even the playoff series at one apiece.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the combined total for this quartet over the
82-game regular season was 27 goals. Drake had nine, Numminen 10,
Carney two and Doan six. Saturday's output was manna from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it takes in the playoffs,'' said Carney, whose
slapper from the point gave Phoenix a 3-2 lead with 5{ minutes left
in regulation. ``Of course, you need your top scorers on their
game, playing their game and providing offense, but it takes
everybody in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, their best defensive people were on our best, like
we tried to do. If you look at your successful teams in the
playoffs, it takes more than your first-liners. It takes your
second-, third- and fourth-liners to chip in.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' injury caused Phoenix Coach Jim Schoenfeld to move
second-liner Robert Reichel to center the first line between
Tkachuk and Rick Tocchet, which created a second line of Drake,
Doan and Juha Ylonen.
</P>
<P>
   Drake produced a tie at 1 at 5:53 of the second period, scoring
on a beautiful cycle of passes from Ylonen and Doan. Doan produced
the game winner at 8:58, banging home a rebound on which Drake and
Ylonen, who had just six goals all season, assisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Juha and Doaner realize a lot of pressure is put on Keith,
Tocchet and Robert to score, and we came out and got a couple,
which is what we have to do,'' Drake said. ``I knew our line
combination on Friday, and it was fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put your three top guys on the Number 1 and let them bang
away. That's how it should be. But me, Juha and Doaner stepped up
to the plate today. It was a huge win. We couldn't go to St. Louis
down 2-0. This gives us a little confidence against a good team.
Hopefully, we can bang a few more off from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Doan said he had divine help on his game winner. He played with
a biblical verse _ Romans 8:28 _ on the blade of his stick, which
reads, ``In all things God works for good for those who love and
believe in him and seek his purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   He said playing with his new linemates was exciting, adding,
``Juha, Dally and I all play the same style, really. Dally and Juha
are a little more offensive, and Dally is so physical and he
creates so much room with his hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Numminen's goal, which tied the game at 2 at 2:15 of the third
period, was huge for a couple of reasons. First, it was a
power-play goal, the Coyotes' first in 11 chances in the series,
and slowed a special-teams trend that had been, and still is,
lopsided in the Blues' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it came early in the period and gave Phoenix new life
and offset a potentially backbreaking second-period goal by Pierre
Turgeon that put the Blues up, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting shots, but they haven't gone in,'' Numminen
said. ``It was good to get a power-play goal. We can relax now and
gain confidence from that. Going on the road, we have to be even
stronger defensively, especially on our penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting goals from the players we did is good. That's playoff
hockey. Everybody has to be playing at the top of their game, and
everybody has to contribute. That's what wins.'' &QL;

YLONEN'S RIGHT FOOT IS BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REPUBLIC STAFF  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes suffered another injury to a key player,
learning after Saturday's 4-3 overtime win over St. Louis that
center  &UR; Juha Ylonen will miss the remainder of the playoffs because
of a broken right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Ylonen, the hard-working Finn who had two assists in Saturday's
Game 2 of the first-round series, including an assist on the
game-winning goal by  &UR; Shane Doan, suffered the fracture when he was
hit in the ankle area by a slap shot from Blues defenseman  &UR; Al
MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   The team said he will be sidelined for four to six weeks. The
injury to Ylonen, one of the team's best defensive forwards and
penalty killers, comes on the heels of injuries to star center
 &UR; Jeremy
 &UR; Roenick and second-line left wing  &UR; Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick is out indefinitely because of a broken jaw and a
fractured right thumb. Adams missed Game 2 because of a groin pull
and will miss Game 3 today in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big loss, but you have to just keep right on going,''
General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said. ``Juha's a very valuable player
who will come back and play for us, but we've got a guy in  &UR; Bob
Corkum who can step up and fill that role, and hopefully, we'll
have Adams back for Game 4 (on Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Ylonen is the third Phoenix player to suffer a broken bone this
season because of a slap shot from MacInnis, who possesses the
hardest shot in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough you have to worry about him shooting it in
your net or faking it and setting up a guy for a goal,'' Smith
said, ``but he breaks an important player's foot.'' &QL; 
Injury update &QL; 
Adams, who pulled himself from Game 1 on the final shift, missed
six games because of a similar groin injury in late February and
early March.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the team reduced the recovery time of defensemen  &UR; Deron
Quint (concussion) and  &UR; Gerald Diduck (broken foot) to one week,
which means both could be available by Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Quint has set his sights earlier, saying he hopes to return by
Game 4 on Tuesday in St. Louis. &QL; 
High-stick anxiety &QL; 
Intensity in Game 2 picked up a notch Saturday, and so did the
chatter.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes right wing  &UR; Dallas Drake and Blues defenseman  &UR; Chris
Pronger were among the players trading words. After Coyotes
defenseman  &UR; Chris
 &UR; Carney scored an unassisted third-period goal to give his team a
3-2 lead, Drake was in Pronger's face.
</P>
<P>
   But just over two minutes later, St. Louis tied the score on a
 &UR; Pavol
 &UR; Demitra goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Drake's talking) sure came back to haunt him pretty quick,
didn't it?'' Pronger said. ``That's what you get for being a
moron.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger also said he was high-sticked by Drake earlier in the
period and it wasn't called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name any play and I got high-sticked,'' he said. ``Apparently,
it's not a penalty to get high-sticked. Only if I do it. I've got
the reputation, so . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The prognosticator &QL; 
Maybe  &UR; Charlie Simmer should book a flight to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   During the intermission before the Coyotes' game-winning goal,
the Fox analyst told partner  &UR; Doug McLeod that Doan would be the
one to score it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Doan did, 8:58 into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod credited Simmer on the air after it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a feel just from how guys are playing,''
Simmer said. &QL; 
A small change &QL; 
Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld removed center  &UR; Robert Reichel from
the No. 1 power-play team after its first chance came up empty. The
coach elevated forward  &UR; Dallas Drake to the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me like Dallas was having a game,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``It was nothing against Robert at all. But we had  &UR; Keith
( &UR; Tkachuk) and  &UR; Rick ( &UR; Tocchet), who are our 1-2 right now, and it
looked like Dallas was going to have a night. He was getting some
loose pucks, and that's what you need on the power play.'' &QL; 
Republic writers Paola Boivin, Bob McManaman and Tim Tyers
contributed to this article. &QL;

MACINNIS SHOWS WORTH TO BLUES

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Al MacInnis made a beeline for St. Louis' massage
therapist after Saturday's 4-3 overtime loss to the Coyotes. He
should have requested additional treatment for his ego.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be easy carrying a team on your back for two games and
have only a 1-1 split to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   How big an impact has the defenseman made in this Western
Conference quarterfinal series? He has played a role in all six St.
Louis goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``His two games have reflected his play all year,'' Blues Coach
Joel Quenneville said. ``He has been outstanding for us. He likes a
lot of minutes; he controls the puck. He's got that weapon and he's
willing to shoot it. Nobody can shoot it like that. It's got
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   His power-play goal 5:31 into the first period Saturday gave the
Blues a 1-0 lead, and his two assists contributed to St. Louis'
other two scores. His first was a feed to Pierre Turgeon in the
second period that Turgeon let fly over goalie Nikolai Khabibulin's
right pad, and the second was a perfect pass to Pavol Demitra, who
was wide open on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's opener, he scored on a first-period slap shot from
the blue line and added two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Six St. Louis goals, six MacInnis points. Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's been in on all the goals, but sometimes we'd like
to spread it out some more and get more guys involved,''
Quenneville said.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis said, ``I'm not concerned about the others. It's only
been two games. Obviously, we have to rely on other guys as well,
and I'm sure they'll step up in Games 3 and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling moment of Saturday's game came when MacInnis
wasn't on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes into the third period, he was sent into
the penalty box for tripping. It took only 38 seconds for the
Coyotes to score what was the biggest goal of the day (until the
game winner): a shot by Teppo Numminen that tied the score at 2 and
seemed to turn the momentum the Coyotes' way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, St. Louis players are optimistic about their
chances in this series. And why not? They've come a long way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blues didn't bring back Brett Hull and Steve Duchesne
before the season, many feared the worst, especially for the team's
power play. Instead, they are ranked No. 2 in the NHL this season.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis, whose shot is the equivalent of a Nolan Ryan fastball,
is a big reason. Ask the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Center Juha Ylonen is out four to six weeks because of a broken
right foot that had an up-close-and-personal meeting with a
MacInnis shot Saturday. Mike Sullivan and Dallas Drake suffered
broken toes in earlier meetings with MacInnis' slap slot.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents will tell you it's a no-win situation covering
MacInnis. ``He's difficult to handle, no doubt about it,'' St.
Louis defenseman Chris Pronger said. ``You want him on your side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays a lot of minutes and he's always coming up with big
plays. I think that's been pretty evident by what he's done in two
games.''

BETTER THAN '95  
 INDIANS ADD PITCHING TO HEFTY HITTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the final weeks of spring training, Cleveland Manager
 &UR; Mike
 &UR; Hargrove issued a challenge to his club, telling them simply
winning the American League Central would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove wanted the Indians to be the very best they could for
each of the 162 games, wanting to reach 100 victories in the
process. A little less than three weeks into the season,
Cleveland's players seem to be taking the matter seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians entered the weekend as the hottest club since the
start of the season. Their .326 team batting average entering the
weekend was 20 points higher than anyone else in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive, the Indians' 3.94 ERA was the third-best in the
AL. And until  &UR; Charles Nagy lost Thursday night, Cleveland starters
were 7-0. The bullpen had a combined ERA of 1.13 entering the
weekend series against Boston, and the club had outscored its
opponents 101-59 in its first 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best team I've ever been on,'' said reliever  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Shuey, who has been on each of the Indians division-winning clubs
of the past four years. ``That (1995) team was awesome. It was an
unreal experience being on that team. But I think this one is
better. I think we have better pitching than the '95 team, and
we've got guys on this staff that haven't even reached their
potential. When that happens look out!''
</P>
<P>
   Shuey's sentiments are equally being tossed around by baseball
people who know such things. This club is showing it may be capable
of anything, including winning the franchise's first World Series
since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, this Indians club is winning big without much help
from
 &UR; David Justice, who has been injured and was the only starter with
an average under .300 before the weekend series. Also, the
uncharacteristic defensive lapses of Gold Glove shortstop  &UR; Omar
 &UR; Vizquel, who has three errors already after committing five all of
last season, have not helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has the same belief in itself as the '95 team,''
Hargrove said. ``The difference is that this team is not as
arrogant as the '95 team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Indians posted an absurd 100-44 record during the
strike-shortened season, winning their division by 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   This club is getting tremendous power from right fielder  &UR; Manny
 &UR; Ramirez, who led the majors in RBI with 23 entering the weekend
series. He was also batting .369 with five home runs and is
apparently unhappy with his contract status, which will pay him $4
million this year and in 2000, when the club has an option.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who turned down a $56 million seven-year extension
recently, has taken to wearing white spikes with messages scrawled
on them during batting practice. So far, the rest of the club is
not allowing his behavior to affect them. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; Roger Clemens ended his distinguished career with the Boston Red
Sox more than two years ago. Before he left, though, he managed to
share two of that franchise's most cherished pitching records with
a certain Hall of Famer. What are the records and who is the other
pitcher? &QL; 
Too big a rift? &QL; 
Judging by the way his teammates and club officials are talking, it
doesn't look as if two-time Gold Glove outfielder  &UR; Jim Edmonds will
be back with the Anaheim Angels next season.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds underwent surgery last week to repair a partial labrum
tear in his right shoulder, an operation that will sideline him for
up to four months. The problem stems from the acknowledgment that
Edmonds could have had this procedure done last October and been
fully recovered by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pleased,'' Angels General Manager  &UR; Bill Bavasi said
when asked about Edmonds' delaying the surgery until now. ``But we
can't do anything about it. We just have to react to the pitch
that's been thrown at us and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels Manager  &UR; Terry Collins, when asked the same question,
said: ``I can't answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't or won't, he was then asked. ``Both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' $4.65 million option kicks in automatically if he
reached 320 at-bats this season, now an impossibility. The club
will now have the choice of picking up that option or letting
Edmonds, who has at least 25 home runs in each of the past four
seasons, become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Even his teammates are stepping gingerly when the subject is
broached, although new leader  &UR; Mo Vaughn leaped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys want to get better, some don't,'' said Vaughn, who
returned two weeks after suffering a high ankle sprain that at
first was believed would keep out the former MVP as much as six
week. ``Some play with pain, some don't. The bottom line is, you
have an obligation _ to the guys who are paying you and to the guys
who are playing _ to get better.'' &QL; 
Never say never &QL; 
Houston's outspoken center fielder,  &UR; Carl Everett, is up to his old
tricks of sticking his foot in his mouth again. This time the
subject was Chicago's Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate coming here,'' Everett said. ``To me, it's the worst
park in baseball other than the one in Detroit (Tiger Stadium). As
far as I'm concerned, they can stick some dynamite in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a career-ending park. I almost broke my leg on those
(drainage) gutters they have out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may recall during last season's playoffs that it was
Everett who said  &UR; Kevin Brown was ``nothing until he gets me out,''
during the first round when Houston eventually lost to San Diego.
Brown, by the way, struck out 16 Astros the day after Everett made
his ridiculous statement. &QL; 
Welcome to the club &QL; 
When Seattle's  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. was drilled by a pitch last week in
Anaheim, Mariners rookie  &UR; Brett Hinchliffe immediately retaliated
by drilling Angels designated hitter  &UR; Todd Greene. The move
eventually led to a bench-clearing brawl between the clubs and a
three-game suspension for Hinchliffe.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle's veterans were so impressed with the rookie, that
they invited him to ride on the veteran's bus from the stadium to
the airport, a move that usually requires more than two years of
big league service time since rookies and young players usually
must ride on the same bus as the coaches. &QL; 
Schott in the dark &QL; 
Quietly last week,  &UR; Marge Schott stepped away from the Reds, ending
her 14-year reign as the Cincinnati president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Schott finally agreed to sell 5{ of her 6{ shares of the club to
Cincinnati billionaire  &UR; Carl Lindner, who plunked down $67 million
for the controlling interest. Schott will retain one of the 15
shares but now has no say in anything the club does.
</P>
<P>
   Major league owners are expected to easily accept Lindner's bid.
During Schott's time as the Reds' point person, the club won a
World Series championship (1990) and two division titles (1990 and
'95). &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Clemens finished his Boston career with 192 victories, tying him
with &UR; Cy Young for the most in franchise history. His 38 complete
games also tied Young in that category. For the record, Clemens
pitched 2,776 innings for the Red Sox, while Young pitched 48 fewer
innings for Boston. Young had 112 losses with Boston while Clemens
had 111.
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Whose line is it anyway?: ``How did I feel about it? Nervous.
Scared. Excited. Sad. All the emotions and feelings mixed in.''
That was reliever  &UR; Mark Wohlers, not Cincinnati's catchers, after
learning he had been traded from Atlanta, the only organization he
had ever known, to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Holy elusive aura!: One school of thought believed that once
 &UR; Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive-games streak ended, it would be the
equivalent of  &UR; Batman being stripped of his mask, there would be no
there, there anymore. Ripken was hitting just .179 with no home
runs and two RBIs in eight games when he landed on the DL for the
first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Floyd Youmans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wonder if Mayor Rudy can parlay this into votes for
 &UR; his probable U.S. Senate race against current first lady Hillary?:
Following the orders of New York City Mayor  &UR; Rudolph Giuliani, the
city that never sleeps will honor Mets reliever  &UR; John Franco with
his own day. Franco recently joined  &UR; Lee Smith as the only
relievers with 400 saves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Go back to using white at home and gray on the road
 &UR; and this would never happen: Half of the Milwaukee Brewers emerged
from the clubhouse for pre-game stretching last Monday wearing blue
tops while the other half was in white. Blue was the color of the
night, and the others had to switch. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Longtime veteran  &UR; Gary Gaetti of the Chicago Cubs played in his
2,212th game at third base Tuesday, pushing him ahead of  &UR; Mike
Schmidt and into sole possession of third place on the all-time
list behind &UR; Brooks Robinson (2,870) and  &UR; Graig Nettles (2,412).
</P>
<P>
   Now that  &UR; Barry Bonds is on the disabled list for at least two
months, it underscores just how durable the three-time NL MVP has
been. Out of a possible 920 games he could have played for San
Francisco since joining the club before he landed on the DL, he had
played in 900, which translates into 97.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas'  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro, a designated hitter only until his knee
heals enough for him to return to first base, entered the weekend
with zero hits in 14 at-bats against left-handed pitchers. Palmeiro
hit .317 against lefties last season when he was with Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   New Atlanta hitting coach  &UR; Don Baylor wanted  &UR; Chipper
 &UR; Jones to start believing he could hit for power from the right
side. So far, Jones is believing. He had three home runs as a
right-hander in his first 14 games after hitting just two from that
side all of last season. Jones entered the season with 12
right-handed home runs in 677 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals, in first place for the first time since
winning the NL Central in 1996, have just two players _  &UR; Donovan
Osborne and  &UR; Willie McGee _ on their active roster who were with
them when they came within one game of reaching the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Former Diamondbacks catcher  &UR; Jorge Fabregas, now with the
Florida Marlins, has four hits in five starts since an eye doctor
told him his contact prescription was incorrect. Of course,
Fabregas has only been able to lift his average to .194 entering
the weekend. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
As difficult as it may be to believe right now,  &UR; Darryl &UR; Strawberry
could have been back in left field for the Yankees by the end of
the month if he hadn't fallen into trouble two weeks ago.
Collectively, Yankees left fielders entered the weekend with two
home runs and seven RBI. In the end, though, these are the Yankees
and anything can still happen, including seeing Strawberry somehow
return later this season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas pitcher  &UR; John Burkett, who has not had a winning record
since posting 20 victories for the Giants in 1993, will miss his
scheduled start today and probably land on the disabled list at
some point soon. His ERA since opening day last year is 5.96. His
2000 option worth $4.2 million automatically vests if Burkett
starts 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   It seems  &UR; Paul Spoljaric's time as a starter for Philadelphia
ended Tuesday after allowing eight runs on nine hits in two-plus
innings against the Diamondbacks. The career reliever was being
auditioned as a starter this season, but it seems he and his 13.00
ERA will now return to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of losing their spot in a rotation,  &UR; Masato
 &UR; Yoshii, who had a successful rookie season with the Mets last
season, appears to be in danger of doing the same. Yoshii allowed
six runs on six hits with three walks Wednesday and is 1-2 with a
7.47 ERA. ``He'll have to do better than that,'' New York Manager
 &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Mulder, Oakland's first-round pick (the second overall) in
last June's draft, has allowed just one run in 12 innings at Triple
A Vancouver. With the big club's need for pitching help, the
left-hander from Michigan State may make his big-league debut
within the next month. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandEven  &UR; Manny Ramirez's antics aren't enough to distract
this club.  &QL; 
2. NY YankeesEntered the weekend 10-5, same as they were after 15
games last year.  &QL; 
3. St. LouisIn first place for the first time since winning
division in 1996.  &QL; 
4. TorontoManager  &UR; Jim Fregosi walked into a great situation with
this brimming club.  &QL; 
5. AtlantaWelcomed the third new member of the bullpen since the
season began.  &QL; 
6. NY MetsEven without  &UR; Mike Piazza, the Mets aren't missing a
beat.  &QL; 
7. ArizonaThe plan was simple: give themselves a chance to win
every night.  &QL; 
8. Houston &UR; Ken Caminiti is predicting he will be back to his old
self soon.  &QL; 
9. San FranciscoCan the other players pick up the slack for the
injured  &UR; Barry Bonds? &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. BaltimoreSimply pathetic. A new manager is almost a certainty,
but is it enough?  &QL; 
29. FloridaA new season, but it appears the same old results are on
the way.  &QL; 
28. Chicago CubsAnother week, another starter on the DL. Where will
they turn next?  &QL; 
27. MontrealThe results are in and  &UR; Dustin Hermanson appears to be
the real thing.  &QL; 
26. Kansas CityThe auditions for pitcher  &UR; Kevin Appier's services
remain a hot topic.  &QL; 
25. MilwaukeeWorkhorse starter  &UR; Cal Eldred returns to one hurting
rotation.  &QL; 
24. CincinnatiSo &UR; Mark Wohlers only had a mechanical problem? It
goes deeper than that.  &QL; 
23. OaklandThis is a division where the A's might find a way to
squeeze into the race.  &QL; 
22. ColoradoScored at least 10 runs for the 75th time in 320 games
at Coors Field. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Pittsburgh Pirates: Two years ago they surprised the baseball world
by remaining in contention until the final two weeks of the season.
The Pirates have much bigger plans this season, considering
themselves the most improved club in the NL Central. Even though
it's just three weeks into the season, the Pirates find themselves
in the thick of the divisional race with good things, like a 4-2
road trip last week, happening. ``Without a doubt, it's a totally
different attitude than last year,'' first baseman
 &UR; Kevin Young said. ``We have guys who want to win ... It's what we
expect.'' &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Anaheim Angels: The offense is averaging 5.5 runs per game, which
certainly should be enough to have a better record than the Angels
entered the weekend with. The problems with this club stem from its
starting rotation, where only  &UR; Omar Olivares has an ERA under 5.87
among the starters entering the weekend series in Kansas City.  &UR; Ken
 &UR; Hill (5.87),  &UR; Chuck Finley (7.94),  &UR; Tim Belcher (8.53) and  &UR; Steve
Sparks (9.42) are dragging down the overall ERA, which stood at
4.92 before the weekend. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
 &UR; First-year Colorado Manager Jim Leyland after watching the
 &UR; Rockies score three runs in the bottom of the ninth twice in a
 &UR; three-day span to win games: ``I'm going to look like  &UR; Don Knotts
and
 &UR; Telly Savales rolled into one. Look at me now and I've only been
here five games.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Tampa Bay pitcher  &UR; Tony Saunders made a name for himself after
helping the Florida Marlins to the 1997 World Series title. He then
became the first player selected in the 1997 expansion draft, taken
by Tampa Bay, but has struggled mightily since then. Three starts
into the season, Saunders appeared on the verge of losing his spot
in the Devil Rays rotation. But after coming within four outs of
throwing a no-hitter last week, it seems Saunders has straightened
out what was ailing him. Instead of relying solely on his breaking
pitches, Saunders went back to having a good mix of fastballs
thrown in to his pitches and had his best performance in 56 major
league starts. ``I know it's early and everyone says it's a long
season, but I don't see me going out there every fifth day and keep
putting that product up,'' Saunders said before his start
Thursday. &QL;

MAYOR SPURRED MCNABB PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia Mayor  &UR; Ed Rendell wasn't on the bus with Dough Boy
and the three dozen other drunken Eagles fans, but he gets much of
the blame for the anti- &UR; Donovan  &UR; McNabb faction embarrassing itself
at last week's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rendell who went on Philadelphia radio and encouraged
people to call the Eagles' office and say they wanted the team to
draft Heisman Trophy winner  &UR; Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He gave out the Eagles' private phone number on the radio,
causing the switchboard at the team's offices to overload. These
weren't nice folks who called. Many were rude and obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia radio station WIP then organized a bus trip to the
draft in New York City, where the fans could yell, ``We want
Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Dough Boy, a 400-pound Eagles fanatic, apparently had a few too
many drinks during he trip, because when the bus reached New York's
Lincoln Tunnel, he mooned a bunch of senior citizens, breaking a
window in the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The fun continued when the bus arrived at Madison Square Garden.
The partyers gave a homeless guy an Eagles shirt. He was taken
inside the arena and fed and then they booed the pick of McNabb,
the Syracuse quarterback taken second overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donovan is a guy with a terrific personality,'' McNabb's
agent,
 &UR; Fletcher Smith, said of the booing. ``He can handle this, and I
think the Eagles understand he can handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb said he didn't care about the fan reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about what's on the inside, with my new family here,''
he said of the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse offensive coordinator  &UR; George DeLeone said he cringed
each time he heard that the Eagles had drafted a former option
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pro-style quarterback who happens to run some options
in a very limited fashion,'' DeLeone said. '`It makes me very angry
to see that kid characterized as an option quarterback. It makes me
angry to have our offense characterized as just an option offense.
It's like we run the wishbone. That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donovan McNabb has been checking protections, hot-reading,
throwing a five-step, three-step, seven-step passing game since
he's been here. It's been a tremendous injustice created by the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   To make amends to McNabb for the drunken fans' behavior, the
Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce had a luncheon in his honor last
week. McNabb gave Rendell an Eagles jersey with Williams' No. 34 on
one side and McNabb's No. 5 on the other. &QL; 
Love that draft
</P>
<P>
   How big is the draft?
</P>
<P>
   ESPN2's TV ratings of rounds four through seven on Sunday blew
away future NHL Hall of Famer  &UR; Wayne Gretzky's last game.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a Seahawks season-ticket holder,  &UR; Don Hopkins Jr.,
split a $24 million lottery prize and used some of his winnings to
take a trip to New York to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   He said the NFL gave him the red-carpet treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is first cabin,'' Hopkins said. ``What they did for us is
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, seeing it in person is something. . . . Everybody is
friendly and talking football.'' &QL; 
Paper Cowboy
</P>
<P>
   Five months after suffering a foot injury against the Cardinals
at Sun Devil Stadium, Cowboys cornerback  &UR; Deion Sanders still is
bothered by the injury.
</P>
<P>
   He was examined by a Tennessee foot specialist last week and
will consult another expert later this week in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were on a week-to-week to two weeks deal,''
Cowboys owner  &UR; Jerry Jones said of the injury. ``But when the final
deal tolled, we didn't have Deion for the last five games. Now,it's
week-to-week to five months later. Rest didn't heal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question this was a serious injury and (still) is a
serious injury.'' &QL; 
Dirt duo
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona State center  &UR; Grey Ruegamer, a third-round draft
pick of the Dolphins, is looking forward to lining up next to
veteran guard
 &UR; Kevin Gogan, whom he refers to as the ``King of Dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins offensive line coach  &UR; Paul Boudreau doesn't expect
Ruegamer to be Mr. Clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough kid, a Gogan type,'' Boudreau said. ``He lacks
some things in terms of real athleticism, but every time you turn
on the film and watch him, he's knocking somebody on their
(butt).''
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer maintains he learned to play offensive line in his
first ASU start three years ago. He was playing alongside lineman
 &UR; Pat Thompson against Washington in Seattle, when he felt a
pinching pain in his inner thigh.

   Thompson then grabbed Huskies linebacker  &UR; Steve Hoffman's groin.

Big shoes to fill
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Chiefs have given first-round pick  &UR; John Tait,
the Brigham Young offensive tackle, jersey No. 76, last worn by
left tackle  &UR; John Alt, who retired in 1996 after a 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all about John Alt,'' said Tait, the Tempe McClintock
High School product. ``He's a cornerstone of the history of the
Chiefs. Just to be mentioned in the same sentence as him is a
little bit unfair. I haven't proven anything to anyone. It shows a
lot of people think highly of me, and that just puts the pressure
on me to perform even better.'' &QL; 
Making history
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Packers General Manager  &UR; Ron Wolf never had drafted a
punter in the first seven rounds before taking Oregon's  &UR; Josh
Bidwell in the fourth round last week.
</P>
<P>
   The pick of Bidwell came two years after the Packers took
place-kicker  &UR; Brett Conway in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you're going to ask me: `Is this any different
than Brett Conway?''' Wolf said. ``I certainly hope so. This is a
second-day pick. You can do stuff like this in the second day.'' &QL; 
Scarlet and gray
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals would have taken linebacker  &UR; Andy Katzenmoyer with
21st pick overall had Eastern Michigan offensive tackle  &UR; L.J.
Shelton not been there. That would have given them an all-Ohio
State first round.
</P>
<P>
   They picked Buckeyes wide receiver  &UR; David Boston eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials also liked Ohio State quarterback  &UR; Joe
Germaine, the Mesa Mountain View product, but wouldn't have taken
him before the fifth round. Germaine went to the Rams in the fourth
round. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the Redskins, who have three first-round
picks next year, use at least one on signing another team's
franchise player to an offer sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells, on the Colts trading
 &UR; Marshall Faulk: ``To tell you the truth, we had a conga line in the

it as a compliment.'' &QL;

OVERPOPULATION OF BURROS DAMAGES WILD LIFE HABITAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is no new problem. It's an ongoing saga.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter began last Saturday in Tucson, when the
Arizona Game and Fish Commission voted to ``strongly'' request that
the Bureau of Land Management initiate emergency burro removal in
various areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM and the U.S. Forest Service, under the federal Wild,
Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, are in charge of
managing mustangs and burros. In Arizona, that means primarily
burros and the BLM. There are 11 herds in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish biologists are concerned that burros are adversely
affecting public lands administered by the BLM as well as federal
wildlife refuges and state wildlife areas where BLM still is in
charge of managing burros, said  &UR; Dave Walker, head of the
department's Habitat Branch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Berlat of Tucson, the commission chairman, said burro
overpopulations and the resultant damage to wildlife habitat have
been going on far too long.
</P>
<P>
   In April of last year, the state sued Secretary of the Interior
 &UR; Bruce
 &UR; Babbitt, alleging that the BLM is violating the law by failing to
control burros on Game and Fish's Alamo Lake Wildlife Area. The
suit claims burros are having severe effects on wildlife, including
sensitive species. The suit hasn't been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish is requesting that BLM do its job and remove
burros that are having an impact on wildlife habitat, especially in
riparian areas and areas containing sensitive species. It also
wants burro population inventories and information on how much
damage burros are doing to wildlife habitat in the various herd
management areas.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, but it all will be tough to do.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone concerned knows that burro populations in Arizona are
out of control. These feral animals are growing in numbers and
damaging wildlife habitat. They don't belong in the wild. They have
domestic roots.
</P>
<P>
   The act should be called The Wild, Free-Roaming HORSES and
Sometimes Burros Act. Almost all the funding it provides is for
mustangs. Burros are an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The state can howl and threaten, but unless the BLM in this
state gets some money, nothing is going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will take the courts to wrest money from the
Department of Interior to take care of the immense burro problem in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Move 'em out. &QL; 
More action &QL; 
The commission also voted to oppose the proposal to create a
Sonoran Desert National Park and Preserve in southwestern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The 3 million-acre park would combine the Barry Goldwater Range,
the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department said these lands are extremely important
for maintaining and improving native wildlife populations and
wildlife-related recreational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that giving control of the land to the National Park
Service has the potential to seriously reduce Game and Fish's
jurisdiction with fish and wildlife management on the Goldwater
Range and the Cabeza Prieta refuge. He also said it could conflict
with interagency management agreements, projects and land
management planning activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to continue our management activities there,''
Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there 75 wildlife water developments on the range and
the Cabeza Prieta. In addition, another 26 water developments are
scheduled for the eastern part of the range.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters are offered 13 desert bighorn sheep permits in the area,
100 javelina permits and 425 deer tags. Part of the range offers
quality quail hunting.
</P>
<P>
   A program also has been developed to help save the endangered
Sonoran pronghorn. &QL;

BRISTER AWAITS CHANCE TO VALIDATE FAITH SHOWN BY BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Elway's successor was so bad in the mid-1990s that he was
out of the NFL for one year.
</P>
<P>
   No team wanted Bubby Brister, who sat out the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, who had
played with Brister at Philadelphia in 1994, convinced Broncos
Coach Mike Shanahan to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Brister will be asked to take over a job held
by Elway since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more pressure than I've ever had and probably
would have ever dreamed of having,'' Brister said.
</P>
<P>
   Think things have changed for the Broncos, back-to-back Super
Bowl champions, and the rest of the AFC West?
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the starting quarterbacks in the division will be
Jon Kitna in Seattle, Rich Gannon in Oakland, Jim Harbaugh or Ryan
Leaf in San Diego, Elvis Grbac in Kansas City and Brister, 36, in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Jeff George was in Oakland, Stan Humphries
in San Diego, Rick Mirer in Seattle, Joe Montana in Kansas City and
Elway in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't replace John Elway,'' said Bob Ferguson, vice
president of player personnel for the Cardinals, who left the
Broncos in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Mike (Shanahan) has been preparing for this _ the
drafting of Brian Griese and Jeff Lewis before him. Plus, Bubby has
proven to be successful. It shows how great that scheme (West Coast
offense) really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Broncos were 5-0 in games Brister started for
an injured Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Brister's numbers were better than Elway's in those starts. He
completed 59.5 percent of his passes for 986 yards and 10
touchdowns. He was intercepted only three times and had a 99.0
passing rating.
</P>
<P>
   He will begin the preseason as a starter, with Griese, a
third-round pick a year ago, being groomed for the job. In
addition, the Broncos are expected to sign veteran Chris Miller,
who has been out of football since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the Horizon High School and Northern Arizona graduate,
was traded to Carolina in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Brister was known for being a hothead and
outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his starting job in Pittsburgh in 1992 when Bill Cowher
replaced Coach Chuck Noll. Then he was traded to Philadelphia after
criticizing starter Neil O'Donnell in the media. Brister said he
could ``outrun and out-throw'' O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Brister started eight games for the Eagles. He was the
backup to Randall Cunningham there the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In '95, he signed with the New York Jets and started only two
games, one in which he made all of the blooper highlight films. His
shovel pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by
Carolina inside linebacker Sam Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Brister's career was resuscitated by Shanahan and the Broncos a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means am I John Elway,'' Brister said. ``I just think if
I can fill my own shoes, that will be good enough for us to get
where we want to go.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Empty gestures won't create peace we're seeking
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metal detectors of the mind. That's what we might wish
for, to prevent any more Littletons. We'd like a modern-day quick
fix. Whether it's Kosovo or Colorado, it's easier to deal at arm's
length. Modern-day examples abound.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians fight a sterile war.
</P>
<P>
   Parents outfit their kids, but don't make time to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians lack the guts to take on the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Educators don't teach the values that history, art, science and
literature offer.
</P>
<P>
   A nation goes to church but doesn't share spiritual
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, exceptions to those generalizations, all
around us and in Littleton. The young student who said she wished
she had given one of the killers a hug because she knew he was
hurting inside; the devoted teacher who was fatally wounded while
pushing his students away from a doorway; the solitary Republican
senator from Denver, Dottie Wham, who voted alone on her side of
the aisle against a National Rifle Association-sponsored bill to
eliminate gun restrictions in some Colorado towns, including the
barring of assault weapons; the black parent who advised his son
not to change schools, only to learn one youth apparently was
executed because he was black (the civil rights movement taught him
never to run from wrong, the father said).
</P>
<P>
   I try to put myself in the shoes of the parents who lost
children to the senseless horror. But it hurts too much.
</P>
<P>
   Our oldest daughter and her family are flying in from Colorado
to visit this week. They live a few miles from the site of the
tragedy, as did we for a long time. After the shootings, she wasn't
the only young mother who found it hard to let go of a 4-year-old's
hand at the preschool door. (I didn't tell her that I went to the
toy box I've replenished for the grandchildren and threw away the
water guns _ a silly but symbolic gesture.)
</P>
<P>
   There are no solutions, only remedies that play around the
edges. But open discussions between diverse groups of students, not
just best friends, and interactions with caring adults will do a
lot more lasting good than metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   I liked two ideas I heard this week. In Colorado, one elementary
school assigns each student an adult other than a parent to mentor
the youngster all the way through school. A variation of that could
work for older kids, too, and could get parents more involved in
the larger school scene. In a Georgia school where fights were
breaking out in the school cafeteria, the principal called on
parents and other volunteers to come have lunch on a regular basis
and get to know different groups of students informally.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a believer that great good can come of great evil, that it's
a sign civilization has progressed when America fights in Kosovo,
not for oil or solely in the national interest, but for universal
human dignity. I believe many adults will decide they have time
after all to listen to young people because of the Columbine
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   And since I once served in the Colorado Legislature and have
watched that body drift to the extreme right on the gun issue, I
have hope sanity will return to policymaking there. Three bad gun
bills have been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor at one of the Littleton memorial services conceded
that he could offer no answers to his tearful audience, just hope
that eternity will provide those answers. As another spring
snowstorm blows into Denver, as if in divine fury, the only words
about the loss I'd like to send to a community our family loved for
its vibrancy are these, by an anonymous writer:
</P>
<P>
   Do not stand now and weep/ I am not here/ I do not sleep/ I am a
thousand winds that blow/ I am the diamond glint on snow./ I am the
sunlight on ripened grain/ I am the rain.

 &HT;    Stop fretting about fabric; fret about feelings
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Whenever it is that the survivors of the Columbine
High massacre reunite as a student body, someone is going to have a
dilemma that needn't be.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary will be over fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Someone will be dressed in black. Someone else will be trying to
judge it.
</P>
<P>
   What will it mean _ black? Will it mean mourning fallen
classmates? Or will it mean solidarity with fallen shooters? Or
will it mean that the white T-shirt was in the wash and the black
one was at the top of the drawer?
</P>
<P>
   Which will it be?
</P>
<P>
   A futile exercise, yes, but someone will be trying to judge, as
will people in schools across the country. Step right up and make
your judgment. It's a game everyone can play. The Columbine gunners
played it. They based spot judgments on the color of classmates'
skin, on a ball cap. Hitler played such a game.
</P>
<P>
   I know. Let's ban black. That would be a typical exercise _
typically fruitless. Lest this be seen as a tome on student
uniforms and the folly of dress codes that historically stay one
step behind whatever is fashionable, relax. Not this time. I wish
for the dialogue not to be about fabric. Let's talk about what
happens below it.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening below this fabric is roughly what happens when
a chick sheds egg shell: a struggle, a strain, an imperative. Break
that shell or die, says nature. It's a good thing baby chicks don't
know the gravity of their challenge. It would scare them to death.
</P>
<P>
   I remember being scared as a teen _ not about carnage in the
school lobby or even the war that was raging on another continent
with my prospective draft number attached. No, I was scared,
simply, of the unknown _ the leap, the advance of time, the leaving
of the previous me behind.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea that nature was going to provide in so many ways,
that I wasn't really leaving anything behind, that everything I
wished to keep near my heart I could keep simply by wanting to. It
would take letters and long-distance calls, and reasons to come
home often. It still does, and it's still life-sustaining.
Fortunately for me, there was always a lot at home to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine what fast-forwards through the minds of teens in
the late 1990s, in an era when anything longer than a music video
is of epic length.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, we ought to be thankful for music videos. Just look at what
else is on the TV: ``Crisis in (fill in blank)''; ``Showdown in
(fill in the blank)''; ``(Fill in the blank) Under Siege.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm often relieved to observe that in their baby-chick world,
teens generally just ignore these world crises and satellite-ready
tempests. They are worried about what's happening inside _ inside
them, inside a friend.
</P>
<P>
   That should be good news to people who worry about converting
teen-agers to paths of righteousness. Inside has their attention,
believe me. And I do believe that discussions about treating one
another other with respect and kindness can stick if we get the
conversation rolling. Of course, to get the children to listen we
need to treat them with respect and kindness we expect from them.
</P>
<P>
   Too touchy-feely? Well, we're talking about feelings. You'll fix
them with a meat mallet?
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like something from a long-broken 45 record, but
we need to recognize the natural process of emerging as a person
unto one's self, with fears and uncertainties, and fads as
transitory as amniotic fluid on the down of that chick.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have fundamental things to discuss: life incubating,
maturity in the making. Instead, someone wants to discuss the color
of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   So, what about that color? Is it in mourning? Is it in defiance?
Is it ``just me'' and not you? Yes.

 &HT;    Safety devices can't make trunk of cars childproof
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the challenges that face automakers is to
figure out how their customers think. They do this mostly so they
can entice people to buy their products. It can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors found out there is a more complex and challenging
customer base _ children _ or their car-buying parents.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to solve the problem of children accidentally locking
themselves in car trucks, which has caused about 20 deaths since
1987, GM decided to use children as research agents. (Ford Motor
Co. also has developed a trunk-escape system.)
</P>
<P>
   Working with experimental psychologists and biomechanical
experts from Exponent/Failure Analysis Associates, GM began a
behavioral research program.
</P>
<P>
   Child physiologist and EFAA staffer Christine Wood, who worked
with 10 behavioral scientists, explains, ``We began by developing a
mechanism that we thought screamed out to the kids, `Use me to open
the trunk.' We quickly discovered that mechanisms that force
children to use only their fingers did not work as well as those
where children put their whole hand on it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said adults have a lifetime of experience opening things and
are aware of hazards. Young children have limited experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very youngest kids we tested (age 3) are still so
dependent on adults for being able to do all the basics like
getting dressed, doing buttons, zippers, etc. ... there are real
physical limitations on what kids can do,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   About nine different devices were tested.
</P>
<P>
   A lighted overhead pull cord similar to those used on buses was
appealing to adults and engineers, Wood said. ``We adults were sure
it would work well, but we found that young children believe they
shouldn't touch things that looked electrical. They wouldn't even
try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and her associates found there is seemingly nothing
``child-attractive.'' They settled on an ordinary-looking
lever-type handle because it had a high success rate among the
children tested.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Zarrella, executive vice president of General Motors, noted,
``We tested a number of designs, found that many that our research
team intuitively thought would be successful didn't work well at
all. And while the majority of the 100 children who ranged in age
from 3 to 7 we tested could operate the escape handle we ultimately
developed, we learned that not all _ especially the younger ones _
were successful. That is why GM quickly changed its focus from an
escape handle to a preventative measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Trunk kits are available at GM dealers for about $50 and can be
installed on most 1990 or later GM passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   My view: Cars are not playthings, and children should be taught
that at an early age. They should never be allowed to play in or
around a parked vehicle. Nor should they ever be left alone in one.
</P>
<P>
   Lock your car even in your own driveway. Little ones have an
uncanny way of finding ways into curious places.

 &HT;    Be leery of shops retrofitting A/C system
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ah, spring! Open windows, chase out musty smells.
Winter's wool garments are replaced by cooler cotton fabrics, and
the temperature selector in the car is moved from the red to the
blue zone. Just push that A/C button and ... What? Oh-oh, no cold
air? Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Getting your car's air-conditioning system serviced has become
more complicated and expensive in the past few years for a number
of reasons. Primarily, the transition from environmentally
unfriendly R-12 to an ozone-safe refrigerant opened a Pandora's
box.
</P>
<P>
   All vehicle manufacturers have been using the newer R-134a in
their A/C systems since the mid-'90s, and it has become the
industry standard to retrofit replacement refrigerant for older
R-12 systems.
</P>
<P>
   However, the introduction and use of several other refrigerants,
both legal and illegal, has created A/C chaos for the auto repair
business. The culprit is contaminated refrigerant, which can only
be identified by using a special piece of equipment that ``sniffs''
it out.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the cost of this mess has fallen on the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Both R-12 and R-134a are pure refrigerants and can be recovered
and recycled _ if they are not contaminated with any other
chemical. Hence the problem.
</P>
<P>
   If a vehicle's A/C system is identified as containing
contaminated refrigerant, it may be deemed unserviceable by a shop.
The recovery and disposal of contaminated refrigerant is a
time-consuming and expensive undertaking. Many shops just don't
want the headache.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to vent refrigerant to the air. The penalty is a
stiff fine or possible imprisonment. If a shop subscribes to this
practice, do you suppose they care what they put in your system?
</P>
<P>
   As the price of R-12 continues to escalate, owners of older
vehicles with A/C systems that use this refrigerant will become the
prime targets for the ``retrofit hawkers,'' or shops that encourage
you to switch your air-conditioning system to a money-saving,
alternative refrigerant.
</P>
<P>
   Beware! While there are legitimate circumstances where a system
should be retrofitted, there are many instances where minor repairs
and a recharge will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, steer clear of shops using refrigerants other than
R-12 or R-134a. Although the other accepted refrigerants may work
well and their price is attractive, it could prove to be a
nightmare when you need future service.
</P>
<P>
   Most reputable shops recommend retrofitting an A/C system only
when the situation is extreme, such as compressor failure or the
need to replace multiple components. Major repairs of this sort
require that the entire system be flushed out with a cleaning
chemical that removes all traces of debris, old refrigerant and
lubricating oils. This, in turn, provides the best possible
environment for the R-134a replacement along with the new oil,
neither of which is compatible with R-12.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is a system that is environmentally friendly,
less expensive to maintain (the cost of the refrigerant in the
event of future repair) and uncontaminated by residue from old
R-12.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of arguments throughout the industry that
ridding the system of the old chemical is unnecessary and that it
is acceptable simply evacuate and recharge using the replacement
refrigerant and oil. However, the use of refrigerant identifiers is
uncovering an epidemic of contamination.

 &HT;    KOSOVO REFUGEES TELL OF DIGGING MASS GRAVES
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKAS, Albania _ The way Hasan Hyseni pieced together the story
of the carnage he found near Izbica, his Kosovo village, Serbian
forces pursued a simple tactic there: ``Every person they saw, they
killed. Five here. Ten there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyseni said he is one of the Kosovar Albanians who discovered
the butchery. Then he helped gather the bodies and dig 151 shallow
graves.
</P>
<P>
   Bajram Hasani is another Kosovo refugee who described the
painful duty of examining the bullet-pocked, sometimes mutilated
remains of his compatriots. He, too, dug graves at Izbica
(pronounced Iz-BEET-sa), then carefully deposited the bodies of his
wife's father, her uncle and her cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered them with blankets. When we buried them we put them
in the right direction as our habits say,'' Hasani recalled.
</P>
<P>
   These Kosovo refugees talked of scores of graves near the
village Izbica. Shallow graves mounded with dirt. All lined up and
orderly.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, NATO officials said at a briefing in Brussels that
a spy satellite had photographed what appeared to be scores of
graves, all pointing southeast toward Mecca out of respect for the
victims' Muslim religion.
</P>
<P>
   The officials cited the discovery as compelling evidence of
Serbian atrocities. The apparent graves had not appeared in a
satellite photo in March.
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence authorities had no way to penetrate the earth
thousands of feet below their cameras to learn what or who really
lay beneath it, no way to answer the questions of how and why and
when.
</P>
<P>
   These two refugees, who stay in tent camps here on opposite
edges of this city, seem to be answering at least some of those
questions. While their stories cannot be verified here, they
directly reflect the satellite findings and support NATO's
accusations of Serbian human rights abuses of an appalling
magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   The men's descriptions don't line up fact by fact, but on most
points their stories agree, and also match what human rights groups
have heard from other refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the two men recounted the chaos of Kosovo and the
human destruction they witnessed:
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of March, tales of killings flew through the
mountain villages that for months had been tormented by Serbian
Yugoslav police, army troops and paramilitary fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The area is home to a predominantly ethnic Albanian population
and a stronghold for guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence.
But it also holds a large Serb police presence and a smattering of
villages where ethnic Serbs dominate. The place is a lethal,
long-simmering stew.
</P>
<P>
   The people in this cluster of settlements centered between Pec
to the west and Pristina to the east had been on the run from
village to village, from village to mountains, from mountains to
home _ constantly moving to find a place that seemed momentarily
safer from the Serb forces they said had been mounting sporadic
attacks for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of March, Hyseni's family had gone from their
home in Kastriot to Klodernice to Tushila, each of which is
separated by just a few miles.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani and his family of nine people also had ended up in
Tushila that day. Both families placed the date as March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both families also said a large group of Kosovar
Albanians, mostly women and children, arrived in Tushila shortly
afterward. Serb forces had ordered them to leave the grounds of the
Izbica schoolhouse where they had been staying, but had not allowed
the older people and men to go along.
</P>
<P>
   There was fear and talk of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Both families independently said they had been told that a
grenade or mortar had exploded in the middle of the column of women
and children, killing one mother and her two children.
</P>
<P>
   The Hasani and Hyseni families could not provide precise dates,
but both said that within a day or two the Serb authorities rounded
them up among the thousands of ethnic Albanians who had taken
refuge in Tushila. This group, too, was divided, and the males aged
15 to about 50 were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The rest were put on the march, heading south toward Albania
accompanied by Serb forces who periodically shot in the air to
hurry them along. But after about only 10 miles, the armed guards
left the convoy. The column dispersed, and many went home or to
other refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Within another day or two, village men ventured out in search of
lost friends and relatives whom they feared might have perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of people looking,'' remembered Hyseni, a
52-year-old primary school teacher. ``We would ask each other, 'Did
you find anyone? How many have you found?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Hyseni said he walked less than a mile over the rough terrain in
a steady drizzle, following a path along a dried-up creek bed, when
he found the first cluster of three bodies.
</P>
<P>
   They were lying face down, hands behind their heads, shot full
of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned them over to see their faces,'' he said, and he
realized he knew all three. One was his cousin Mustapha. One of the
bodies was missing a foot, which Hyseni and a friend found a few
yards away.
</P>
<P>
   A mile and a half farther he encountered two more bodies, he
said, an elderly man and his son, whose fingers had been nearly
hacked off one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was a group of 10 bodies scattered along the
creek bed for about 50 yards, all of them shot but not mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew them all,'' Hyseni said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers met at the Izbica schoolhouse around 4 p.m. They
determined to gather the bodies and bury them the next day as
properly as possible, about half a mile away from the school in a
plot of land that a local man donated.
</P>
<P>
   Hyseni said he believed few people had been killed there at the
white, three-room school, and that most were brought from nearby
sites such as those he had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani, who is 45 and a bricklayer, differs on this.
</P>
<P>
   He also said villagers had gathered at Izbica in the late
afternoon, but arrived to discover a line of scores of bodies on a
small field near the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them had been killed from a very short distance,'' he
said. ``From five to ten meters, not more.'' Some had many wounds,
some only a shot in the head or the heart or the chest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani said the villagers found three piles of shells in
different places, leading them to believe three people had carried
out the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered the bodies of the father, uncle and cousin of his
wife Sobrije. The villagers covered the bodies as best they could,
using a blanket for every three bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Sobrije Hasani whispered an added fact to a reporter out of her
husband's presence. When he came back home that night with her
brother, who had gone with him on the search, her husband was so
shaken that he was unable to tell her what had happened. Her
brother had to deliver the bleak news.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani did agree that not all the bodies buried the following
day had been found at the same site, and that some were brought
from elsewhere in the vicinity of Izbica. Some of those, he said,
were mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   He put the total dead at 145, while Hyseni said it was 151. Both
said smaller numbers of additional victims were found and buried in
different villages during these days.
</P>
<P>
   Hasani and Hyseni, who said they are acquainted but had not seen
each other since they left Kosovo as refugees, gave identical
accounts of what happened the day of the burial. They also gave the
same names of some of the deceased, including three fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The burials, they said, were simple. Men dug a yard or so deep,
placed a body, and covered it with dirt so that a mound was left
showing.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA helped dig the graves, but more important, stood guard
for Serb patrols, they said. They also videotaped the event to be
used as evidence in war crimes trials.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they did one other thing that may or may not
survive the brutality of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. They put
numbered wooden markers at the head of each grave and made a
corresponding list of the names of the dead, so people will be able
to find their late loved ones if they and if peace ever return to
Kosovo.

AD AGENCIES URGED TO LEAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Md., Fla., Calif.)  By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. _ The 81st annual meeting of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies, which concluded here on
Saturday, closed with exhortations to the estimated 350 attendees
to enthusiastically tackle the challenges confronting the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have serious issues; the world is changing,'' said Shelly
Lazarus, the chairwoman of the association for 1999-2000 who is
also chairwoman and chief executive of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in
New York, part of WPP Group PLC. ``Are we going to lead or are we
going to follow?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to lead, we need to be active and we need to be
committed,'' not just ``sort of involved,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the humorous definition of the difference between
``involvement'' and ``commitment'' _ in a ham-and-eggs breakfast,
``the chicken was involved but the pig was committed'' _ Ms.
Lazarus declared: ``We live and die by this industry. In this
instance, I align with the pig. So let's get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lazarus, in her address as the incoming chairwoman, urged
members of the association, which is known as the Four As, to
celebrate the unconventional and the unexpected _ the better to
meet competition from the likes of management consultants, who are
threatening to usurp the traditional role agencies play in
marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``My management consultant friends sometimes seem almost
offended by the irrational and illogical,'' Ms. Lazarus said.
``Have you noticed that?''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she asserted, ``we thrive on that,'' because
``consumers are often irrational and illogical,'' influenced by
``intangible emotional values that often transcend logic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a vendor arm of the clients we serve,'' Ms. Lazarus
said. ``We are not the tactical executor of our clients' will.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she added: ``We marry consumer insights in
brand-building communication. We find ideas. We produce the stimuli
that drive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what consultants do,'' Ms. Lazarus declared.
``That is what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the text of her speech, Ms. Lazarus suggested that the
association ``pull a shocker'' and ``offer the consultants
membership in the Four As.'' Ms. Lazarus said later that the
passage was omitted for time reasons, adding with a smile that she
had ``meant it absolutely in jest.''
</P>
<P>
   Jest and the unexpected were prominent parts of a panel
discussion on how to operate an agency successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to embrace failure,'' said Donny Deutsch, chairman
and chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York. ``Learn from it,
grow from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you reach for the stars, you fall off your
chair,'' he added. ``We are so afraid of the myths, but that's only
where greatness comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Deutsch advised, ``let's be proud'' and be
imbued with ``the arrogance the McKinseys have,'' a reference to
the McKinsey &AMP; Co. consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough business,'' he added, ``and you have to say to
yourself we are going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A second panelist, Clifford J. Einstein, chairman and corporate
creative director at Dailey &AMP; Associates in West Hollywood, Calif.,
part of the Interpublic Group of Cos., told the audience that ``if
you want to be great, clients should think you're great.''
</P>
<P>
   That way, he explained, ``they will trust you and listen to you
and bring you into the business'' _ and those additional insights
will help you produce even better work.
</P>
<P>
   A third panelist, Ed Eskandarian, chairman and chief executive
at Arnold Communications in Boston, owned by Snyder Communications,
echoed Ms. Lazarus in proclaiming that success comes from ``taking
a different perspective, a different angle at the way you look at
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an executive who said at another panel discussion that
agency managers should ``set a goal to pay less than average
salaries,'' Eskandarian urged agency principals to ``pay more
competitively'' to attract talented employees and ``give them
opportunities for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Because no advertising conference is complete without awards,
the association presented its 1999 honors on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the O'Toole Creative Awards competition, for general
excellence during 1998, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide
unit of Omnicom Group, won for agencies with billings of more than
$30 million. It was the second time in three years that BBDO New
York had won or tied for the award. Dweck Inc. in New York,
formerly Dweck &AMP; Campbell, won for agencies with billings of less
than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole Awards for multicultural advertising were presented to
four agencies. Vigilante in New York, part of the Leo Burnett Co.,
won for work aimed at black consumers. There was a tie for the
award for work aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers, which was
shared by Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio, part of
MacManus Group, and Conill Advertising in New York, owned by
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC Pancom International in New York won for work
in the ``other multicultural'' category.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Toole Awards for public service advertising were presented
to Eisner &AMP; Associates in Baltimore, for television work, and Asher
&AMP; Partners in Los Angeles, for print work.

FROM DOW JONES, A FREE SITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The niche market for business-oriented sites on the World Wide
Web is getting a little more crowded. Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which has
attracted 283,000 paid subscribers to The Wall Street Journal
Interactive Edition, is introducing dowjones.com, a free site for
business users.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which will have 12 new editorial employees, was one of
two new initiatives announced last week by the company's chairman
and chief executive, Peter R. Kann, at its annual shareholders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company is preparing a Sunday section devoted
to careers and personal finance, which will be offered to
newspapers in major metropolitan markets as a supplement to their
own local business sections.
</P>
<P>
   The dowjones.com Web site will include some of the familiar
paraphernalia of financial sites, like stock tracking and quotation
services, as well as a search function tailored to cover more than
2,000 business-related sites chosen by Dow Jones editors and
industry-specific areas that focus on 29 industries, including
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, transportation, advertising,
media and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neil F. Budde, a vice president of the interactive publishing
division at Dow Jones, said he did not expect the free site, which
will include breaking news from the Dow Jones news wires, to draw
paying subscribers away from its paid cousin. ``If anything,'' he
said, ``having a lot of traffic through dowjones.com will be a
place where we can sell even more subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The existing competitors of the site include the financial
section of the Yahoo portal; Quicken, which provides information
through a variety of online outlets &UR; ; &LR;  and a range of smaller
sites, including those of CBS Marketwatch, CNNfn and the financial
section of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competitor was skeptical of the initial blueprint.
``They're in a bind,'' said Larry Kramer, the chief executive of
CBS Marketwatch (http://cbs.marketwatch.com). ``They understood
when they made their product part of the paid tier that they were
giving away the mass market. The advertising dollars from the mass
market have come in a lot faster than subscription dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created yet another brand name,'' he added. ``That's
the opposite of the way you should go on the Web.''

   INDONESIAN-WRITER (Undated) _ For three decades Pramoedya Ananta
Toer, Indonesia's greatest modern writer, felt the full force of
President Suharto's military state. He is a free man now, on his

1959. When he speaks there is no mistaking his inner strength, and

series; this week by Jane Smiley.

   OSCAR-DOCUMENTARIES (Undated) _ Earlier this year, the board of
governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which
administers the Oscars, voted to eliminate the award for short
documentaries. The vote provoked an outcry from documentary
filmmakers, who say that short documentaries, which were first
recognized by the academy in 1943, are an art form in themselves.

Friedman, is upbeat. Reviewed by Richard Eder.
</P>

   TV-L.A.RIOTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although ``L.A. Riots
Revisited'' comes up with no revelations, it does bring back the
striking failure of the Los Angeles police to contain, much less

had settled down to manage its own $31.8 billion acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable carrier, the company made
an unsolicited bid to buy Mediaone for $58 billion. If the bid is
successful, AT&AMP;T would become the nation's No. 1 cable television

`THE LEXUS AND THE OLIVE TREE': RESIST THE GLOBAL VILLAGE AT YOUR
PERIL
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes and author ID at end of review.) 
 (DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he wrote an absorbing book 10 years ago about the
Middle East, Thomas L. Friedman is mainly known to readers first as
a Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent for The New York Times and,
in recent years, a foreign affairs columnist. He made the shift as
if he had been not so much born to it as born from it. He hunts out
ideas as voraciously as an investigative reporter hunts out facts.
When trapped and brought in, they bear the markings of unfamiliar
subspecies.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman seems to lack a receptor for received opinions.
Conversely, when the nonreceived opinion provokes your
disagreement, this is less apt to be a knee-jerk. On the contrary,
you hobble a ways with him before turning back, and then with some
reluctance since not only are the ideas provocative, even when you
disagree with them, but also the entertainment _ the anecdotes and
the ``ding'' of a phrase _ is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   The reader's brains are agitated like dice. The throw may turn
out differently than Friedman intended; he has provided facts and
arguments that allow it to. In ``The Lexus and the Olive Tree,'' a
spirited and imaginative exploration of our new order of economic
globalization, and the instant technological and financial networks
that have brought it about, the author is upbeat. Inevitable is his
word, and his exuberance sometimes seems like tub-thumping. Yet the
word is less that of an advocate than of a prophet who, not long
after you mark him down as John the Baptist, gives occasional
glimpses of what seems to be an Inner Jeremiah.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible for readers to reverse this Inner into
their Outer, reading, for example, a line Friedman offers from
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, a major global as
well as national player. Referring to an environment of
international mergers, scurrying currency traders, the
instantaneous Internet-provided efficiency with which vast shifts
of capital are decided and accomplished, Greenspan acknowledged
that the older order of slower change and more security, though
less efficient, was ``more tranquil and certainly less threatening
to those with only moderate or lesser skills.'' God must have loved
the common people, having made so many, but apparently he was not
as smart as the artificers of the new global order.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus of the title, built in a process of superautomation,
is Friedman's symbol for this order, with its advantages and also _
I'm not sure if the author intends it _ an availability mainly to
the rich. (Friedman says his is secondhand.) The olive tree,
rooted, taking generations to mature and deeply prized, stands for
tradition with its constraints and also its humane values. Friedman
prizes these as well; his book, successful in so much, never
manages fully to confront the two, let alone reconcile them, though
it would like to.
</P>
<P>
   The author uses his skills as reporter and analyst to conduct a
breathtaking tour, one that possesses the exhilarating qualities of
flight and the stomach-hollowing ones of free fall. Bond markets,
currency fluctuations, the operations of hedge funds, finance
ministries and Groups of Five, Seven or Whatever, all page turners
for many of us (an excellent thing in a book, the reverse in a
newspaper) are made clear. Not only clear but interesting, not only
interesting but necessary to us, as war news becomes necessary when
we know we are at war. (The writer is certain we are, though he is
hopeful of a profitable victory.)
</P>
<P>
   He does it by his insistence on making connections: politics,
finance, military policy, culture, the operations of a small
business, a hedge trader, the National Basketball Association, and
a brilliantly imagined speech by Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin, explaining why he doesn't keep a telephone on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Leave that one for a moment. Friedman sets the historical shift
he is expounding. He dates it from the fall of the Berlin wall.
From the artifact of a divided world we have moved to that of a
world united: the World Wide Web. It is a striking image though
neither did the wall, porous from the start, completely divide, nor
does the Web completely unite. In fact, it may come to divide the
haves and have-nots even more drastically than before, as Friedman
allows and Greenspan concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Superpowers are being partly superseded by the financial markets
or, as he puts it, the supermarkets. The United States can destroy
by dropping bombs, the supermarkets by downgrading bonds. ``Don't
congratulate me,'' a newly named Indian finance minister told a
friend, ``I am only half a minister. The other half is in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to what Friedman usefully labels the ``golden
straitjacket'': the detailed set of fiscal and policy requirements
imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and _
more and more important _ by the bond rating agencies that
determine whether a country will receive credit. When President
Clinton visited Canada some years ago, Friedman writes, he got
second place in the headlines to ``the man from Moody's'' who was
conducting a rating check. So back to Rubin's nonexistent
telephone. No use calling me, Friedman imagines him telling a
foreign finance minister entreating for a gout of fiscal oxygen.
The American government itself lives in fear of the credit raters.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's faith in the transforming and boat-lifting potential
of globalization _ he argues that it can, oddly, encourage
democracy _ and his sheer delight in tracing out its connections,
do not preclude doubts. He can be eloquently outraged about the
growing gap between rich and poor and the threat to the
environment. He might have done more justice to his own shrewd
explorations had he brought his pluses and minuses together more
closely and scrappily instead of laying them out so far apart.
</P>
<P>
   He quotes an Israeli political thinker, Yaron Ezrahi: ``The most
arbitrary powers in history always hid under the claim of some
impersonal logic _ God, the laws of nature, the laws of the
market.'' Ezrahi continues: ``The same could happen with
globalization. Many will see it as little more than a mask used by
certain economic elites for taking away the voice of the individual
citizen.'' For the most part, though, Friedman accepts the current
version of the invisible hand: globalize, or the economic forces
that be will condemn you to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Just to toss into Friedman's capacious pot, though, there is
also the king of Persia demanding of a beggar why he too claimed to
be king. Official king: ``Where is your treasury then?'' Beggar:
``Where, oh king, are my needs?'' Not an answer that Moody's would
rate.

DEAR DREAMWORKS: YOUR LETTER WENT TOO FAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass., Ore., Colo.)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounded like a letter from a love-smitten stalker.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which appeared to have been printed out from a home
computer, arrived in a plain envelope with no return address.
``Dearest,'' it began, ``Do you know how in love with you I am?''
It went on: ``I have fallen in love without taking a step ... When
I'm close to you, I feel your hair brush my cheek when it does not.
I look away from you sometimes, then I look back.''
</P>
<P>
   That letter arrived on Tuesday. On Friday, another arrived, in a
similar envelope, addressed in the same computer type. This one
read: ``Dearest, Hope you got my letter. `The Love Letter' will
open in the smaller theater next to `Star Wars' on May 21st. Hope
to see you there.''
</P>
<P>
   The two letters, which were received by many editors and
reporters around the country who cover the media industry, turned
out to be a publicity stunt by the Dreamworks SKG film studio.
</P>
<P>
   The letters frightened several recipients, and some said they
were annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was creepy and disconcerting,'' said Jennifer Barr, a
senior editor at Elle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Millea, a senior editor at Premiere magazine, was equally
disdainful. ``It was utterly bad timing, in light of all the bad
things that happened this week in the world, and in the magazine
world,'' she said, referring to the school shootings in Colorado
and the death from cancer of Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper's
Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a turn-off,'' Ms. Millea said. ``It's right up there with
sending a ticking clock for a terrorist film. Not funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Press, the director of marketing for Dreamworks, said that
she saw no need to offer any apologies. In fact, Ms. Press said,
that she had heard from women who were disappointed when they
discovered that they did not really have an anonymous admirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it,'' she said, ``but lighten up.''

   Barricade Guidelines
</P>
<P>
   Many people watching CNN's live coverage of the high school
shootings in Littleton, Colo., last week were shocked to hear the
voice of a student still inside Columbine High School, who spoke by
cell phone to the local television station, KUSA, and told where he
was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew at that point where the gunmen were, or whether they
had a TV set turned on during their siege. But KUSA's and CNN's
live broadcast could possibly have endangered more students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty Dennis at KUSA has said that in retrospect she might not
do that again,'' said Barbara Cochran, president of the
Radio-Television News Directors Association. Ms. Dennis, KUSA's
news director, did not return a call Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cochran added: ``These things suddenly explode on you,
and a new technology enters the picture _ this is the first time I
know of where kids in school had cell phones and could call out _
and people haven't had a chance to think about it and establish a
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, has rules, said the senior
vice president for domestic news, Earl Casey. ``Our primary
guideline,'' he said, ``is don't do anything that could endanger
human life or human safety, and don't endanger an ongoing law
enforcement effort.''
</P>
<P>
   To help journalists learn from one anothers' experience, the
Media Studies Center of the Freedom Forum in New York has started a
project to produce a handbook on fairness for broadcast
journalists. Av Westin, a former news executive for CBS and ABC, is
compiling the handbook, which will gather the ``best practices''
advice of journalists from the major networks and station groups.
</P>
<P>
   He found that stations in Portland, Ore.; Tampa, Fla., and
Boston already have agreements with their local police departments
setting rules for coverage of what they call ``barricaded assailant
situations.'' They set distances for how close news helicopters can
get to the scene, agreed to use pool cameras in some cases and
decided not to broadcast live footage of SWAT teams in action. In
exchange, the police agreed to allow pool cameras better locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not me on Mount Olympus pronouncing things. This is
fellow journalists saying how they handled it,'' Westin said of the
handbook. ``If guidelines become second nature, coverage will be
better.''

 &HT;    SPIFFED-UP CAPITAL IMPRESSES NATO VISITORS
 &HT;    With NATO-SUMMIT.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secured and sanitized, the nation's capital has
impressed the thousands of journalists and diplomats who converged
for three days of NATO meetings, press conferences and dinners.
</P>
<P>
   With streets sealed and several blocks barricaded in the
downtown area where the conference was held, the scene was serene
and clean almost to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different this time,'' Vlad Nistor, a member of the
Romanian delegation, marveled Sunday about his second visit to the
District of Columbia. ``Ordinary people are not around _ only
police cars and heads of state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very positive impression of the city, but I doubt
that this is the normal situation,'' said Paul Koopman, a newspaper
reporter from the Netherlands who was making his first visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems suspiciously safe and clean,'' he said. ``It reminds
me of a story of our queen who thought something should be done
about the odd smell at all the hospitals that she visited. It was
fresh paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The District government has viewed NATO's 50th Anniversary
Summit and a gathering of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council as
a chance to show that things are changing in a city long plagued by
images of crime, corruption and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity is for the District to put a welcome mat out
to the world, not a trap door,'' new Mayor Anthony Williams told
the Washington Post last week. ``They will see that Washington,
D.C., is a city on a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   The early reviews from the well-traveled European visitors were
glowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been absolutely delighted with the city,'' said Lance
Prince, a member of the delegation from the United Kingdom.
``Everything looks fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Saturday and Sunday provided glorious spring weather _
cool temperatures, bright sunshine and cloudless blue skies. White
dogwoods and red tulips are blooming, and trees are bursting with
young green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   While tourists abound in normal numbers, most local residents
have heeded warnings to stay away from the blocked streets, so
traffic has remained unusually light. Anti-NATO demonstrators were
kept well away from the meetings and motorcades that occupied
</P>
<P>
   the 3,400 journalists and 1,700 diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   But some visitors missed the expected bustle of a metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very beautiful city, but in comparison with New York,
it's much calmer,'' said Andre Rubbens, press spokesman for the
Belgian defense minister. ``Without being insulting, I would say
that it's a quite provincial city.''

 By JANE SMILEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wholesale transformation of my writing life began, I suppose
inevitably, with just a notion. I was beginning a new novel, a
comic novel about horse racing, and I have to say I was
inordinately pleased with it.
</P>
<P>
   I had written a comic novel before, ``Moo,'' and I had certainly
been my own best audience, sitting in my office, writing funny
lines and pages and chapters, and laughing all the while. From time
to time during ``Moo'' I would sashay out, a couple of pages in
hand, and read something aloud, only to be greeted with
well-meaning but blank stares. What in the world, who in the world,
was I talking about?
</P>
<P>
   In the end ``Moo'' found an audience, and several years after I
so enjoyed myself, I started getting reviews and letters from
others who also enjoyed themselves. But too late. I was writing
``The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton'' by that
time, and was no longer in the mood.
</P>
<P>
   So. I had a new friend and a new novel. What could be simpler
than to bring the two together, that is, read the thing aloud to
him chapter by chapter?
</P>
<P>
   My friend, known as Jack, was a little perplexed. He was not a
reader and had not read any of my books. He didn't know what his
role was. Should he offer suggestions? Would he laugh in the right
places? Would he get bored and fall asleep, especially since he
knew nothing about horse racing?
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't tell him was that the main point was my own
enjoyment. His presence was merely to be the occasion for me to
laugh at my own jokes. Actually he performed perfectly. All he did
was laugh, nod, say mmmm, yes and thank you. Nary a suggestion, not
to mention a criticism. When I was in the middle of chapters, he
would ask me when the next reading was going to be. I began pushing
myself a bit, in order to finish enough to be able to invite him
over.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the transformation of my process to
begin. From time to time I would write something and think not
``Oh, I like that,'' but ``Oh, Jack will like that.'' I would laugh
even harder, laughing for him, for me, and in anticipation of the
pleasure of sharing with him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it take long for him to orient himself in my esthetic.
The first two or three chapters he didn't quite understand or
perfectly comprehend, but then I began to notice that just where I
had intended a particular irony or a specific point, he would
almost always grunt, chuckle, or murmur.
</P>
<P>
   There were two ways of thinking about this. One was that my
words were communicating clearly on levels of both sense and
emotion. The other was that he and I were in sync. I chose both of
the above.
</P>
<P>
   After about 150 pages, maybe three months of reading, he offered
a suggestion. I bridled but hid this. He was, after all, respectful
and courteous in his manner. I listened. All he wanted was some
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I realized that he was the ideal audience even in
this, that he always needed clarification in just those spots where
I had been confused or careless. He was listening attentively
enough to know when he didn't understand and to be able to
distinguish what he didn't understand from what he did understand.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he only rarely requested clarification came to
mean that he understood almost everything. What a relief that was.
Then he offered a joke. All along I had been including jokes about
animals in the novel, and when he told me this joke, I laughed so
hard I threw the phone across the room. After I put it in and read
it back to him, he corrected my wording and my timing just a little
bit. The first time, I bridled at that, too.
</P>
<P>
   There was the temptation, which I instantly gave into, to depict
our relationship, kaleidoscopically rearranged, in the novel and
then read it back to him. These parts of the readings always
aroused many hmmm's but no overt discussion or response. I
understood that my right to my point of view was being honored, and
that he understood that he was being shown what it meant to be
observed in detail, one of the trials of intimacy with a writer.
</P>
<P>
   We had a few discussions about the nature of observation:
Honesty, detachment and a measure of courage were required on the
part of both the observer and the observed. These discussions
showed me that I, too, was being observed, and that the truly
interesting thing was not our particular observations of each other
but the act of observation itself.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that more than any of my other novels this one evolved
in the making does not seem related to its being read aloud. But I
often sat down to a new chapter and didn't have the first notion of
what I was going to write, something I had never encountered, or
perhaps I should say suffered, before. I often thought I knew
exactly what was going to happen to a particular character, or how
he or she would fit into the climax and the denouement, and I
almost never did. But although I struggled with my imagination more
than I ever had, what appeared on the computer screen after the
struggle surprised and delighted me more than it ever had, and I
was always eager to share it.
</P>
<P>
   There was an improvisational exuberance that excited and
entertained us both that, in retrospect, became the goal of each
day's writing. I suspect that having a ready and nonjudgmental
audience gave me the freedom and comfort not to know what I was
doing, to accept that a way of getting to the end that I did not
understand would come to be understood once I got there.
</P>
<P>
   Every other novel I had written had been a secret; that seemed
to be inherent in novel writing. You went into your room one day,
and some years later you presented the results of your private
meditations, all neatened up and complete.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good life for a secretive person, but I found it
uncomfortable, a sort of double agentry in which who I was for a
good part of every day was unavailable to my dearest companions and
perhaps seemed to them to be just another form of commodity making.
The process that for me produced an evolution of thoughts,
feelings, esthetics and identity for them produced a book and an
income. Including Jack in my process made him party to the
evolution, part of the evolution. We do not have even this benign
secret between us.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Through this I came to see novel writing as more like running
water through a hose than putting objects into a box. Because I
spoke the novel as it came out, I was also more aware of how it
went in: of the questions I asked people and their answers, of the
things I observed and used, of what I eavesdropped upon and read
and cooked together into the day's offering.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``After Bakhtin,'' David Lodge reflects upon the
failure of much literary theory to grapple with the richness of the
novel, and he locates this richness in the variety of voices that
enter into the narrative, even when the author seems to have a
strong voice of his or her own. This came to be my daily
experience, a myriad of voices entering me and holding sway,
sometimes for a whole chapter, sometimes for only a word.
</P>
<P>
   I had always thought of novel writing as a social activity: The
writer alone at a loud party in his office, entertaining a host of
characters that no one else could see or hear. But this time I
welcomed many more voices more actively, and they carried me,
flowed through me to Jack, were returned to me in his attention and
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I suppose, two parties engaged in a comic novel will
come to love each other, and we did, and the novel will grow more
comic as the possibilities of love grow between them, as it did. We
have discussed every piece I've written in the last year. When I
told him this morning that I was going to write this piece on ``the
writing life,'' he said, ``What are you going to write about?'' I
said I didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Then I said: ``The writing life. I give you 30 seconds to come
up with a word, any word.'' Thirty seconds later he said, ``Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I thought, a novel is a spot where language, movement,
feeling, and thought jell for a moment, through the agency of,
let's say, a particular volunteer, but it is not an object or a
possession. It is an act of love.

PATENTS: TREATMENT FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION; DATABASE OF
ILLUSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN

<P>
   With the recent success of Viagra, the impotence drug for men, a
number of companies are scurrying to develop sexual-dysfunction
therapies aimed at an even larger market: women.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in The Journal of the American Medical
Association, for example, reported that 43 percent of women suffer
from sexual dysfunction, compared with 31 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a $5-billion-a-year market,'' contends Dr.
Michael Wysor, who along with his wife, Dr. Wanda Drinnon Wysor,
patented an ointment this month that when applied to the clitoris,
the inventors say, can induce multiple orgasms in women.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wysor, who is based in Knoxville, Tenn., and who
specializes in treating impotence, said of the ointment: ``It
increases blood flow tremendously and basically eliminates the need
for foreplay. This is going to have an impact equal to that seen
with the introduction of the Pill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wysors thought that theirs was the first such patent to be
issued, so they were surprised to learn last week that a similar
patent had been issued the month before to Vivus, a drug company in
Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Wysors' patent appears to cover a broad range of hormonelike
chemicals called prostaglandins in treating female sexual
dysfunction as well as in preventing yeast infections and improving
vaginal muscle tone.
</P>
<P>
   A prostaglandin known as alprostadil is already on the market to
treat male impotence. Indeed, Vivus sells a pellet version of
alprostadil that is inserted into the tip of the penis. An
injectable version of alprostadil is sold by Upjohn under the name
of Caverject. Other companies have been developing a cream version,
which has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   So what advantage would a prostaglandin-based gel have over
Viagra, which is being tested for use in women?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a naturally occurring substance delivered locally, so
there is a very low incidence of systemic side effects,'' said
Leland Wilson, president of Vivus. Because Viagra is taken as a
pill, he said, it has to circulate in the whole body, ``to the
heart, brain, and lungs, in order to get to a small area in the
genital region.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivus thus far has tested its gel only in female cats and
rabbits. Though the Wysors have not conducted formal clinical
trials, their patent refers to testing done on human volunteers who
experienced on average ``enhanced sexual response in three to four
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the similarity between the two patents? Normally, a
conflict between pending patent applications is resolved before the
patents are issued, in a secret procedure called an
``interference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Patent Office goofed here,'' said Michael Ebert,
the Wysors' patent lawyer, who is based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert contended that the Wysors' patent was strong because it
was based upon human studies. Officials at Vivus said they were
still studying the rival patent but noted that they applied for,
and received, their patent before the Wysors did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a bigger, better and earlier patent,'' said Nina
Ferrari, a spokeswoman for Vivus.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is likely that any conflict between the two
patents would have to be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   The Wysors received patent 5,891,915. Vivus was awarded patent
5,877,216.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures Available on Patent Web Site
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a ceremony at the Commerce Department, the Patent
and Trademark Office demonstrated a new feature of the searchable
patent database on its Web site. The new feature? The ability to
display the illustrations that accompany patents. Until recently,
the site displayed only the text of a patent and not the pictures
that went with it.
</P>
<P>
   The acting commissioner, Todd Dickinson, successfully linked up
to photographs that appear in a patent recently issued to Bert
Vogelstein, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health. Then
Dickinson tried to do the same for a patent that was recently
issued to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the images for the IBM patent were not forthcoming.
Nonetheless, the Patent Office says that everything is in good
working order. Those wanting to try for themselves to see images on
the Patent Office site may need to plug special software into their
browsers. More information is available at the site
(www.uspto.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Patent images have been available on line since 1997 on IBM's
own patent site (www.ibm.patents.com), which it operates as a
philanthropic gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Esquire and GQ, nominees for National Magazine Awards
this week, are rival men's publications headed by two former
colleagues and sharing a demonstrated interest in what might
politely be called male anatomy. But they approach the subject _ as
they do many other things _ very differently.
</P>
<P>
   At the GQ Man of the Year Awards, a star-studded,
multimillion-dollar, black-tie affair held in October at Radio City
Music Hall, an audience of some 5,000 watched as the rock star
Sting accepted his award. He hoisted the statuette _ a muscular,
nude male torso sculpted in glass _ and then made a speech about
the energetic amorous life he shares with his wife, Trudie Styler.
The crowd roared with glee. The proceedings were, in a phrase,
testosterone-rich.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of Esquire, however, the tone is a bit more quirky
and earnest, much like the magazine's editor in chief, David
Granger. In November, while the Man of the Year cover was GQ's
best-selling issue of the year, Esquire's cover (its worst seller
of 1998) featured a profile of Fred Rogers, the 70-year-old
children's television-show host.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, writer Tom Junod described his subject's daily
athletic-club swim. He observed Rogers' locker-room changing
session and described in jaw-dropping prose _ that is, for people
not accustomed to thinking about their childhood heroes in the buff
_ Rogers' nude body.
</P>
<P>
   GQ: Sting's virility. Esquire: naked septuagenarians.
</P>
<P>
   The difference speaks volumes about these magazines and their
editors, who were once mentor (Art Cooper) and protege (Granger).
They have been vaguely at odds since Granger left GQ in May 1997 _
pilfering several GQ staff members along the way, including one who
has the letters ``GQ'' tattooed on his arm _ to take the top
editing job at Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   GQ, put out by the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications, is
aimed at men entranced by luxury, fashion, sports and the notion of
what some call ``the good life'' (a theme of the May issue). It has
been and remains the financially stronger of these two titles in
the men's general-interest magazine field.
</P>
<P>
   But Esquire, published by Hearst Corp., has under Granger aimed
for quirkier, more personal writing _ like one writer's essay about
his addiction to the painkiller Vicodin, or another's about his
heart surgery _ and is showing signs of a small but palpable
resurgence after a nearly two-decade decline.
</P>
<P>
   The two men couldn't be more different. Cooper is known for his
sartorial grandeur, his occasional bouts in the tabloid press with
celebrities like Sharon Stone _ there was that episode in 1998 when
he refused to let her pose for GQ's cover with live zebras _ and
his martini lunches with supermodels. The soft-spoken Granger, on
the other hand, lives in the suburbs with his family and has said
that he prefers never to see his name in boldface type.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Cooper-Granger heat gets its most direct test
yet. After a lonely spell of five years, Esquire has been nominated
for not just one but three National Magazine Awards, in the coveted
categories of essays and criticism (for which it has two
nominations) and feature writing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, GQ, which has been nominated for 21 awards since
1992, is a nominee in only one category, feature writing. The
winners of the awards, which are presented by the American Society
of Magazine Editors, are to be announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in nominations fuels a continuing contretemps
between GQ and Esquire. When his protege left for Esquire two years
ago, Cooper gibed to reporters that Granger had been ``burning to
be an editor in chief.'' Later, he called Granger's magazine
``unsubtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a seemingly benevolent and perhaps more publicity-conscious
Cooper says in a politely worded e-mail that Granger ``is a
talented editor and has done a nice job with the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Granger, meanwhile, will say nothing negative about his former
boss. ``My relationship with Art is complicated,'' he said. ``Art
has done a very good magazine for a long while, and I continue to
marvel at some of the good writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Solidly moribund for most of the 1990s, Esquire was mainly
overlooked by the American Society of Magazine Editors in those
years, and its annual ad pages hit an apocalyptic low of 608, to
GQ's 1,558, in 1996, according to the Publishers Information
Bureau. Its circulation slid from 747,000 in 1994 to 673,500 in
1998, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that people had totally written
Esquire off,'' Granger said. ``When I took the job, people asked
me, `What are you thinking?' They assumed Esquire couldn't be a
vital magazine again. But all the signs point to a tremendous era
of vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding that vitality are not just the award nominations, but
also an intriguing literary find that Granger will publish this
summer _ three previously unpublished short stories by the
postmodern writer Raymond Carver _ and a minor burst in advertising
pages. For its issues of January through May, Esquire can count 348
ad pages, up 32 percent from the corresponding period last year,
according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   GQ, by contrast, counts 586 pages from January through May,
which, while formidable, still represents a 24.8 percent decline
from the same months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Salembier, the publisher of Esquire, attributed the
magazine's advertising growth to Granger's editorial vision,
adding, ``Give readers a product they want, and advertisers will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Esquire's successes have come in a less-than-perfect period for
GQ. There was a perilous 17.5 percent decline in GQ's newsstand
sales for the second half of 1998. Then its fourth publisher in
five years, Jack Laschever, resigned this month, citing medical
reasons. But Thomas Florio, his newly appointed successor, does not
seem worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they showed up at the race in their uniform,
doesn't mean they're going to win,'' Florio said of Esquire.
``They're just at the starting line.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with GQ, in fact, Esquire hasn't even gone that far.
Since Hearst rescued the magazine by acquiring it from Esquire
Magazine Group in 1987, Esquire has never made a profit. Ms.
Salembier would not discuss specific losses, but she said there
might be a chance that Esquire would be in the black by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   GQ, by contrast, is a moneymaker for Conde Nast, though the
company will not disclose how big the profits are. In 1997, the
last full year of Richard Beckman's tenure as publisher, the
magazine generated $75.8 million in advertising revenue, according
to the Publishers Information Bureau, up 17 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, revenue reached $88.6 million, and Beckman _ who had by
then earned the sobriquet ``Mad Dog'' for his aggressive sales
strategy _ moved to Conde Nast's Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit,'' Ms. Salembier said, ``that after Richard
Beckman, no one scares me.'' She added, ``I heard they started
calling him `Mad Cow' Beckman around the office.'' Beckman
responded by saying of Ms. Salembier, ``We sort of internally
thought of her as one of the great marketing minds of the Dark
Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Esquire's advertising revenue was $42.6 million, less
than half GQ's. And advertisers still consider GQ the stronger buy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``GQ is huge,'' said Steve Greenberger, the director of print
media at Grey Mediacom, a unit of Grey Advertising. ``The question
is, in this more challenging share-of-market war that is going to
be witnessed not only between GQ and Esquire but among all the
men's magazines, it's whether GQ can still gain significant
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Both publishers acknowledge that the men's magazine market is
changing. Reed Phillips, a managing partner at DeSilva &AMP; Phillips,
an investment banking firm that advises the media community, said
that fewer readers were interested in general-interest men's
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening with men's magazines like GQ and Esquire, in
the general-interest category, is that they are facing competition
from more niche-oriented magazines like Men's Health, Outside,
Details and Maxim,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be more concerned with who is chipping away at
their market rather than locking horns with one another,'' Phillips
said. But locking horns is what improves magazines, and it is the
identities of the two top men that inform the heart and soul of GQ
and Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   At a party celebrating Cooper's 15th anniversary as GQ editor,
held in September at the Four Seasons, guests received a booklet
with Cooper's devilish caricature on the cover. Inside, a
contributor to the magazine had written a list of qualities she
could ascribe to Cooper and those she could not.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``What's Art'' the following entries appeared: Florence,
Italy; Cole Porter; Dom Perignon; steak, and GQ. Under the heading
``What's Not'': Cleveland, Ohio; John Tesh; tofu burger, and
Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Art and I are very different people,'' Granger later
said of the unflattering comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Granger and Cooper do have a bet riding on this week's awards.
The winner has to take the loser to lunch at the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's OK,'' Granger said. ``Even if it is his
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who answered by e-mail, offered his own salvo: ``If
neither of us wins, Valerie Salembier buys us lunch.''

 &HT;    U.S. BATTLE TANKS ARRIVING IN ALBANIA
 &HT;    410&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ Stepping up its psychological
pressure on Yugoslavia, NATO on Sunday began deploying limited
numbers of American heavy battle tanks into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks, arriving from the 1st Armored Division in Germany,
are intended to help protect U.S. Army troops on duty in Albania, a
U.S. military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Yugoslavian generals realize, the 1st Armored Division is
one that thrust deep into Kuwait on the first day of the Desert
Storm ground war against Iraq in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said crew members of an MIA1 Abrams battle tank
would be made available for press interviews at this congested air
strip Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to allow the media to photograph at least
one Abrams tank on a runway, not far from the landing pads of the
Apache attack helicopters that made their highly publicized first
landing here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark, visiting U.S. soldiers here
for the second time in about a week, said the helicopter gunships _
seven more of which arrived Sunday _ would be put into action soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a specific date as of when the Apaches will be
operational, but we're on track and they won't be too long,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents in Belgrade, meanwhile, said a new wave of NATO
bombing raids Sunday temporarily knocked Serbian state TV off the
air for a second time since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, NATO missiles hit the northeastern industrial area of Nis
early Sunday, causing extensive damage, according to the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug. Five other missiles hit a chemical plant in
Lucani, about 60 miles south of Belgrade, Serb media said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said at a Brussels news conference
that neighboring Macedonia had agreed to allow the deployment of
additional British and German troops on its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment we have in Macedonia over 12,000'' troops, Shea
said. ``We are sending via Greece a second German battle group.
It's on its way. Also a second (British) battle group. This will
take the numbers up to something like 16,000'' in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been building an advance force in Macedonia for an
eventual peacekeeping operation in Kosovo where Serb forces have
driven out ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also announced that Romania and Slovenia had granted NATO
the use of air space for alliance military operations against
Yugoslavia. Bulgaria is expected to vote Monday to give similar
permission.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The arrival of top-of-the-line battle tanks in Albania is likely
to excite speculation about whether the first few M1A1s are the
forward wedge of a future ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Albania's high mountains and poor roads, it probably
would be impossible to move any significant number of tanks to the
Kosovo frontier by road or air, and they are too heavy to drop by
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be possible to use a ferryboat service that runs
across northern Albania to carry the heavy tanks most of the way to
the border.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry route follows the valley of the river Drin from the
northern city of Shkoder to the riverside of Fierze. From there it
might be possible to develop a further barge route across an
artificial lake called Lake Fierze eastward to the border of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 1,600 years, generations of military planners have
considered the Drin valley a potential invasion route through the
Balkans. In the 4th century A.D., the Romans erected the citadel of
Vig along the river bank to prevent invasions from present-day
Kosovo by the Ostrogoths and Visigoths.

   LOS ANGELES _ Tax time was crunch time for the World Wide Web
site of Intuit Inc., the supplier of personal finance software.
Traffic shot up to as much as 20 times its levels the rest of year,
as customers downloaded the latest revisions to Intuit's Turbotax
tax preparation program.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike tax seasons past, this time Intuit had the help of
Sandpiper Networks Inc., a start-up company that has developed a
way to speed the delivery of information on the Web. ``Customers
got it faster than they would have with us,'' said Rick Parkinson,
director of the planning and delivery group at Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper and a rival start-up company, Akamai Technologies
Inc., are pioneering a way to distribute material over the Internet
that avoids much of the congestion that can turn the World Wide Web
into the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sandpiper is expected to announce that America
Online, the largest provider of Internet access, has made a small
investment in the company and will incorporate Sandpiper's
technology into its network.
</P>
<P>
   The Inktomi Corp., a supplier of Internet software is expected
to invest in the start-up company along with two Sandpiper
customers _ the Times Mirror Corp. and NBC. Sandpiper is raising a
total of $21.5 million in this, its second round of raising venture
capital, with each of the corporate partners believed to be putting
in $2 million to $3 million and the rest coming from venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, meanwhile, recently scored a coup of its own, hiring as
its president and chief executive George H. Conrades, formerly
president of the GTE Corp.'s BBN unit and before that a top
executive at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   As more corporations turn to the Web for marketing and sales,
long waits on the Internet are becoming bad for business. While the
companies can improve service somewhat by buying more powerful
computers for their Web sites, they have less control over the
traffic jams that can develop between their sites and the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since nobody controls the Internet, how do you insure quality
of service?'' said Scott Yara, vice president for marketing at
Sandpiper, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The answer proposed by both Sandpiper and Akamai is to
distribute the contents of a Web site to server computers dispersed
throughout the Internet, so that information does not always have
to wend its way through the network from one site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole name of the game here is to push content to the edge
of the Internet, very, very close to the end user,'' said David
Goodtree, vice president for marketing at Akamai, which is based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One use of such a service would be to help with big Web events
that could bring the Internet to its knees. The Los Angeles Times,
owned by Times Mirror, used Sandpiper to help cope with the online
demand for the Starr Report last year and for the newspaper's
coverage of the Academy Awards in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandpiper and Akamai contend, and some analysts agree, that
distribution of Web content will eventually be a full-time
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar technique, known as caching, is already in
use. If, for example, an Internet service provider in Los Angeles
finds heavy demand among its customers for a Web page based in New
York, it will create a local copy of the page in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual producer of the Web page in New York has no
control over this cache, and thus no way of preventing the
information on it from becoming outdated. Moreover, the producer of
the Web page usually does not know how many visits or ``hits'' the
copy on the cache receives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sandpiper and Akamai sell their service directly to the Web
content providers, automatically distributing the content to
servers, updating the material as necessary and keeping track of
the number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper was founded three years ago by David Farber and Andrew
D. Swart, software experts who had worked for Interactive Systems,
a Unix company. Leo S. Spiegel, whom they recruited to be
president, started a computer company while still in college. That
company, LAN Systems, was sold to the Intel Corp. and R.R. Donnelly
&AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which says its name means ``intelligent, clever and
cool'' in Hawaiian, grew out of a math class at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, the MIT researcher known as the father of the
Web, suggested to Tom Leighton, a professor of applied mathematics,
that ``load balancing'' on the Internet would be a good problem for
his class to tackle. The classwork led to algorithms that are used
by Akamai, which was founded by Leighton and a graduate student,
Danny Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which is only now beginning commercial service, says
that customers for its trial service included five of the 10 most
popular Web sites. But Goodtree would not identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai seems to have a more sophisticated approach, but
Sandpiper has the advantage of being first, said Peter Christy,
principal at Collaborative Research, a market research firm in Los
Altos, Calif. Akamai also has deployed 400 servers, compared with
only 32 for Sandpiper. ``We could handle the load today of 15
Yahoos and the top 20 Web sites combined,'' Goodtree said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with America Online and Inktomi could help change
that. Inktomi already provides more than 300 cache servers to
America Online, and Sandpiper will now be able to use those, as
well as Inktomi servers in other networks. ``It really expands our
footprint,'' Spiegel said of Sandpiper (which calls its service
Footprint).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the companies, though, might not be
each other but new entrants expected in the market. Julian of
Forrester said these could include big computer service providers
like IBM and Electronic Data Systems as well as companies like
Exodus Communications that provide computer sites used to host Web
pages. Even Intel announced last week that it would enter the
business of providing servers to host Web pages. But some of these
companies might decide to ally themselves with Sandpiper or Akamai
rather than compete with them.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge could be persuading companies to entrust
distribution of Web pages to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson of Intuit, for instance, said it made sense to use
Sandpiper to save Intuit from having to invest in enough capacity
to handle the rare peak demand. But at times of normal demand,
Intuit prefers to run its Web site by itself, to guard its
competitive information. ``You give up a little bit of control
every time you give something to someone else,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lemont Southworth, technology manager for latimes.com, said
another problem was that Sandpiper's system cannot handle the
customized advertisements that many Web sites offer.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible threat is that if technologies like high-speed
cable modems and optical fiber can sufficiently reduce congestion,
there would be less need to store Web pages close to users.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies insist that cable modems, by increasing the
flow of information between users' computers and Internet sites,
will only increase the strain on Web site providers, much as
widening freeway on-ramps can worsen congestion on the freeway
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's the next evolution of the Internet,''
Spiegel said.

CLINTON, YELTSIN CONFER ON NEXT STEP TO END KOSOVO STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and the NATO allies pressed a
carrot-and-stick campaign for ending the bloodbath in Kosovo
Sunday, encouraging intensified diplomatic intervention by Russia
while warning that the military alliance will now defend nations
bordering Yugoslavia from any Serbian attack.
</P>
<P>
   The punishing military offensive against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic dominated the final day of the three-day summit
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, just as it had through a
gathering once planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
Cold War-era alliance and map a new strategy for combating future
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, winding up the summit with a final statement,
emphasized that even amid fledgling diplomatic overtures, the
19-member NATO alliance will ``intensify our actions, military and
economic, until we achieve our objectives in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed that the alliance would protect Slovenia and six
non-NATO nations bordering Yugoslavia from any Yugoslav attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance ``will stand by the neighboring countries that have
accepted risks and hardship in support of this effort,'' Clinton
declared. ``If Mr. Milosevic threatens them for helping us, we will
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said that
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed in an earlier
telephone call for the Kremlin leader to press ahead with
diplomatic efforts to press Milosevic to accept an armed occupation
force in Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant state
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and the Russians are ``very serious about trying to find
a peaceful solution,'' Berger told the Cable News Network.
``President Clinton encouraged President Yeltsin to do so and I
think there will be continuing contacts over the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Yeltsin conversation, which lasted for nearly an
hour, triggered preparations for Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, fluent in Russian, to travel to Europe to huddle with
Chernomyrdin in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed U.S. support for
stepped-up Russian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be positive to have the Russians on board,'' Solana
said. ``We want to recuperate the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana said keeping the Russians involved in the quest for a
diplomatic solution could help avoid a Russian veto in the
15-member U.N. Security Council when and if NATO seeks U.N.
participation in drafting a peace agreement acceptable to
Milosevic, or the supervision of a postwar occupation force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that, Russia will be important,'' Solana explained.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the ``biggest stumbling block'' for suspending the
allied air campaign that began on March 24 remains the disagreement
with Milosevic over ``the nature of an international presence that
would go into Kosovo'' to facilitate the return of 1.4 million
ethnic Albanians who have been uprooted by Milosevic's ``ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO allies favor a heavily armed international force, including
troops from NATO countries, Russia and Ukraine, to provide security
for frightened ethnic Albanians who have been driven from their
homes in Europe's most horrific campaign against civilians since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Berger dismissed relying on unarmed international monitors with
``clipboards and pencils'' as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has to play a significant role so that the Kosovars can
feel that they can come back in safety,'' Berger emphasized. ``That
is not something that Mr. Milosevic has yet agreed to but I believe
that the Russians will continue to work to try to move this towards
a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conversation with Yeltsin followed up on a peace
mission to Belgrade on Thursday by former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has close ties to Vice President Al Gore.
Chernomyrdin won Milosevic's acceptance of a U.N.-controlled
``international presence'' in Kosovo to guarantee the safe return
of refugees. NATO leaders rejected Milosevic's ill-defined
commitment as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   NATO allies have been in touch with the Russians for nearly a
month to find an end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Premier Yevgeny M. Primakov met with Milosevic in
Belgrade on March 30 to discuss a diplomatic compromise. But
Milosevic said he would not seek a political solution until the
NATO bombing campaign ended.
</P>
<P>
   NATO rejected suspension of the bombing campaign until Milosevic
accepted NATO's conditions. But on Friday, NATO leaders softened
their conditions, offering to suspend bombing if Milosevic began
withdrawing forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged allied support to the leaders of Albania,
Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Slovenia during a
meeting with so-called ``front-line states.'' On Saturday, the
alliance extended comparable security guarantees to the democratic
government in Montenegro, which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Belgrade challenges its neighbors as a result of the
presence of NATO, we will respond,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the defense guarantees did not match iron-clad
guarantees protecting the NATO members. Under the NATO agreement,
an attack on one partner is deemed an attack on all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have given all the assurances that we will take with
the utmost concern any problem that they may have,'' Solana said,
adding: ``I think we have demonstrated that we are standing by
these countries and will not allow them to be destabilized as a
result of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania and Macedonia are providing sites for camps for hundreds
of thousands of refugees from Kosovo as well as facilities for
thousands of allied troops.
</P>
<P>
   Romania and Slovenia have opened their air space to NATO war
planes and humanitarian flights _ a gesture expected by Bulgaria on
Monday. Croatia, Bulgaria and Bosnia are cooperating with
enforcement of an economic embargo against Yugoslavia. That
blockade is expected to tighten in the days ahead with NATO
enforcement of a ``visit and search regime'' on ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called the defense of Yugoslavia's
neighbors ``a direct and material interest of the alliance,''
adding: ``We will not tolerate threats against them or attacks on
them by Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of Clinton, Solana and leaders from Yugoslavia's
neighbors underscored that ``in the region, Milosevic is all
alone,'' Shea emphasized. ``He is a pariah in his own back yard.''

</P>
<P>
   Berger, Clinton's top security adviser, said that Yeltsin
indicated in his telephone conversation with Clinton that Russia
would honor the oil embargo being imposed on Yugoslav oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect all nations, including the Russians, would
abide by a regime to put a halt to oil shipments,'' Berger said,
adding that he had heard ``nothing in the conversation today with
President Yeltsin that was to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and alliance leaders said they were laying plans for a
comprehensive recovery plan for the Balkans akin to the post-World
War II Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes security guarantees by NATO and assistance
from international financial institutions to help nations in the
Balkans build robust, free enterprise economies led by democratic
regimes that enjoy extensive trade ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the allies would launch ``a very important plan for
restabilization of the region'' in the days ahead, adding: ``We
really want to take as a priority the southeastern part of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea added: ``This area has got to stop being the bleeding wound
of Europe.''

NATO, ONCE WELCOMED BY MANY SERBS, IS NOW WIDELY REVILED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A year ago, Yugoslav government ministers
and the policy elite seriously pondered joining NATO's Partnership
for Peace program, a sort of training ground and waiting room for
alliance membership.
</P>
<P>
   While American officials were dubious, there was talk of
Belgrade's becoming Washington's partner for stability in the
Balkans. Even the Yugoslav defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic,
talked of NATO as an instrument for collective security.
</P>
<P>
   Today, rather than welcoming the Yugoslav military into its
councils, NATO is trying to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary in Washington, the
alliance is bombing Yugoslavia every day and night, waging war on a
European nation because of its abuses of human rights in its
sovereign territory, the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Politika, a government mouthpiece, called NATO ``a
criminal organization, celebrating its 50th anniversary by dropping
bombs, destroying civilian objects and killing innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusan Kozic, who writes a normally amusing Sunday column, said,
``NATO has cut its birthday cake with hands bloodied to the
elbows.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Yugoslavs, who feel the unity of their country is at
stake, and especially to those old enough to have been steeped in
Tito's doctrine of nonalignment with either East or West, NATO's
war smacks of old-fashioned superpower aggression, not some new,
post-Cold-War doctrine of human rights and shared sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   However defensively, they believe that NATO's talk of
humanitarian intervention is selective and hypocritical, as its
warplanes bomb bridges, television stations, power stations, the
presidential residence and, by accident, passenger trains and even,
apparently, columns of the very Albanian refugees NATO is trying to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   Taking their cue in part from official media, many Serbs believe
that NATO's real aims are to dismember Yugoslavia further, to
create an independent Kosovo and even to cut off Serbia's northern
province of Vojvodina and the largely Muslim, southwestern region
of Sandzak from what would be a rump Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdan, a 31-year-old volleyball player, thinks that America
wants this weakened, shrunken Yugoslavia, no matter what American
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Kosovo is part of Serbia and then use the Albanian
pronunciation _ Kosova _ like some form of political correctness,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They support the KLA openly and talk of arming the KLA, which
wants independence,'' he said, referring to the ethnic Albanians'
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   He bemoaned how far Yugoslavia seems to have fallen. ``I thought
that we were a part of the same world,'' he said. ``I thought one
day we'd be in Europe and NATO. But the roots of the Serbian people
are in Kosovo, and I will go to defend it if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivana, a 36-year-old child therapist, becomes livid. ``I can't
stand this NATO and the West anymore,'' she said, dressed in blue
jeans and white Reeboks. ``The hypocrisy is unbelievable. They let
the Russians kill the Chechens and the British kill the Irish, and
the Americans created one of the biggest ethnic cleansings in the
world against the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any of those acts justified Serbian actions in
Kosovo, she said: ``Of course I know that the Serbian police have
done a lot of bad things to the Albanians in Kosovo. But it is not
the police who suffer now. I hate NATO because it is driving
innocent people crazy and making little children crazy. I saw the
paintings of one small girl full of horrible things, and NATO did
that to her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vera Obrizovic wrote an open letter to NATO, published in
Politika, in which she said, ``Gentlemen, I wish your celebration
takes place with screeching air-raid sirens followed by an
orchestra of 2.5-ton drums.'' She then gave her e-mail address _
double o(AT)drenik.net _ in case any of the alliance's leaders
wished to reply.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav media has been rabid on the subject of NATO's
anniversary. Politika fumed about ``this festival of evil,'' where
``the American fuehrer, Clinton, managed to top it all, with his
mouth full of democracy in order to justify the hysterical killing
of the citizens of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanjug, the official news agency, called Clinton's address to
the summit leaders ``a harangue against a country and its people
that are preventing him from accomplishing his goals in the Balkans
and Europe and from arranging the world in the way he envisaged
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Politika also mentioned ``the ethnic cleansings and pogroms
against the Indians'' and told readers that ``until a couple of
years ago, blacks and whites were forbidden to go into the same
schools and restrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the massacre at Colombine High School in Colorado
last week, the daily noted: ``In honor of Hitler's birthday, two
young men, taking after their president, massacred 25 of their
classmates.'' (Actually, 15 people, including the two suspects,
were killed.)
</P>
<P>
   Given that ``commemoration'' in Serbian is a ceremony for the
dead, there were numerous puns on how NATO's birthday commemoration
really represents its funeral. The alliance has moved from one of
collective defense, Politika said, ``to a cruel and deceitful
policeman, licensed to kill all across Europe and later in other
parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, said:
``The alliance which is supposed to be the best on earth is jumping
over boundaries and borders in an effort to justify its existence.
This is dangerous, and the world will not be the same. The U.N.
secretary-general cannot speak the same way after this aggression.
Yugoslavia is not the only victim. The victim is also the United
Nations and the common European home.''
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic, in an interview with the Slovak
daily Praca, said that ``NATO, instead of celebrating the 50th
anniversary of its foundation, will die in Yugoslavia,'' which he
said is defending the post-1945 order of the United Nations against
the will of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new world order, imposed by the United States, has been
attempting to subjugate the entire world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a relatively liberal scholar and adviser to Deputy Prime
Minister Vuk Draskovic, Predrag Simic, said, ``NATO has run through
a lot of red lights here.'' NATO had a ``spotless record until
now,'' he said, and even the Russians recognized it as a purely
defensive alliance. ``But now this new NATO scares the Russians and
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would dedicate his new book, on NATO and the Yugoslav
crisis, to Milica Rakic, a 3-year-old girl who died from shrapnel
wounds last week in her bedroom in Batajnica, a city north of
Belgrade that has an air force base.

CLINTON, YELTSIN CONFER ON NEXT STEP TO END KOSOVO STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and the NATO allies pressed a
carrot-and-stick campaign for ending the bloodbath in Kosovo
Sunday, encouraging intensified diplomatic intervention by Russia
while warning that the military alliance will now defend nations
bordering Yugoslavia from any Serbian attack.
</P>
<P>
   The punishing military offensive against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic dominated the final day of the three-day summit
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, just as it had through a
gathering once planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
Cold War-era alliance and map a new strategy for combating future
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, winding up the summit with a final statement,
emphasized that even amid fledgling diplomatic overtures, the
19-member NATO alliance will ``intensify our actions, military and
economic, until we achieve our objectives in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed that the alliance would protect Slovenia and six
non-NATO nations bordering Yugoslavia from any Yugoslav attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance ``will stand by the neighboring countries that have
accepted risks and hardship in support of this effort,'' Clinton
declared. ``If Mr. Milosevic threatens them for helping us, we will
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said that
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed in an earlier
telephone call for the Kremlin leader to press ahead with
diplomatic efforts to press Milosevic to accept an armed occupation
force in Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant state
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and the Russians are ``very serious about trying to find
a peaceful solution,'' Berger told the Cable News Network.
``President Clinton encouraged President Yeltsin to do so and I
think there will be continuing contacts over the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Yeltsin conversation, which lasted for nearly an
hour, triggered preparations for Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, fluent in Russian, to travel to Europe to huddle with
Chernomyrdin in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed U.S. support for
stepped-up Russian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be positive to have the Russians on board,'' Solana
said. ``We want to recuperate the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana said keeping the Russians involved in the quest for a
diplomatic solution could help avoid a Russian veto in the
15-member U.N. Security Council when and if NATO seeks U.N.
participation in drafting a peace agreement acceptable to
Milosevic, or the supervision of a postwar occupation force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that, Russia will be important,'' Solana explained.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the ``biggest stumbling block'' for suspending the
allied air campaign that began on March 24 remains the disagreement
with Milosevic over ``the nature of an international presence that
would go into Kosovo'' to facilitate the return of 1.4 million
ethnic Albanians who have been uprooted by Milosevic's ``ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO allies favor a heavily armed international force, including
troops from NATO countries, Russia and Ukraine, to provide security
for frightened ethnic Albanians who have been driven from their
homes in Europe's most horrific campaign against civilians since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Berger dismissed relying on unarmed international monitors with
``clipboards and pencils'' as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has to play a significant role so that the Kosovars can
feel that they can come back in safety,'' Berger emphasized. ``That
is not something that Mr. Milosevic has yet agreed to but I believe
that the Russians will continue to work to try to move this towards
a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conversation with Yeltsin followed up on a peace
mission to Belgrade on Thursday by former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has close ties to Vice President Al Gore.
Chernomyrdin won Milosevic's acceptance of a U.N.-controlled
``international presence'' in Kosovo to guarantee the safe return
of refugees. NATO leaders rejected Milosevic's ill-defined
commitment as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   NATO allies have been in touch with the Russians for nearly a
month to find an end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Premier Yevgeny M. Primakov met with Milosevic in
Belgrade on March 30 to discuss a diplomatic compromise. But
Milosevic said he would not seek a political solution until the
NATO bombing campaign ended.
</P>
<P>
   NATO rejected suspension of the bombing campaign until Milosevic
accepted NATO's conditions. But on Friday, NATO leaders softened
their conditions, offering to suspend bombing if Milosevic began
withdrawing forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged allied support to the leaders of Albania,
Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Slovenia during a
meeting with so-called ``front-line states.'' On Saturday, the
alliance extended comparable security guarantees to the democratic
government in Montenegro, which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Belgrade challenges its neighbors as a result of the
presence of NATO, we will respond,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the defense guarantees did not match iron-clad
guarantees protecting the NATO members. Under the NATO agreement,
an attack on one partner is deemed an attack on all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have given all the assurances that we will take with
the utmost concern any problem that they may have,'' Solana said,
adding: ``I think we have demonstrated that we are standing by
these countries and will not allow them to be destabilized as a
result of Milosevic's ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania and Macedonia are providing sites for camps for hundreds
of thousands of refugees from Kosovo as well as facilities for
thousands of allied troops.
</P>
<P>
   Romania and Slovenia have opened their air space to NATO war
planes and humanitarian flights _ a gesture expected by Bulgaria on
Monday. Croatia, Bulgaria and Bosnia are cooperating with
enforcement of an economic embargo against Yugoslavia. That
blockade is expected to tighten in the days ahead with NATO
enforcement of a ``visit and search regime'' on ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called the defense of Yugoslavia's
neighbors ``a direct and material interest of the alliance,''
adding: ``We will not tolerate threats against them or attacks on
them by Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of Clinton, Solana and leaders from Yugoslavia's
neighbors underscored that ``in the region, Milosevic is all
alone,'' Shea emphasized. ``He is a pariah in his own back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Berger, Clinton's top security adviser, said that Yeltsin
indicated in his telephone conversation with Clinton that Russia
would honor the oil embargo being imposed on Yugoslav oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect all nations, including the Russians, would
abide by a regime to put a halt to oil shipments,'' Berger said,
adding that he had heard ``nothing in the conversation today with
President Yeltsin that was to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and alliance leaders said they were laying plans for a
comprehensive recovery plan for the Balkans akin to the post-World
War II Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes security guarantees by NATO and assistance
from international financial institutions to help nations in the
Balkans build robust, free enterprise economies led by democratic
regimes that enjoy extensive trade ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the allies would launch ``a very important plan for
restabilization of the region'' in the days ahead, adding: ``We
really want to take as a priority the southeastern part of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea added: ``This area has got to stop being the bleeding wound
of Europe.''

THE STRUGGLING JOURNAL OF COMMERCE UPDATES ITS STRATEGY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coverage, circulation and advertising have peeled
away from The Journal of Commerce for two generations. Stock and
bond tables disappeared two decades ago, commodities coverage was
hijacked by competitors and the advertising base eroded as large
shipping companies merged. But as the newspaper has sputtered
economically, it has continued to provide a mix of trade policy
analysis and coverage of the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, however, is being changed. The newspaper _ which was
founded in 1827 by Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph _ is
jettisoning most of its policy coverage, all of its commodity price
listings and 20 percent of its editorial staff _ four of 18 _ and
will devote itself to ``those who control the movement of goods,''
in the words of a recent Journal editorial. It will also convert
from a broadsheet to a tabloid format on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper plans to move from its broader perspective to
porthole-to-porthole coverage of an industry that has all the
glamour of the industrial age at a time when the financial world is
fixated on all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   Just as shipping companies' stock prices have been dwarfed by a
digitally charged Standard &AMP; Poor's index, the circulation figures
of The Journal of Commerce (18,290 at last count in September, half
its peak rate in the 1950s) have been dwarfed by those of snazzy
new business magazines like the two-year-old Fast Co. (256,000,
more than double its figure at the end of 1997). Advertising
revenues followed circulation down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had developed a kind of stodgy format that hadn't changed
for quite a while,'' said Roger Majak, the assistant secretary of
commerce for export administration and reader of The Journal of
Commerce for the last 10 years. He expressed the hope that in its
new incarnation the newspaper would concentrate on ``trade in all
its international implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Majak's vision, however, does not seem to mesh with that of
Willy Morgan, the publisher and executive vice president of the
Journal of Commerce Group, which is wholly owned by the Economist
Group. ``We've understood that we're in the business-to-business
business,'' he said, chuckling in mock despair at his own
description. Then he continued, ``we have, for the first time in
however old we are, a mission statement that says we aim to provide
actionable business information to help people get richer and more
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Morgan's strategy is to put all breaking news on the The
Journal's World Wide Web site (www.joc.com). ``We've done research
and we've found that something incredible, like 74 percent, of our
readers say they're connected to the Web,'' he said. ``We will be
marketing the paper and the Web holistically. Hideous word,
holistically.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to ``get actionable stuff to them faster on the Web,
along with a lot more of the breaking news,'' Morgan said. ``The
paper will be more of a how-to, news analysis, case-history
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach will allow editors to enforce earlier production
deadlines, so that all articles are filed by 2 p.m. and the
Philadelphia printing plant can start to ship the newspaper off to
its nationwide destinations by early evening. It will also attract
a wider field of advertisers _ accounting firms that are branching
into the business of helping with shipping logistics, for instance,
or banks and financial services catering to shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tirschwell, the 37-year-old new editor of the newspaper,
said that until recently it had sought to provide in-depth coverage
of fields like energy, world trade, insurance, and air, rail and
truck transportation, as well as maritime issues. ``The information
needs of those separate areas have changed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a very strong effort to try to consolidate what
we have,'' Tirschwell said. And while the paper will still do some
``broad-picture trade stories,'' he said, the coverage of how goods
get from one point to another, and how money can be made along the
way, matters most now.

 &HT;    NATO KEEPING OPEN THREE TRACKS TO VICTORY
 &HT;    With NATO-SUMMIT.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly five weeks of air strikes, NATO is
pressing the conflict against Yugoslavia on three separate tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's leaders are keeping the way clear for a swift
diplomatic end to the fighting on its own terms. At the same time,
it is escalating its bombing campaign and preparing for the
possibility of a prolonged war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with Moscow, the United States and other NATO
members are trying to formulate a plan that would save face for
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, yet still meet NATO's
bottom-line demands on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For NATO to halt the bombing, Milosevic must end his year-long
campaign of repression against the ethnic Albanian majority in
Kosovo, pull out his forces and allow armed peace-keepers led by
NATO to ensure the safe return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Those, at least, are the terms laid out in a Friday agreement
that set the tone for this weekend's summit marking the 50th
anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings last week with Foreign Minister Victor Chernomyrdin
of Russia, Milosevic signaled a willingness to go along with all
these conditions except the armed peace-keepers. Milosevic offered
to allow an unarmed United Nations monitoring team, but NATO
rejected the offer, saying it would not ensure the safe return of
the 1.5 million ethnic Albanians that Serbs have driven from their
homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is to meet with
Chernomyrdin in the days ahead to try to build on the possibility
of a Russia-brokered plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, is escalating the air war.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, has asked for
300 additional warplanes, and Hungary, one of NATO's three new
members, agreed Sunday to allow U.S. and allied pilots to fly out
of three of its airfields, a move expected to hasten the deployment
of the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Clark spent Sunday in Albania, where he said Apache attack
helicopters would soon be ready to strike inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also announced Sunday that 4,000 additional British and
German infantry troops are en route to Macedonia, where they will
joint 12,000 other NATO troops already there. The force is
providing humanitarian assistance to refugees at the moment, but
would form the vanguard of a larger NATO peacekeeping contingent,
should Milosevic capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   However, NATO appears to be bracing for the possibility that
Milosevic won't give in soon.
</P>
<P>
   As fears of a widening war have spread across the region, NATO
extended security guarantees to seven states along Yugoslavia's
borders _ Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia
and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Security guarantees aren't taken on lightly. NATO wouldn't have
widened its defense obligations unless it were deemed essential to
carrying on a longer-term conflict with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The move fits, moreover, with NATO efforts to choke off
Yugoslavia's oil imports, with a naval blockade, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   By placing efforts to starve Yugoslavia of oil alongside its
promise to widen its security umbrella to cover every state in the
Balkans except the one it's attacking, NATO has sent an
unmistakable signal: the alliance is hunkering down for the
possibility of weeks, if not months, of continuing war in
Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ Each time a bus load of refugees rumbles
into this dusty refugee camp, 14-year old Murat Beqiri scans the
faces peering from the windows. When he hears his family name
called out over bullhorns by aid workers searching for a specific
refugee, he scrambles expectantly out of his tent hoping he may
find his mother or father. Every day he tries to call home to
Pristina, but the line has been dead for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are trapped in Pristina,'' Kosovo's capital, said
Murat, a drawn and distracted look casting a shadow over his
youthful face. ``I think they can't get out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the frantic, chaotic hours when Albanians were forced from
their Kosovo homes, hundreds of parents and children lost track of
each other. Some children crossed the border here alone or with
relatives. Others got separated by accident in the camps,
especially one night when Macedonian police officers forced Kosovo
Albanians crowded into a camp to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Murat last saw his father when his father told him and his
sister to leave home and find their way to Macedonia by train as
word spread in Pristina that Yugoslav forces were ordering people
to leave. His parents planned to remain at home with his
grandmother as long as they could.
</P>
<P>
   Lost children have been a big problem wherever families have
been suddenly uprooted, as in Rwanda. But it is especially
difficult here because half of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians were teen-agers and young children. The chaotic nature of
the exodus from Kosovo, the unusually high number of children, and
the complicated international aid and evacuation programs here have
helped make efforts to reunite families particularly daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Albania, Macedonia has been forcing refugees to move on,
even putting them on planes to several other countries. Adding to
the problem, on April 7, 50,000 Kosovo refugees were rousted from a
camp in the border town of Blace and hustled away to other camps or
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun came up, Jehona Ulialu, a 5-year-old girl, was
found wandering alone in the remains of the camp. Aid workers have
posted her photograph in the larger refugee camps in Macedonia and
are trying to determine if her parents were sent to Turkey or
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed, but Jehona's parents have not emerged.
British NATO soldiers at first cared for her, but she is now living
with a refugee family in Macedonia. They are missing children of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   By one count, Murat and Jehona are two of 253 ethnic Albanian
children in Macedonia refugee camps separated from their parents,
the International Committee of the Red Cross says. But there are
other children unaccounted for because 776 parents have reported
that their children are missing and are not on the Red Cross lists.
</P>
<P>
   Of lost children aid workers know about, few have been
completely abandoned and most are being cared for by relatives. The
Red Cross is posting the names of children it has located on
bulletin boards in the camps here, hoping parents or relatives will
come forward.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, only 54 children have been reunited with their
parents through the efforts of the Red Cross and Save the Children.
Aid workers predict that parents and children are not likely to be
reunited for weeks, possibly months, and countless other relatives
_ siblings, aunts, uncles and grandparents _ are also missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we are just dealing now with the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Francois Zen-Ruffinin, a Red Cross spokesman.
``We're starting with children. They are the priority. But just
about every single family is missing a relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Families started scattering even before the NATO airstrikes.
Many parents hustled their children out of larger towns and cities
to the rural homes of relatives for safekeeping. But when Yugoslav
forces launched a major offensive after the bombing began, hundreds
of parents were blocked from retrieving their children.
</P>
<P>
   Even families that began the flight from Kosovo together were
sometimes separated. Panicked crowds swarmed aboard trains headed
for the border and the Serbian police cut off convoys of cars,
ordering some to the border, and others back into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murat, who lives in a tent with his 25-year-old sister and her
husband in this sprawling refugee camp of 29,000, went to the train
station in Pristina after his aunt burst into in his home in tears
a week after the bombing began. Serbs had just expelled her from
her nearby home, she said, and Murat and his sister were told to go
to the train station immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said, `You go, we'll catch up with you,''' Murat
said. ``We waited for three hours. They never came.'' He managed to
reach his parents at a neighbor's house a week ago, but has heard
nothing since.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents said they were forcibly separated from their
children. Hyzri Gaytani, 24, and his wife, Imrani, 20, said the
Serbian police expelled them from their home in Pristina and then
blocked them from going to the hospital where their premature baby
was still in an incubator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 17 days,'' Gaytani said, holding his first, and
only, child's birth certificate. ``We don't know where he is.''
Phone calls to the doctor in Pristina have not been answered. They
have asked the Red Cross to see if they can send someone to the
hospital to find their infant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Families that had already been split up in Kosovo have been
divided yet again. Fatmira Mehmeti, 15, said she, her sister and
two brothers were separated from their parents after being taken to
their uncle's home in Pristina for safekeeping. After the NATO
bombing began, the children fled with their uncle to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   When Macedonian police officers cleared out the Blace camp, the
two girls and one of their brothers managed to stay with their
uncle. Their other brother, aunt, grandmother and three cousins
disappeared. ``Somebody told us they went to Turkey,'' Fatmira
said. ``But nothing is confirmed. We don't know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with children, elderly and mentally ill people have been
found here wandering alone. A dozen people in their 60s, 70s and
80s and two mentally retarded teen-age boys are being cared for in
a tent here run by the International Catholic Migration Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the boys can offer a hint as to who they are, their
age, their home or who cared for them. When strangers appear in
their tent, one offers a warm smile, waves his hand in the air and
blurts out garbled words. The other stares blankly at a wall of the
tent, seemingly traumatized by the tragedies that brought them
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite likely we're not ever going to find their
families,'' said Albert Ramirez, a social worker from Austin,
Texas, who has been caring for the boys. ``They can't communicate
with us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In another tent here, Benin Kukiqi and his college-age friends
represent one more group, teen-agers and young adults separated
from their parents. Kukiqi, 20, is the oldest of five students
sharing a tent here. None of them know where their parents are.
</P>
<P>
   All five are childhood friends from the town of Glogovac in
northern Kosovo. Taking classes at Pristina University, they were
dozens of miles from their families when the NATO airstrikes began
a month ago. Kukiqi, a mechanical engineering student, said the
last time he spoke to his parents was from a phone booth in the
main post office in Pristina the day the strikes began.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, he said, lectured him for taking the risk of walking
through the center of town to make the call. Since then, phone
lines to Glogovac have been dead and no refugees from the town have
emerged. He has no idea where his parents and 17-year-old sister
are. ``There has been nothing at all,'' he said, ``just rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his tent-mates keep busy working with relief
organizations in the camp, a seeming distraction from thinking
incessantly about the missing. Kukiqi, steeling himself from what
could be weeks of doubt and worry, said the best thing he can do is
stay in one place and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am staying here to wait for some kind of contact,'' he said
resolutely. ``If my parents are alive, and I hope they are, they
will find me here.''

THOUSANDS GATHER IN BEIJING IN LARGEST PROTEST SINCE TIANANMEN
SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ More than 10,000 followers of a religious cult
surrounded China's leadership compound Sunday, demanding
recognition from authorities who are wary of any group not easy
controlled. It was the biggest protest here since the democracy
movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, eerily silent and devoid of banners or slogans,
displayed remarkably good organization and discipline, with
demonstrators remaining motionless and calm and seated on the
sidewalk while organizers communicated by mobile telephones. Many
protesters apparently tried to use meditation to persuade leaders
to see them in a more favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   The cult, known as Buddhist Law, asserts that it has more than
100 million members in this country of 1.2 billion, the largest
among hundreds of cults that have flourished in China in recent
years as socialism evaporates as an ideology. Preaching good
behavior to win salvation from an increasingly evil world that is
headed for catastrophe, followers believe that they can cure
illness and eviscerate wickedness from the world.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's charismatic leader, Li Hongzhi, 48, moved to New York
City two years ago, under pressure from the authorities to restrict
his activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in simple clothing, followers converged from many
provinces of China, sitting all day on worn squares of cotton
padding in long rows that stretched for nearly two miles along two
sides of Zhongnanhai, the compound in central Beijing where China's
leaders live and work.
</P>
<P>
   The police, apparently eager to avoid a confrontation, did not
force the protesters to move, and the gathering dispersed
peacefully by 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The protest came at a politically sensitive time, with China's
leadership deeply concerned about the potential for social unrest
in a year marked by the 10th anniversary of the crackdown in
Tiananmen Square and the 50th anniversary of the founding of
Communist China.
</P>
<P>
   As China becomes a more chaotic society _ with people confused
over conflicting laws and regulations and with tens of millions of
people losing their jobs as state-run industries close _ religious
cults with mass followings like this one appear to pose a greater
threat to social order than democracy advocates do.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the strong role that secret societies played in the
downfall of the last imperial dynasty, in 1911, China's leaders are
juggling their need for social order with popular demands for
greater religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   To many Chinese bewildered by a fast-changing society, perhaps
the greatest appeal of a cult like Buddhist Law lies in its
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we stand for is good for the nation and good for society,
so how can we threaten anyone?'' said a 47-year-old woman in a worn
green jacket who sat near the corner of Zhongnanhai. ``They don't
understand us. We want understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other followers nodded in agreement as the woman spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay as long as it takes,'' said a 52-year-old man in
a tattered grey sweater. ``A day, a week, a year. We are not in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, wary of giving their names or talking in detail
about their organization, said they were demanding a meeting with
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. In the late evening, as the protest
dispersed, organizers announced to small groups that they had been
promised a meeting with members of the State Council, China's
Cabinet. The government made no announcement, and state-run news
media were conspicuously silent about the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law is a sect of qigong, a traditional Chinese teaching
that incorporates a broad range of healing techniques, martial arts
and meditation. The overwhelming majority of Chinese believe in
some form of qigong, while some join cults built on the teachings
of a particular master, like Li.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party denounces cults as superstitious remnants of
an earlier age and asserts that many charismatic qigong masters
fool followers with get-rich-quick schemes and fake medicine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cult followers carried a book by Li. Buddhist Law,
founded by Li in 1992, preaches that evil lurks in the modern
appearance of rock 'n' roll music, television, drugs and
homosexuality. Although the group is vehemently opposed to modern
science and technology, many members use the internet to spread the
group's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your diseases will be eliminated directly by me,'' wrote Li in
one of his five books, regarded by followers as sacred texts.
</P>
<P>
   Li's teachings echo ancient Chinese civilization, asserting the
power of healing by using qigong to tap into a person's ``inner
energy.'' The cult also uses the Buddhist notion of karma, which
holds that people's good and bad deeds determine their fate in the
next life.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of Sunday's protest apparently lay in a recent
article in an obscure academic journal published in the coastal
city of Tianjin, that warned of the dangers posed by cults in
China. Several protesters said they were deeply offended by the
article and that a dozen followers were arrested in Tianjin last
week after a small protest there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after Beijing Television broadcast a program critical
of Buddhist Law, organizers engineered a protest outside the
television station. Two employees of the station were later said to
have been dismissed because of inaccuracies in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law has apparently earned tens of millions of dollars
by selling Li's books and videotapes of his preachings, as well as
meditation cushions and pictures of Li. But the full size and scope
of the operation remains hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, secretive about its operations, has a network
of support in the United States, and the followers say that many
Communist Party members, senior officials and police officers are
among its members.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who asserts that he has a higher spiritual authority than
Jesus, Mohammed or Buddha, teaches that he was sent to earth by a
``supreme being'' to save mankind from moral corruption caused by
consumerism, modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese society has disintegrated so seriously, Li contends,
that many humans are reincarnated as demons, some of them disguised
as monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in Taiwan,'' he has written, ``many famous monks or
lay Buddhists are actually demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing for followers with other cults, Li has denounced other
qigong masters as ``possessed with foxes or yellow weasels, and
some with snakes.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's protest, followers extolled the virtues of their
cult, talking more about the beneficial effects of moral discipline
than about the greatness of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a better father and husband and citizen,'' said a
48-year-old man from Hebei Province, who said he had been a member
of Buddhist Law for six years. ``We are making a better society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get sick anymore,'' the man continued. ``If everyone
is healthy, it will save medical costs and be good for society as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest, populated mostly by people from outside the
capital, elicited much fascination but limited sympathy from
Beijing residents, thousands of whom gathered to look on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're crazy,'' said Li Xiaoming, 27, who works for a
transport company. ``But there are a lot of them, so the government
has to listen.''

<P>
   TETOVO, Macedonia _ Here they stroll, up Marshal Tito Street,
some of the most recognizable faces of Kosovo's diaspora. Their
lives are now scattered pieces, some parts irretrievable _ homes
lost, loved ones missing, work destroyed, faith worn down to the
nub.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, hundreds of the uprooted intelligentsia of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, have come to Tetovo, a Macedonian city
of 300,000 people, dozens of good coffee houses and a university.
In Tetovo, as in Pristina, most people are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   So who was strolling here on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Luan Jaha, the stage actor, came along. He made it across the
border three weeks weeks ago. His face was pale, his eyes tired. He
seemed like an old ball that had lost its bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no mind any more with which to think,'' he said wanly
and apologetically. ``My wife asks me what am I going to do, and I
say what can I do but wait? But it is not even waiting that I do,
because waiting means I expect something. And what is there to
expect?''
</P>
<P>
   And there walked the young playwright Jeton Budima, wearing a
black leather jacket and biting the end of a toothpick. He and his
wife and daughter spent four nights sleeping in their car, stranded
in the awful traffic of so many people with vehicles trying to get
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly you are an animal on the run, a refugee, a number in
the world's book of statistics,'' he said. ``Suddenly, you feel
like human garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   They were here, but their talk was mostly of who was not. Had
there been word of so-and-so? Was she among the many still hiding
in Pristina? Had she gone to Albania? Was she dead?
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper editor Baton Haxhiu was almost dead. NATO
announced news of his murder on March 29. Haxhiu heard the live
broadcast, finding the information inaccurate but hardly
inconceivable. He surmised that he was on a Serbian hit list,
joining such authentically dead as the civil-rights lawyer Bajram
Kelmendi and the trade unionist Agim Hajrizi, both murdered by the
Serbs shortly after NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   After a harrowing escape, Haxhiu set up shop here on Marshal
Tito Street. His newspaper, Koha Ditore, was the most respected
Albanian-language daily in Kosovo. Then, on March 24, its offices
in Pristina were ransacked and its night watchmen killed. The
daily's founder, Veton Surroi, a delegate to the failed peace talks
on Kosovo, went into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, said Haxhiu, ``want to cut all connections to
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, he was standing outside the paper's new office, a
tiny space jammed with desktop computers but lacking even a single
phone line. The staff intends to end Koha Ditore's monthlong
silence on Monday, distributing free copies in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Haxhiu said, the Serbs will awaken from their moral
slumber, but ``we Albanians will never forget what has happened to
us, and it will be very hard to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the popular Restaurant Arbi, its espresso
machine ceaselessly exhaling steam and, at night, its bartenders
pouring stiff drinks. Life can be terribly painful and some believe
the best way to look at it is through the refracted light of a shot
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, these same people would have been chatting in
Pristina's crowded cafes like Magic and Hani i 2 Roberteve. Both
places were attacked by the Serbian paramilitary. The young actress
Ardiana Abdullah was killed with a machine gun, said her friends,
now in exile here.
</P>
<P>
   Migjen Kelmendi lost a cousin in one attack and expected that he
would soon be among the slain. His face is well known, as are his
opinions. He is a writer. He once sang in a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``This phenomenon of emptying a city and pushing people out of
their lives _ this I had only seen in movies,'' said Kelmendi,
sipping coffee at Restaurant Arbi.
</P>
<P>
   He used the words ``holocaust'' and ``genocide'' in his
descriptions, but then regretted it and asked forgiveness. These
are terms others reserve for their own catastrophes and he worried
that the Kosovo Albanians' plight did not yet measure high enough
on the calibrations of human misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel I have had death as close to me as my skin or my
T-shirt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clatter of silverware and plates, he told his story,
and it was not an uncommon one. He went into hiding after the first
NATO airstrike. Six days later, the Serbian paramilitary came into
his Pristina neighborhood and ordered everyone to leave in three
minutes. Fear had been joined by chaos. The soldiers marched
thousands of people toward a train station. Kelmendi pulled a cap
low on his forehead, trying to conceal his familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scene was biblical, you could say,'' he continued. ``We
were marched at gunpoint through the center of town, and I will
especially remember that our Serbian neighbors who saw this were
indifferent. No one asked: What are you doing to these people?''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that 7,000 ethnic Albanians were packed into the 20
cars of a passenger train. The border was only 50 miles away but
the journey took six hours. The train kept stopping, and when it
did, the air became as still as the locomotive. People gasped and
collapsed. Parents pleaded for water for their children. At least
two old men died.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want, I could also tell you about conditions at the
refugee camp at Blace,'' he said, referring to his first days in
Macedonia. ``But maybe this is enough horror for now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few tables away sat Vesel Nuhiu, dean of the philology
department at the ethnic Albanians' underground university in
Pristina, founded after the Serbs stripped Kosovo of broad autonomy
in 1989. He was immaculately dressed in the only shirt and sport
coat he left with. His family had five minutes to pack after the
paramilitary arrived with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to describe the madness of such a thing,'' he said.
``We were with a colleague of mine from the faculty and we agreed
to go to Tetovo together. But in the chaos we were separated almost
immediately. I was lucky to leave with my car, though at every
intersection, the police asked for 100 or 200 Deutschmarks (roughly
$55 or $110) or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Tetovo has welcomed the exiled professors and
students, but the school was already overcrowded. Like the Serbs,
the Macedonians disapprove of colleges that teach in the Albanian
language. The university here is tolerated, if not officially
accredited, and its classes are held in basements, garages and
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My department had 70 professors and associates, but I only
know what has happened to five or seven,'' said Nuhiu. ``I just met
one here at the restaurant. Others are a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   People are caught up like corks in a swift current. They once
fit snugly into a bottle. Now the bottle is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Along Marshal Tito Street came Ardian Arifaj, youthful and
serious and angry, the managing editor of Koha Ditore. He had a
paper to put out. He had recovered purpose, but not the place or
the possessions or the people he needed. He felt incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not only a biophysiological concept,'' he said. ``My
life is the place where I grew up, where I live, my desk, my books,
my music, my computer, the people I know and the places I go to
have fun. This is what I am and without it I do not exist. I am no
longer the same as I was. I have lost my personality. And now I am
merely surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pristina has come to Tetovo, but Tetovo can never be
Pristina. Kosovo is home and the ethnic Albanians believe _ or
fervently hope _ that one day soon they will go back.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, they will again share their cities with Serbs, the
neighbors who they say have been so lacking in conscience. Can such
a deep hurt ever heal?
</P>
<P>
   Arifaj pondered this and recounted a story that he heard as a
child:
</P>
<P>
   There was a naughty boy whose father would hammer a nail into a
piece of wood each time his son did something wrong. One day the
boy asked why, and when it was explained, the boy decided he would
behave better. Each time he did something good, he wanted his
father to remove a nail from the board. Eventually all the nails
came out.
</P>
<P>
   Arifaj let a few seconds pass, allowing suspense to precede the
story's moral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the nails were gone,'' he said. ``But the holes always
remained.''

<P>
   By producing increasingly violent media, the entertainment
industry has for decades engaged in a lucrative dance with the
devil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, parents and consumer groups have continued to
sound alarms about the effects that violent films, television and
ever-more-realistic video games are having on their children and
society at large. The response from the industry consistently has
been a kind of indignant shock that anyone would think a silly old
movie or game could have a measurable effect on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can tell the difference between fantasy and reality,''
these executives have repeatedly asserted, ``Why can't you?''
</P>
<P>
   But a growing body of evidence suggests it is the producers who
may be having a hard time telling the difference between their
apologist fantasy and grim reality.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, say those who study violence in culture, is
unassailable: Hundreds of studies in recent decades have revealed a
direct correlation between exposure to media violence _ now
including video games _ and increased aggression.
</P>
<P>
   This is not because people cannot distinguish between reality
and fantasy, but because ultra-violent media systematically employ
the psychological techniques of desensitization, conditioning and
vicarious learning.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Grossman, a former Army officer and professor at West Point
and the University of Arkansas, says these are the same techniques
that were used to great effect during the Vietnam War to increase
the ``firing rate'' _ that is, the percentage of soldiers who will
actually fire a weapon during an encounter _ from the 15 to 20
percent range in World War II to as much as 95 percent in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman has written ``On Killing: The Psychological Cost of
Learning to Kill in War and Society'' (Little, Brown, 1995), in
which he discusses how conditioning techniques were used to teach
Vietnam-bound soldiers to kill automatically in battle encounters,
yet respect authority and make split-second distinctions between
friends and enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he says, is that today these same techniques are
not tempered by such respect or distinctions. What is worse, he
adds, they teach us to associate violence with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   America's adolescents spend countless hours watching action or
horror movies _ the exquisitely detailed suffering and killing of
human beings _ on television and in movie theaters, places we
associate with entertainment, pleasure, favorite foods and the
intimacy of dating.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive video games, Grossman asserts, are even more
directly connected to behavior. Addictive, increasingly hyperreal
in their effects and long since shed of the goofy monsters that
were targets in the old days, contemporary video games often are
what he calls ``operant conditioning firing ranges with pop-up
targets and immediate feedback, just like those used to train
soldiers in modern armies.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Grossman wrote: ``We are reaching that stage of
desensitization at which the inflicting of pain and suffering has
become a source of entertainment; vicarious pleasure rather than
revulsion. We are learning to kill, and we are learning to like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two boys apparently responsible for the massacre in
Littleton, Colo., last week were, among many other things,
accomplished players of the ultraviolent video game Doom. And
Michael Carneal, the 14-year-old boy who opened fire on a prayer
group in a Paducah, Ky., school foyer in 1997, was also known to be
a video-game expert.
</P>
<P>
   Carneal had never fired a pistol before stealing the gun he used
that day. But in the ensuing melee, he fired eight shots, hit eight
people, and killed three of them.
</P>
<P>
   The average law enforcement officer in the United States, at a
distance of seven yards, hits fewer than one in five shots,
Grossman asserted in a interview in the current issue of Adbusters
magazine, published by the Media Foundation in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michael Carneal was shooting, he fired one shot at each
kid,'' Grossman said. ``He simply fired one shot at everything that
popped up on his screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's sentiments are echoed by Joel Federman, co-director
of the Center for Communication and Social Policy at the University
of California at Santa Barbara. In his former job as the research
director of Mediascope, a nonprofit policy organization that
promotes media responsibility, he published an annotated
bibliography called ``The Social Effects of Interactive Electronic
Games'' (www.mediascope.org/vidbib.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Although he says only seven or eight studies specifically
focused on aggression in interactive games, the majority of them
showed that aggressive games increased the likelihood of aggression
just as certainly as violent television did. ``In games,'' he said,
``aggressive behavior is not only seen as appropriate, but you're
rewarded for doing it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Federman drew a parallel between producers of violent media and
the tobacco industry, which denied causality in the face of
irrefutable evidence of a direct correlation between smoking and
cancer. A study proving that TV or video games cause violence would
mean that at least one study participant would be inspired to
commit murder _ clearly an untenable ethical situation for the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same as the tobacco industry, the evidence is there,''
Federman said. ``These effects do exist, and everyone from the
American Psychological Association to the surgeon general has
acknowledged them. But since not every kid experiences the extreme
effects, people can continue to deny them.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, to do?
</P>
<P>
   The industry's attempts at self-policing were never intended to
stem the creation or distribution of ultraviolent games; in fact,
despite their superficial intent to protect, every producer knows
the best way to guarantee a best seller is to give a movie or video
game a ``restricted'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is censorship seen as a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very legitimate First Amendment concern,'' Federman
said. ``And because of freedom of speech, because there's a value
that we don't want to compromise, then it really comes down to the
people creating these games. That's where the responsibility
lies.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ Ask Jon Rubinstein, the man in charge of
hardware at Apple Computer Inc., about the supposedly imminent
``post-PC era,'' and he answers like someone who works for
Microsoft or Intel, the twin pillars of the personal-computer
industry, rather than for this quirky California computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   For though it has become fashionable to say that the PC era is
waning and the future of computing lies in a burgeoning assortment
of wired and wireless hand-held consumer-electronics gizmos,
Rubinstein is still a true believer in powerful, full-featured
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there will be appliances out there, but if you look at
the PC it's still in its infancy,'' Rubinstein said. ``I keep
hearing that the PC is dead, but when I look at the next couple of
years, that's not what I see at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer, which itself was all but given up for dead a few
years ago, has had a remarkable resurrection. Eleven days ago, the
company exceeded analysts' estimates in reporting its sixth
consecutive profitable quarter. For the last two quarters, it has
held more than 12 percent of the retail and mail-order PC market.
And the company is once again one of the top five makers of
personal computers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while manufacturers on the Microsoft-Intel side of the
PC industry are being pinched by prices that are spiraling below
$500 with no end in sight, Apple, the ``Think Different'' company,
is busily selling a line of desktop computers whose price begins at
$1,500, helping raise Apple's profit margin more than a point from
last year, to 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple understands simplicity, branding and style,'' said
Charles Wolf, a Wall Street analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. ``It's
amazing that nobody on the PC side gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, Apple's charismatic co-founder, Steve
Jobs, gets much of the public credit for what is certainly one of
the most remarkable turnarounds in U.S. corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret to Jobs' successful return to Apple is the small
manufacturing and design team and the highly disciplined
engineering process that Rubinstein has quietly put in place during
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is this team that is responsible for the popular iMac
machines that Apple began shipping last August, for the critically
acclaimed G3 desktop and portable machines that updated Apple's
moribund Macintosh and Powerbook lines, and for a new low-priced
portable to be introduced in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apple you and I knew two years ago is dead,'' said Andrew
Gore, editor in chief of Macworld, the trade magazine that tracks
Apple more closely than any other publication. ``It's a completely
different company. It's unfortunate that Apple has chosen to keep
Jon Rubinstein under wraps.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Rubinstein, 42, know him as someone who has
spent his entire career evolving with the computer industry. After
earning bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering
at Cornell University, and a master's in computer science from
Colorado State University, he moved to California, where he became
a computer work-station designer for Hewlett-Packard before joining
Ardent, a start-up supercomputer company.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he caught on with Next Computer, the company Jobs
founded in 1986 after being forced out at Apple. Rubinstein ran
Next's hardware engineering until the company shifted to an
all-software approach. He left to set up an independent
hardware-design firm that Rubinstein subsequently sold to Motorola
in 1996 _ part of the proceeds of which he planned to spend on
wandering the world.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into his sojourn, Rubinstein was touring Scotland
when a phone call caught up with him. It was from Gilbert Amelio,
who had recently been brought in as the chairman of Apple. Apple
had run up losses in 1996 and 1997 totaling $1.86 billion and was
being counted out of the game by virtually everyone in the
personal-computer industry. But offered the job of running Apple's
hardware operations, Rubinstein agreed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rubinstein accepted so readily that Amelio later
wondered in his book ``On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple''
whether he had been the victim of a palace coup. It was on the
advice of Jobs that Amelio hired not only Rubinstein but also Avi
Tevanian, who was then head of software at Next and now has that
job at Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was all part of a secret plan by Jobs to recapture
Apple, Amelio wondered in print, after he had been ousted by a
board that brought Jobs back to run the company temporarily _ an
arrangement that has continued for 20 months and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be news to me,'' Rubinstein said of the conspiracy
theory. He came to Apple, he said, because he saw himself primarily
as a desktop-computer designer and he thought that the company,
even in its deepest crises, was the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a no-brainer,'' he recalled. ``Apple was the last
innovative high-volume computer maker in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From a highly disorganized company where as many as four
independent engineering teams might work simultaneously to design
the same computer, Apple is now working on a dozen projects using
cooperating, interdisciplinary teams _ using what Rubinstein refers
to as a ``fast-track design.'' The approach puts many parts of the
design process in parallel, speeding the time to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as having a bag of technology tricks, and at
the appropriate time I bring them out and put them in our
products,'' he said. ``And we have more in our bag of tricks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say that Rubinstein is obsessive about checklists,
which have now been built into every facet of Apple's engineering
system.
</P>
<P>
   And when things are not caught by the checklists, Apple's
designers take a SWAT-team approach to fixing bugs.
</P>
<P>
   When the company's innovative iMac computer first shipped last
year, Rubinstein attended a midnight store-opening celebration in
Palo Alto. By the next morning, after hearing consumer complaints
at the store and on Macintosh enthusiasts' Web sites, he knew that
the machine had some problems _ the worst being that the computer
did not work with a newly designed Epson printer.
</P>
<P>
   A software patch was created in a matter of days and widely
distributed with the aid of the Internet, sidestepping a
potentially serious public-relations stumble for the new iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson episode could have been much worse. Several years
before Rubinstein's arrival, a few of the company's new Powerbook
portable machines actually caught fire while in use. The machine
had to be withdrawn from the market, and for more than a quarter
Apple went without revenue from an important part of its product
line.
</P>
<P>
   If Rubinstein's team is more efficient than Apple's earlier
hardware groups, it is also a remarkably more insular and
frequently secretive organization _ perhaps the clearest break from
the former Apple Computer, which was so porous that it was known in
some circles as ``a ship that leaks from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among the Valley's digerati the company is now referred
to as ``Jobs &AMP; Company,'' and Apple has adopted an almost
Japanese-style adherence to the ideal of the unified team.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubinstein dismisses the popular notion that Jobs can act as
a capricious tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working with Steve,'' he said. ``We make a good team,
and he raises the bar on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while working to uphold Jobs' exacting standards, Rubinstein
may provide an important buffer between Jobs and the rest of the
company. ``He is absolutely unflappable,'' said Glen Miranker,
Rubinstein's vice president for desktop systems. ``It's a
particular value in the present environment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those outside Apple who are skeptical about the
company's resurgence. They note that with the exception of the
iMac, which has found a market in both first-time computer users
and former owners of Microsoft-Intel PCs, Apple is still selling to
a core group of customers devoted to the Apple Macintosh legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them being strong for a while and then slowly fading,''
said Seymour Merrin, a computer industry consultant at Merrin
Information Services in Palo Alto. ``They can't afford the
development spending that an Intel can make.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Apple executives acknowledge that the company has made
little headway in corporate markets recently.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, despite the company's contention that thousands of new
software applications have been introduced for Apple machines,
companies like Nisus Software, which develops applications for the
Macintosh and benefited from the industry innovation the Macintosh
stimulated during the 1980s and early 1990s, say they have yet to
feel the impact of the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   And others wonder whether the introduction of two successful
computers under Rubinstein _ the iMac and the G3 desktop line _
necessarily mean Apple can sustain its comeback in the highly
volatile PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at this as pulling a rabbit out of the hat,''
Rubinstein said. ``Our strategy has a lot of dimension, from
industrial design to performance to functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim will be put to the test late this spring or early
summer when Apple introduces its long-awaited entry into the
consumer market for portable computers, priced in the $1,000 to
$1,500 range.
</P>
<P>
   With a sleek, gray translucent case and clamshell shape,
according to those who have seen it, the computer will be as
radical an industrial design departure from the standard boxy
notebooks as the iMac was from the conventional desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the machine _ which Jobs has reportedly insisted will
weigh less than 5 pounds and have a large flat-panel display _ will
be a runaway hit like the iMac is hard to predict. Though certainly
another example of Jobs' think-different philosophy, it will appear
while much of the rest of the PC industry is focusing on so-called
subnotebooks, which weigh less than 4 pounds and are the rage among
the computer road-warrior set.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein is confident the machine will be a hit, in part
because it will incorporate features from the company's heavier
laptops, like long battery life and disk-drive bays for floppies,
CD-ROMs or DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is waiting to see what we do next,'' he said. ``I
heard that some of them are holding back their products and saying,
`I don't want to be iMac'd.'''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Polar air will surge into New England behind a strengthening
cold front. Brisk winds from the northwest will drive much cooler
weather back into the Northeast during the next 24 hours. Ahead of
the front, ample sunshine will combine with increasingly mild winds
to raise readings 10 degrees above seasonal levels from Cape Cod to
the middle Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore winds, circulating around high pressure off the Carolina
coast, will keep an abundance of clouds over Georgia and the
western Carolinas. Showers are likely near the southern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The air mass over the Gulf states will stay warm and very humid,
which will give rise to clusters of thundershowers. A cold front in
eastern Texas will be the triggering mechanism for strong to severe
thunderstorms near the Texas coast and over Louisiana and Arkansas.
Flooding rains and isolated tornadoes are possible.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of dry and pleasant air is expected from the northern
Ohio Valley to the northeast Plains as high pressure slips
southward from Canada. Winds from the southeast will extend to
30,000 feet over the upper plains, and this will promote widespread
clouds and patches of showers, from the Dakotas to Kansas. Somewhat
drier air will be drawn northward from Mexico into western and
central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Showers of rain and snow will linger over the eastern Rockies. A
new push of polar air should spread into the Pacific Northwest with
plenty of clouds and showers inland and a mixture of sun and clouds
at the coast. The Southwest will be brighter and warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rochester Rains
</P>
<P>
   In March, southern Minnesota and Wisconsin enjoyed an unusual
two-week streak without a drop of rain. This has changed
dramatically as Rochester, Minn., is now on the verge of its
wettest April. As of Saturday evening, 6.39 inches of rain had
fallen, just .09 inches shy of the record set in 1990. Across the
Mississippi River, La Crosse, Wis., has now moved into ninth place
for April rainfall. Oddly, in Rochester, four of the five wettest
Aprils have occurred in this decade, leading to speculation about a
long-term shift in spring weather patterns over the Middle West.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ Larry Pratt said that his first thoughts
after hearing about the bloodshed in a Colorado school were, ``This
is bad, and there's going to be a feeding frenzy on the gun issue,
and I'll probably have to wear a coat and tie to work for the next
few days.'' The television cameras would surely be coming. He
should look nice.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, the executive director of the Gun Owners of America, an
advocacy group situated in this suburb of Washington, stands tall
even when some officials with the National Rifle Association are
lying low. He expects as much from NRA officials; they are, he
believes, sometimes faint of heart and impure of ideology. Pratt is
not.
</P>
<P>
   He believes there should be absolutely no regulations governing
the sale or purchase of handguns _ no waiting period, no background
checks, no trigger locks. Automatic weapons should be as available
as hunting rifles. People should be permitted to buy them in
abundance.
</P>
<P>
   In this more perfect world, Pratt said, many of the deaths in
Colorado might have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saddened that there were not teachers and principals who
had access to a gun, who might have been able to stop the mayhem,''
Pratt said late last week in his office, from which he directs the
lobbying and other activities of an organization that he said has
about 150,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's group is a mere shadow of the NRA, and it holds sway
over only a small number of extremely conservative lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are looking for the most unyielding proponents of the
right to bear arms, the kind whose ardor and outspokenness are
undimmed even by the deaths of 14 teen-agers and a teacher in one
ghastly spree, this is where you will find them, along with Pratt,
a 56-year-old with a sallow complexion, gray-fringed hair and a
gentle voice. He is the kind of man you would ask to watch your
luggage while you dashed to the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control, an advocacy group
on the other side, said: ``His personality is disarming. But his
views are not.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pratt, it is really quite simple: When the founding fathers
fashioned the Second Amendment, they rightly saw an armed citizenry
as a final safeguard against any possibility of tyranny. And
because tyranny does not augur or announce its arrival, it is best
to be ready, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is advised to buy fire insurance when one's house is not
burning down, and you hope it never does burn down, but you're
certainly not going to be able to buy it during or after the
fire,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's the same thing with firearms,'' he continued,
``whether it's a government that goes bad like Milosevic against
the Croats and his own people as well as the Kosovars, or Hitler,
or Stalin, or whatever, or just the criminal element.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was not always so wary. He described his childhood outside
of Camden, N.J., as uneventful. His father, an electrical engineer,
worked in television sales for an electronics company. His mother
stayed home to rear him and one sister.
</P>
<P>
   He first touched a gun as a teen-ager, on a duck-hunting trip
with a friend, and then not again until 1968, when he felt
compelled to buy one. He was then living just outside Washington,
and there were riots under way, and he suddenly felt a sense of
helplessness in the chaos. He had a wife and the first of what
would be four children. He wanted to know that he could protect
them.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of American University with a degree in political
science, he worked in the late 1960s and early 1970s for various
conservative policy groups before taking the helm of Gun Owners in
1976, one year after its inception. Initially a job, it turned into
a crusade as he witnessed a growing number of restrictions over
guns.
</P>
<P>
   He also came to associate with extremists in the militia
movement, white supremacy groups and the violent fringes of
anti-abortion militancy. When these ties were revealed in 1996, he
was forced to step aside temporarily from his role as co-chairman
of Pat Buchanan's campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt said he had merely given speeches to _ or appeared at
events of _ the organizations in question and did not share their
racist or anti-Semitic views. He simply wanted to talk to them
about guns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has never been the victim of a violent crime, nor has
any member of his family, though one of his daughters, then a
teen-ager, was home alone at the family's house in Springfield
about eight years ago when she saw a man who seemed to be casing
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was out of town, but she called him to ask where the gun
was. As he told her he felt relief. He said she did not have to use
the weapon; the man never approached the house.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt tries to have a sense of humor about his work, but it can
come across as brazenness. One of two baseball caps in his office
has a picture of a handgun and the words, ``I Don't Dial 911.'' The
other cap has two mock bullet holes in it and says, ``My Gun
Cleaning Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he indeed had a gun with him in his office,
at this moment. Was it actually on him?
</P>
<P>
   He paused a short beat before answering. ``It's close enough.''

INDIA WILL LIKELY HOLD ELECTIONS FOR THIRD TIME IN 3 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A week after the Hindu nationalist-led
government collapsed, India appeared to be headed for its third
general election in three years as the opposition's efforts to form
a new government disintegrated Sunday in acrimony and finger
pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi, the widowed heir to the
nation's political dynasty who actively campaigned to bring down
the government, admitted Sunday that her first attempt to lead the
party back to power had failed.
</P>
<P>
   She was unable to win enough support from other opposition
parties for Congress, which has only about a quarter of the votes
in Parliament, to form a government by itself. And she ruled out
supporting a coalition that would have necessarily included more
than 20 squabbling, demanding parties in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not ready to bargain,'' Mrs. Gandhi said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi's reputation for calm, shrewd leadership was
tarnished in the past week as Congress helped shatter one
government but was unable to put together the shards of the
opposition to form a new one. In what now appears to have been a
bluff, she claimed on Wednesday that she had the 272 votes for a
majority, but confessed Sunday that she had come up with only 239.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who has never held elective office, informed
President K. R. Narayanan of the political stalemate. It is now up
to him to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said there was an outside chance the
president would give the coalition that narrowly lost a confidence
vote a week ago another chance. But so far, that coalition, led by
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, has claimed 270
supporters, still two votes short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely option is to hold general elections since no
alliance of the more than 40 parties in Parliament has mustered a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who resigned a week ago but
stayed on as a caretaker, announced Sunday evening after meeting
with Narayanan that he would call a Cabinet meeting on Monday
morning to discuss the political crisis. He did not say what action
they would take. Nor did he describe what the president had
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said it is likely that the Cabinet will request
dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, and
call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tired and dejected, Vajpayee, 72, pointedly noted that
some in the opposition had claimed a new government would be formed
in five minutes. If there are elections, leaders of the Bharatiya
Janata Party will undoubtedly portray their main rival, the
Congress Party, as a destructive force more interested in coming to
power than in the country's need for political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, a grandfatherly looking man with an understated
manner, is generally thought to be more popular than his party,
which has had trouble shaking its reputation for being anti-Muslim
and, more recently, anti-Christian, in its pursuit of an idea of
India as a nation united by a Hindu way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee has said in the past that his current stint as prime
minister would be his last in government, but on Thursday, during a
somber dinner party at the home of a supporting member of
parliament, he chuckled mirthlessly when asked if he would run
again. Then he fell silent. Munching from a plate of sweets, he
drifted away to another conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If parliament is dissolved, elections must take place within six
months. Pulling off national elections in India _ the world's
largest democracy with more than 600 million voters _ is a costly,
gargantuan task. And because of the timing, voting would either
have to take place in the near future, during the scorching summer
when temperatures routinely top 105 degrees in some parts of the
country, or during monsoon rains that leave parts of the country
flooded, muddy and impassable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The way the last week has played out seems likely to have
damaged the Congress Party politically and created sympathy for the
Bharatiya Janata Party, which lost a confidence vote by the
narrowest margin ever in independent India _ a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   The government's fall came after Jayalalitha Jayaram, head of an
18-member party from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, withdrew her
support, but Mrs. Gandhi is seen to have encouraged Jayalalitha, a
former actress who is known by her first name, to jump ship by
attending a tea party in her honor, a step that suggested Congress
might be a friendlier port of call.
</P>
<P>
   After Jayalalitha quit, Mrs. Gandhi personally lobbied many
party leaders to vote against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say her advisers badly miscalculated the
degree of support Congress would get to run a government that left
all its allies on the outside looking in. Mulayam Singh Yadav,
leader of a party in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh,
that is a bitter rival of Congress, flatly refused to support any
government that excluded his party. Without his 20 votes, Mrs.
Gandhi's gambit was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Until the current debacle, Mrs. Gandhi had won plaudits for her
restraint in seeking power. Repeatedly, she had stressed that
Congress needed to rebuild its corroded foundations before it took
power.
</P>
<P>
   She had begun installing a younger generation of leaders at the
state level. Attempting to rebuild the party's fractured coalition,
she had pushed through a measure requiring that 53 percent of party
officials at all levels be women, Muslims or low-caste people.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy had seemed to be working. In November, Congress
clobbered the Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections, largely on
the issue of rising vegetable prices.
</P>
<P>
   But some Congress Party officials said that in recent months
party leaders had begun to worry that the Hindu nationalists were
consolidating their hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Prices had come down. Attacks on Christian churches and schools,
which many believed were fomented by groups allied with the party,
had dwindled. The government had introduced a budget that was well
received. And after months of mixed signals, it had pressed forward
with a number of economic proposals to encourage investment and
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   When Jayalalitha's withdrawal deprived the government of a
majority, Congress went into action to insure that Vajpayee's
coalition lost the vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gandhi had played her hand very cooly and unhurriedly in
favor of waiting for a few more state assembly elections,'' said
Pran Chopra, a political analyst at the Center for Policy Research
in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   But this time she listened to advisers who told her that
Congress could win control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very bad advice,'' Chopra said. ``But the advisers were
appointed by her and the responsibility of that advice belongs to
her.''

`L.A. RIOTS REVISITED:' THE DAY VIOLENCE ECLIPSED THE SUNLIGHT

 &HT;    (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although ``L.A. Riots Revisited'' comes up with no revelations,
it does bring back the striking failure of the Los Angeles police
to contain, much less control, the April 1992 riots that left much
of the city ablaze. While mobs ran through South-Central Los
Angeles, looting and burning and attacking whites who found
themselves in the wrong place, the police dithered, retreated and
for a time surrendered to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting, we are reminded Monday night at 9 on A&AMP;E, was set
off when a jury from Simi Valley, a mainly white town, returned a
not guilty verdict for four white officers who had been seen on
video beating a black man named Rodney King. Bill Kurtis,
narrating, suggests that the jury was reacting to a few seconds of
the tape that fuzzily caught King charging at the police officers,
images not widely included in the repeatedly broadcast pictures of
the King beating. Whether that explanation, advanced by someone
identified as ``a defense attorney,'' can mitigate the police
outburst, the viewer can decide.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the suggestion that the officers were forced to club
King because they had been forbidden to use choke holds does not
explain the gratuitous quality of the beating revealed on the
video.
</P>
<P>
   In his search for explanations of the riots, Kurtis criticizes
television's treatment of the beating, with its heightened,
slow-motion effects, as well as the live coverage of the riots,
which may have further incited the crowd. He does not note that his
own series, ``Investigative Reports,'' is given to such techniques
of docudrama. Monday night's program, for example, opens with
re-enactments that have no other purpose than to add to the
emotional punch.
</P>
<P>
   The program also suggests that the efforts of individuals, black
and white, to calm rioters and help victims were insufficiently
reported. Perhaps, but no doubt is left that the basic failure was
the lack of leadership by the authorities. Once it became apparent
on the streets that the police could not or would not react
forcefully to the outbursts of violence in a neighborhood known for
the presence of youth gangs, the results were ordained. It was,
Kurtis says, ``a lesson in failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Riots Revisited'' ends on an optimistic if somewhat
wishful note, with reports on efforts by black churches to rebuild
burned-out areas of South-Central. But the pictures of
still-devastated areas are likely to leave viewers reflecting on
the job that a mob can do when the police fail to do their job.

OSCAR BOARD RETHINKS FATE OF THE SHORT DOCUMENTARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Lazarus had been making films about social issues for
17 years before she won an Academy Award in 1994 for ``Defending
Our Lives,'' a 30-minute documentary recording the experiences of
battered women who were convicted of killing their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination alone landed her $135,000 film a 10-city tour
along with other nominated short films. But the Oscar made the film
an instant classic with women's groups, giving Ms. Lazarus _ and
her cause _ enormous exposure and making it much easier for her to
raise money for subsequent work. ``I'd been making a lot of films,
but nothing else propelled to the heights this did,'' Ms. Lazarus
said, referring to her Academy Award. ``It made the film enter a
different dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, however, the board of governors of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which administers the
Oscars, voted to eliminate the separate award for short
documentaries (40 minutes or under), contending that there were no
longer enough entries to justify it. The decision meant that next
year, short and feature-length documentaries would compete in one
category.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 7 vote provoked an outcry from documentary filmmakers,
who say that short documentaries, which were first recognized by
the academy in 1943, are an art form in themselves, a vehicle for
provocative or challenging subjects and a path of entry for young
filmmakers with limited resources. Many suggested that the action
was taken to shorten the Oscars presentation, an accusation that
the Academy leadership vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   The protest led to a resolution seeking to restore the separate
award. It will be taken up by the board at a meeting Tuesday, said
Bruce Davis, the executive director of the Academy. Last week
Martin Scorsese, Robert Redford, the director Taylor Hackford,
Michael Eisner, the chairman of Disney, and 55 other prominent
members of the film industry joined the movement to overturn the
decision. In an ad running in trade papers, they said that ``Oscars
for short films provide inspiration to filmmakers and moviegoers
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the board's decision, Davis said that a separate
category for short documentaries was not warranted because most of
the 23 films that were entered for nomination this year were made
not for movie theaters but for television, which is outside the
purview of the Academy. ``We have to maintain that distinction,''
he said. ``It's not about snobbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Imax films, which are being shown at an increasing number of
theaters, are an exception, Davis acknowledged. ``But over the last
five years, there have been two and a half Imax documentaries a
year,'' he said. ``That's not enough to maintain a real category.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers say the Academy's leadership is out of touch. Short
films are shown in a wide variety of places, including theme parks,
museums and film festivals, said Bob Rogers, a veteran film maker
who was nominated twice in the category for short live action
films.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and other critics of the Academy's decision said the
academy would be better advised to delete some of the plodding
Oscar night production numbers rather than an award that often
produces some of the broadcast's freshest moments. Jessica Yu,
whose short film, ``Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark
O'Brien,'' was honored last year, is still remembered for saying
that her dress cost more than her film.
</P>
<P>
   This year Keiko Ibi, who won for her film ``The Personals:
Improvisations on Romance in the Golden Years,'' touched audiences
when she delivered a succinct speech thanking her ``mother for
letting me come to the United States so I can follow my dream to
become a filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the board of governors decided to eliminate the awards
for both short documentaries and short films using actors, which
are known as live action films. The move drew a similar protest
from some of the movie industry's biggest names, leading the board,
in what some people considered a face-saving effort, to shelve the
decision and commission a study. After examining the 88-page report
by a researcher, Heather Lindquist, the governors reversed
themselves and restored the categories.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came up again after Chuck Workman, a filmmaker whose
montages are seen during the awards presentation, observed at a
meeting of the Academy's executive committee that both the number
and the quality of short-documentary entrees had declined. But
Workman, who won an Oscar in 1986 for a short documentary,
``Precious Images,'' said he had never suggested that the category
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Workman urged Davis and Robert Rehme, the president
of the academy, to retain the category and predicted that the
caliber would improve if short documentaries shown at film
festivals were allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   As several other filmmakers suggested, Hackford, the director of
``An Officer and a Gentleman,'' said he thought the consolidation
of short and long documentaries was a first step that would
eventually result in the elimination of short live action and short
animated films. He said that an Oscar he won for a live action
short, ``Teenage Father,'' in 1978 was pivotal in his career. ``It
gave me an entree that I didn't have before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Guttentag, who won an Oscar in 1989 for the short
documentary ``You Don't Have to Die,'' about a young boy's triumph
over cancer, said that short films deserved to be honored for their
quality rather than the boost they give winners. ``Is a short story
by Philip Roth any less valid than one of his novels?'' he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For three decades Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's
greatest modern writer, felt the full force of President Suharto's
military state.
</P>
<P>
   Clubbed on the head when he was seized by the police in 1965 _
Indonesia's infamous ``year of living dangerously'' _ he lost much
of his hearing. Arrested without charge, he was imprisoned and
silenced for 14 years, confined for most of that time to a remote
island penal colony where he was forced into hard labor and had to
forage for food. More than a dozen years of closely monitored house
arrest followed.
</P>
<P>
   He is a free man now on his first visit to the United States,
his first trip abroad since 1959. At 74 he is small and frail and
speaks sparingly and quietly. But when he speaks, there is no
mistaking his strength, and no sign that his tormentors ever came
close to breaking his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just seem strong; it takes more than strength to
survive,'' he said on a balmy afternoon in the garden outside the
United Nations, which he had just toured. ``It took resistance,
mental resistance as well as spiritual resistance. Strength was not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya's story of suffering and survival on the prison island
of Buru are the theme of a memoir, ``The Mute's Soliloquy,'' to be
published in the United States on Wednesday by Hyperion East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mute's Soliloquy'' is a collection of ruminations from the
Buru experience in the form of notes to himself and unsent letters
to his eight children, whose growing-up years he missed. The
letters are full of fatherly advice: don't swim carelessly in the
sea; take your vitamins; learn to relax before falling asleep at
night; study history.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Indonesian through an interpreter, his American
editor and friend, John McGlynn, a co-founder of the Lontar
Foundation to promote Indonesian literature abroad, Pramoedya
(pronounced pram-OOH-dee-ah) is still pained by the damage his
ordeal caused his family. In an interview, he was acerbic about the
quality of Indonesian intellectual life and guarded in his
predictions about Indonesia's future.
</P>
<P>
   Last May the 30-year rule of Suharto came to an end amid street
protests against his corrupt and dictatorial military government.
At the same time an economic crisis gutted the currency and
Indonesian living standards, bringing the International Monetary
Fund into the management of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under an interim president, B.J. Habibie, elections are to be
held in June to elect a new parliament, which in turn is to choose
a new president this fall for Indonesia, the world's
fourth-most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya seems to doubt that Indonesians, consumed now by the
settling of ethnic and political scores through violence on several
islands, have the courage to make a clean sweep of the old order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole country of `yes' people,'' he remarked
dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   He never was one. A leftist and supporter of Indonesia's first
president, Sukarno, Pramoedya continues to hold some anti-Western
opinions and suspicions about the United States. He discourses
freely on the corruption of the Indonesian military and the
cowardice of the older generations, which are now closing ranks, he
says, against change and possible revelations about the past.
</P>
<P>
   He still has critics who suspect that he was closer than he
admits to a communist movement that was intent on controlling
intellectual life in the 1960s and might have been prepared to
seize political power in 1965, when Suharto stepped into a murky
coup and tens of thousands of suspected leftists and ethnic Chinese
were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya says he cannot understand why anyone would be
interested in these old accusations. But he says that to get into
politics now would only revive old charges that he is a communist.
Sukarno's daughter, Megawati Sukarnoputri, is expected to be a
leading candidate for president in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya, who says he freed himself from house arrest in 1992
by simply walking out onto the street on Human Rights Day, has
picked up several international prizes in recent years, among them
the 1995 Magsaysay Award, Asia's top honor, and a UNESCO award in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   His newest book was the subject of an Asia Society program on
Thursday. Last week Fordham University, which arranged his trip to
the United States, held a three-day symposium on his work.
</P>
<P>
   He is to receive an honorary degree this week from the
University of Michigan and then plans to visit the University of
Wisconsin and Berkeley before touring Canada and finally the
Netherlands, the colonial power in Indonesia for 300 years. In 1947
Pramoedya was imprisoned by the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   For Pramoedya, recognition late in life is no recompense for
``all the things that have been stolen from my life.'' Separation
for years from his wife, Maimoenah Thamrin, and children in the
1960s and '70s was a kind of torture in itself, because he had
vowed as a young man to be a better father than his own scholarly
but distant father had been.
</P>
<P>
   Postcards to his children were censored. ``But an even greater
tragedy than being unable to teach my own children was that the
atmosphere created by the New Order acted as a stronger teacher for
them,'' he said, using the Suharto regime's name for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely difficult for them. During the time I was
away, they had to bear the burden of curses, people looking down on
them, people exiling them within the community, so that they
themselves didn't grow up naturally. They didn't become the people
they should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his daughters was barred from taking a final exam in
pharmacology, although she topped the class. Even after Pramoedya's
release from Buru in 1979, he said, his only son, then a young
teen-ager, was beaten by a gang of taunters, and then arrested and
tortured by the police officers who arrived to break up the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   If Pramoedya was deprived of a normal life, Indonesia was also
denied the work of many writers and thinkers who shared his
experience of harassment and years in prison. He does not hold the
government solely responsible for their isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the intellectuals themselves,'' he said.
``A good portion of the blame rests on the intellectuals. The
Indonesian intelligentsia has no tradition of speaking out. The
intelligentsia, for the most part, comes from the upper class. And
that particular group of people was raised to respect the status
quo. They listen to what their superiors say. This unfortunate
aspect of Indonesian culture came to the fore in the past 30 years,
where everyone from top to bottom had to listen to the top. The
only exceptions you might find were the intellectuals who lived
abroad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not many Indonesians lived and wrote abroad, being unable to
tear themselves away from the intense cultures of their
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that many Indonesians felt that they
could not survive abroad, not just in the intellectual sphere but
in the material sphere,'' he said. ``Indonesians seem to have a bit
of an inferiority complex presenting themselves to the foreign
world. Even when you talk about Indonesia itself, you don't find
many Indonesians who know their own history. A lot of them have to
read textbooks written by foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, where Pramoedya is still wary of leaving home alone
for fear of government spies or the police, his books of both
fiction and history remain officially banned, though they are now
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known novels form a four-part series, the Buru Quartet
_ ``This Earth of Mankind,'' ``Child of All Nations,''
``Footsteps'' and ``House of Glass'' _ built around the life of
Minke, a Javanese boy who comes of age in the waning years of Dutch
colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   The books were composed in his head on Buru, a mental exercise
that helped preserve his strength and sanity. They were written
down only late in his imprisonment, when he was allowed a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Politically charged students now flock to Pramoedya to draw on
his wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wave after wave of young people come to my house, and I keep
telling them, `Have the courage to stand up for your
convictions,''' he said. ``All that the younger generation needs is
capital, capital in the sense of bravery and courage. Bravery and
courage does not come down from the heavens. You have to create it
yourself. It's as much a part of fitness as a physical fitness
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya is impressed by the emergence of the student movement
that drove Suharto from power last May, especially since many of
the young people were drawn from comfortable families in which
challenging authority was not encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddly enough, having been raised in deceit has also opened
their eyes to deceit and has brought them together as a class,'' he
said. ``They are without power. They had no weapons. They were
without hope of success. But they went after Suharto and they
brought him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The future ``is completely dependent upon the youth,'' he said.
``If they can pass the test of history itself, Indonesia will
survive and become stronger. But if they can't, I don't see much of
a future. I see only two choices ahead: One is that students
achieve their goal of complete reformation of the government or, if
that doesn't work, the consequence could well be social revolution.
If the latter were to happen, that would be the end of Indonesia as
we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pramoedya spends his days writing a diary and occasional
articles, while collecting histories of prisoners whom the Dutch
sent into exile in Irian Jaya, Indonesia's share of New Guinea. He
is keeping a journal about his current trip and his impressions of
the United States. For years he held this country responsible for
prolonging colonialism in Indonesia and interfering even after it
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general my intellectual opinions about the United States
are pretty much what they once were,'' he said. ``But this trip has
given me the opportunity to balance my views, to fill out the
picture. I find it such a pleasure to see so many ethnic groups,
religions, people from all over the world being able to live here
in harmony and peace,'' he said, after stops in Washington,
Bennington, Vt., and Ithaca, before arriving in New York City on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to see police forces without the arrogance that
is apparent in my own country,'' he added. Not yet knowing about
the criticism of police violence in New York recently, his general
reaction to American police was positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesians seem to have a problem with power,'' he said.
``They get just a little bit of it, even an ounce, and they go
overboard.''

FREQUENT PARENTAL WARNINGS ABOUT DRUG USE ARE MOST EFFECTIVE, STUDY
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents who talk to children about the risks of illicit drugs
sometimes despair that their warning goes in one ear and out the
other. But the message just might stick in a young brain if it gets
repeated enough, according to a study of parental and adolescent
attitudes to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a
nonprofit coalition best known for its anti-drug advertisements,
also reported a dramatic disconnection between parents and children
in getting the message through. The study is being released over
the Internet, at www.drugfreeamerica.org.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming 98 percent of the parents in the study said they
talked with their children about drugs, but only 65 percent of
teen-agers recalled having such a conversation. And a mere 27
percent of teen-agers said they learned a lot from their family
about the hazards of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the study reported that the more adolescents
hear from parents about the risks, the less likely they are to use
drugs, even if they fail to heed the advice altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Of the teen-agers in the study who said they heard nothing at
home about the risks of drugs, 45 percent said they had smoked
marijuana within the last year. One-third of those who said they
learned a little at home used marijuana in the same period. But
among teen-agers who said they learned a lot, only 26 percent said
they smoked marijuana, the primary drug of choice after alcohol and
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable reductions were reported in the use of inhalants,
hallucinogens like LSD and crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   When parents hesitate to tell their children about drugs, said
Stephen Dnistrian, executive vice president of the partnership,
``We can make a pretty safe assumption that there is probably not a
lot of communication between parent and child about a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Partnership Attitude Tracking Study, the 12th such
study since 1987, was conducted last year by Audits and Surveys
Worldwide Inc., a market research firm based in New York. It
sampled 6,852 teen-agers age 13 to 18, 2,358 children 9 to 12 years
old and 809 parents around the United States. The margin of error
in the responses was 1.8 percent for teen-agers, 2.8 percent for
pre-teens and 3.9 percent for parents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though virtually all the parents said they raised the issue of
drugs with their teen-agers, fewer than half, or 48 percent, said
they had done so four or more times in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Black parents were more likely than Hispanic or white parents to
say they discussed the risks of drugs regularly with their
children. Fifty-seven percent of black parents in the study said
they did so, compared with 45 percent of Hispanic parents and 44
percent of white parents. And 31 percent of the black children in
the study recalled having such conversations, compared with 29
percent of Hispanic children but only 19 percent of white ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents cannot seem to bring themselves to believe that
their children might experiment with drugs. According to the study,
42 percent of the teen-agers said they tried smoking marijuana, but
only 14 percent of the parents thought this was possible. And 53
percent of teen-agers said they had been offered marijuana; 37
percent of the parents considered it likely.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's director of national drug control policy, Gen.
Barry R. McCaffrey, said the study made an important point about
the disparity between perception and reality in parents'
conversations with their children about the dangers of drugs.
``Like a good teacher, they must check the feedback,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   His Office of National Drug Control Policy defined as its first
goal educating and enabling young people to reject illegal drugs as
well as alcohol and tobacco. Congress appropriated $195 million for
a national media campaign to sway a target audience of 9-to
18-year-olds with prime-time commercials and print advertisements.
The campaign, which was begun in July, also tries to persuade
parents to confront the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership study said that 66 percent of pre-teen children
in the study last year agreed with the statement that ``people on
drugs are stupid,'' compared with 63 percent in 1997. And 56
percent of children in the fourth- to sixth-grades said they wished
their parents would talk more about how drugs were bad.

SUN PLANS TO INTRODUCE NEW NETWORK PRODUCT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md.)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to introduce a
software product on Monday that is designed for companies that want
to let their employees use various devices to connect to corporate
computer networks, secure from unauthorized access.
</P>
<P>
   Employing the system, workers could use desktop computers,
laptops or even hand-held personal digital assistants to connect to
the network.
</P>
<P>
   The new software, called i-Planet, creates an electronic work
space for employees that includes traditional applications like
word processing and spreadsheets as well as group calendars, file
storage and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The approach represents a refinement of the original ``network
computer,'' or NC, strategy first proposed in 1996 and supported by
companies including Sun, Oracle, IBM and Apple Computer as an
alternative to the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   That NC has been slow to gain support, in part because of the
drastic collapse in prices of personal computers based on
Microsoft's Windows operating system, as well as slow development
of software and hardware to replace standard office PC's.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, however, industry executives like Sun's chairman,
Scott McNealy, and Oracle's chairman, Larry Ellison, have continued
to push for an alternative to the traditional corporate PC network.
</P>
<P>
   As with the NC strategy, i-Planet aims to eliminate the need for
installation of software programs on individual computers by
offering software services that users would employ through
network-access devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a fundamental shift to the consumerization of
network access and the emergence of network services,'' said Greg
Papadopoulos, Sun's chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's executives said the company, which is based in Palo Alto,
Calif., planned to offer i-Planet through alliances with companies
that provide services based on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to the planning plans said Sun would
announce those partners on May 5. One partner is expected to be
Digex Inc. of Beltsville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sun and Microsoft have worked on technologies intended to
shift corporate information away from the personal computer and
back toward centralized corporate computing systems that are in
some ways reminiscent of mainframe computer setups.
</P>
<P>
   Last year William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, circulated a
memorandum that outlined a system he referred to as a
``megaserver'' that would act as a repository and distributor of
most corporate information.
</P>
<P>
   Papadopoulos compared i-Planet to consumer media portals like
Yahoo, Excite and Lycos, except with built-in security features to
safeguard the information that passes between the employee's
computing device and the central server.

 &HT;    Confederate Memorial Day forgotten by many
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frank ``Skip'' Alcorn IV remembers as a kid scooping
minie balls ``by the bucketful'' out of Tanyard Creek in Collier
Hills. Once he ``scared my mother to death'' by lugging home a
cannon ball he'd found. And his mind's eye still sees the
``fantastic, deep trenches'' on the spot where Piedmont Hospital
now stands.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Alcorn, 51, laments that in a city long linked
to the Civil War by ``Gone With The Wind,'' so many remnants of
Atlanta's past have vanished like the trenches he remembers from
his adolescence. One exception is Confederate Memorial Day today,
but not many people other than state employees are even aware of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Its main impact today will be on traffic. For more than 81,000
state workers, including 30,000 in Atlanta, it's a paid day off.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, the original Confederate Constitution will be hauled
out of storage and put on display at the University of Georgia's
library, as it is every year only on Confederate Memorial Day. Over
the weekend, groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the
United Daughters of the Confederacy held wreath-laying ceremonies
at cemeteries across the city, state and South.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the South has changed so much since World War II that few
people seem to care about the day, or even know it exists, says
John Shelton Reed, a sociologist at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in Southern culture. Only
31 percent of Southerners had ancestors in the Confederate army,
according to a recent UNC poll. Eight percent had ancestors who
were Union soldiers, 8 percent had ancestors on both sides and 34
percent said they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of African-Americans, the day is a reminder, like
the Confederate battle emblem on Georgia's state flag, of ``a lost
and wrongful cause,'' said Rev. Joseph Lowery, former head of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The state holiday hasn't attracted the protests that the battle
flag has, but there are many who would like to see it abolished.
Georgia legislators designed Confederate Memorial Day as a holiday
in 1874. Many states in the former Confederacy commemorate their
veterans, some with state holidays.
</P>
<P>
   But such days annoy many African-Americans, says historian Skip
Mason of Morris Brown College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a horrific time to those who are descendants of
those African-Americans who were slaves,'' said Mason. ``That we
should still have it as a holiday I find absolutely unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, including members of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans and United Daughters of the Confederacy, argue that men
who fought for a cause they thought just should be forever honored.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Dunaway, an official of the UDC, said it would be
unthinkable not to honor those who fought for the Confederacy, and
even Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to preserve this period of history,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And some African-Americans see a value in having a Confederate
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that should be studied, not glamorized,'' said
Erwin Jordan, a University of Virginia historian, and an
African-American who authored a book about black men who supported
or fought for the Confederacy. ``It's an episode in history from
which we can learn, and by learning, perhaps not repeat some of the
same mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed contends both sides are right _ and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not inappropriate for people to honor the Confederate war
dead,'' he said. ``These were honorable men who were doing their
duty as they saw it, and it seems to me that memorials are quite
appropriate. The problem comes when the state gets into the act and
basically says, 'This is everybody's holiday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials insist a day should be set aside to honor a
war that killed more than 618,000 Confederate and Union soldiers
because it serves as a reminder of a past that no one should want
to forget, however painful. More soldiers died in the Civil War
than any in other war where Americans have fought. In comparison,
405,000 Americans died in World War II.

KOSOVO REBELS SPEAK OUT IN ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ For the first time since NATO began bombing
Yugoslavia, leaders of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in northern
Albania spoke openly on Sunday with Western reporters, detailing
what they said were crippling shortages of ammunition and food in
Kosovo, and confusion within the rebel force itself.
</P>
<P>
   Although the KLA openly has a base in this town, its
representatives have growled at reporters and refused all requests
for interviews or photographs for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the rebels produced a military spokesman who calls
himself Leopard II, and a representative of the Kosovo Albanians'
underground government. Like rebels who have previously met
reporters in Albania's capital, Tirana, or commanders reached in
Kosovo by telephone from Macedonia, they described fierce fighting
between the rebel army and Serbian troops across many areas in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gani Sylaj, who said he is a former schoolteacher who spent 11
years in Yugoslav jails for advocating freedom for Kosovo, also
accused the Serbian security forces in Kosovo of a list of
massacres and rapes. There was no way to confirm their accounts
independently.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden openness of the KLA in Kukes appears to represent a
new strategy that has the potential to stir up the already volatile
state of politics in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing a meeting with reporters may have been the rebels'
way of mitigating reports of thuggish acts by KLA adherents, who
had for a time appeared to take civil control of Kukes, pulling
people off the street for questioning, and enforcing order. Young
refugees here often voice the fear that they will be grabbed by KLA
soldiers and forced to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of a KLA office here also raises questions
about what effect the rebels' activities will have on the political
landscape of Albania, whose northeast is the political stronghold
of former president Sali Berisha. His government lost control of
this rugged, mountainous country before he lost elections in June
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The current Albanian government openly backs the Albanian
rebels' aim of independence, but _ unlike Berisha, whose family
property in the northeastern Albanian town of Tropoja has served
the rebels as a weapons depot in the past _ says it does not back
the rebels militarily.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government has ceded control of its air space and
military bases to the NATO allies for their war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA representative would not confirm or deny that support
was coming from Berisha, or that he has any designs on using the
conflict to return to power. ``We are getting all the help which is
possible to get from all our friends around the world,'' said
Leopard II. ``I cannot say that it is coming from Mr. Berisha or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The military spokesman, who said he had served in the Yugoslav
army until 1990 and attended the military academy in Zagreb, said
the rebels currently are strongest in northeastern Kosovo, where he
said civilians are unable to flee, because the region abuts Serbia
proper.
</P>
<P>
   The commander said the KLA controls about 70 percent of that
northeastern Kosovo area. He would not offer a similar assessment
for other parts of the province, but said the picture shifts in
accord with civilian and Serbian movements.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA leaders expressed unlimited support for continued NATO
bombings, a planned oil embargo of Yugoslavia and called for ground
troops which they said could be guided by rebel leaders past
mountains and valleys where Serbian armor and tanks are concealed,
thus reducing allied casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been reluctant to lend open support to the KLA, which
last winter was seen as violating the cease-fire in Kosovo almost
as often as the Serbs. Western diplomats view the still shadowy
group with suspicion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Founded in the early 1990s, the rebel group developed slowly and
unsteadily, with not much support and little in the way of arms or
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1997, chaos in neighboring Albania provided a windfall.
Berisha's government fell after crooked pyramid schemes collapsed.
Armories were looted and the country was flooded with 1 million
cheap automatic rifles. Many were brought into Kosovo and got into
the hands of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of a leading KLA organizer, Adem Jashari, and dozens
of members of his extended family in March 1998 encouraged many
Kosovo Albanians to switch support from the pacifist tactics of
their political leaders to the rebels, who were fighting for
independence but have appeared unprepared to assume political
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Sylaj conceded Sunday that the KLA has yet to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits and volunteers from the Albanian diaspora have been
streaming into Albania, the KLA says. It is unclear how many of
them have actually been sent to fight, or assigned to strengthen
the KLA's disorganized command structure. The KLA says volunteers
are only processed at its Kukes base, and are then sent to safe
areas in KLA-controlled parts of Kosovo for training.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has been running a recruitment campaign on Albanian
television. In one spot, videotape of civilians wounded in a Serb
attack is shown over footage of rebel recruits being trained. At
the end of the spot a voice sings, in English, ``That's why we are
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesmen insisted that all the recruits are volunteers,
denying that young men are being picked up off the streets and
forced to join. And they denied that the KLA received financial
support from drug trafficking or other illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money laundering, no drug money, none at all,''
said Sylaj. He said the bulk of the army's funding comes from
contributions sent by more than 100,000 Kosovo Albanians living
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   There have been independent reports of more than 50 KLA soldiers
being brought to the Albanian hospital at Bajram Curri, near the
border north of here. The spokesman would not confirm the number of
casualties but he did say soldiers had been wounded in border
skirmishes and in fighting within Kosovo.

ANALYSIS: NATO SUMMIT MEETING'S SUCCESS WAS IN ITS APPEARANCE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The timing could hardly have been worse as the
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization was largely obscured by savagery in Kosovo and
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the absence of the Russians sounded a foreboding
note, especially since many of the European diplomats who assembled
here over the weekend consider it a near certainty that they will
eventually have to call upon the Russians to help negotiate an
agreement in Kosovo or to help enforce one or both.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did what he could to keep that possibility
open in a lengthy telephone conversation Sunday with the Russian
president, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the NATO summit meeting, which ended Sunday afternoon,
proved to have unanticipated uses, however inert the rhetoric and
however unconvincing the reports of steady, significant military
success may have been.
</P>
<P>
   On the most basic level, it gave Clinton a chance to dramatize
the fact that the air attacks on Kosovo are the attacks of a broad
international alliance, although most of the aircraft are flown and
most of the missiles are fired by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Americans have been arguing that the Balkans are a
European problem and asking why the Europeans were not stepping in
to handle it. On a number of occasions, the United States has
thrown up its hands entirely, in part because American politicians
considered the Balkans a quagmire where public support for any
American involvement would soon dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got no dog in this fight,'' said James Baker, then the
secretary of state, after a visit to Yugoslavia as it was beginning
to fly apart eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, in a nice piece of symbolism, briefers with
European accents _ an Englishman, an Italian, a German, a Spaniard
_ stood behind lecterns in Washington with their American
counterparts to discuss the war. The administration hopes some of
the American public was paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there was strength in visible numbers for the leaders
of countries where the military campaign against President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia is unpopular and growing more so with each
night the bombs rain down.
</P>
<P>
   President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, a country with
longstanding ties to Yugoslavia, could revel for a while in his
nation's new membership in the NATO ``club,'' rather than
confronting in Prague the reality of rapidly vanishing public
approval for NATO's Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations from Greece and Italy played it both ways,
trumpeting their solidarity with NATO in their official statements
on the alliance stage Friday afternoon and speaking more critically
to reporters from their own countries for domestic consumption. The
longer the war, the more likely Greece will grow alienated from the
United States, said Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece.
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini of Italy had harsh words for the
mounting air attacks on civilian targets, including Serbian
television.
</P>
<P>
   Those tensions were not resolved here, nor were others. Some are
long term, such as the question of further expansion of NATO _
backed by France, Italy and Spain as a means of avoiding a split
between western Europe and the Orthodox Christian and Muslim states
farther east that want in, resisted by Germany and Britain on the
ground that the alliance will be weakened by size.
</P>
<P>
   Other lingering questions relate to the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The French, though thoroughly committed to the bombing campaign,
care more about U.N. authorization for future NATO operations than
the other members, and they seemed more worried than their allies
about the possibility of armed confrontation in the effort to block
oil shipments to Yugoslavia. Both disagreements were finessed, for
the moment, with murky language.
</P>
<P>
   On the most fundamental question _ whether the alliance would
even contemplate the commitment of ground troops in the absence of
an agreement with Milosevic _ less happened than met the eye, or
for that matter, ear.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain took the most hawkish
public line, and he pressed Clinton hard in public. His aides
insisted that he had won significant concessions from the
president, and one or two of them pictured him as stiffening
Clinton's resolve the way Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher claimed
to have stiffened the resolve of George Bush at the onset of the
crisis in Kuwait that eventually led to the war in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is well known for his capacity to leave visitors to
the Oval Office convinced that he agrees with them when in fact he
retains serious reservations. Clinton may have accepted the notion
that the ground troops issue needs to be restudied merely to keep
peace in the family or merely to give Milosevic something else to
worry about, without any real intention of moving beyond a study.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the whole thing is deadly earnest and not a stall or a
bluff, much would have to happen before ground troops could move
in, not least the assembly of sufficient equipment, supplies and
support troops, a process that would probably take months. And the
advocates of ground troops would very likely have to decide to go
ahead without a unified NATO behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about this war,'' as Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
put it, ``is that it's being fought by an alliance. The bad thing
about this war is that it's being fought by an alliance.''

 &HT;    Columbine memorial: `The heart of America aches with your heart'
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They came by the thousands, somber faces
under low gray skies, hands clasping bright spring flowers, lapels
pinned with blue and silver ribbons, eyes rimmed with tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, Columbine High School stood silent, the echoes
of Tuesday's gunfire from the nation's worst school shooting
tragedy likely still echoing in the minds of hundreds of teachers
and students who ran for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the past week is about as much suffering as any
community can bear,'' the Rev. Charles J. Chaput, Archbishop of
Denver, told the crowd gathered Sunday to mourn the 13 victims
killed by two boys who then took their own lives. ``But as
scripture says, love is stronger than death. I believe that. Love
is stronger than death.''
</P>
<P>
   The solemn gathering drew an estimated 70,000 people who braved
damp, chilly weather to pay their respects to the victims and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain began to fall as the service drew to a close,
dappling the wings of 13 white doves which were released and
flitted into the sky as Colorado Gov. Bill Owens read the names of
each victim.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Owens on the platform were Vice President Al Gore,
former Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell and numerous other state
and local dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not alone,'' Gore told the crowd, which spilled across
a 20-acre movie theater parking lot and down Bowles Avenue toward
the nearby high school. ``The heart of America aches with your
heart ... To the families of the victims ... may you feel the
embrace of the literally hundreds of millions of Americans who
grieve with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other leaders who have spoken out in the wake of the
tragedy, Gore issued a challenge not to allow the deaths to go in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,'' he
said, his voice shaking. ``More than ever I realize that everyone
of us is responsible for all the children. Somewhere in the reach
of every adult in this country is a child to hold and teach ...
Parents, we can stop the violence and the hate. We can rise up and
we can say, no more.''
</P>
<P>
   The service was the largest of dozens of memorials, funerals and
other community gatherings held in the days since the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who have worked nearly around the clock combing through
the devastated school in a painstaking search for evidence, scaled
back their work Sunday, but are expected to be back at full force
today.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have tightened security at area schools, although
there were no plans to cancel classes in the wake of a disturbing
note received Friday by a Denver newspaper that warned of more
violence to come today.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the note was composed after the two teens, Eric
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed themselves at the end of
their deadly rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris left a detailed diary, begun more than a year
before the shootings, which laid out in chilling detail how they
would carry out the crime. They apparently began building homemade
bombs and gathering weapons months in advance, and even studied
school schedules to determine when they could kill the most
students in one spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going for a big kill,'' Jefferson County Sheriff
John Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were apparently motivated by rage ignited from the
taunting they got from more popular students, particularly
athletes. They also seemed fascinated with Nazism, posting
disturbing messages on a Web page created by Harris.
</P>
<P>
   They carried out their melee on the anniversary of Adolf
Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Police continue to suspect others may have helped them, either
in planning and preparation, or in transporting the numerous bombs
they brought into the school. As yet no other suspects have been
named.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service brought Columbine's shell-shocked students
and teachers together again, a prelude to Thursday when they will
resume classes at Chatfield High School, where they will split the
day with the students who regularly attend that school.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore school jackets or sweatshirts, and nearly everyone
wore a ribbon of blue and silver, the school's colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sticking together,'' said Sarah Cain, 16, a Columbine
sophomore who fled the school cafeteria just before the shooters
came in. ``I've been going over to other kids' houses and talking.
I want to go back in our building, but I don't think I'll go back
in the library again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten victims were found in the library, where witnesses said the
shooters casually strolled around the room, taunting their victims
before shooting many at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelist Franklin Graham, the Rev. Billy Graham's son, spoke
about one victim in the library, Cassie Bernall, who was confronted
by one of the shooters who asked her, ``Do you believe in God?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe in God,'' she replied, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the last words she spoke,'' Graham said, calling on
others to be equally strong in their faith.
</P>
<P>
   The service was filled with many touching songs, including
performances by Christian singers Michael W. Smith, Amy Grant and
Phil Driscol.
</P>
<P>
   Two Columbine students, brothers John and Steve Cohen, opened
the memorial with a song they wrote with their pastor's help. The
song will be released on a CD, with proceeds going to the victims'
families, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine, friend of mine, peace will come to you in time,''
the boys sang, accompanied only by a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   After the white doves were released near the end of the service,
four Colorado Air National Guard jets thundered low over the
gathering, splitting the gray skies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore then led a solemn procession down Bowles Avenue to Clement
Park, where huge makeshift memorials filled with flowers, teddy
bears, cards and balloons now cover several acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sorrow, a lot of sorrow,'' said Joanne Nelson, 60, a
resident of nearby Englewood who volunteered as an usher for the
service. ``It's horrible because there's no explanation. You search
and search but there are no answers.

<P>
   You're going to be reading more John Elway tributes this week as
the king of comebacks officially tells everyone there'll be no more
coming back, sending the entire state of Colorado into group
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   A testimonial we found to be most impressive came, from all
places, another journalist. The Boston Globe's Will McDonough ended
his Sunday column with:
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this a few years before he ever won a Super Bowl, John
Elway is the best quarterback I have ever seen and that covers
almost 40 years in this business. If you put Elway on the same team
with the others considered as the greatest, he would have had them
beat in size, arm strength, mobility, durability and courage. If
they were all young and in their prime, trying out for the same
team, Elway would be the starter.'' . .
</P>
<P>
   __ In the same column, McDonough quotes New York Giants coach
Jim Fassel, who recruited Elway out of Granada Hills High to go to
Stanford and coached him there all four years.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite Elway moment? It came in a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a sophomore playing right field against Arizona State.
They had a man on second and the batter hit a single down the
right-field line, just inches inside the line. John raced to the
line, gloved the ball, turned and threw a strike to home plate to
get the runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything thrown as hard as that ball was. It
was so stunning the players on both sides came out of the dugout,
and the fans came right out of their seats.'' . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Elway leaves football. Jordan left basketball. Gretzky left
hockey. And by the end of the year, after he plays DH long enough
to get his 3,000 knocks, Cal Ripken will leave baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Add Joe DiMaggio's death and fittingly, the last year of the
1900s will be remembered in sports as the year of the good-bye. . .
</P>
<P>
   __ It's already been see-ya-later Lavin-gator at UCLA, so why
does the coach, who broke down and cried while defending himself at
a team meeting when the season ended, seems to be the only one who
thinks Baron Davis will be back? . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Lavin's only hope is that no one else defects, because after
two great recruiting classes, his staff whiffed on every notable
prep senior it wanted, most notably JaRon Rush's little brother
Kareem. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Dave Taylor's short list for a Kings coach reminds us of what
Dodgers' GM Kevin Malone had to pick from last winter: Davey
Johnson, Kevin Kennedy or Mike Scioscia. Does Taylor go with a
proven winner but often-fired guy (Mike Keenan), someone who's been
there but isn't in the loop anymore (Ted Nolan) or a former team
star who might not be ready (Butch Goring or Dave Lewis)? If form
follows function, go with Keenan on Staples Center opening night. .
.
</P>
<P>
   __ If that great humanitarian who owns the Clips spent as much
on NBA talent as he has publicizing the latest Friars Club roast,
maybe his team wouldn't be the butt of another Dom Irerra guffaw.
As if DTS knows the difference between Cazzie Russell and Nipsy
Russell. He's still following up on a lead that Yakov Smirnoff,
knocking 'em dead in Branson, Mo., is the latest European power
forward lock as a lottery pick. . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Finally, if it were anyone but future Friars Clubber Tom
Arnold, we might care. But a star-struck reporter from the Arizona
Republic easily spotted him at Thursday's NHL playoff opener
between St. Louis and Phoenix _ because while all the Coyotes fans
were dressed in white, Arnold came in black.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough that Tombo achieved his purpose of being noticed. He
then said about the Phoenix faithful: ``The crowd is great. . . You
could never get fans to do this in L.A. One, they'd leave after the
first period. Two, they'd never all dress the same because they're
too conceited.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, so?

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at
some of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in
Los Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event
from the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los
Angeles Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   __ April 29, 1970: Long before the NBA instituted the 3-point
rule, the Lakers' Jerry West sinks a 63-footer at the buzzer to tie
Game 4 of the NBA Finals series at 102 against the New York Knicks
at the Forum. West played all 53 minutes and scored 34 points, but
it wasn't enough in this game (which the Lakers lost in OT 108-105)
or for the series (the Knicks won in seven games on Willis Reed's
heroics at Madison Square Garden). (45)
</P>
<P>
   __ April 30, 1989: At Hollywood Park, Bill Shoemaker becomes the
first jockey to win 1,000 stakes races, riding Peace to victory in
the Premiere Handicap. (96)
</P>
<P>
   __ May 1, 1923: Construction is completed at the Los Angeles
Coliseum. It takes less than two years to build (groundbreaking was
Dec. 21, 1921) and the initial construction cost is $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ Birthdays: Tuesday: Former Los Angeles Rams coach Chuck Knox
(67). Sunday: Former UCLA and Lakers star Jamaal Wilkes (born
Jackson Keith Wilkes) (46).

EACH SIDE IN GUN DEBATE ADAPTS SCHOOL MASSACRE TO ITS AIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla.)  (Eds: See also GUN-GROUP-PRATT) 
(mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just hours after the gunfire had stopped on Tuesday in
Littleton, Colo., another battle erupted as lobbying groups and
others on warring sides of the nation's gun debate moved to turn
the shootings to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing that evening on CNN, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of
Handgun Control Inc., blamed the easy access to weapons for the
tragedy. A day later, Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of
the National Rifle Association and its chief political strategist,
went on the MSNBC show ``Equal Time'' to say that Hollywood's
obsession with violence, rather than firearms, was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shootings at Columbine High School,
organizations on both sides of the debate over gun control have
sought to use the killings to advance their legislative agendas or
deflect those of opponents. At stake are proposals that could limit
how guns are sold, or restrict the types of weapons for sale, like
the high-powered semiautomatic pistol that found its way into the
hands of teen-agers in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to influence the public could also affect the outcome
of a growing number of lawsuits against gunmakers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the shootings, many groups recycled familiar
themes, fine-tuning them as more facts emerged. But perhaps the
best indication that the stakes are mounting may lie in how quickly
the rifle association moved to get out its message and what forum
it chose.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the NRA has typically withdrawn from the gun debate
right after a large public shooting, experts sympathetic to the
group said. And Bill Powers, the group's director of public
affairs, said on Thursday that LaPierre's television appearance had
gone forward only because it had been arranged before the Colorado
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time nor the place to debate public policy,''
Powers said. ``Anything other than prayers and thoughts for the
community is not fitting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cory Shields, an MSNBC spokesman, said that producers for
``Equal Time,'' which uses a debate format, contacted LaPierre on
Tuesday, a few hours after the shootings, and that LaPierre agreed
to do the following day's show. The co-host of ``Equal Time,''
which is the only television show on which LaPierre appeared last
week, is Oliver North, who is a member of the NRA's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to MSNBC's version of events, Powers declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was on Tuesday, soon after the initial fragmentary news
reports about the Littleton shootings, that media organizations
began calling groups involved in the gun debate, like Handgun
Control in Washington and the NRA, which is based in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Paiss, the communications director for Handgun Control,
said that one of the group's first steps was to call Suzanne
Wilson, a woman in Jonesboro, Ark., whose daughter was killed when
teen-agers opened fire on schoolchildren there last year and who
has aligned herself with the group. Ms. Paiss said she and her
colleagues did not want Ms. Wilson to first hear about the
Littleton shootings from reporters. Within hours, Ms. Wilson flew
to Washington and began a round of media interviews that made her
both a visible face and a touchstone in the debate that would
follow.
</P>
<P>
   For strategists like Ms. Paiss who were trying to develop a
response to Littleton, the immediate problem was what to say. For
hours, few details were known. By late Tuesday afternoon, the group
decided to have Mrs. Brady appear on ``Larry King Live''; Mrs.
Brady is the wife of James Brady, the former White House press
spokesman who was seriously wounded by gunfire in the assassination
attempt on President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of the shooting last year was child access to
guns,'' said Ms. Paiss, referring to Jonesboro. ``It seemed like
this was going to be a major issue in the Colorado shooting, but we
knew Mrs. Brady could speak generally about the significance of
guns and access to guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the news of the shooting itself was dominant on
Tuesday, by Wednesday old adversaries in the gun control battle had
begun squaring off against each other and familiar battle lines
were being drawn. On various television and radio interviews, Larry
Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, said that
he and his colleagues had sent out the same message they had used
before: Gun control laws cannot prevent random violent acts like
the Colorado shootings because those involved are willing to die.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those favoring looser gun laws were thrown on the
defensive and, as a result, John Lott, a University of Chicago law
professor, was also quickly drawn into the fray. In his writings,
Lott has asserted that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons
can reduce the death toll in public shooting sprees because an
armed citizen can kill or disarm an attacker. In contrast, he
believes, gun control laws can inadvertently endanger the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bottom line is that these laws were passed with the best of
intentions to create safety zones for our children,'' Lott said in
an interview. ``But my concern is that the people who obey these
laws are the good people and what these laws do is make safe zones
for criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day before the Colorado shootings, Lott, whose
work has been attacked by gun control advocates as methodologically
flawed, was in Colorado working with legislators supporting a
concealed weapons bill backed by the NRA. On Wednesday morning, he
said, he got an urgent call from Doug Dean, the majority House
leader in Colorado, asking whether he could refer reporters to him.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Dean pulled the bill, and other state
legislatures also dropped consideration of NRA-sponsored
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both the gun lobbying group and the firearms industry faced
other problems on Wednesday, like what to do about the planned NRA
convention in Denver and what message to put out in the aftermath
of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association _ which on Thursday had been asked by
Denver Mayor Wellington Webb to cancel its meeting _ drastically
scaled back the upcoming convention. In a letter to members signed
by its president, Charlton Heston, it stated that the group had
taken the action ``to show our profound sympathy and respect for
the families and communities in the Denver area in their time of
great loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston also spoke in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The group
champions the work of Lott, and Heston said that the shootings in
Colorado might have been prevented by having even one armed guard
at the school. As it turned out, there was an armed guard on duty
at Columbine High School that day.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA typically draws back from the gun debate for a time
after a major violent crime to avoid becoming negatively associated
with the incident, said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at
Florida State University whose studies have also been cited by the
rifle association. And on Wednesday, a group representing the
nation's leading firearms and ammunition makers was advising its
staff and members to take just that course.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time I do not feel that a statement for widespread
distribution to the media is appropriate because it has not been
suggested and, barring irresponsible exploitation by anti-gun
groups, I do not believe that it will be suggested that firearms,
or the promotion of the recreational use of firearms, are in any
way responsible for this tragedy,'' said a memorandum signed by Bob
Delfay, the president of the National Sporting Sports Foundation,
in Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Delfay said in an interview on Friday that he believed that
groups on both sides of the gun debate should avoid commenting for
a time about Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   But by Wednesday, both Handgun Control and the rifle association
had staked out familiar turf and identified their suspects. Handgun
Control officials said firearms were the reason for the high death
toll at the school and began pushing the group's legislative
agenda, which calls for penalties for parents who do not lock up
guns, added safety devices on weapons and limits on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   That night, on ``Equal Time,'' LaPierre blamed a moral breakdown
in society for events like Littleton, specifically pointing to an
entertainment industry obsessed with violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're increasingly looking away at behavior that our parents
would never have tolerated,'' LaPierre said. ``We're looking the
other way at evil behavior and we need to really focus on what
would turn students into homicidal maniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week after the shootings last year in Jonesboro,
LaPierre had made identical comments. He also said then, as he did
on Wednesday, that his group believed that federal officials,
rather than passing new laws, should more vigorously enforce
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ms. Paiss said that a news report had tentatively
identified one of the weapons used in the Littleton shooting as a
Tech DC9, an assault-style semiautomatic pistol with a
large-capacity magazine, whose manufacture has been banned since
1994. (Officials later confirmed that that had been one of the
weapons used.) Bob Walker, the president of Handgun Control, said
his group would use that information to push harder for tougher
rules on the sale of such weapons or to close loopholes allowing
the sale of such magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the NRA and the Gun Owners of America have dismissed
such initiatives as ``cosmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Kleck, the Florida State University professor, said
that all he had heard were replays of old arguments by both sides
of the gun debate.

CAST YOUR VOTE FOR WORLD'D DUMBEST SOUVENIR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   No question, Michael Jordan had a great supporting cast when he
was with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   So . . . wanna own it?
</P>
<P>
   For a minimum bid of $2,000 (unfortunately likely to go much
higher), Mastro Fine Sports Auctions has the actual, grimy
heel-to-knee fiberglass cast that Jordan used to help heal a broken
foot in 1985, his second NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   You need proof it belonged to His Airness? Lot No. 172 also
includes medical records to ``prove beyond a doubt'' that ``our
consignor was there that day'' in the doctor's office when Jordan
had the cast removed. Jordan not only gave it away but also signed
it, according to the description of the piece in the auction's
catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   At the semi-regular sports memorabilia auction Thursday and
Friday out of Oak Brook, Ill., there's the usual game-worn fare of
expensive trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,500 items are personal treasures you hate to see up
for auction, such as Mike Cuellar's 1969 American League Cy Young
Award trophy or the bat Mark McGwire used to hit his first
professional home run in 1984 with the Single-A Modesto A's.
</P>
<P>
   There's some neat Hall of Fame-type items like a Red Grange
leather helmet (minimum bid $10,000), Gordie Howe's size 102/3
skates ($750) and a Babe Ruth Louisville Slugger with eight notches
near the label that represent the homers he hit with that bat
($15,000).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's stuff like Jordan's cast, as well as:
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 173: Jordan's expired 1991 Illinois drivers license. With
lots of staple holes where the state troopers attached violations.
Minimum bid: $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 237: Tonya Harding's purple sequined costume, worn when
she won the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championship _ when Nancy
Kerrigan was forced to pull out after an unfortunate knee injury.
Minimum bid: $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 654: A mint-condition (no bullet holes or alcohol stains)
long maroon robe trimmed in black with a ``TRC'' monogram that Ty
Cobb wore when Al Stump visited his house to write his biography.
Minimum bid: $900.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 714: A passport Mickey Mantle used to visit Bermuda, the
Bahamas, Canada, the Dominican Republic and France from 1976 to
'81. Minimum bid: $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 732: The rosin bag Montreal pitchers used on Sept. 27,
1998, when McGwire hit homers No. 69 and 70. Minimum bid: $900.
</P>
<P>
   More information on the auction is available via the Internet

LOVE OF PASTIES BRINGS OUT THE DEVOTED ONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You need only pronounce the words ``Cornish pasty'' and devotees
around the world begin to sniff, salivate and generally behave as
though they've been surviving on sunflower husks and vinegar water
since the last millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact you can get the same effect merely by printing
the words on paper. That's exactly what I did in this column a
couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then I've been invited to a spectacularly successful pasty
feed. I learned where to buy the best commercial pasties in greater
Seattle. I have come into possession of the Web site address of the
Pasty Capital of the World. And I learned that, with proper
planning, you can travel from West Seattle to Michigan's Upper
Peninsula fueled only by the contents and fumes of freshly baked
pasties.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Holappa lives in West Seattle but was raised in the
copper mining region of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a large English and Cornish population there and
everyone ate pasties. Besides our dads taking them down the mine
for their lunch, we took them to school in our lunch buckets and in
winter could sometimes heat them on the radiators,'' she reports.
</P>
<P>
   On frequent trips across the country the Holappas and their four
sons would load up on freshly baked pasties in West Seattle or
Michigan and try to survive until they reached the city limits of
Butte, the Pasty Capital of the Rockies. The trick was to avoid
eating up all the warm, fragrant pasties in the first half hour of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   A ``trip home'' for E. Donald Sutton involves traveling from
Bellevue, Wash., to Cornwall, where he was born and raised. The
retired Boeing engineer recently established contact with Hettie
Merrick (Pasty Queen of Cornwall) and with her daughter, Ann
Muller, who now operates the Lizard Pasty Shop at Beacon Terrace,
Helston, Cornwall. Sutton reports that the Web address is:
www.connexions.co.uk/lizardpasty/index.htm
</P>
<P>
   Sutton has determined the best pasties in this area are baked at
the British Pantry in Redmond, Wash., even though the cook is not
from Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   The pasty cooks are also active in Poulsbo, Wash., and Walter
Williams, who was raised in Butte, sent along his grandmother's
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   And from Sequim, Wash., Jean Timmermeister reports that she is
president of the Pacific Northwest Cornish Society. She leaned
about pasty cookery from her grandmother who was also from Butte.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who maintain pasties are the only edible
products of British kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Not true. Shortly after she turned out a batch of pasties, my
wife created a terrific Bubble and Squeak, although _ to tell the
truth _ it neither bubbled nor squeaked. She made it like this:
</P>
<P>
   Bubble and Squeak
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-sized onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 cups mashed potatoes
</P>
<P>
   one-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   one-half teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped ham
</P>
<P>
   1 and a half cups Brussels sprouts or cabbage
</P>
<P>
   Cook and coarsely chop the sprouts or cabbage. Drain and
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet. Mince the onion,
then saute until soft in the skillet. Add the diced ham and cook
another minute or two, then push the ham and onion to one side of
the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Add the mashed potatoes to the skillet. Spoon the onion and ham
over the top, then add the sprouts or cabbage. Add salt and pepper
to taste.
</P>
<P>
   With a wooden spoon moosh everything down in the pan and fry
until the underside of the potato cake is brown and crispy.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with the crispy side up. This makes four portions as a
side dish, two portions as the main dish.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits also specialize in Dover sole and I recently kitchen
tested this recipe with good results.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Sole
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds sole filets
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks plus 1 tablespoon water or one-fourth cup of egg
substitute
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   three-fourths cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   one-eighth teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   one-half cup (or more) of green stuffed olives, halved or sliced
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan and stir in the flour. When
you have a smooth paste, stir in the broth and lemon juice. Let it
thicken, stirring, then keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Lay out the sole filets in a single layer on a greased oven
dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper then dot with the remaining
tablespoon of butter.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the fish dish into a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes, or
until the sole flakes when touched with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the fish to a warm platter.
</P>
<P>
   To the sauce in the pan stir in the egg substitute or the yolks,
which have been beaten with the tablespoon of water. Let thicken
over low heat (do not boil). Stir in the cayenne pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon the sauce over the cooked fish and scatter the sliced
olives over the top. Serves four.

`HOME MOVIES' IS FRESH, ORIGINAL APPROACH TO TV COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the credits on a special-effects blockbuster, the animation
avalanche keeps rolling. And rolling. And rolling some more. There
are so many animated TV series cluttering the prime-time schedule
that we've had to switch to the crowd-estimating system the police
use for rallies, marches and unruly mobs. By this method, UPN's
``Home Movies'' is the 500th animated show to make its debut this
season, give or take.
</P>
<P>
   You may not remember each of the 499 previous entries, but don't
worry, I can't, either. So this won't be on the final exam.
Besides, if you like improvisational humor and wobbly animation,
those that have gone before really don't matter because the TV
hierarchy apparently saved the best for last.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, toonies. ``Home Movies'' is a keeper. It's odd.
It's charming. It's oddly charming and charmingly odd. And anyone
familiar with ``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist'' already knows
it's like watching TV while having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is primitive. The primitives call it minimalist.
They also call it SquiggleVision, which means the TV screen fairly
pulsates because the lines that encompass the cartoon images never
stay put. They move around like an amoeba under a microscope. Or a
baby on a diaper-changing table. Think of it as animation within
animation.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean ``Home Movies'' will make Americans toss their
cookies the way Japanese kids did after watching ``Pokemon'' last
year. At least I didn't hurl. Not even when Snot-Nosed Jason
demonstrated the mucus-retraction power of his right nostril.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how comedian Paula Poundstone explains it: ``I'd been
looking for a project that I could still be on medication and do,''
she said, ``and so far this has medication written all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough. If we graded shows with pharmaceutical icons
instead of with ABCs, ``Home Movies'' would get five of those
little pink things the dentist gave me after he pulled my wisdom
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Poundstone lends her vox sardonica to Paula Small, divorced
mother of two, clad always in gray sweats. 'Tis a voice made for
animation: theatrically sedated, unusually resonant, inherently
funny. And it's matched by the best-chosen cast of voices since
``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula's son, Brendon Small, is voiced by another comedian, a guy
by the name of Brendon Small. How clever is that? Small was
discovered in Boston by executive producer Loren Bouchard, who
worked as a bartender there before hooking up with Tom Snyder (not
that Tom Snyder) and helping him create the Emmy- and
CableACE-winning ``Dr. Katz'' for Comedy Central. Filling out the
cast are Melissa Bardin Galsky as Brendon's friend, Melissa (how
clever, redux), and H. Jon Benjamin, who still writes/performs on
``Dr. Katz'' while providing the voice of the obviously talented
Snot-Nosed Jason and the brick-brained Coach McGuirk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm sorry if this is TV-Turnoff Week and you'd planned a
prime-time mushroom-hunting foray with the family, but if you don't
catch Coach McGuirk on Monday night, especially his comments on the
inadvisability of getting tattooed, then it's your loss.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk is a complete wingnut, but it doesn't stop him from
mentoring 8-year-old Brendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendon, let me tell you a little somethin' about women,''
McGuirk says. ``Women are like, they're like men. But I'll tell you
somethin': Men are not like women. When you grow up you'll
understand what I'm talkin' about.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances that McGuirk's pronouncements are likely to be any
more profound over the next few weeks are lower than his I.Q., but
there's something strangely appealing about the big lug. And
Brendon, a fourth-grader who spends most of his time making little
movies with his friends, is the most lovable character this side of
Rocky and Bullwinkle. With permanently windswept hair, world-weary
eyes and a voice in perpetual semi-yodel, Brendon is Everychild _
with a camcorder and a touch of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say that writing is the key to the allure of ``Home
Movies,'' because there really isn't a script in the classic sense.
The show is essentially a series of edited improvisational sketches
put together in Boston, with Poundstone phoning in from L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds goofy, but it may be the future of TV comedy. Bouchard,
the executive producer, obviously likes the process, which they
call Retroscripting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just totally fascinated with the idea of recording hours
and hours of improvisation,'' he said, ``and because it's animated
you can edit it in a way that you couldn't do with live video.
</P>
<P>
   ``With animation,'' he continued, ``we can literally go in and
take out a word if it didn't quite work or combine two different
performances even from different days. When all is said and done,
we have a track we like. It's sort of like making a radio show. And
then we turn that over to the animators.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for executives at audience-starved UPN, it's not
radio. It's a fresh, original approach to TV comedy that might even
put UPN back on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Home Movies. Half-hour animated comedy series about an
8-year-old boy and his divorced mom. Voices by Paula Poundstone,
Brendon Small, H. Jon Benjamin and Melissa Bardin Galsky. Premieres
Monday night. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A

SUMMER MOVIE SEASON IN TWO WORDS: `PHANTOM MENACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the history of the movie summer of 1999 is written, it will
be summed up in two words: ``Phantom Menace.'' It's a foregone
conclusion that George Lucas' long-delayed ``Star Wars'' prequel
will be the movie event of the year, probably the decade, possibly
the century.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, its box-office impact is expected to be so monumental
that no movie analyst seems confident about predicting how it will
affect the rest of the movie summer _ that crucial period between
Memorial Day and Labor Day when Hollywood traditionally does its
heaviest business of the year.
</P>
<P>
   One prevalent theory is that ``Episode I'' will create a bonanza
of a movie summer. After all, a monster hit _ especially when it
comes early in the season _ tends to generate a kind of moviegoing
momentum that benefits the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   The other theory is the film will be so big, and everything else
will seem so small and ho-hum in comparison, that it will simply
gobble up the American moviegoing dollar for the entire summer.
People will see it not once, but endless times, and ignore
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the second theory seems to be holding sway, and the
competition is so afraid of the Force that Lucas is getting a clear
field in May. And, at this point, the rest of the summer looks as
unambitious and lacking in potential megahits as any summer of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   According to Variety editor Peter Bart's new book, ``The
Gross,'' which analyzes the movie summer of 1998, the reasons for
this may have less to do with ``Star Wars''-phobia than with the
culmination of several trends that have suddenly made Hollywood
surprisingly gun-shy of blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Bart points out the disappointment of ``Godzilla'' (especially
to its merchandising partners), the low profit margins of expensive
sequels such as ``Lethal Weapon IV,'' the trauma of ``problem
pictures'' such as ``Armageddon,'' and the flop of big-star
vehicles such as ``Meet Joe Black'' have made the studios
dramatically rethink their summer strategies.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hollywood is curtailing the number of summer releases
(while demanding that producers ``supply co-financing from outside
sources'') and cutting back sharply on ``pricey event movies.'' All
in all, according to one distributor, it's ``a big trend away from
the expensive techno-movies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the studios are stepping up the output of
low-budget, demographically targeted genre pictures _ especially
inexpensive comedies geared to teenagers, most of them modeled
after ``There's Something About Mary,'' last summer's most
profitable film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not surprising,'' Bart writes, ``that Sony, the company
that gave us `Godzilla' in 1998 will focus summer '99 not on
big-effects movies, but on slasher sequels, an Adam Sandler comedy,
and a children's effects movie titled `Muppets in Space.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Steven Spielberg, who had his name on no less
than four summer films in '98 as producer or director, is staying
out of summer '99, though his company, DreamWorks, has several
films, including Jan De Bont's remake of ``The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be some big movies, including Disney's animated
version of ``Tarzan.'' But, beyond ``Phantom Menace,'' there is
only one $100 million-plus special-effects spectacular on the
boards: the big screen version of TV's ``The Wild, Wild West'' on
July 2.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, buoyed by the success of last summer's ``The
Truman Show,'' the studios will brave the summer market with a
number of serious, non-summer type films, including Stanley
Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' on July 16, Spike Lee's ``Summer of
Sam'' on July 30 and John Sayles' ``Limbo'' on June 4.

 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Mont. _ Since 1959, the Combs family has entertained
guests at their dude ranch in Jack Creek Canyon, taking a few at a
time by horseback into places with names like Cowboy Heaven and
Spanish Peaks, deep in the rugged wilderness of the Madison
Mountain Range in south central Montana.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the nearly half-century tradition of leading
riders into the federally owned wilderness was in jeopardy, said
Bruce Combs, a Bozeman lawyer and a ranch owner.
</P>
<P>
   A new neighbor had threatened to block the family's access to
the government land, resulting in a lawsuit. It was the sort of
dispute that had become increasingly common in the West as wealthy
people from out of state buy land that includes roads and trails
long used by the natives.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the Combses' 159-acre ranch, tiny by Western
standards, was nearly surrounded by U.S. Forest Service land, which
the family members rode across freely to get to the Lee Metcalf
Wilderness Area, more than a quarter-million acres just north of
Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service land eventually was traded to a timber
company for land elsewhere, but the Combs family still had access
to the wilderness. Then the timber company sold about 10,000 acres
to Jon Fossel, the former chief executive of Oppenheimer Funds, one
of the nation's largest mutual funds companies, and his brother,
Scott, a retired venture capitalist. The Fossels' lawyer sent the
Combses a letter in 1996 saying that they could no longer use seven
of the the trails that crossed their land.
</P>
<P>
   The Combs family thought that three trails were not enough to
sustain the dude ranch. If someone comes for a week, ``they're done
with those by Tuesday,'' Combs said. ``Then you still have
Wednesday through Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs also says that Jon Fossel, an avid bow hunter, told him he
had plans to close all 10 trails and effectively lock the Combses
out of the wilderness, and out of a way to make a living. After a
court battle in early March, a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the case, the three trails the Combses had access
to remain open to all users; the other seven are open just to the
Combs family and their guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled with it because it assures our riding
program,'' Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   The case underlined a growing trend. Those who can afford a
slice of the Rockies often find a bonus: when they buy acreage that
borders government-owned wilderness areas, they gain access to
thousands more acres of public land.
</P>
<P>
   But many newcomers grow unhappy with the public's right of
access to public lands through their private ranches. Some realize
that they can have exclusive or near exclusive access to huge
chunks of taxpayer-owned ground by locking the public out.
Incidents in which private landowners close trails or roads are
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to public lands is one of the biggest issues in the
state right now,'' said Alan Charles, coordinator of
landowner-sportsman relations for the Montana Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks. ``These guys with the big ranches are getting
the press, but it is going on in the little, lesser-known valleys
throughout the state as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fairhurst, a retired military pilot in Three Forks, is
finishing a term as volunteer president of Public Lands Access
Association, a group formed 15 years ago to battle the closings.
There is no question, he said, that the situation is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls once or twice a week from people complaining they
are being locked out'' of Forest Service or Bureau of Land
Management land, Fairhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the land in Montana is public. The only way for
the large and increasing number of hunters, fishermen, hikers,
mountain bikers and others to get to the wilderness, in most cases,
is to travel on private land.
</P>
<P>
   Some landowners say that public access leads to litter, cattle
killed by hunters and noxious weeds that grow from seeds that fall
from tires. Disputes about what trails are public are often
complicated, which is part of what led to the Combs case.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fight for public use say landowners often wage a war
of accelerating intimidation. The first salvos are ``no
trespassing'' signs on a public road, which most people obey. If
that does not work, the next step is a locked gate. Fairhurst said
he drove on a county road not far from his home recently and found
it blocked by a locked chain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Things sometimes go further. Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and
Time-Warner vice president who owns tens of thousands of acres of
land in Montana, and Leon Hirsch, founder of U.S. Surgical Corp.,
who has a ranch near Dillon, have been the subjects of repeated
complaints to the state for using armed security officers to deny
people legal access to public streams and lands in their ranches.
</P>
<P>
   The first big fight by access advocates involved Robert M. Lee,
the owner of a chain of retail stores called Hunting World and a
big-game hunter. Lee bought the Windy River ranch near here and
closed a hiking trail. Lee lost a lawsuit in 1988 and the trail
remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road from the Combses' Diamond J ranch is another
sprawling ranch, owned by Stan Kroenke, an apartment complex and
strip mall magnate from Missouri and minority owner of the St.
Louis Rams football team. Kroenke is married to Ann Walton, a niece
of the late Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart and one of the
nation's wealthiest men. A local outfitter, Tim Beardsley, is suing
Kroenke for closing the Aspen Creek trail that goes through his
ranch and allows access to the government wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing value of wildlife has also contributed to
closures, and not just by recent arrivals. The public lands access
group has sued asserting that a longtime rancher near Avon, Earl
Stuky, placed locked gates on two public roads after leasing the
ranch to private outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in the West, the closures trend represents the
erosion not just of access but of an established way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking people into the wilderness is how many people make
their living around here,'' Combs said. ``Montana is becoming
gated, exclusive and private, because that's what sells. It's
gut-wrenching.`

ANALYSIS: TASTY MORSELS AND DIGESTIVE CHALLENGES FOR AT&AMP;T  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the AT&AMP;T Corp. under C. Michael Armstrong has become
an experience akin to watching one film sequel after another in the
``Jaws'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought that Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman of 18
months, could not possibly bite off another big deal, he does just
that, and the masses in the communications industry are sent
fleeing to find ways to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's casualty may have been the Comcast Corp., the big
cable television operator. Just when it looked as if AT&AMP;T had
settled down to manage its own $31.8 billion acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable carrier, Armstrong swam
into the middle of Comcast's pending $53 billion deal for the
Mediaone Group and roiled the waters with an unsolicited bid for
AT&AMP;T to buy Mediaone for $58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mediaone executives have not yet publicly responded, but many
analysts say that AT&AMP;T, with its superior financial power, will
scare off Comcast and win Mediaone _ if regulators allow it. That
would make AT&AMP;T the nation's No. 1 cable television company, in
addition to the nation's No. 1 long-distance telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   But like a voracious shark that ends up with a bunch of old
license plates in its belly, AT&AMP;T may have a tough time digesting
everything it has tried to swallow. The main question for AT&AMP;T now
is whether its appetite has exceeded its ability to integrate its
businesses into the lean yet powerful communications machine that
Armstrong wants AT&AMP;T to become.
</P>
<P>
   As Armstrong propels AT&AMP;T headlong into the future he has
envisioned, the company faces mounting challenges _ not only of
management and strategy, but also of regulation and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most daunting management challenge for AT&AMP;T is the
sheer breadth of Armstrong's strategic ambition. After John Zeglis,
AT&AMP;T's president, was conspicuously absent during the company's
Mediaone announcement last Thursday, several analysts wondered
where he was.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out he was in Japan. There, over the weekend, AT&AMP;T and
British Telecommunications, AT&AMP;T's new international partner,
announced a joint investment of more than $1.8 billion to acquire a
30 percent stake in Japan Telecom, a communications carrier backed
by the main Japanese railroad company.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications will also fold into Japan
Telecom two of their existing Japanese ventures, with combined
annual revenue of just more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement's near simultaneity with the Mediaone bid was
either impressive or unnerving, because it demonstrated Armstrong's
comfort with juggling multiple deals. In fact, the Japan Telecom
and Mediaone deals ``are part of the same strategy,'' Zeglis said
over the weekend. ``We want to go end-to-end delivering services
for our customers on our own architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite AT&AMP;T's common goal of controlling its own architecture,
or electronic infrastructure, there is a big difference between
these two deals. AT&AMP;T's overseas ventures are aimed at serving
big-ticket multinational corporate clients, while the company's
cable television expansion is aimed at serving everyday residential
consumers. It is the company's hunger for residential customers
that best explains AT&AMP;T's seeming feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear by now that AT&AMP;T is terrified of the prospect of at
least one of the local Bell phone companies, probably Bell
Atlantic, being poised to win regulatory approval to enter AT&AMP;T's
core long-distance business this year.
</P>
<P>
   By way of a harbinger, AT&AMP;T is well aware of what happened in
Connecticut after the Southern New England Telecommunications
Corp., which did not need special approval, began offering
long-distance service to Southern New England's local phone
customers. Large numbers of Connecticut customers dropped
long-distance service from AT&AMP;T, among others, to take a single
package of local and long distance from SNET.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's strategic planners hate to contemplate the millions of
local phone customers who might drop AT&AMP;T phone service once Bell
Atlantic is freed to offer long-distance service to customers along
the Eastern Seaboard, or even just in New York. It is a much bigger
worry for AT&AMP;T than for its principal long-distance rivals, MCI
Worldcom and Sprint, because AT&AMP;T derives a much higher proportion
of its long-distance revenue from residential consumers than do MCI
and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has decided that the solution is to counterattack the
Bells by taking the war to a new front _ off the conventional local
telephone network and onto cable TV systems. Through those cable
lines, AT&AMP;T intends to offer local and long-distance calling, as
well as Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take a few years to determine whether that
strategy is visionary or foolhardy. AT&AMP;T would like to offer its
cable-based services using a variant of Internet technology.
Because this is a largely experimental approach, it poses large
technical challenges. It may, however, prove easier in Mediaone
territories than in TCI areas, because Mediaone's network is
generally more technically advanced. That is why AT&AMP;T is willing to
pay more for Mediaone than it did for TCI, even though TCI has more
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The cable strategy also raises management questions. AT&AMP;T is
well practiced in telephone-network technology, but linking so much
of its future to cable television networks means the company needs
to rely on experts from outside the AT&AMP;T tradition. Foremost among
them is Leo Hindery, the former No. 2 executive at TCI who now runs
AT&AMP;T's cable operation _ but who is still largely unfamiliar with
AT&AMP;T and its culture in offering telephone service. The same could
be said for the highly respected Amos B. Hostetter, Mediaone's
largest shareholder, who AT&AMP;T has said will become chairman of its
cable and Internet unit if its Mediaone bid succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But before Hostetter can come aboard, AT&AMP;T must not only fend
off Comcast, but also convince Federal regulators that a combined
AT&AMP;T-TCI-Mediaone would not wield disproportionate power in the
cable television industry. Under Federal Communications Commission
ownership rules, no single entity can control cable systems that
together are available to more than 35 percent of the nation's
households. But those rules have been suspended pending a review by
the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   There are financial imponderables. AT&AMP;T _ with backing from
Chase Manhattan Bank and Goldman, Sachs &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Co. _ seems set to raise
$30 billion in cash to support its Mediaone bid. But Standard &AMP;
Poor's, the credit-rating agency, said on Friday that it was
considering downgrading AT&AMP;T's debt to reflect the big financial
burden the company will take on if it acquires Mediaone.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for Armstrong, not to mention AT&AMP;T, are high. They
keep escalating. If the cable strategy works well, he will become
known as one of the most visionary and dynamic executives of his
day. If it does not, business history might one day recall him as a
former IBM executive who was passed over for the top job at that
company and who, later, when given the chance to run AT&AMP;T, tried to
prove too much.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, dynamic seems to be winning. Armstrong,
presumably, is looking for his next ``Jaws'' sequel.

   The niche market for business-oriented sites on the World Wide
Web is getting a little more crowded. Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which has
attracted 283,000 paid subscribers to The Wall Street Journal
Interactive Edition, is introducing dowjones.com, a free site for
business users.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which will have 12 new editorial employees, was one of
two new initiatives announced last week by the company's chairman
and chief executive, Peter R. Kann, at its annual shareholders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company is preparing a Sunday section devoted
to careers and personal finance, which will be offered to
newspapers in major metropolitan markets as a supplement to their
own local business sections.
</P>
<P>
   The dowjones.com Web site will include some of the familiar
paraphernalia of financial sites, like stock tracking and quotation
services, as well as a search function tailored to cover more than
2,000 business-related sites chosen by Dow Jones editors and
industry-specific areas that focus on 29 industries, including
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, transportation, advertising,
media and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neil F. Budde, a vice president of the interactive publishing
division at Dow Jones, said he did not expect the free site, which
will include breaking news from the Dow Jones news wires, to draw
paying subscribers away from its paid cousin. ``If anything,'' he
said, ``having a lot of traffic through dowjones.com will be a
place where we can sell even more subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The existing competitors of the site include the financial
section of the Yahoo portal; Quicken, which provides information
through a variety of online outlets &UR; ; &LR;  and a range of smaller
sites, including those of CBS Marketwatch, CNNfn and the financial
section of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competitor was skeptical of the initial blueprint.
``They're in a bind,'' said Larry Kramer, the chief executive of
CBS Marketwatch (http://cbs.marketwatch.com). ``They understood
when they made their product part of the paid tier that they were
giving away the mass market. The advertising dollars from the mass
market have come in a lot faster than subscription dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created yet another brand name,'' he added. ``That's
the opposite of the way you should go on the Web.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Tax time was crunch time for the World Wide Web
site of Intuit Inc., the supplier of personal finance software.
Traffic shot up to as much as 20 times its levels the rest of year,
as customers downloaded the latest revisions to Intuit's Turbotax
tax preparation program.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike tax seasons past, this time Intuit had the help of
Sandpiper Networks Inc., a start-up company that has developed a
way to speed the delivery of information on the Web. ``Customers
got it faster than they would have with us,'' said Rick Parkinson,
director of the planning and delivery group at Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper and a rival start-up company, Akamai Technologies
Inc., are pioneering a way to distribute material over the Internet
that avoids much of the congestion that can turn the World Wide Web
into the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sandpiper is expected to announce that America
Online, the largest provider of Internet access, has made a small
investment in the company and will incorporate Sandpiper's
technology into its network.
</P>
<P>
   The Inktomi Corp., a supplier of Internet software is expected
to invest in the start-up company along with two Sandpiper
customers _ the Times Mirror Corp. and NBC. Sandpiper is raising a
total of $21.5 million in this, its second round of raising venture
capital, with each of the corporate partners believed to be putting
in $2 million to $3 million and the rest coming from venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, meanwhile, recently scored a coup of its own, hiring as
its president and chief executive George H. Conrades, formerly
president of the GTE Corp.'s BBN unit and before that a top
executive at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   As more corporations turn to the Web for marketing and sales,
long waits on the Internet are becoming bad for business. While the
companies can improve service somewhat by buying more powerful
computers for their Web sites, they have less control over the
traffic jams that can develop between their sites and the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since nobody controls the Internet, how do you insure quality
of service?'' said Scott Yara, vice president for marketing at
Sandpiper, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The answer proposed by both Sandpiper and Akamai is to
distribute the contents of a Web site to server computers dispersed
throughout the Internet, so that information does not always have
to wend its way through the network from one site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole name of the game here is to push content to the edge
of the Internet, very, very close to the end user,'' said David
Goodtree, vice president for marketing at Akamai, which is based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One use of such a service would be to help with big Web events
that could bring the Internet to its knees. The Los Angeles Times,
owned by Times Mirror, used Sandpiper to help cope with the online
demand for the Starr Report last year and for the newspaper's
coverage of the Academy Awards in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandpiper and Akamai contend, and some analysts agree, that
distribution of Web content will eventually be a full-time
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar technique, known as caching, is already in
use. If, for example, an Internet service provider in Los Angeles
finds heavy demand among its customers for a Web page based in New
York, it will create a local copy of the page in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual producer of the Web page in New York has no
control over this cache, and thus no way of preventing the
information on it from becoming outdated. Moreover, the producer of
the Web page usually does not know how many visits or ``hits'' the
copy on the cache receives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sandpiper and Akamai sell their service directly to the Web
content providers, automatically distributing the content to
servers, updating the material as necessary and keeping track of
the number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper was founded three years ago by David Farber and Andrew
D. Swart, software experts who had worked for Interactive Systems,
a Unix company. Leo S. Spiegel, whom they recruited to be
president, started a computer company while still in college. That
company, LAN Systems, was sold to the Intel Corp. and R.R. Donnelly
&AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which says its name means ``intelligent, clever and
cool'' in Hawaiian, grew out of a math class at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, the MIT researcher known as the father of the
Web, suggested to Tom Leighton, a professor of applied mathematics,
that ``load balancing'' on the Internet would be a good problem for
his class to tackle. The classwork led to algorithms that are used
by Akamai, which was founded by Leighton and a graduate student,
Danny Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which is only now beginning commercial service, says
that customers for its trial service included five of the 10 most
popular Web sites. But Goodtree would not identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai seems to have a more sophisticated approach, but
Sandpiper has the advantage of being first, said Peter Christy,
principal at Collaborative Research, a market research firm in Los
Altos, Calif. Akamai also has deployed 400 servers, compared with
only 32 for Sandpiper. ``We could handle the load today of 15
Yahoos and the top 20 Web sites combined,'' Goodtree said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with America Online and Inktomi could help change
that. Inktomi already provides more than 300 cache servers to
America Online, and Sandpiper will now be able to use those, as
well as Inktomi servers in other networks. ``It really expands our
footprint,'' Spiegel said of Sandpiper (which calls its service
Footprint).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the companies, though, might not be
each other but new entrants expected in the market. Julian of
Forrester said these could include big computer service providers
like IBM and Electronic Data Systems as well as companies like
Exodus Communications that provide computer sites used to host Web
pages. Even Intel announced last week that it would enter the
business of providing servers to host Web pages. But some of these
companies might decide to ally themselves with Sandpiper or Akamai
rather than compete with them.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge could be persuading companies to entrust
distribution of Web pages to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson of Intuit, for instance, said it made sense to use
Sandpiper to save Intuit from having to invest in enough capacity
to handle the rare peak demand. But at times of normal demand,
Intuit prefers to run its Web site by itself, to guard its
competitive information. ``You give up a little bit of control
every time you give something to someone else,'' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lemont Southworth, technology manager for latimes.com, said
another problem was that Sandpiper's system cannot handle the
customized advertisements that many Web sites offer.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible threat is that if technologies like high-speed
cable modems and optical fiber can sufficiently reduce congestion,
there would be less need to store Web pages close to users.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies insist that cable modems, by increasing the
flow of information between users' computers and Internet sites,
will only increase the strain on Web site providers, much as
widening freeway on-ramps can worsen congestion on the freeway
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's the next evolution of the Internet,''
Spiegel said.

   The niche market for business-oriented sites on the World Wide
Web is getting a little more crowded. Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which has
attracted 283,000 paid subscribers to The Wall Street Journal
Interactive Edition, is introducing dowjones.com, a free site for
business users.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which will have 12 new editorial employees, was one of
two new initiatives announced last week by the company's chairman
and chief executive, Peter R. Kann, at its annual shareholders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company is preparing a Sunday section devoted
to careers and personal finance, which will be offered to
newspapers in major metropolitan markets as a supplement to their
own local business sections.
</P>
<P>
   The dowjones.com Web site will include some of the familiar
paraphernalia of financial sites, like stock tracking and quotation
services, as well as a search function tailored to cover more than
2,000 business-related sites chosen by Dow Jones editors and
industry-specific areas that focus on 29 industries, including
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, transportation, advertising,
media and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neil F. Budde, a vice president of the interactive publishing
division at Dow Jones, said he did not expect the free site, which
will include breaking news from the Dow Jones news wires, to draw
paying subscribers away from its paid cousin. ``If anything,'' he
said, ``having a lot of traffic through dowjones.com will be a
place where we can sell even more subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The existing competitors of the site include the financial
section of the Yahoo portal; Quicken, which provides information
through a variety of online outlets &UR; ; &LR;  and a range of smaller
sites, including those of CBS Marketwatch, CNNfn and the financial
section of MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competitor was skeptical of the initial blueprint.
``They're in a bind,'' said Larry Kramer, the chief executive of
CBS Marketwatch (http://cbs.marketwatch.com). ``They understood
when they made their product part of the paid tier that they were
giving away the mass market. The advertising dollars from the mass
market have come in a lot faster than subscription dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created yet another brand name,'' he added. ``That's
the opposite of the way you should go on the Web.''

SERB TV KNOCKED OFF THE AIR AGAIN AFTER NATO ATTACK

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes knocked Serb television off the air
again Sunday for several hours when they attacked large television
transmission towers south of the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the attack, the second on Serb television
facilities in three days, should make clear to Serb television
employees that they risk their lives if they continue broadcasting
what NATO has described as hateful propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The towers in the hills of Avala, about 10 miles from Belgrade,
were among 200 targets hit in what NATO spokesmen described as a
busy night in the month-old air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Also hit overnight in the raids were a chemical factory in the
central Serb town of Lucani _ NATO says the plant produces
explosives _ as well as an oil storage depot in Pristina, the
provincial capital of Kosovo, and several targets in the industrial
city of Nis, about 125 miles southeast of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At least six missiles were reported to have struck a bridge in
Nis, Yugoslavia's third largest city, which has faced heavy NATO
bombardment in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Television transmissions in Belgrade resumed Sunday about 11
hours after the attack on the transmission towers, which took place
at about 3 a.m. as the network was showing a Russian romance film.
</P>
<P>
   But when Serb television returned to the air Sunday afternoon,
the image was fuzzy because the national network was forced to
borrow facilities from a private television station with limited
range. The extent of the damage to the transmission towers was not
reported by NATO, nor was it clear if anyone was killed in the
overnight strike on the facility.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO attacked the building in Belgrade that housed
the headquarters and studios of Serb television, forcing it off the
air for about six hours. The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug
reported Sunday that six more bodies were recovered from the
studios, bringing the death toll there to 20.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has defended the attacks on Serb television by describing
the network as a military propaganda tool for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before the attack Sunday, President Clinton told
reporters at the NATO summit here that the alliance's military
commanders believe that ``Serb television is an essential
instrument of Mr. Milosevic's command and control _ he uses it to
spew hatred and to basically spread disinformation.'' He justified
the attacks by insisting that the television network is ``not in in
a conventional sense a media outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman, Col. Konrad Freytag, said at a news conference
Sunday that Serb television was included among the targets of the
American-led air raids because it ``helps create the political
environment of oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vladislav
Jovanovic, condemned the airstrikes on the television facilities,
saying Sunday that they amounted to ``terrorist action against
civilians and against civilian targets'' and that NATO was
attempting ``to stifle the right to speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded Sunday over Serbia's second-largest
city, Novi Sad, as Cornelio Sommaruga, head of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, toured wreckage there from earlier NATO
strikes, which destroyed all three of the city's bridges across the
Danube River.
</P>
<P>
   Sommaruga was scheduled to meet on Monday with Milosevic, hoping
to secure the return of Red Cross staff to Kosovo and access to
three American soldiers who were captured by the Yugoslav army on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO supreme military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, traveled
to Albania Sunday to meet with about 3,300 American troops
stationed there. He said that the allied campaign against the Serbs
was ``right on schedule'' as seven more Apache attack helicopters
arrived to step up the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The low-flying Apaches are designed to destroy tanks, and Clark
said it ``won't be too long'' before they are put into action
against Serb forces.

A WORLD VIRTUALLY REMOVED FROM THE REAL-LIFE NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seemed a far lovelier war being waged Sunday in
the embattled nation of Azure.
</P>
<P>
   Computer mice, not swagger sticks, were in the hands of the
British air marshal and three-star Ukrainian general moving troops
and fighter planes about on the big-screen projection of Azure, a
place every bit as ravaged as Kosovo except for the one advantage _
it was a dream in a NATO war-game, not the real-life nightmare in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's diplomats wended through their final bittersweet day
of commemorating and conferring on the alliance's 50th anniversary,
some of the cream of NATO's officer corps and allies worked quietly
on Azure at dozens of computer command screens.
</P>
<P>
   As a simulation of technological prowess, Azure proved a
blessedly fantasy-filled challenge in comparison with the harrowing
reality of Kosovo that haunted the diplomats through their final
ceremonies. Even with 100,000 simulated refugees on the run and a
rebel-held uranium mine in peril, Azure was only the stuff of
NATO's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It was a high-tech war that could be believed. It was a
convincing theater of operations where provinces named Indigo and
Turquoise were yielding to the canniest war college strategems.
There were no sticky postmortems about collateral casualties and
overdue Apache gunships.
</P>
<P>
   Criss-crossed with high-tech command graphics and multicolored
force vectors, Azure proved an apt virtual-reality symbol for
NATO's weekend gathering. The summit conference, hermetically
isolated from the rest of the city by a formidable ring of
security, often seemed a dimension removed as well, as it wrestled
uncertainly with the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Only the more telegenic scraps of agenda talk were played out on
the countless television screens that dotted the cavernous Ronald
Reagan International Trade Center, an office citadel where more
than 2,000 global news workers were tagged and kept under close
watch. The three-day presentation of resolute speeches and
ceremonial comings and goings by NATO leaders played largely to
themselves on the summit's internal broadcast system.
</P>
<P>
   Out beyond the conference, on the screens of the surrounding
nation, viewers were more likely to be watching graphic
alternatives like the latest from the high school shooting rampage
in Colorado. Or even an interview with Slobodan Milosevic, the NATO
antagonist who dominated the summit by his absence. He spoke a
peacefully toned, articulate English in contending that Serbia
stood innocent before the forces of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, the daily NATO briefing on Kosovo was followed
by more of the silent motion pictures of the latest Yugoslav
bombings: Mundane gray targets loomed upward in the now familiar
cross hairs, slowly rotating to sudden explosive blots on the giant
screen in the Reagan building lobby. Dozens of people moved past
the highlight film, heedless as commuters as they searched for
fresh briefings and food and hints of whatever was really
happening.
</P>
<P>
   The order of each summit day seemed rooted in tightly controlled
photo opportunities. ``Leaders Walk to Working Lunch,'' a typical
agenda highlight, was multiplied six-fold Sunday with farewell
lunches for the leaders, defense and foreign ministers and their
spouses separately sub-grouped. Closer mingling in search of the
nuances of statesmanship had to be sought by way of the summit's
truly teeming cell-phone culture; everyone seemed to have a cell
phone, even the army private polishing his general's NATO sedan as
he waited through the summit's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Talking-head sound bites and video cameos from selected leaders
and briefers provided the raw material of each conference day. The
product was beamed up to the satellite-dish heavens from eddies of
on-camera reporters. They boomed forth with polyglot summit
authority, but no clear word on how NATO will ultimately manage
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A few of NATO's natural politicians, chafing in the
ultra-isolation of the diplomats' bastion in Mellon Auditorium,
crossed through the security cordon to chat in the flesh with
reporters. Here came Alexander Kwasniewski, the president of Poland
who had charmed the summit in thanking NATO for its induction of
his resilient nation. He stood in the morning sunlight that beamed
down through the atrium of the Reagan building, personally exuding
in a brief encounter more plain hope than a full news cycle of NATO
bombing briefers.
</P>
<P>
   As the summit wound down, Kwasniewski talked with certainty of
the day when peace and reconstruction would come to Kosovo. ``This
peace should not be based on poverty,'' he emphasized. Then this
newest summiteer headed off to a plenary session of gray-suited
diplomats, taking an outdoor path under skies that were azure,
indisputably.

<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ With the energy of a football rally, a convoy
of cheering enthusiasts with red-and-white headbands wound through
this tiny seaside capital of the territory of East Timor last week.
Then, shouting, ``Kill them, burn their houses!'' they jumped from
their trucks and started shooting and lobbing hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of town a similar group smashed its way into a
house sheltering scores of refugees, slashing at them with knives
and cutlasses. Not far away, they vandalized the office of the
territory's small newspaper, destroying its equipment and
scattering its files as two workers cowered in the darkroom.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 and as many as 30 people died in the weekend rampage
through Dili by militias that oppose independence for east Timor.
Many more are believed to have been killed in recent weeks in
remote villages, and thousands of people are reported to have fled
into the hills for safety.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the surge of violence: A peace agreement is at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether this sad and battered territory can
survive the endgame to its long separatist war. Many analysts fear
that the prospect of settlement will only ignite an uglier, more
intractable conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp reversal, the Indonesian president, B.J. Habibie,
announced in January that East Timor, annexed by Indonesia in 1996
after its colonial ruler, Portugal, withdrew, could select its own
future after a generation of insurgent warfare.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal _
after years of fitful negotiations _ announced that they had agreed
on a plan to allow East Timor to choose between independence and an
autonomous status within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The vote would be on whether to accept an autonomous arrangement
in which Indonesia would control the territory's security and
foreign relations. Habibie said that if autonomy is rejected, East
Timor can simply cut itself loose from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Though the plan has not yet been signed and its details have not
been made public, it would mandate a vote, probably this summer, by
the territory's 800,000 people. Many people here, and many
political analysts in Jakarta, say, though, that this is a formula
for civil war.
</P>
<P>
   While many East Timorese have fought and died in a struggle for
independence, many others have cast their lot with Indonesia and
stand to lose in an independent state. While many yearn for
statehood, others fear that East Timor _ a tiny half-island
territory closer to Australia than to Jakarta _ could not stand on
its own economically.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese are not ready to put these differences to a vote,
the analysts say. Their wounds are too raw, their enmities too deep
and their culture too violent after a generation of bitter warfare.
Neither side is prepared to accept the result if it goes against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whichever way it goes it will mean civil war,'' said Aniceto
Guterres Lopes, director of the Hak Foundation, the local human
rights organization, who spends nights in hiding. ``And because
this war will be among East Timorese, it will be harder to resolve
than the war between East Timorese and Indonesians.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it appears that the Indonesian military has already
begun a process of Timorization of the war. The truckloads of men
who terrorized Dili last week were some of the thousands of
recruits who have joined ragtag military-backed ``militias'' since
the start of the year. These groups, which support continued
integration with Indonesia, are carrying on a war of intimidation
from which the military has officially withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached at the United Nations gives the military
responsibility for assuring that a referendum is free and fair, a
prospect that for some people casts doubt on the sincerity of the
Indonesian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian military has done a very good job of showing
what kind of response there would be to the East Timorese people if
they fight back, and that is a massive military response against
civilians,'' said Dr. Dan Murphy, an American doctor who runs a
small clinic here.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, say the aim of the
military, despite official denials, seems to be to block the
apparent momentum here for full independence by derailing or
skewing the outcome of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The militia campaign has raised questions about the military's
commitment to Habibie's offer of self-determination. This offer
sharpens a long-held fear by the government that independence for
East Timor could inflame separatist insurgencies around the nation,
particularly in the remote provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   The military is already overextended, analysts say, in trying to
maintain stability and unity at a time when the nation is going
through a dangerous transition from the dictatorship of former
President Suharto, who resigned last May.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the militias have the initiative in East Timor,
and the separatist rebels and their civilian supporters have gone
underground. Their leader, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, who is under
house arrest in Jakarta, responded to reports of killings by
ordering his men to fight back, and then rescinded the order.
</P>
<P>
   But fears of a purge by these forces have caused a swelling
exodus of many Indonesians who have migrated here over the years.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Separatist guerrillas have also used brutal tactics against
their enemies. ``If the pro-independence groups win, we will be the
first to die,'' a pro-integration leader told the National
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Government services are provided here largely by outsiders sent
from Jakarta, and they also are potential targets of separatists.
Hundreds of teachers, medical workers, civil servants, and
telephone and electricity workers are fleeing the territory on huge
ferries, leaving its people increasingly bereft.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it chooses independence or autonomy, East Timor is a
tropical island territory with little joy. The long-running war has
taken as many as 200,000 lives and left the atmosphere dulled and
brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the children hit the teacher, we don't blame them, because
of the violence all around them,'' Guterres Lopes said, excusing
some of the intimidation that is forcing teachers to flee. ``They
are used to violence and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, it seems not to have been difficult for
paramilitary leaders to recruit thousands of men into their
militias or for these men to turn on their compatriots.
</P>

   ``The militia are mostly unemployed youngsters or school
dropouts,'' said Aderito Hugo da Costa, managing editor of the
newspaper Suara Timor Timur, who is in hiding. ``And once they are
recruited, they have been killing and slaughtering out of control.
The law does not seem to apply to them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing subtle or secret about the orders to thousands
of new recruits before their rampage through the city. ``As from
today, I order all the pro-integration militia to conduct a
cleansing of the traitors of integration _ capture them and kill
them,'' said the leader of the main militia group at an induction
ceremony attended by provincial and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the leader, Eurico Guterres, seemed to relish
the prospect of violence. ``It's going to be a civil war,'' he
said. ``In East Timor, it is normal for father and son to fight
each other.''

   DEUTSCHE TELEKOM SEEN AS A SUITOR FOR ONE 2 ONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, which is in the midst of an $80-billion-plus
attempted merger with Telecom Italia, may also have its sights on a
major mobile telephone acquisition in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Telekom said it was interested in acquiring One
2 One, a joint venture between Cable and Wireless and Mediaone
Group. One 2 One's parents put it up for sale last month, and the
company has drawn intense interest throughout the European
telecommunications industry. It is unclear whether Telekom has made
a firm offer.

   GLOBAL CROSSING TO ACQUIRE GLOBAL MARINE
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, the owner and operator of a worldwide fiber
optic network designed for Internet transmissions, is expected to
announce the acquisition Monday of the Global Marine unit of Cable
and Wireless for $725 million in cash and $160 million in assumed
debt.

   SUN TO INTRODUCE NETWORK PRODUCT
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems plans to introduce software Monday that is
designed for companies that want to let their employees use various
devices to connect to corporate computer networks, secure from
unauthorized access. With the system, workers could use desktop
computers, laptops or even hand-held personal digital assistants to
connect to the network.

   A NEW TACK ON THE SHIPPING NEWS
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of Commerce, which has provided a mix of trade
policy analysis and coverage of the shipping industry, is changing
its focus. It is jettisoning most of its policy coverage, all of
its commodity price listings and 20 percent of its editorial staff
and is devoting itself to ``those who control the movement of
goods,'' in the words of a recent editorial. It will also convert
from a broadsheet to a tabloid format on June 1. The newspaper, led
by its new editor, Peter Tirschwell, plans to move from its broader
perspective to porthole-to-porthole coverage of an industry that
has all the glamour of the industrial age at a time when the
financial world is fixated on all things digital.

   HARVARD ECONOMIST WINS
</P>
<P>
   Medal Andrei Shleifer, a Harvard University economist who
immigrated to the United States from Russia when he was a
teen-ager, has won the John Bates Clark Medal, the most prestigious
prize in economics short of the Nobel. The medal, awarded every two
years by the American Economic Association, goes to an outstanding
economist younger than 40.

   VIRGINIA GOVERNOR TAKES LEAD ON INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   As the worlds of politics and high technology increasingly come
together, Virginia Gov. James Gilmore would like to be at the
nexus. In recent years, Virginia's high-technology economy has
surged and Gilmore, a Republican, has made Internet policy central
to his 18-month stint in office.

   LINKING REAL AND PRETEND VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Parents and consumer groups have sounded alarms for years about
the effects that violent films, television and video games like
Doom, left, are having on their children and society. The
industry's response consistently has been indignant shock that
anyone would think a movie or game could have a measurable effect
on anyone. But a growing body of evidence suggests a connection
between exposure to media violence, including video games, and
increased aggression.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE NOTES: CAMPBELL REBUILDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge head men's volleyball coach
Jeff Campbell was doing everything he could to make this meeting
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a doctor's appointment at two,'' Campbell told the
person on the other end of the phone call. ``But I really want you
to come over. You call me when you are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Campbell hung up the phone looking like he had just landed
one of the nation's top recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to do the tile for my kitchen,'' Campbell said to a
visitor. ``I've been playing phone tag with him for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is slowly rebuilding his Chatsworth home, which he
bought a few years ago when it was in pretty bad condition. He's
working just as hard on remaking CSUN into a men's volleyball
power.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors set many significant records this past season, but
they weren't the right kind. CSUN had its worst season in the
program's 23-year history, with just three wins in 24 matches.
</P>
<P>
   Before beating UC Santa Barbara in the season finale, the
Matadors had lost 13 consecutive matches. CSUN, which was 2-17 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, has had two-consecutive
sub-.500 seasons since the university's decision to cut volleyball
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This was a program that played in the NCAA-title game in 1993,
losing to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the sport was reinstated, former head coach John
Price had left to take over at Cal State Bakersfield and starters
Dan Fisher, Sean Callahan, Josh Sanders and Mike Szymanski had all
transferred to other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who was an assistant under Price, was elevated to
interim head coach after men's volleyball was brought back in
August 1997. But by then the roster was depleted.
</P>
<P>
   In '98, CSUN rallied with junior college transfers to go 10-14.
In '99, the Matadors had just three players who had played at least
one year at the Division I level. You know what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience level was so low,'' Campbell said. ``There were
a lot of senior-oriented teams (in the MPSF).''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors return all their starters, and the 33-year-old
Campbell, who is in the second year of a three-year contract, said
the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be good for a really long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last chance: Campbell made a classy move in the Matadors' win
over UCSB - he gave significant playing time to senior outside
hitter Mark Lee, who was playing in his last match.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who played at Hart High and transferred from Pierce College
when the program was revived and needed players, had his best match
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate all these guys who came here at the last
minute,'' Campbell said. ``We owe them a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tara to the rescue: Tara Glaister became the first pitcher in
the history of CSUN softball to strike out 200 or more batters in
three seasons early in Saturday's 16-inning 5-3 victory over Cal
State Fullerton
</P>
<P>
   More important than Glaister's second-inning strikeout of Dara
Marzolo was her adjustment against the Titans' Stephanie Little.
Little, one of the nation's leaders in homers, hit her 18th and
19th of the season in her first two at-bats against Glaister.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaister went to off-speed pitches later in the game against
Little and struck her out in the top of the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Glaister, a senior right-hander from Claremont, is 15-11 and
leads the Big West Conference with 207 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   __ The other brother: It's hard to miss Michael Ranier; he's
6-foot-6 and weighs 215 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Ranier, a freshman left-hander at CSUN, didn't gain much
notice as a senior at Royal High in 1997. Part of the reason was
his twin brother Matt was a prospect who is now at Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Michael went to Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo for a year
before coming to Northridge. He made 10 appearances before last
week's surprise start against Cal State Los Angeles, when he threw
seven scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ranier says an appearance like that is a good audition for next
year, when top recruits Kameron Loe (Granada Hills) and Ivan
Hernandez (Sylmar) are expected to make an impact on the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proving it to (the coaches) and especially myself,'' he
said. ``I haven't had the opportunity to prove it to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN pitching coach Jamie Nelson said Ranier ``has done so well
in a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a project,'' Nelson said. ``Now he's gaining
confidence.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN, Calif. _ Little more than a week until his
appointment with the state executioner, Manny Babbitt has more
friends now than in all his nearly 50 miserable years.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those rallying to save his life is long and growing.
It includes at least two of the jurors who sentenced him to death,
his trial lawyer, who says his defense was inept, and a retired
police officer whom Babbitt saved as a Marine in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others: more than 600 other fellow Marines who endured
the 1968 siege at Khe Sanh, when American troops were pinned down
for 77 days by the North Vietnamese, thousands of other veterans
and David Kaczynski _ the brother of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber _
who knows the anguish Babbitt's brother feels for turning Manny
over to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a visiting cell, Manny Babbitt, stocky and
open-faced, seemed perplexed at all the attention from all over the
country, after 18 years on death row. ``Children and women are on
death row, too,'' he said, his eyes moistening behind his bifocals.
``I hope some people try to save them.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Board of Prison Terms scheduled to consider
Babbitt's plea for clemency on Monday, there are people equally
passionate about sending him to his death _ none more so than the
family of the 78-year-old woman whom he attacked in Sacramento the
night of Dec. 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   They have no use for the arguments that the victim was a war
casualty, that Vietnam had broken Babbitt's fragile mind. They know
all they need to know: Manuel Pena Babbitt broke into Leah
Schendel's apartment, beat her, grabbed a few trinkets and some
change, and caused the heart attack that killed her.
</P>
<P>
   For Gov. Gray Davis, who is waiting for the recommendation from
the Board of Prison Terms before deciding whether to commute
Babbitt's sentence to life in prison, the case poses a unique
dilemma. During his election campaign last year, Davis promised to
be a tough-on-crime, pro-death penalty governor. Shortly after he
took office in January, he turned down the clemency plea of Jaturun
Siripong, who was put to death by lethal injection a month later.
</P>
<P>
   But as an Army veteran, the governor has also pledged to give
veterans due respect. Babbitt, who was awarded the Purple Heart in
a rare prison ceremony last year, has become a rallying cry for
Vietnam veterans of all political stripes. They are convinced that
Babbitt _ who wrapped a leather strap around his victim's ankle,
reminiscent of the way soldiers tagged the dead _ attacked Leah
Schendel in a flashback caused by a textbook case of post-traumatic
stress disorder brought on by two tours of duty in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Manny when he tells me that he doesn't remember
anything about the crime,'' said Gary Dahlheimer of Fresno, who was
a mechanic in Babbitt's platoon at Khe Sanh and has collected 600
letters of support for him. ``I'm not an expert on PTSD, but I came
very close to killing my wife once,'' Dahlheimer said. ``I was
asleep and I was dreaming of killing a North Vietnamese and I had
him in a scissor lock. It was my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``So far I've gone to six of the Khe Sanh reunions and
everyone from private to general seems to suffer from some degree
of post-traumatic stress syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors call Babbitt a career criminal and a mean drunk who
hated women. Jan Scully, the Sacramento County district attorney,
said that the post-traumatic stress disorder defense had been
raised at the trial and the jury had rejected it. She also said
that a federal court had ruled two years ago that Babbitt had
received a ``very good defense _ a better one, in fact than the
defense argues in hindsight should have been presented.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the jury that convicted Babbitt and sentenced him to
death understood his offenses. ``It should go without saying that
members of the Marine Corps are neither trained nor permitted to
rape, rob or murder defenseless senior citizens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, in many ways, was the high point of Babbitt's life, his
lawyers said. Raised dirt-poor in Wareham, Mass., in a small
community of immigrants from the Cape Verde Islands, he and his
eight brothers and sisters were regularly beaten by their father,
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Josephine, suffered from bouts of mental illness
that worsened after Charles Babbitt died, when Manny was 14. She
would stand outside in her black mourning clothes, talking to a
pear tree, and wake the children in the middle of the night,
screaming at the top of her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Manny dropped out of school when he was in the seventh-grade, at
age 17. After joining the Marines, he was sent to Vietnam, where he
became a highly regarded member of an anti-tank, anti-personnel
armored car unit.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 1968, Babbitt was wounded by shrapnel at Khe Sanh, and
flown to a medical unit atop a pile of dead bodies. He was back on
duty shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After Khe Sanh, he fought another battle, went home, married,
and signed up for another tour. In the fall of 1969 he was
stationed at Quonset Point, R.I.. But something was going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At night, while patrolling with his M-16 rifle, he would kill
and skin rabbits. He'd scream to his wife to grab the babies and
run for cover from the bombs. He took LSD, as he did in the war,
and went absent without leave. By the time he was given an
honorable discharge in 1971, he had been demoted from corporal to
private.

 SAN QUENTIN, Calif.: to private.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually he turned to crime. In 1973, he helped rob two gas
stations and was sentenced to eight years in state prison. He ended
up in a hospital for the criminally insane in Bridgewater, Mass.,
where he spent eight months before going back to prison. Two months
later, after numerous suicide attempts, he was returned to the
hospital. In 1975, as a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, he was
granted parole and freed.
</P>
<P>
   Single again, he moved near his half-brother Charles in
Providence, R.I., met a woman, and attempted to settle down.
Instead, he became the town crazy. For sport, according to defense
affidavits, some patrons of his brother's bar would ply Manny with
drugs and alcohol, knowing that would set him on a lunatic tear.
</P>
<P>
   James Schenk, Babbitt's court-appointed lawyer for his murder
trial, could have found dozens of witnesses willing to discuss his
client's mental condition to corroborate his psychiatric defense.
He did not seek them.
</P>
<P>
   Schenk, who resigned from the state bar last year after pleading
no contest to embezzling $50,000 from client trust funds, admitted
in court papers that he ``failed completely in the death penalty
phase'' of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   He never called witnesses who had served with Babbitt in
Vietnam, never documented his family history of mental illness, an
aggravating factor in the post-traumatic stress disorder, and never
sought Babbitt's Vietnam medical records. The records documented
that Babbitt had had ``dissociative reactions,'' or bouts of
amnesia, during particularly stressful events, during his two tours
of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt says he does not remember attacking Ms. Schendel, or
another woman on the following night who was beaten but recovered.
On the afternoon before he attacked Ms. Schendel, he drank and took
drugs with an Asian-American man who was also a Vietnam veteran.
All he remembers of that night, Babbitt said, were lights in the
fog which reminded him of incoming aircraft in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's appeals lawyers, Jessica McGuire, a public defender,
and Charles Patterson, a private attorney who is a Khe Sanh
veteran, say that Babbitt saw the lights in the fog and
``dissociated.'' The sight of aircraft would always be followed by
fire from the enemy, and soldiers would duck for cover. Babbitt,
they say, ran for cover in Ms. Schendel's house and reacted as a
soldier _ brutally _ when she panicked at the sight of him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schendel, whose forehead was split open to the bone, was
found with her dress pulled over her waist, a tea kettle on her
pubic area, a mattress over her and a cord around her ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The mattress, defense experts say, is significant because
soldiers covered the dead with anything available to protect them
until they could be recovered. And soldiers always wrapped dog tags
around a fallen comrade, to aid in identifying him.
</P>
<P>
   Schenk said he never explored the way Babbitt left Ms. Schendel.
He also said he failed to raise an objection when the prosecution
argued that Ms. Schendel was sexually assaulted, although its
expert could only say that it was ``possible.''
</P>
<P>
   William Babbitt, who had moved his younger brother Manny from
Providence to live with him in Sacramento shortly before the attack
on Ms. Schendel, said that his brother should have received help,
not a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He called the police after finding coins and a cigarette lighter
with the initials ``L.S.'' among his brother's belongings and said
the police assured him that his brother would ``not go to the gas
chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames a justice system that most severely punishes blacks
when the victims are white, as in his brother's case.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Thompson, Mrs. Schendel's granddaughter, is angry at the
system too. For 18 years, she and her family have waited for
justice, she says, while Manny Babbitt's appeals wound their way
through the courts. (Babbitt was refused an evidentiary hearing at
every turn, and the Supreme Court declined to review the case.)
Now, Ms. Thompson fears that the campaign to spare the killer who
ruined her family will work.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Babbitt, who has taught himself to read and write, said he
would like to write Ms. Thompson a letter and tell her he is sorry,
and that if he is executed, he hopes it will bring her closure.
</P>
<P>
   His execution by lethal injection is set for May 4, one day
after his 50th birthday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO extended security guarantees Sunday to seven
countries rimming Yugoslavia, widening its defense obligations to
include non-alliance states for the first time in its 50-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   The move places the NATO security umbrella over Albania, Bosnia,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Slovenia _ every part of
the Balkans except Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as the seven states have agreed to play increasingly
larger, and potentially riskier, roles in NATO's escalating attacks
against the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stand by the neighboring countries that have accepted
risks and hardship in support of this effort,'' President Clinton
said in closing a three-day summit that he said had left the
alliance more united than ever. ``If Mr. Milosevic threatens them
for helping us, we will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did confer with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia on
Sunday about prospects for negotiating an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, NATO announced that 4,000 additional
British and German troops were en route to Macedonia, while Hungary
and two other states extended air rights to allied warplanes on
missions to attack neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO pressed on with bombing strikes on bridges, broadcasting
stations, airfields, troops and tanks across Yugoslavia. The NATO
commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, visited Albania and said
Apache attack helicopters would soon be ready to fly missions into
the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hour-long telephone conversation with Yeltsin came as
he dispatched Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Any Russian-brokered end to the conflict, officials said, would
be based on Milosevic accepting NATO's essential demands:
</P>
<P>
   _ An end to repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ The withdrawal of Yugoslavian forces and the admittance of a
NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guarantees that the 1.5 million ethnic Albanians that have
fled Kosovo would be allowed to return and rebuild their homes in
safety.
</P>
<P>
   _ The return of political autonomy for the majority Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five weeks of inconclusive NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia, Clinton and other allied leaders voiced their resolve
to prosecute a war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance leaves Washington more united even than it was
when we came here,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As one example, White House aides said France had decided to
drop its objections to a NATO naval blockade aimed at choking off
Yugoslavia's oil imports.
</P>
<P>
   It later appeared, though, that France had simply agreed to set
aside its concerns until the details of how a blockade would be
enforced could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a combination of mechanisms,'' said White House
national security adviser Samuel Berger, ``to achieve the goal of
inhibiting and stopping the flow of energy to (Milosevic's) war
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As NATO worked to tighten the military and economic noose, the
alliance took the unprecedented step of extending security
guarantees to the seven non-NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Those states have already suffered economic damage, threats and,
in the case of Albania and Macedonia, military attacks and
overwhelming refugee flows, since NATO launched air strikes against
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those ``frontline'' states _ Slovenia and Romania _ have
agreed to let NATO warplanes fly over their airspace for bombing
runs targeting Yugoslavia and for reconnaissance flights and midair
refueling.
</P>
<P>
   A third, Bulgaria, is expected to grant its permission for such
activities on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Macedonia and Albania, are playing host to a growing
NATO troop contingent.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO has already assumed a major security role in Bosnia,
where it has based peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hungary, which became a full NATO member last month,
said it would permit U.S. and allied warplanes to take off from its
airfields to bomb Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance's security
assurances to these states are not as strong as the guarantees
provided by Article Five of the NATO charter. The heart of the
alliance structure, Article Five obligates all 19 NATO members to
regard an attack on any single member as an attack on all, and to
respond militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the same as Article Five, but they are very
strong indeed,'' said Shea. ``They're much stronger than anything
that we've ever done before in making it clear that we would
consider
</P>
<P>
   an attack on any of these countries as something which would
obviously need to elicit a response from the allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the commitment, said Shea, is that ``we have a
direct material concern for the security of these countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's move marked the first time the alliance has extended
formal security guarantees beyond the borders of its members, said
NATO expert Ronald Spector, chairman of the history department at
George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, they did not guarantee the security of non-NATO
states,'' said Spector. ``In fact, they went to some lengths to
avoid it, if you think about the 1968 Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia,'' which NATO treated as an issue to be contained
within the sphere of influence of the old Soviet Union.

FOR COLUMBINE PRINCIPAL, A TIME OF FUNERALS, GUILT, HOPE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Four days before the shootings, the principal
of Columbine High School, Frank DeAngelis, told his students at an
emotional pep rally in the gym that he did not want to bury another
young person. With the prom set for the next night, Saturday, he
implored them not to drink, or drink and drive, or put themselves
at risk in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to attend another memorial service,'' he had
said, recalling students who had died in car accidents, including a
baseball player he had coached and two girlfriends of his teen-age
daughter. ``I do not want to put up another memorial plaque.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said he told them, ``I want to see all your smiling
faces here on Monday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday morning, after a weekend in which not so much as a
fender bender was reported, the principal said, ``One of the
students came up to me and said, `I think all our smiling faces are
here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis was talking by telephone from his home only hours
after he had attended one funeral, and two days before he would
attend four more. All were for victims of the shootings at
Columbine on Tuesday that left a teacher _ DeAngelis' close friend
William David Sanders _ and 14 students, including the two teen-age
suspects, dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the shootings, the visible presence of the
police investigation has taken center stage, with briefings by law
enforcement officials and news conferences with the governor, the
district attorney and the superintendent of Jefferson County
Schools.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis, 44, has been meeting with his faculty and students,
paying his respects to the families of the victims and, in the few
private moments he has had, anguishing over the young people, and
the friend, he has lost.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said that he had asked two aides to handle the press.
``My first priority is my faculty and kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, DeAngelis has no explanation for the actions
of the two suspects, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. ``I'm still
baffled by it all,'' he said. ``I cannot explain what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike everyone else, DeAngelis was in charge. Columbine was
his school. He had started there as a social studies teacher in
1979, and worked his way up, first to dean of students, then to
assistant principal and, in 1996, to principal.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were his students. ``I knew them
by name and by face,'' he said, but he could not remember any
dealings with them.
</P>
<P>
   After shepherding a group of students to safety outside the
school amid the gunfire on Tuesday, and then maintaining a vigil
into the night for those trapped inside when police would not let
him re-enter, DeAngelis faced his faculty the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized,'' he said. ``I stated, `I'm so sorry for what
you are experiencing, for what you went through with this tragedy.'
I told them, `Right now I'm feeling guilty. I've asked myself I
don't know how many times in the last several hours if there was
anything I could have done to prevent this.' I said, `I'm sure some
of you are feeling that too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They cried together, he said. ``I told them how proud I was of
each and every one of them for putting their lives on the line for
our students.''
</P>
<P>
   From that meeting, one of his assistant principals drove
DeAngelis to a nearby church to address the community, parents and
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what to expect,'' he went on. ``I was concerned
that I had let them down. Here I am the leader of this high school,
with over 1,900 kids, this fantastic community, a leader in our
school district, and I just felt that I had let everyone down, and
I wasn't sure if I was going to be accepted. I was worried that I
had disappointed people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was encouraged when two seniors, Kelly Beers and
Kelly Dickson, ran up and hugged him when he walked up and took his
place in the group of administrators on the stage. He awaited his
turn to speak. ``They announced, `Here's the principal of Columbine
high school,' and they gave me a standing ovation,'' DeAngelis
said. ``I just broke down.'' He was so overwhelmed, DeAngelis said,
that he turned his back to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just overtaken by emotion. I got rejuvenated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, DeAngelis focused on the students. ``I told them
how proud I was of them,'' he said. ``I told them that I've been
proud of Columbine for 20 years, that I have never been prouder of
these students than I am now for what they have done. We've heard
stories of students stopping to help other students, of two
students administering first aid to one of my teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, DeAngelis recalled how on Tuesday morning he
had walked out of a meeting in the school, and into an eerily quiet
north hallway. Suddenly, his secretary, Susan White, came running
out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said there was a shooting downstairs in the cafeteria. I
said, `I don't believe it. Call 911.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His secretary ran back into the office, leaving DeAngelis alone
in the hallway. ``Then I noticed the gunman coming down the hall,
firing his weapon,'' he said. ``I said, `I'm dead, my time is up.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In that same moment, DeAngelis said, he heard voices and
laughter around the corner. He ran down the hallway and found a
group of about 20 girls, oblivious to what was happening, heading
from the locker room to gym class. DeAngelis said he herded the
girls into a locked storage room in the gym, assuring them that
they were safe and that he would be back to get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went outside to try to see what was happening,'' DeAngelis
said. ``It was then that I saw fire alarms had gone off, kids
exiting the building, teachers helping kids out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of us went back in to get the girls out of the storage
room. We got the girls outside to the park'' across the street, he
said. At that point police warned everyone to stay out of the
building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when he got to the park, the principal said, and
possible suspects were named, that he realized the awful
possibility: The gunman he had seen might be one of his own
students.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said he waited outside for the next nine hours,
drawing maps of the school for the SWAT teams, sharing information
with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point when a tank is moving down Pearce Street
with the SWAT team,'' he said. ``I just looked up and there were
helicopters hovering around and ambulances. I just thought to
myself, `This is only the beginning of this nightmare.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, DeAngelis sounded exhausted and
grief-stricken, but determinedly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe there's such a strong foundation, it will
continue to be a great high school,'' DeAngelis said. ``There's
just a lot of loving and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   He had 12 funerals before him, the friends and families of the
dead to console, the wounded to visit in the hospital,
investigators' questions to try to answer. He has a school to lead,
even if, with Columbine closed indefinitely, he will be doing it
out of a neighboring high school.
</P>
<P>
   His teachers will return on Tuesday, his students on Thursday.
Together, DeAngelis said, they will figure out how to finish the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I've said, why were the 15 killed?'' the
principal said. ``Why? Life is so unfair. But I've also felt that
tough times make us tougher people, tough times challenge us, tough
times teach us how to get it done. Somehow I'm getting it done.''

ENFORCEMENT OF OIL BLOCKADE PRESENTS POLITICAL, DIPLOMATIC RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The mechanics of imposing an oil embargo against
Yugoslavia enforced by NATO warships plying the Adriatic Sea should
be fairly simple, military officials said Sunday. The legal,
political and diplomatic risks are far greater, particularly with
Russia, which has furiously denounced the plan and thus raised the
specter of clashes at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1995, allied warships enforced such a ban on
arms to all six republics of the old Yugoslavia in the same
Adriatic waters. Some 6,000 ships were boarded and inspected, and
only six were caught trying to smuggle weapons. Arms shipments
overland still found their way into the hands of the warring
factions _ as did oil shipments to Serbia and Montenegro, despite
comprehensive U.N. sanctions that virtually barred all foreign
trade with the oil-starved republics.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban on oil shipments to Yugoslavia that NATO has now
authorized is trickier to enforce. And stopping oil tankers from
countries not party to the agreement, like Russia, is an expansion
of the month-long war with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Sunday sought to dismiss
the Russian threats of war with a verbal wave: ``The Russians,
every now and then, they make phrases which go a little bit beyond
where they should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as forcefully, Solana said on the ABC news program ``This
Week'' that Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's military commander, was
writing a draft plan that considers ``all the possibilities so that
the embargo can be guaranteed not only by NATO and NATO-friendly
countries, but also for others. If it's an embargo, it will apply
to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the embargo is dry up the flow of oil into ports on
the coast of Montenegro, the small republic which supplies its far
larger partner in Yugoslavia, Serbia. NATO has also ordered heavier
air strikes against overland roads, pipelines and railroads that
carry the fuel to Serbia. ``Without oil, the Yugoslav military
machine will come to a halt and very quickly,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO officials say that with Serbia's two main
refineries knocked out of operation, Yugoslav military officials
are so desperate for fuel that they are siphoning fuel out of the
abandoned cars belonging to refugees, and using it for tanks and
other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence analysts estimate that Montenegrin ports
have unloaded 40,000 to 45,000 metric tons, or about 300,000
barrels, of oil in the past month, undercutting the air campaign's
goal to dry up Belgrade's ability to resupply the 40,000 Yugoslav
troops in Kosovo who are expelling ethnic Albanians and destroying
their villages.
</P>
<P>
   France and Italy, in particular, have raised questions about the
legal justification for mounting a blockade against third-party
countries, as distinct from an embargo restricting only shipments
from cooperating nations. Solana's scenario would cover countries
that do not belong to NATO or the European Union, such as Russia or
Ukraine, whose tankers have unloaded oil in Montenegrin ports since
the air war started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make the choice of a blockade, then we have to recognize
we risk war with a third party who hasn't agreed to the blockade,''
said one French diplomat. ``For that you need a U.N. mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema explained to Italian
journalists Sunday that the embargo by NATO and European Union
countries can be carried out with on-board searches and
inspections. But a blockade, as such, does not exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Norway's foreign minister, Knut Vollebaek, said in an
interview, ``As for third parties, we would like to see a U.N.
Security Council resolution in order to make this binding.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Pentagon official said that while there may not be
a specific Security Council resolution authorizing the ban, ``the
laws of armed conflict'' justify such an embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea acknowledges that ``there would have to be a political
discussion as to who is covered by such a regime.'' And Solana, in
his closing briefing Sunday, made light of objections to the
embargo, asserting that all 19 members would be in agreement on
Clark's draft plan. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's political
arm, is expected to review that plan this week, military officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As outlined now, American and other NATO officials said, the
embargo would not try to exclude all ships from Yugoslav ports.
Instead, NATO would create a kind of seaborne police force to check
manifests and board selected ships to investigate cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Ships caught carrying contraband oil would be turned back or
diverted to other ports, but NATO military officials said the legal
consequences of interdictions have not been worked out. ``There are
some legal questions that have to be answered,'' the Dutch defense
minister, Frank de Grave, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Other military experts said the issue could be rendered moot
simply by the stated purpose of the naval armada. ``The very
presence of NATO ships would be a deterrent, and would induce ships
to go back,'' Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed
Services Committee, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot tell our pilots to fly high-risk missions against
petroleum storage facilities in Yugoslavia, and then let this other
oil creep in through the back door,'' said Warner, a former
secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   At Clark's headquarters outside of Brussels, top aides are
pouring over the details of the operation. Military officials said
they must define where the NATO maritime interdiction force will
operate in the Adriatic and Ionian seas.
</P>
<P>
   Clark must also determine how many ships, helicopters and
surveillance planes, like U.S. Navy P-3s, the operation will need.
Navy officers said that a dozen ships, rotating duty, would likely
be sufficient. Eight NATO ships are assigned to the region now.
</P>
<P>
   A delicate part of the mission would be the actual rules of
engagement. Once NATO affirms a specific plan, a notice would go
out to all international mariners with the rules. NATO warships
would likely establish checkpoints off the Montenegrin coast for
checking vessels.
</P>
<P>
   If ships were suspected of carrying contraband, they would be
boarded and inspected. Allied ships could fire on any vessels that
refused to comply, first as a warning, and then to disable,
violators. Navy officers say there are also nonlethal means of
stopping a rogue tanker dead in its tracks, including devices that
would entangle a ship's screw or rudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tactical sense,'' Adm. Luc Kroon, the Dutch chief of
defense staff, said in interview, ``it's no problem to execute
this.''

Zimmerman won't start, other notes 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Don't expect to see right-hander Jeff Zimmerman in
the Rangers' rotation during this or future seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have never discussed the possibility, assistant
general manager Dan O'Brien said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's something we have in mind,'' O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman possesses two ``plus'' pitches _ fastball and slider _
and an improving changeup. He started as recently as 1997 while
pitching for Winnipeg of the independent Northern League.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, view Zimmerman as one of those
``maximum-effort pitchers,'' one who expends a great deal of energy
during his delivery to generate velocity. That does not make
Zimmerman an ideal candidate for the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman entered yesterday's games with a major league-best 11
scoreless innings and ranked fifth among American League relievers
in opponents' batting average at .086 (3-for-35).
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates considers inserting Zimmerman into the
rotation an interesting idea, but added: ``He's doing great right
where he is.'' Pettitte scratched The New York Yankees scratched
left-hander Andy Pettitte from his scheduled start Thursday at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (0-0, 2.08 earned-run average) complained that his
``legs felt like sandbags'' after his start Saturday against the
Toronto Blue Jays. Pettitte, who made only his second start this
season after straining his left elbow during spring training,
allowed three earned runs on seven hits in the 108-pitch
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a lot easier getting back,'' Pettitte
told reporters afterward. ``I thought my legs would have been under
me a lot quicker than they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees plan to start right-hander Ramiro Mendoza (2-1, 2.05
ERA) on Thursday. That might not be a favorable tradeoff for the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte is 5-3 with a 6.42 ERA during 542/3 innings against the
Rangers. Mendoza is 2-1 with a 3.86 ERA during 161/3 innings. No
interest in Nomo Right-hander Hideo Nomo, whom the Chicago Cubs
released Friday, does not interest the Rangers, O'Brien said. The
Rangers shared the assessment of Cubs general manager Ed Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't see the command or stuff that we felt was good
enough to get major-league hitters out,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs released the 30-year-old pitcher Friday after Nomo
declined to make two more starts at Triple-A Iowa. nn

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Jonathan Cohen, a slender 17-year-old lost in
an oversized sweatshirt, stood Sunday before a sea of silent faces,
closed his eyes, and sang in a clear tenor, ``Do you still hear
raging guns, ending dreams of precious ones?''
</P>
<P>
   In this community torn by violence, many students who heard
Jonathan at the memorial service for the victims of the Columbine
High School shootings knew that he wrote the words from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Jonathan, a junior, was trapped in the school
choir room when the shooting started. His older brother, Stephen,
who accompanied him Sunday on the guitar, had been in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine, rose blood red, heartbreak overflows my head,''
Jonathan sang to the still audience. ``Columbine, friend of mine,
peace will come to you in time.''
</P>
<P>
   As clouds and a cold rain shrouded the nearby Rocky Mountains,
the outdoor memorial service drew 60,000 _ nearly double the
population of the suburban neighborhood served by the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the families of all those who died here, I say: You are not
alone,'' Vice President Al Gore said from a makeshift stage erected
in a movie theater parking lot. ``May you feel the embrace of
literally hundreds of millions who weep with you.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday when religious leaders across the nation tried to
find meaning in a massacre that left 15 people dead, including the
two gunmen, many speakers at the service here cited the example of
Cassie Bernall, a 17-year-old junior. Asked by one of the gunmen if
she believed in God, she answered, ``Yes'' and was shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Franklin Graham, citing her final words, compared her
death to the suffering he had seen among Kosovo refugees on a
recent visit to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of hatred and violence must not be allowed to
gain,'' exclaimed the son of the Rev. Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Although bagpipes played, a religious singer played the trumpet,
and four F-16s scraped overhead in a ``missing-man formation'', the
most remarkable aspect of the huge gathering was the silence. With
ribbons on their lapels in the school colors, blue and white,
mourners wiped tears and bowed heads, holding hands or simply
embracing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it really puts any peace to it, because it's
still so fresh,'' said Taylor Brown, a 19-year-old who graduated
from Columbine last year. ``I'm still in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Many clutched flowers, lilies or purple and white sprays, some
of 25,000 flowers donated by Colorado and California flower
growers. When the Cohen brothers opened the service with a simple
``Hi,'' mourners spontaneously released blue and white balloons
they had been holding. One hour into the service, when a light rain
began to fall, people quietly popped open umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, as Gov. Bill Owens read the roll call of victims, he
released a white dove into the air for each of the victims. For a
few moments, the doves wheeled overhead, then flew away. Columbine,
Colorado's state flower, derives its name from a Latin word meaning
``like a dove.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens read only 13 names, omitting those of the two dead gunmen,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they took far too many precious lives,'' the governor
told the somber crowd. ``But they failed in their goal to kill
hundreds more, and to burn the school to the ground. Behind you
stands the charred remains of Columbine High School. This community
will not be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night at the park across from the school that has
been filled with makeshift memorials, a man brought a sign reading,
``We miss you Eric and Dylan.'' Someone seized the sign from him
and burned it on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for
the spirit of America,'' Gore said Sunday in a rare reference to
the gunmen. ``America is a good and decent place, and our goodness
is a light to all the nations of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several political leaders, including retired Gen. Colin Powell
and most of Colorado's congressional delegation, were on the stage
but did not speak. Those politicians who spoke urged Americans to
spend more time with their children and to purge popular culture of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more raising of children who do not value human life,''
appealed Owens, a Republican. ``No more children forced to grow up
in a culture of death and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Democrat, sounded a similar note, urging as he
gesticulated with his right forefinger, ``All of us must change our
lives to honor these children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a parent, they need your attention, if you are a
grandparent, they need your time,'' he said. ``We must teach them
right from wrong. We must teach them about violence in popular
culture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Clinton appealed to parents, the media,
and the entertainment industry to ``pledge ourselves to the task of
putting an end to the culture of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, Clinton said in his weekly radio address, ``should turn
off the television, pay attention to what's on the computer screen,
refuse to buy products that glorify violence.''
</P>
<P>
   To entertainment industry workers, he said, ``I ask you to make
every video game and movie as if your own children were watching
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Denver, Charles Chaput,
led the gathering in prayer, asking God to ``help us to turn away
from violence and selfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the memorial service, funerals were held for
two slain students, Kelly Fleming and Daniel Mauser. The funerals
were at the St. Francis Cabrini Roman Catholic Church, across the
street from the house of Eric Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 wounded in the high school attack, 11 remained
hospitalized Sunday. Of the injured, one was in critical condition,
six in serious condition and four in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the day of the last scheduled funeral, Columbine
students are to return to school, attending classes at Chatfield
High School, a few miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators, who have already catalogued 2,000 pieces
of evidence, do not expect to release the crime scene until early
May.

STANFORD TAKES PAC-10 WOMEN'S AND MEN'S SINGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; OJAI, Calif. _ Even though she dominated junior events at the
Ojai Valley tennis tournament over the years, Marissa Irvin was
never satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin won titles here as a 14- and 16-year old, then would watch
as the Pacific-10 Conference crowned its annual champions before
large crowds at Libbey Park. For a talented young player growing up
in Southern California, the Pac-10 represented prestige and
history, the conference championship tournament a destination to
one day reach.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it's always been for Irvin, Stanford University's
freshman sensation: Dream about the future while dominating the
present.
</P>
<P>
   In both regards, nothing much has changed. On Sunday, Irvin
fulfilled a lifelong goal of winning the Pac-10 women's singles
title, beating USC's Ditta Huber 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) in the final of the
99th annual Ojai Valley Tournament. Soon after, she was asked what
her immediate plans were: Will she return to Stanford University
next fall or play professional tennis?
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it seems Irvin's present and future are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Irvin decided to enjoy what !ital!was!off! instead of
considering what will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to base what I do on (college and amateur)
tournament results,'' Irvin said. ``I'll base it on how I feel.
(Pro tennis) is a goal of mine, obviously, but I'm just going to
wait and see how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of thing that happens when a freshman explodes
onto the scene as Irvin has. She was regarded as one the top
recruits in Stanford history after leaving Harvard-Westlake and
she's done nothing this year to tarnish that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's impressive first season _ she captured the women's
singles championship at the Rolex National Indoor Title in February
and had a string of 23 consecutive wins at one point _ has only
fueled speculation that she might soon turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who said she won't make a decision on her future until
after the NCAA tournament in May, just wants to enjoy her latest
win. She ended the day by teaming with Teryn Ashley to help
Stanford win the women's doubles title 6-1, 6-2 over Cal's Claire
Curran and Anita Kurimay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Southern California, the Pac-10 always meant so
much,'' Irvin said. ``When I came here to play (as a youth), I'd
always watch the Pac-10 final and think about playing in it one
day. It's definitely been a dream of mine for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In men's Pac-10 singles, Stanford's Ryan Wolters beat Arizona
State's Gustavo Marcaccio 6-4, 6-4. Wolters was making his third
straight appearance in the final, but for the first time he faced
someone other than a Stanford teammate.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed the difference early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lot more nervous then I was the last two years,''
Wolters said. ``I definitely wanted to win more this year than the
two previous times.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolters kept Marcaccio off balance with solid serving and some
terrific passing shots. In some ways, he beat the clever Marcaccio
at his own game.
</P>
<P>
   Marcaccio, a 5-foot-7 senior, frustrated previous opponents with
his quickness and tenacity. That didn't work against Wolters, who
showed similar intensity and hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be in top shape to beat Ryan,'' Macaccio said.
``And today he was really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Irvin slipped a little in April (she lost four of her
last seven matches heading into Ojai), she is obviously on top of
her game now. Irvin didn't drop a set here this week and was
cruising against Huber before wilting somewhat in the second set.
Serving for the match at 5-2, Irvin lost four of the next five
games to force a tiebreaker. She rallied at that point, winning the
tiebreaker 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just got a little tight, I started having trouble
with my first serve and then I was tight on some of my shots,''
Irvin said. ``But fortunately I was able to pull it out.''

COST OF WAR IN KOSOVO COULD COST BORDER COUNTRIES $2.5 BILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war in Kosovo will effectively cost the six
most affected Balkan countries bordering Serbia at least $2.4
billion this year if fighting is prolonged and no refugees return
home, Western analysts have estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Even that estimate may prove conservative, and the costs for
Albania, Bosnia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia are
likely to rise if the conflict continues into 2000, a study by the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers attending the spring sessions of the Bank and
the IMF will discuss the estimated costs and the study of the
economic consequences of the Kosovo crisis on Tuesday in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that _ if the Kosovo crisis persists all
year _ the six affected Balkan countries will need a total of
$1.826 billion in outside assistance. The money would cover
increased balance of payments deficits as a result of lost trade
and the cost of caring for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study says, the governments of the six
countries are likely to see their budget deficits swell by another
$652 million as a result of lost customs revenues and the increased
costs of maintaining defense and law and order during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The study postulates what it calls pessimistic assumptions that
Albania will receive 417,000 Kosovo refugees this year, followed by
Macedonia with 182,000. The total number of refugees is estimated
to reach 925,000, including 276,000 in Montenegro, Serbia's junior
partner which is part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This unfavorable scenario assumes these countries lose all their
official trade with the rump Yugoslavia this year, but that their
exports and imports across Yugoslav territory return to a quarter
of their precrisis levels in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   It also assumes the number of refugees they are sheltering peaks
at 750,000 in the second quarter of the year and ``declines only
modestly in the remainder of the year as a result of some
relocation of refugees to other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   On the more optimistic assumption that ``the crisis is resolved
quickly,'' the World Bank and the IMF say the six countries will
need some $807 million in external assistance to cover the costs of
lost trade and caring for refugees. In addition, their governments
will face additional budget deficits totaling $308 million.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption in this scenario is that their trade with
Yugoslavia returns to 75 per cent of precrisis level and transit
trade to 50 per cent during the second half of the year and that
all refugees have returned by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Fund and the Bank say the Kosovo crisis will strain the
social and economic infrastructures of these largely impoverished
Balkan states. Trade _ particularly for Macedonia and Bosnia, which
export to Serbia _ will be disrupted, and the flow of commerce in
general slowed by NATO bombing damage to Yugoslav transport and
storage facilities, the study notes. Foreign investment is likely
to sink because of the general crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's lucrative adriatic tourist trade is expected to
suffer. Along with Bulgaria and Romania, it is likely to find
itself paying higher interest rates for borrowing on international
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the study says the crisis may harm these countries by
postponing economic reforms they are planning. For example the
privatization of state-owned industries may be delayed by lack of
foreign investor interest and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both the World Bank and the IMF say they will help these
countries meet the additional costs they face as a result of the
crisis. The World Bank says it will ``provide emergency financing
assistance to the affected countries to help close balance of
payments and budgetary gaps,'' noting that it has already given
Albania $2 million for refugee costs and is discussing aid with all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which by statute cannot assist governments cover
domestic budget deficits, says it will ``rephase and augment''
existing loans to help some countries finance their increased
payments deficits.

NEW RATINGS GIVE LYCOS A REASON TO CELEBRATE  
 ANTI-VIRUS COMPANIES SOUND A NEW ALARM  
 TAKING TO THE ROAD WITH A NEW INTERNET PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Internet business, the top of the heap is a very unsteady
place. And nobody knows that better than Bob Davis, chief executive
of Lycos Network Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Media Metrix, which measures Web traffic, announced
that in March the Lycos network of 11 sites, including the search
service Lycos.com, surpassed Yahoo in audience reach for the first
time. That means that more people visited a Lycos site in March
than a Yahoo site _ 31.9 million people vs. 31.3 million. Lycos,
however, is still outranked by America Online and Microsoft sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo asserted that its figures did not include
Broadcast.com or Geocities, which the company is acquiring. In the
case of Lycos, however, the numbers do reflect its acquisition of
Wired Digital, which it announced plans to acquire last fall. That
deal has not officially closed, though Wired Digital has already
become part of the Lycos Network, which is based in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis is celebrating, if only for the moment. ``What the
ratings say is that today we've got the No. 1 spot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first; it's never happened where Yahoo hasn't been
the dominant one,'' Davis said. ``It shows there's still
competition on the Web.'' He attributes Lycos' rise to its focus on
what he calls ``organic applications,'' like Tripod, an online
community site that the company acquired last year, and other
projects that encourage communications among Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Lycos announcement of taking first place is
premature, or even inaccurate, Davis has other reasons to
celebrate. In February, Lycos struck a deal to merge with USA
Networks, the media and electronic-commerce company controlled by
Barry Diller. Under that agreement, Lycos, along with Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch, will become USA/Lycos Interactive Network.

   Anti-Virus Companies Sound a New Alarm
</P>
<P>
   When the clock strikes midnight on Monday, it will set off a
nasty version of a computer virus known as CIH 1.2 that is capable
of deleting part of the contents of hard drives and preventing
computers from booting up.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks there has been an outbreak of a different
sort: Various makers of anti-virus programs have sent out news
releases warning of the virus and touting their own software for
use as a preventive measure. Several anti-virus companies, like
Network Associates Inc. and Computer Associates International Inc.,
said they were offering free CIH virus patches for download from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All this simply underscores a constant tension in the anti-virus
community, which on the one hand exists to eradicate viruses and on
the other thrives on their existence and benefits from copious
press about the potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of CIH, the companies insist they are not blowing
the potential dangers out of proportion. Variants of the CIH virus
attack computers on the 26th of each month, but the one programmed
for Monday is considered the most virulent strain; it is known as
the ``Chernobyl virus'' because it hits on the anniversary of the
meltdown of the nuclear reactor in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most prevalent file virus in the wild,'' said Sal
Viveros, marketing manager for Network Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The CIH attacks files that can be opened in Windows 98 and
Windows 95, including Word and Excel files. The virus can be passed
by e-mail, floppy disk or other means, but is easily detected and
destroyed by most anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   Previous incarnations of the CIH virus have not proved as
harmful as computer security experts warned at the time. Still,
makers of anti-virus software are not out of line in bringing
attention to this latest strain, said Kathy Fithen, manager of the
CERT Coordination Center, a federally financed computer-virus
response team at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hysteria,'' she said. ``What they are doing is
alerting customers that they need to update software. And that's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MATT RICHTEL
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the Road With a New Internet Pitch
</P>
<P>
   He is flush from the recent initial public offering of
iVillage.com, in which he got insider stock as a participant in the
Web site's Armchair Millionaire section. Now, Lewis Schiff, a New
York-based Internet marketer, is touting his latest venture,

   LANGHORNE, Pa. _ Lisa Chapman and her two sons camped out in
their car in the parking lot of the Oxford Valley Mall here on a
recent Friday night so they could beat the crowd at the Pokemon
Trading Card Game Tour the next morning. The line formed at 7 a.m.,
and by the time the event began four hours later, it had swelled to
4,000 kids and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore handmade Pokemon costumes in hopes of having their
pictures taken for the official Pokemon site on the World Wide Web.
Marie Summa, 12, of Beverly, N.J., sported a yellow hat with white
felt horns and a T-shirt decorated with her favorite Pokemon
characters. ``She's been wearing that hat for three days,'' said
her father, Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Similar mob scenes are being repeated across the country. At the
Woodbridge Mall in Woodbridge, N.J., many of the 13,000 people who
showed up had to be turned away. The craze has invaded schools,
too, and several have banned Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting lost or misplaced and the kids were getting
upset,'' said Richard P. Limato, principal of the Prospect Hill
School, one of three elementary schools in Pelham, N.Y., that
outlawed them last month.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon is actually a video game _ the cards are just one of the
spinoffs _ and it is shaping up as one of the biggest blockbusters
ever produced by the Nintendo Corp. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Started in Nintendo's home market three years ago, Pokemon has
grown into an international industry that includes comic books,
plastic figurines, virtual pets, bean-bag toys, lunch boxes,
T-shirts, a television cartoon show and compact disks, with sales
so far of nearly $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, more than 2.5 million video games have
been sold at about $28 each since Pokemon was introduced last
September, more than any other hand-held Nintendo product in such a
short span. At least 40 licensing deals have been struck, and
revenues already exceed $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it one of the hottest fads of the 1990s among the
preteen-age set. The sale of Pokemon cartridges alone, for example,
has totaled $70 million in just seven months. That compares with
$107 million for Sesame Street's Tickle Me Elmo doll from mid-1996
through 1998; $83 million last year for the Teletubbies, the cuddly
dolls from Britain, and $80 million for Tamogotchi, a virtual pet,
over a 20-month period through December, according to the NPD
Group, a research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of Pokemon, which the company says is properly
pronounced PO-kay-mon and which is short for ``pocket monsters,''
are complex. Pallet Town is inhabited by 151 monsters _ or Pokemons
_ with names like Raiku and Bulbasaur, and at the beginning of each
game the player recruits and trains one of them to fight all the
others. Each time a monster pops onto the screen the player
determines which skills _ fire, lightning, water, growling, and so
forth _ his comrade-in-arms may use.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to become a master Pokemon trainer by capturing all
151 monsters. Luckily, the player's initial Pokemon grows stronger
with every victory and can evolve into an entirely new creature,
with the fiery-red Charmander transmogrifying into the
fire-breathing dragon Charizard, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The passion that kids aged 5 through about 12 _ mostly boys, but
a lot of girls, too _ feel for Pokemon defies easy explanation.
Part of it has to do with the huge choice of monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pokes are so cute and the characters all do different
things,'' said Tanbari Pianwi, a third-grader at the John W. Ross
School in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Santos, a fifth-grader, focused on their battlefield
skills. ``Pug is stronger than any others,'' he said approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Good, president of a marketing research firm in Cleveland,
said the Pokemons combined two qualities that had always attracted
children: magical powers and the need to be nurtured. For a
generation raised on action-packed television shows, he added, it
doesn't hurt that the game provides a lot of raw excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool because it has different kinds of animals that have
different powers,'' said Dustin Chapman, Ms. Chapman's 9-year-old
son. He rattled off examples _ ``electric beats water, water beats
stone, strength beats water and stone'' _ as his mother listened in
obvious bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy marketing has also increased the game's popularity.
Nintendo spent $20 million on publicity before it introduced
Pokemon in the United States, four times its usual budget for new
products, including a 15-minute free video it sent to one million
kids. It dropped 1,000 stuffed Pikachus, a mouse-like star in the
cartoon series, from the sky over Topeka, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   It dispatched 10 Volkswagen Beetles, painted to depict Pikachu,
to show the cartoons on portable TVs at the malls and on the Main
Streets of America. And after stops in New Jersey, Massachusetts
and Illinois, it has taken its trading-card road show west, with
events in Colorado and in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the spending was Pokemon's unexpected triumph
in Japan, where Nintendo has sold more than 12 million video game
units, one million CDs and one billion trading cards. All Nippon
Airways even painted the sides of some of its planes with Pokemon
characters. ``This is so far beyond anybody's original projections
that there has to be more to it than a quirky niche concept,'' said
Peter Main, a marketing executive for Nintendo of America in
Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Nintendo anticipated a tough sell in the United States,
especially after a strobe-lighting effect in one of its television
cartoons caused a number of children in Japan to faint. (The
lighting scene was later eliminated.) But more than 100 American
television stations quickly signed on, and retailers ordered more
than 500,000 game cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   As children master the Pokemon video game, demand for the cards
_ which are used to play a board game but are also avidly traded _
has rocketed. A starter set of 60 sells for about $8, with other
packs costing from $3 to $10. Wizards of the Coast, the Renton,
Wash., company that sells them under license, has begun rationing
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Carmical, a supervisor at a hobby shop in Colorado
Springs, Colo., said the cards often disappeared from shelves
within three hours of arriving. ``We've timed it and we've placed
bets'' on when the last pack will go, Carmical said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Johnston, who works at a toy store in Arlington, Va.,
said the allure of the game had spread to adults. ``We get everyone
from Pentagon guys who come in asking for the game to mothers with
kids,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no end to the Pokemon invasion. Last week, the
Topps Co. announced it had signed a deal to market a line of cards
in North America, as Wizards of the Coast has been doing since
January, and to sell Pokemon lollipops in the entire Western
Hemisphere. And last month, the Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. said it
would feature the cartoon characters on 50 million packages of its
Lunchables snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon has also proved a surprise hit for Hasbro, which began
selling miniature Pokemon figures, pokeballs, and electronic
figures late last year. It has introduced about 50 characters, and
plans to phase in the others. The company has doubled its revenue
projections for Pokemon this year to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think the Pokemon craze has gotten a bit out of
hand. A small number of schools in New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas and Washington have barred either the
cards, the handheld game or both. Limato, the Pelham principal,
said the cards were worse than just a distraction; the older
children often made advantageous trades with younger students, who
would then become upset. As for the game, he added, ``We try to
discourage solitary activities.''
</P>
<P>
   So do some parents. ``I know about the game, but it is not
allowed at home,'' said Yvonne Rayes, the mother of a 5-year-old.
``I don't think action figures are good for kids. It is good to
encourage kids to play with each other, not with a Game Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents voice less lofty objections. A woman named Linda
from Yardley, Pa., who declined to give her last name, said she had
just spent $300 on various Pokemon paraphernalia at a local
Electronics Boutique for her two sons, aged 7 and 12, and ``I don't
want to ever shop for this stuff again.''
</P>
<P>
   She may have little choice. Nintendo will introduce two new
games this year, Pokemon Pinball, for use in Game Boy players, and
Pokemon Snap, for the Nintendo 64 player. New monsters will be
introduced in a Yellow Game Boy cartridge, to go along with the red
and blue already available, and a Pokemon movie should hit U.S.
shores this year.
</P>
<P>
   When told of all that was yet to come, Linda laughed nervously.
``I'll deal with it when it happens,'' she said.

VIRGINIA'S `INTERNET GOVERNOR' WOOS SILICON VALLEY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ James S. Gilmore III, the governor of
Virginia, stood on the steps of the Netscape Communications Corp.'s
headquarters last Tuesday and smiled in the morning sun. The man
Virginians know as the ``Internet Governor'' was 3,000 miles from
his constituents but he insisted he felt at home in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak their language,'' Gilmore said. ``We're on line
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the governor correctly interpreted the ties remains to
be seen. One thing is certain: as the worlds of politics and high
technology increasingly come together, Gilmore is a man who would
like to be at the nexus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Virginia's high-technology economy has surged
and Gilmore, a Republican, has made Internet policy central to his
18-month stint in office.
</P>
<P>
   He helped create and signed what supporters deemed the nation's
first comprehensive set of state Internet laws, created the first
state technology cabinet post, made fast ties with Virginia's
technology industry and aggressively recruited technology companies
to consider making Virginia their home.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is seeking to parlay his efforts into a national role.
Last December, he was named to a federal commission charged with
studying Internet tax issues, and he hopes the Internet policies
pioneered in Virginia will be used as a blueprint by other states.
</P>
<P>
   His three-day tour of California last week represented a
coming-out party of sorts, an effort to sell himself and Virginia
at ground zero of the digital revolution. He said he felt a warm
reception from executives at the likes of Netscape, Oracle and
Cisco Systems. But it was also clear that Gilmore's portrayal of
Virginia as the ``Internet state'' did not overly impress the
industry titans in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody comes here trying to get a little Silicon Valley
dust on their shoes,'' said Netscape's chief executive, James L.
Barksdale, during his meeting with the governor, though not
appearing to refer to the governor personally.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what made the visit to Netscape particularly
symbolic is that Netscape recently was purchased by America Online,
the brightest jewel in Virginia's high-technology crown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to America Online, Virginia is home to MCI Worldcom
and one of its subsidiaries, Uunet, as well as Psinet. Gilmore is
fond of saying that thanks to the presence of those companies _
Uunet and PSInet are Internet service providers _ 50 percent of all
Internet traffic goes through Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Virginia's high-technology economy has been on a
tear. Over the last five years, the technology sector has generated
more than 60 percent of the growth in the state's economy,
according to the governor's office. The office also projected that
the number of technology businesses in Virginia would grow to 5,300
by 2002, up from 3,400 now.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore says he has never called himself ``the Internet
Governor,'' but he does not mind the title a bit. ``If somebody
wants to refer to me as that, I won't run from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To his detractors, Gilmore is a Johnny-come-lately who has tried
to transform himself into a ``governor.com.'' Critics say he hardly
uttered a word about technology until after he became gvernor in
1997 and has since sought to take credit for Virginia's
high-technology growth. They point out that Gilmore's gubernatorial
opponent, Donald S. Beyer Jr., was much more closely tied to
northern Virginia's technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech economy has been booming for years,'' said
Kenneth R. Plum, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia.
``He's gotten on board and is riding it for all it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Plum and other critics do not dispute that Gilmore and
the Internet industry have become fast friends in the intervening
months. Many in the industry say the gvernor is one of the few
politicians who has made a truly concerted effort to understand
their new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's recognized what the Internet is, how it got there and
what impact it can have'' said Stephen M. Case, the chief executive
of America Online, adding that Gilmore's efforts in Virginia are
being emulated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a recognition this is a launching pad,'' Case said.
``The policies set in Virginia could become a blueprint.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not hurt the governor's standing among the state's
technology companies that he has offered tax breaks to support
their growth. For example, he engineered an $18 million tax break
for America Online as an incentive for the company to build a new
data center in Prince William County.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also credit Gilmore with being the first governor in
the nation to create a technology cabinet post (although Democratic
critics in the state contend they had the idea first). The
secretary of technology post is held by Donald W. Upson, a former
marketing executive, who is charged with attracting high-technology
business to Virginia and exploring how the state can use
information technology internally.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the work of a state commission created by Gilmore, he
signed the nation's most broad-based state Internet laws last
month, giving force to seven bills called the Internet Policy Act.
Among other things, the act has provisions to protect consumer
privacy, make it a crime to use encryption for criminal activity
and make it a criminal offense to send unsolicited commercial
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other states are considering Internet-related laws, and
some are patterning them after the work of Virginia, said Paul
Russinoff, state policy counsel for the Internet Alliance, an
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a fan of heavy regulation on the Internet, you may
find the Virginia act unsatisfying, but it is one of the few policy
initiatives I've seen at a state level that takes a realistic
approach,'' Russinoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying there aren't other `Internet governors' out
there,'' he added. ``But Governor Gilmore is absolutely focused on
the medium.''

Darrell Gwynn pulls life together after paralyzing crash 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ENNIS, Texas _ April 15 used to be the most taxing day of the year
for Darrell and Lisa Gwynn, but it snuck right past them this
month.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The only thing we think about now on April 15 is our taxes,''
Lisa Gwynn said from the couple's home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
``That's a good thing. It's a healing kind of process that we've
gone through. Because for the first couple of years after the
accident, it was like, `Oh gosh, it's here again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The accident. It happened on April 15, 1990, Easter Sunday.
Darrell Gwynn was an always-smiling, borderline-cocky, rising star
in the National Hot Rod Association's Top Fuel ranks. And then an
exhibition run down a drag strip in England altered his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The chassis on Gwynn's rear-engined car inexplicably snapped in
half while accelerating down the quarter-mile Santa Pod Raceway.
The tumbling wreckage struck the track's retaining wall, paralyzing
Gwynn from the chest down and eventually forcing doctors to
amputate his left arm at the elbow. In a matter of five or six or
seven horrifying seconds, the carefree driver known as ``The Kid''
_ winner of 18 NHRA races and the championship runner-up in 1986
and 1988 _ was launched into his second life at 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a creature of your environment,'' said Gwynn, 37,
owner of the Team Mopar Dragster driven by Mike Dunn at the Castrol
Nationals this weekend at the Texas Motorplex. ``A lot of people
haven't been around me since the accident. I still have my bad
days, days when I don't feel like getting out of bed. But if you
own a Top Fuel team, you'd better get out of bed. Early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have a lot of good people and my family around me. A
lot of good things have happened to me since the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Darrell and Lisa, who were engaged at the time of
the accident, were married Jan. 9, 1993. Last June 26, Lisa gave
birth to the couple's first child, daughter Katie Brianne. She is
the first frozen embryo born through the Miami Project to Cure
Paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little miracle child,'' said Darrell, proudly
sporting a plastic credential-holder around his neck featuring two
photographs of his daughter. ``She's 10-months-old and learning how
to say `da-da.' I've got more reasons than ever to stay home with
my wife and my baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gwynn is completing the first year of a three-year
residency at Jackson Memorial Hospital at the University of Miami,
leading to board-certification as a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interning as a mother and a pediatrician,'' said Lisa, who
also has learned to rely on family and friends to make her and
Darrell's diverse schedules work. ``Living life with a spinal-cord
injury in the family is not without its complications. With the
baby, it makes it even harder. We've truly learned about the
goodness of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darrell also has more reasons than ever to guide his
motorized wheelchair into his specially equipped Winnebago
motorhome and spend the weekend at the track. Because four races
into the 22-event schedule, Gwynn's team is atop of drag racing's
premier division.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn ended a personal losing streak dating to June 23, 1996,
with a victory in the season-opening Winternationals on Feb. 8 at
Pomona (Calif.) Raceway, where Gwynn won his first Top Fuel race in
1986. Dunn also won the season's third race in Gainesville, Fla.,
on March 21. Dunn brought a 32-point lead over Doug Herbert into
this meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not by accident that this car is running this good,''
said Gwynn, whose team includes veteran tuner Ken Veney and team
manager Larry Meyer of Irving. ``We did a lot of problem
identifying in the off-season to find out how to make this team
better. Hiring Larry Meyer fixed about 90 percent of the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be bad news for the usual Top Fuel contenders. While
many have been hit-and-miss with their five-disc clutch and engine
combinations, Veney generally has been able to keep Dunn firing on
all eight cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken has got the rip-your-throat-out attitude,'' said Gwynn, a
bulldog who posted a five-year won/loss record of 140-64 (.686
percentage) as a driver. ``As a car owner, I can't ask for anything
more.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dunn, Gwynn has a driver he truly can relate to. Gwynn's
father, Jerry, was an accomplished Sportsman drag racer whose
career included a victory in the World Finals at Dallas in 1969 in
an AA/Altered Roadster. Dunn is the son of Jim Dunn, a pioneer
Funny Car driver whose 1970s match-racing career was chronicled in
the movie ``Funny Car Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn, who drove Funny Cars from 1981-1991, has been Gwynn's
full-time Top Fuel shoe since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Dunn is a guy I don't have to babysit,'' said Gwynn,
whose team's best points finishes have been fourth-place runs in
1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's admiration for Gwynn and his commitment to the team is
unabashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive spirit has never died in Darrell,'' said Dunn,
42, of Wrightsville, Pa. ``And don't get me wrong, because we do
argue. I've often said that part of the reason we're still together
is that I live in Pennsylvania and Darrell lives in Florida. The
thing about Darrell is, since I've been with him, he has never
complained about the cards he's been dealt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell wants us to get better. He's always said, `Let's
invest the money that will make the real estate \Rbodywork\S on the
side of this car more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Courting sponsors, in fact, occupies most of Gwynn's work day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in contact with Mopar and Gates Rubber and Prolong and Mac
Tools and Winnebago, the people that have invested in us,'' Gwynn
said. ``It's a full-time job making sure those people are happy and
taking care of the business side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a schedule that, combined with his family life, allows
Gwynn little time to dwell upon ``one bad day'' nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew it was coming up last week,'' Darrell Gwynn
said of the anniversary, ``and it went by and I never thought about
it. It's not like we sit around the house all day, crying on April
15.''

`Machines' threaten horse racing's image 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Trainer Bob Baffert is going for a record third

<P>
   Interesting storylines for this Run for the Roses on Saturday
are everywhere. But instead, headlines are being dominated by the
saga of jockey Billy Patin, who is being investigated for possibly
carrying an illegal battery device that could keep Arkansas Derby
winner Valhol out of the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Horse people cringe at the adverse publicity the issue has
generated at a time when the sport is aggressively seeking a better
image. ``There is no place in this game for something like this,''
said trainer Nick Zito, who has three horses for Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Crude electrical stimulation devices are as much a part of
racing folklore _ although an unseemly part _ as the Vanderbilts
and Whitneys.
</P>
<P>
   A computer check by Association of Racing Commissioners
International turned up 65 pages of stewards' rulings since 1974
for electrical devices, commonly known in the sport as
``machines.'' Such homemade devices typically consist of two AAA
batteries looped in wiring and covered with black electrical tape,
with two exposed prongs that provide a shock when pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Offending jockeys most often have carried the small devices in
their palms, surreptitiously rubbing them against horses' necks as
part of their natural riding motion in an attempt to shock horses
into running faster.
</P>
<P>
   Riders have been caught with machines hidden up their sleeves,
tucked into riding britches, and tied to the underside of horses'
manes. One jockey in Arizona was caught when a finish-line
photograph showed a device in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Oaklawn Park is alleging Patin carried a ``machine'' during the
April 10 Arkansas Derby, then dropped it to the track as 31-1
longshot Valhol was galloping out past the finish. At least one
eyewitness saw an object fall from the horse, and video from ESPN's
national telecast clearly shows an unidentified object falling from
the vicinity of Patin's left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol faces possible exclusion from the Kentucky Derby due to a
lack of graded-stakes earnings. The Arkansas Racing Commission is
withholding the gelding's $300,000 Arkansas Derby winnings, pending
the outcome of its investigation, which will last at least another
eight days. James Jackson of Rockdale, who owns Valhol, says he
will take legal action if necessary to have those earnings credited
to Valhol until guilt or innocence is established.
</P>
<P>
   If Valhol makes it into the Kentucky Derby, he will be a
longshot, just as Hallieboy was a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hallieboy finished 10th at 69-1 odds in the 1950 running, and
track officials subsequently received a tip that jockey George
Atkins carried a ``machine'' during the race. When Hallieboy ran
two weeks later in another race at Churchill Downs and finished
sixth, Atkins was searched afterward and a device was found.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins wasn't permitted to ride again until 1959 and never had
another Derby mount. \Nsubheds:A Who's Who of culprits The ARCI's
list of stewards rulings associated with battery devices includes
well-known jockeys such as national superstar Shane Sellers, Lone
Star Park's own Marlon St. Julien, and top quarter horse jockey
Eddie Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Sellers, were unfairly accused and later exonerated.
Then only 20 years old, Sellers was ruled off in May 1986 by
stewards at Fairmount Park, a minor-league track in Collinsville,
Ill., for what they termed as ``participation'' in the possession
of an electrical device. Actually, the device was found on Lee
Felix, who had been aboard a pony that accompanied Sellers and his
mount to the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Fairmount stewards overturned the ruling nine months later and
restored Sellers to good standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As God is my witness, I was nowhere near that thing,'' Sellers
recalled yesterday from Churchill Downs. ``It wasn't fair back
then, and I don't like being associated with that stuff now. I've
worked too hard to build my good name.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien was given a six-month suspension in 1995 by stewards
at Evangeline Downs in Lafayette, La., for an incident in which a
machine was found on the ground beneath one of his mounts.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien, the leading Lone Star thoroughbred jockey in races
won in 1998, said he continued to ride on appeal, never served a
single suspension day, and now has a clean record. According to the
Louisiana Racing Commission, St. Julien was arrested for
``unnatural stimulation of a racehorse,'' but charges were dropped
and the incident removed from his record after he participated in a
four-month diversionary program as mandated by the Lafayette Parish
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and St. Julien are natives of south Louisiana. Many of
the country's most celebrated machine cases involved other riders
from that area, such as Lane Suire, Phil Rubbicco, L. J. Durousseau
and now Patin.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers explained to Fairmount stewards in 1986 that although he
had never carried a device at a recognized track, they were
commonly used at the state's celebrated ``bush'' tracks where
quarter horses are matched against each other for side bets. Like
many Cajun kids, Sellers began riding in these races at a young
age.
</P>
<P>
   One trainer who asked not to be identified said that machines
are much more prevalent at smaller tracks, where scrutiny from the
public and officials is not as intense. At some small tracks, he
said, maintenance workers have been known to supplement their
income by retrieving discarded machines from track infields and
selling them back to jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   He said the devices tend to work best on older horses that have
become bored with the sport and don't try their hardest.
Inexperienced horses such as Valhol are considered poor candidates.
\Nsubheds:A matter of chance Former jockey and racing official Ted
Atkinson, now 83 and a member of the National Racing Hall of Hame,
said it is well-known that most racehorses don't respond positively
to such stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of the horse,'' Atkinson said. ``He's got
to be scared to death of it, and a lot of horses won't run from it
at all. It's a matter of chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As a steward at Arlington Park, Atkinson participated in the
expulsion of Suire, whose creativity was surpassed only by his hard
luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Suire was injured in a spill at Arlington
and was removed from the track by ambulance. A few minutes later, a
tractor driver harrowing the track found a whip on the track near
the spot of the accident. The whip was engraved with Suire's
initials and a battery device was found concealed inside its
hollowed-out handle, with two prongs sticking out of the bottom of
the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Suire was suspended from riding for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious of all jockeys associated with ``machines,''
however, hailed from Arkansas rather than Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The late Lonnie Joe Ray was a talented rider, but was better
known for his flamboyant and often erratic personality. Those who
knew him well said Ray would rather win one race dishonestly than
two by following the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ray eluded discovery until a January 1973 race at Tropical Park
in Miami, now known as Calder Race Course. Security showed up
behind the starting gate to search Ray, who was ordered to
dismount. A body check turned up nothing. Ray climbed back into the
saddle, and as his horse was loaded into the gate, he verbally
abused the track starter, who presses the button to open the gates
and begin the races.
</P>
<P>
   The starter had heard rumors Ray had a special hiding spot for
his machine, and had kept quiet during the initial search. But when
he was cursed by Ray, he ordered the horse backed out of the
starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   He summoned security officers. ``Look in his knot,'' the starter
said.
</P>
<P>
   And there, tucked into a large knot Ray had tied in the reins
behind the horse's neck, was an electrical device.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the authorities had their man. Ray was ruled off from
riding.
</P>
<P>
   If the frequency of stewards' rulings is any indication, the use
of electrical devices in racing is declining. Three cases were
reported to the ARCI in 1997, one in 1998, and none so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Park executive vice president and general manager
Corey Johnsen said track management meets with riders before each
season to explain the hard line the track will take with offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place in horse racing for an electrical device,
and we feel strongly about that,'' Johnsen said. ``If anyone is
found with one on our grounds, they will be banned for life from
Lone Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agrees with that stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that \RPatin\S
carried a device,'' said Jackson, ``then in the future they should
check riders before every race and at the gate. They should make
absolutely sure nothing like this ever happens to anyone else in
this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm innocent in this, but yet I'm the one paying the price for
it.''

LITTLE URGENCY CLOUDS EVE OF WORLD BANKERS' MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Story includes material from previously skedded RUSSIA-IMF.) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the finance ministers and officials of the
world's biggest economic powers last met in Washington six months
ago, President Clinton declared that he and other leaders were
confronting ``the biggest financial challenge facing the world in a
half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of another such meeting, millions of people are
still suffering, national economies are still shrinking, but the
crisis seems oddly abated.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis preoccupying Clinton and other leaders is in Kosovo,
not the market. Fear of new forms of ``economic contagion'' has
been replaced with far older fears of military contagion. Asia's
slow recovery has moved it off the political radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Without that sense of urgency, the chances of remaking the
``global financial architecture'' through fundamental changes _ the
rallying call of financial meetings last fall _ have diminished
considerably. But there have been some modest steps, including one
Sunday by the International Monetary Fund's executive board. As
part of the lending agency's efforts to offer some way to prevent
economic turbulence from spreading from country to country, the
board approved a program for contingency credit, Michel Camdessus,
its managing director, announced.
</P>
<P>
   The program, first called for by Clinton last September, will
allow the IMF to offer substantial credit to any country determined
to be following sound economic policies. The hope is that such
support will deter speculators from attacking a nation's currency
and will preserve investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that the IMF's action was a
victory for Clinton's financial stability agenda and that the
program would provide ``an expanded capacity to help maintain
confidence when countries face the threat of financial contagion.''
</P>
<P>
   An unresolved problem with the program is that the standard _
sound economic policies _ is likely to be hard for the most
vulnerable nations to meet, while many eligible countries are less
likely to be hit by contagion.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders of the IMF and the World Bank, in Washington for
their spring meetings, start occupying the hotel rooms just
abandoned by NATO leaders who were here for NATO's 50th
anniversary, some officials insist that the biggest worry once
again is the absence of fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real danger, which I sense already, that the
pressure to reform is weakening around the world,'' James
Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, said in an interview
this weekend. ``There were a lot of powerful and wealthy interests
who opposed reform, and they have been able to reassert
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned last week against the dangers of ``complacency,''
endorsing an agenda of reforms spelled out the next day by Rubin.
Those proposals, however, turned out to be modest at best: more
disclosure rules to force countries, companies and hedge funds to
make information about their financial health public, and some
``voluntary guidelines'' to try to prevent countries from taking
huge financial risks.
</P>
<P>
   To many experts, the package looked more like interior
decorating than real architectural alterations. Rubin shied away,
for example, from any proposals to control the flow of capital into
or out of vulnerable countries, or to expand the powers of the IMF
to be a ``lender of last resort'' for stricken nations.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the countries hardest hit by the economic crisis,
notably Thailand and South Korea, a sense of optimism has replaced
gloom. Although their economies will still shrink this year, their
stock markets began rocketing back almost as soon as the last set
of meetings of the World Bank and the IMF ended in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, South Korea's market has returned to where it
was before the crisis in Asia struck, and Hong Kong's has roared
back to life. Brazil, which in January appeared to be the next
domino to fall, has stumbled into unexpected stability.
</P>
<P>
   While the good news has buoyed investors, it has also emboldened
the leaders of huge businesses _ like South Korea's powerful
industrial groups, the chaebols, which came to symbolize crony
capitalism _ to resist real change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis came about because of some misjudgments about the
fragility of the system,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the
Yale School of Management, who had called for some tough reforms,
including the creation of a global central bank, several months
ago. ``Now there is a feeling in the air that the system is more
resilient, more capable of bouncing back fast, than anyone thought.
When you put that together with vivid pictures out of Kosovo, you
can see how quickly the political attention span can be diverted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some other reforms are under way. Countries already publish far
more data than they did before the crisis first hit Thailand in
July 1997. The IMF posts some of its conclusions about member
nations' debt and economic strategies on the Internet
(http://www.imf.org).
</P>
<P>
   Armed with more information, investors are expected to be far
more cautious. But questions remain as to whether the new
disclosure policies have prompted the IMF to be less open. ``We are
clearly less willing to publish something that could trigger
investors to panic now that it's clear it may be immediately
published,'' one senior official said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the diminished sense of urgency is some new thinking
that has emerged about crisis-racked nations like Russia and
Indonesia: that after a while, their troubles pose less of a threat
to the rest of the world, not more.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Clinton administration scrambled to put
together a huge bailout package for Russia, fearing that an
economic meltdown would destabilize President Boris Yeltsin,
threaten economic reforms and perhaps lead to a national political
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   While the IMF is close to a new agreement to resume loans, it
will probably give Russia only enough to pay back major debtors and
avert the embarrassment of default.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if Russia gets anything more than just a
chance to muddle through the year,'' said one international
official involved in the negotiations. ``There is a sense that if
you don't give them the money, it would be another sign of Russia's
severed linkage with the West, which would put them more and more
outside the system.'' Talk of resuming real economic reform,
though, has dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, aid to Indonesia is on hold until after elections in
June. While its economic woes remain severe, and violence continues
around the country, American officials have concluded that the
chances are now small that Indonesia's troubles will infect the
rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new thinking is the old thinking,'' said Garten, who left
the Clinton administration for Yale after the president's first
term. ``And that is that since we still don't really understand
many of the forces at work, we should leave a lot of this to the
market.''

EDITORIAL: LIABILITY FOR THE MILLENNIUM BUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 26:
</P>
<P>
   With 249 days to go until the year 2000, many experts are
alarmed and others are only mildly concerned about the danger of
computer chaos posed by the so-called millennium bug. One
prediction seems safe, however. Whatever the damage, there will be
lots of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation, some in Congress, mainly Republicans, want
legislation to limit the right of people and businesses to sue in
the event of a Y2K disaster. Their reasoning is that the important
thing is to get people to fix their computer problems now rather
than wait and sue. But the legislation is misguided and potentially
unfair. It could even lessen the incentive for corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   As most people know by now, the millennium bug arises from the
fact that chips and software have been coded to mark the years with
only two digits, so that when the date on computers moves over to
the year 2000, the computers may go haywire when they register 1900
instead.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by a Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000
found that while many government agencies and larger companies have
taken action to correct the bug, 50 percent of the country's small-
and medium-size businesses have not. The failure is especially
worrisome in the health sector, with many hospitals and 90 percent
of doctors' offices unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If hospitals, supermarkets, utilities and small businesses are
forced to shut down because of computer problems, lawsuits against
computer and software manufacturers will certainly result. Some
experts estimate that liabilities could reach $1 trillion.
Legislation to protect potential defendants, sponsored by Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, is expected to be voted on in the Senate this
week. The bill would impose caps on punitive damages and tighter
standards of proof of liability, and provide for a 90-day waiting
period in which the sued company would be allowed to cure the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would also suspend ``joint and several liability,''
under which wealthy defendants, like chip or software companies,
could have to pay the full cost of damages if other parties could
not be sued because they were overseas or unable to pay.
</P>
<P>
   These provisions would curtail or even suspend a basic
protection, the right to sue, that consumers and businesses have
long enjoyed. The White House and the Congressional Democratic
leadership are right to view such a step as unnecessary. Existing
liability laws offer plenty of protections for businesses that
might be sued.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the legislation argue, for example, that companies
that make good-faith efforts to alert customers of Y2K problems
should not be punished if the customers ignore the warning, or if
the companies bear only a small portion of the responsibility. But
state liability laws already allow for these defenses. The larger
worry is that the prospect of immunity could dissuade equipment and
software makers from making the effort to correct the
millennium-bug problem.
</P>
<P>
   It might make sense to have a 90-day ``cooling off'' period for
affected businesses to get help to fix as many problems as possible
without being able to file lawsuits. But it would be catastrophic
if stores, small businesses and vital organizations like hospitals
and utilities were shut down for 90 days. They should have the same
recourse to relief from the parties that supplied them with faulty
goods that any other customer has.
</P>
<P>
   Government can certainly help by providing loans, subsidies and
expertise to computer users and, perhaps, by setting up special
courts to adjudicate claims. Congress can also clarify the
liability of companies once it becomes clear how widespread the
problem really is. But before the new year, the government should
not use the millennium bug to overturn longstanding liability
practices. A potential crisis is no time to abrogate legal rights. &QL;

<P>
   TETOVO, Macedonia _ Here they stroll, up Marshal Tito Street,
some of the most recognizable faces of Kosovo's diaspora. Their
lives are now scattered pieces, some parts irretrievable _ homes
lost, loved ones missing, work destroyed, faith worn down to the
nub.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, hundreds of the uprooted intelligentsia of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, have come to Tetovo, a Macedonian city
of 300,000 people, dozens of good coffee houses and a university.
In Tetovo, as in Pristina, most people are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   So who was strolling here on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Luan Jaha, the stage actor, came along. He made it across the
border three weeks weeks ago. His face was pale, his eyes tired. He
seemed like an old ball that had lost its bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no mind any more with which to think,'' he said wanly
and apologetically. ``My wife asks me what am I going to do, and I
say what can I do but wait? But it is not even waiting that I do,
because waiting means I expect something. And what is there to
expect?''
</P>
<P>
   And there walked the young playwright Jeton Budima, wearing a
black leather jacket and biting the end of a toothpick. He and his
wife and daughter spent four nights sleeping in their car, stranded
in the awful traffic of so many people with vehicles trying to get
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly you are an animal on the run, a refugee, a number in
the world's book of statistics,'' he said. ``Suddenly, you feel
like human garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   They were here, but their talk was mostly of who was not. Had
there been word of so-and-so? Was she among the many still hiding
in Pristina? Had she gone to Albania? Was she dead?
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper editor Baton Haxhiu was almost dead. NATO
announced news of his murder on March 29. Haxhiu heard the live
broadcast, finding the information inaccurate but hardly
inconceivable. He surmised that he was on a Serbian hit list,
joining such authentically dead as the civil-rights lawyer Bajram
Kelmendi and the trade unionist Agim Hajrizi, both murdered by the
Serbs shortly after NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   After a harrowing escape, Haxhiu set up shop here on Marshal
Tito Street. His newspaper, Koha Ditore, was the most respected
Albanian-language daily in Kosovo. Then, on March 24, its offices
in Pristina were ransacked and its night watchmen killed. The
daily's founder, Veton Surroi, a delegate to the failed peace talks
on Kosovo, went into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bosnia's Muslims, the Albanians of Kosovo are finding that
the Serbs are scattering and destroying those who could be deemed
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, Haxhiu said, ``want to cut all connections to
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tetovo, the remnants of Kosovo's Albanian elite are trying to
regroup, to piece together something of their shattered
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, Haxhiu was standing outside the paper's new
office, a tiny space jammed with desktop computers but lacking even
a single phone line. The staff intends to end Koha Ditore's
monthlong silence on Monday, distributing free copies in refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Haxhiu said, the Serbs will awaken from their moral
slumber, but ``we Albanians will never forget what has happened to
us, and it will be very hard to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the popular Restaurant Arbi, its espresso
machine ceaselessly exhaling steam and, at night, its bartenders
pouring stiff drinks. Life can be terribly painful and some believe
the best way to look at it is through the refracted light of a shot
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, these same people would have been chatting in
Pristina's crowded cafes like Magic and Hani i 2 Roberteve. Both
places were attacked by the Serbian paramilitary. The young actress
Ardiana Abdullah was killed with a machine gun, said her friends,
now in exile here.
</P>
<P>
   Migjen Kelmendi lost a cousin in one attack and expected that he
would soon be among the slain. His face is well known, as are his
opinions. He is a writer. He once sang in a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``This phenomenon of emptying a city and pushing people out of
their lives _ this I had only seen in movies,'' said Kelmendi,
sipping coffee at Restaurant Arbi.
</P>
<P>
   He used the words ``holocaust'' and ``genocide'' in his
descriptions, but then regretted it and asked forgiveness. These
are terms others reserve for their own catastrophes and he worried
that the Kosovo Albanians' plight did not yet measure high enough
on the calibrations of human misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel I have had death as close to me as my skin or my
T-shirt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clatter of silverware and plates, he told his story,
and it was not an uncommon one. He went into hiding after the first
NATO airstrike. Six days later, the Serbian paramilitary came into
his Pristina neighborhood and ordered everyone to leave in three
minutes. Fear had been joined by chaos. The soldiers marched
thousands of people toward a train station. Kelmendi pulled a cap
low on his forehead, trying to conceal his familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scene was biblical, you could say,'' he continued. ``We
were marched at gunpoint through the center of town, and I will
especially remember that our Serbian neighbors who saw this were
indifferent. No one asked: What are you doing to these people?''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that 7,000 ethnic Albanians were packed into the 20
cars of a passenger train. The border was only 50 miles away but
the journey took six hours. The train kept stopping, and when it
did, the air became as still as the locomotive. People gasped and
collapsed. Parents pleaded for water for their children. At least
two old men died.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want, I could also tell you about conditions at the
refugee camp at Blace,'' he said, referring to his first days in
Macedonia. ``But maybe this is enough horror for now.''

</P>
<P>
   A few tables away sat Vesel Nuhiu, dean of the philology
department at the ethnic Albanians' underground university in
Pristina, founded after the Serbs stripped Kosovo of broad autonomy
in 1989. He was immaculately dressed in the only shirt and sport
coat he left with. His family had five minutes to pack after the
paramilitary arrived with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to describe the madness of such a thing,'' he said.
``We were with a colleague of mine from the faculty and we agreed
to go to Tetovo together. But in the chaos we were separated almost
immediately. I was lucky to leave with my car, though at every
intersection, the police asked for 100 or 200 Deutschmarks (roughly
$55 or $110) or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Tetovo has welcomed the exiled professors and
students, but the school was already overcrowded. Like the Serbs,
the Macedonians disapprove of colleges that teach in the Albanian
language. The university here is tolerated, if not officially
accredited, and its classes are held in basements, garages and
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My department had 70 professors and associates, but I only
know what has happened to five or seven,'' said Nuhiu. ``I just met
one here at the restaurant. Others are a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   People are caught up like corks in a swift current. They once
fit snugly into a bottle. Now the bottle is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Along Marshal Tito Street came Ardian Arifaj, youthful and
serious and angry, the managing editor of Koha Ditore. He had a
paper to put out. He had recovered purpose, but not the place or
the possessions or the people he needed. He felt incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not only a biophysiological concept,'' he said. ``My
life is the place where I grew up, where I live, my desk, my books,
my music, my computer, the people I know and the places I go to
have fun. This is what I am and without it I do not exist. I am no
longer the same as I was. I have lost my personality. And now I am
merely surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pristina has come to Tetovo, but Tetovo can never be
Pristina. Kosovo is home and the ethnic Albanians believe _ or
fervently hope _ that one day soon they will go back.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, they will again share their cities with Serbs, the
neighbors who they say have been so lacking in conscience. Can such
a deep hurt ever heal?
</P>
<P>
   Arifaj pondered this and recounted a story that he heard as a
child:
</P>
<P>
   There was a naughty boy whose father would hammer a nail into a
piece of wood each time his son did something wrong. One day the
boy asked why, and when it was explained, the boy decided he would
behave better. Each time he did something good, he wanted his
father to remove a nail from the board. Eventually all the nails
came out.
</P>
<P>
   Arifaj let a few seconds pass, allowing suspense to precede the
story's moral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the nails were gone,'' he said. ``But the holes always
remained.''

CATROL NATIONALS NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN AND LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Attendance up ENNIS, Texas _ Texas Motorplex owner Billy Meyer said
he is pleased with the growth rate of the Castrol Nationals, which
concluded its third edition yesterday with an announced four-day
attendance of 119,000, up from 112,200 last year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elon Werner, the track's director of media relations, said that
126,350 tickets were sold but that the threat of rain likely held
attendance down.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's attendance was estimated at 36,000. Meyer said
Saturday's attendance was up 18.9 percent and Friday was up 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is the same size as the fall race was in its ninth
year,'' said Meyer, referring to the O'Reilly Fallnationals, which
has a 14th edition scheduled Oct. 21-24. Tough day for Prudhomme
Don Prudhomme's entries, driven by Ron Capps and Larry Dixon, both
lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Capps' struggles continued in his Copenhagen Chevrolet Camaro
Funny Car, even after qualifying second behind John Force. Dale
Creasy Jr. beat Capps in their first-round run, keeping Capps
winless in elimination rounds this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were just too aggressive early in the run,'' said
Capps, who finished second to John Force in the 1998 Funny Car
point standings. ``It's not a front-end down-force problem; it's
the first 200 feet of the track, and it's just that you are trying
to run these cars so hard you lift the front end.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, driving the Prudhomme-owned Miller Lite Top Fuel
dragster, was the top qualifier in the class, but lost traction in
his first-round pass, losing to Allen Hartley. Dixon's loss was the
second time this season he has failed to advance out of the opening
round.
</P>
<P>
   Also losing in Top Fuel's first round were Doug Herbert, who was
coming off a $100,000 victory at Houston Raceway Park two weeks
ago, defending Castrol Nationals champion Joe Amato and
sixth-fastest qualifier Bob Vandergriff Jr. nn

EDITORIAL: THEY DIDN'T LIVE SO LONG FOR THIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 26:
</P>
<P>
   It is thought that as many as half of all women over 65 in the
United States and a third of all men will spend some of their
remaining time in a nursing home. The American population is aging,
and as new assisted living communities draw off the more able and
affluent retirees, and as increased federal funding allows others
to be supported by health care visits at home, nursing homes have
acquired the sickest and most dependent of the old.
</P>
<P>
   Of that concentration of 1.6 million people, less than 8 percent
can bathe, dress, go to the bathroom, move about and feed
themselves without help. Bedded down usually two to a room, they
are cared for at an average charge of about $50,000 per year _
$94,000 in New York City _ enough to impoverish most of them. About
two-thirds end up being welfare cases. The federal government
expects to pay $39 billion for nursing-home care this year. Yet as
every study for decades has shown, great numbers of the old, many
as helpless as babies, continue to be neglected and abused.
</P>
<P>
   Some die of accidents, malnutrition, dehydration, untreated
urinary infections and bedsores that turn into toxic, flesh-eating
wounds. In California, a lawyer who is an advocate for the elderly
charged that more than 3,000 people succumbed to unacceptable care
in 1993 alone. The General Accounting Office, investigating a
sample of those cases, found that in half of them that may have
been true. The majority of nursing homes seem to give good or
decent care. But just last month, the GAO pointed out that
government inspections of nursing homes across the country each
year show that more than one-fourth cause actual harm to their
residents, or place them at risk of serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, says Dwana Pinchock, of the National Citizens'
Coalition of Nursing Home Reform, is that for nurse's aides, who do
most of the bathing, dressing, turning and feeding of patients,
there is often less required training than for a manicurist at a
beauty parlor, and they may be paid less than a beginning caretaker
at the zoo. Another problem is that state and federal governments
have been too lax. Again and again, nursing homes found to mistreat
patients are given time to correct the problems, only to be found
in violation again.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disgraceful dose of misery and death for a generation
that did not survive the Great Depression and World War II to be
treated like this. There are, however, some reasons for hope.
</P>
<P>
   One is the baby-boom generation, whose members, in places like
California, Maryland and Michigan, have begun to complain about the
fate of their parents, aunts and uncles in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the Senate Special Committee on Aging chaired by Sen.
Charles Grassley of Iowa, which keeps prodding the GAO to
investigate, and the Clinton administration to get tougher under
present law. There are signs that the Medicaid and Medicare
authorities are beginning to clamp down on nursing home
performance. Michigan has an initiative of its own, making rules
that have allowed it to force plans of corrective action on homes,
and even impose professional managers on them until they improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome this sort of initiative,'' Grassley said recently,
``and I'm going to be watching this to see if that's something we
can build on.'' Toward a better end.

VENEZUELAN VOTERS OK MEASURE TO CREATE ASSEMBLY TO WRITE NEW
CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Venezuelans Sunday overwhelmingly approved
a government-backed proposal to convoke a national assembly to
write a new constitution. The decision signals the disintegration
of the political system that has been in place here for more than
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half of 11 million eligible voters apparently took
part in the referendum, called by President Hugo Chavez as part of
his plan to install what he calls ``a true participatory
democracy'' in this oil-producing South American country.
</P>
<P>
   That immediately led opposition leaders to question the
legitimacy of the official results, in which more than 85 percent
of those who cast ballots favored a new constitution on the
president's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the outcome of Sunday's vote, combined with the
passage Thursday of a special ``enabling'' law that allows Chavez,
a 44-year-old former Army paratrooper, to rule by decree on
economic matters, significantly strengthens the position of
Venezuela's new leader.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said that was exactly what this country, which
has become the principal supplier of oil to the United States in
recent years, requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to untie the hands of our president and give him the
powers he needs so that he can really govern and make the changes
Venezuela needs,'' Pureza Duenas, a 47-year-old nurse, said as she
waited to vote Sunday morning. ``He can't do that in this fake
democracy we have, in which a bunch of corrupt politicians use a
flawed constitution to hold him in check.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the proposal have expressed concern at Chavez's
behavior since he took office in February, seven years after
leading a violent but unsuccessful coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   That conduct has included making threats to declare a state of
emergency that would give him enhanced powers, expanding the
military's role and announcing that he intends to seek a second
consecutive five-year term of office, something the current charter
prohibits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is right in wanting to correct the many
shortcomings in our institutions, but no single person should be
given absolute power,'' said Luz Marina Rondon, a 42-year-old
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need gradual change, not a radical change, and it needs to
be carried out within the existing system so that the economy and
stability of the country are not damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the attributes and powers of the constitutional assembly
have not been clearly detailed, political turbulence seems likely
to increase, not diminish, as a result of Sunday's vote. Last
month, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that the assembly will
not have the power to dissolve Congress or the court system, as
Chavez had originally proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has given strong indications, though, that he intends to
defy the ruling, which he dismissed last week as meaningless. ``It
would be the same as me decreeing that the sun will not rise in the
morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedures approved by voters Sunday, the
constitutional assembly will consist of 131 members to be chosen in
a special election, likely to be held late next month, in which
candidates apparently will not be allowed to run under party
banners.
</P>
<P>
   Counting from the day it is sworn in, which Chavez suggests
should be July 5, Venezuela's Independence Day, the panel will have
six months to draw up a new charter, which will then be put to a
popular vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin agreed in a telephone conversation Sunday to continue
personal contacts in the search for a solution to the Kosovo
conflict. They spoke as leaders of NATO concluded a summit with
pledges to continue and intensify their air campaign against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Yeltsin initiated the call and had
asked Clinton to place the next one after doing ``some thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader's thoughts were not fully clarified in the
90-minute conversation, the officials said. But after the call they
announced that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott would leave
for Moscow on Monday to consult with Victor S. Chernomyrdin,
Yeltsin's envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day NATO summit, originally called to celebrate the
50th anniversary of the alliance but largely overshadowed by
Kosovo, concluded with bold expressions of solidarity in the
struggle to halt Milosevic's assault on Albanians in Kosovo, and,
in so doing, build a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What NATO did here this weekend was to reaffirm our commitment
to a common future rooted in common humanity,'' Clinton said in his
closing statement. ``Standing against ethnic cleansing is both a
moral imperative and a practical necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders went away declaring that they would succeed against
Milosevic by sticking to their original strategy of an air
campaign. But they vowed to escalate the attacks and expand the
targets.
</P>
<P>
   They left open how long it would take for the air campaign to
achieve their goal of degrading Milosevic's military forces in
Kosovo and forcing him to capitulate. The British foreign
secretary, Robin Cook, declared that NATO would continue ``for as
long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk at the beginning of the summit about when and how ground
troops might enter Kosovo faded, a casualty of opposition within
the Clinton administration and a recognition that the stability of
several European governments, especially Germany and Italy, would
be risked by open discussion of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Reaffirming the primacy of the air assaults, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, said: ``What I think has really come out of
this session here at the summit is a really genuine support for an
intensified air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, ``It's not going to be
easy. It's going to take longer than we would have originally hoped
for, but we shall win.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the steely statements, aides to European leaders said
there was an acute awareness that the escalation of the air strikes
had to bring better results soon. Public support in NATO countries
could easily erode if the war dragged on, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, if the alliance wanted to get the more than 500,000
ethnic Albanian refugees now camped in Albania and Macedonia back
into Kosovo before the onset of winter, the military campaign
against the Serbs in Kosovo had to speed up, several European
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time that the alliance was stressing military
victory, NATO leaders were also trying to push a diplomatic track.
</P>
<P>
   The officials described Russia's efforts to deal with the Serbs
as being in ``good faith'' and that they were interested to know
more about what Chernomyrdin had accomplished in Belgrade during a
visit there last week with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made the point to Yeltsin strongly that he very
much wants to keep the lines of communication open at the highest
level,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the phone conversation, the Russian president described
some of the elements of a possible peace deal that Chernomyrdin had
brought back from Belgrade, according to a White House official who
listened to the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin told us there was a commitment from the Serbs to allow
the return of the refugees and for the Serbs to withdraw their
forces from Kosovo,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was ``not a great deal of clarity'' on what the
withdrawal of Serb forces meant. On another key point, Yeltsin said
that Milosevic had agreed to the deployment of an ``international
presence'' run by the United Nations with Russia as a key element.
It was also not clear whether the ``presence'' meant inclusion of
police, armed observers or soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal described by Yeltsin fell far short of the five
principles that NATO had laid down as the basis for an agreement,
the White House aide said. These include an international military
force, with NATO at its core, that would escort back the ethnic
Albanian refugees once the conflict was over.
</P>
<P>
   An important task for Talbott was to try to determine from
Chernomyrdin how much Milosevic ``was hurting'' from the air
strikes, the White House aide said. This was a key factor in
figuring out how far the Yugoslav leader is from accepting a
diplomatic solution on NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders stressed the need for Russia's help in finding a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The German chancellor said he was meeting with the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, in Berlin this week to talk about a
Kosovo solution and that he understood Annan would then fly on to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invite the Russians to resume their role in putting pressure
on the Serb side to come to a political solution of the conflict,''
Schroeder said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was on the verge of appointing a personal envoy for the
Kosovo conflict, most probably former Austrian Chancellor Franz
Vranitsky, Austrian officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a member of the Milosevic government, deputy prime
minister Vuk Draskovic, said that Russia and NATO could come to a
compromise agreement at the United Nations soon, and urged his
government to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   As it had during the first two days of the summit meeting, the
Kosovo conflict served as the constant current on the last day.
</P>
<P>
   At a special session devoted Sunday morning to the seven states
that surround Serbia, Clinton praised Albania and Macedonia for
bearing the burden of more than 500,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
expelled into their countries by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Albania and Macedonia have welcomed almost a
half a million refugees to their countries _ often, literally, into
their homes,'' Clinton said. ``You have shared what you have,
though the strains are immense.''
</P>
<P>
   The well-being of all Europe, Clinton said, rested on the
ability of NATO and other Western organizations to rebuild
Southeastern Europe. When the Kosovo conflict ended, the region
should aim for similar democratic and economic standards as Western
Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were few specific details about how this would be
accomplished, although several countries in the region called on
Sunday for measures on the scale of the Marshall Plan. The German
chancellor reiterated Sunday that his government was interested in
initiating a ``stability pact for Southeastern Europe'' which would
involve an economic role in the region for the European Union, and
a security role for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton made 11 statements during the three day summit
conference, including several toasts and a question and answer
session at a news conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing remarks Sunday afternoon, he tied together the
idea of a new Europe with the conflict in Kosovo and its refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision of a Europe undivided, democratic, free and at
peace depends upon our constructive commitment to the hundreds of
thousands of poor refugees, so many men, women and children with no
place else to turn, who have been made pawns in a power struggle,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations of all 19 countries included defense ministers.
In interviews Sunday, half a dozen of the ministers said an
important outcome of the summit meeting was the decision to step up
the air campaign with a goal of turning the Serbian people against
their leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at how their positions will be after this
is all over,'' said Hans Haekkerup, the defense minister of
Denmark. ``People are not going to believe in this myth of
Milosevic much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit's communique embraced the idea that NATO remained
open to new members but did not give a timetable for when they
could join.
</P>
<P>
   The communique listed groups of possible new members. In the
first group were Romania and Slovenia, which almost made it into
NATO in 1997 when Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland were named
as new entrants.
</P>
<P>
   In the second group, the communique listed the Baltic states:
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Bulgaria and Slovakia were both
noted for ``positive developments,'' a reference to their moves
toward democratic standards. And Albania and Macedonia, which are
bearing the burden of the ethnic Albanian refugees but have little
hope of meeting NATO's standards, were listed as long-shot
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov criticized NATO for not
extending an invitation to his country to join NATO and showing
little appreciation for Macedonia's efforts to aid the refugees.
``Macedonia has been circumvented and has again been put in last
place,'' Gligorov said.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic political impact of the Kosovo air campaign
prompted Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, to say Sunday that
he would not allow a Senate vote on a resolution authorizing the
president to ``use all necessary force'' to accomplish NATO's
objectives in Kosovo. Lott said that he feared that passage of such
a resolution would give Clinton too free a hand without any input
from Congress, while defeat of the measure could signal a lack of
political support for the NATO effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that Congress do no harm, first,'' said
Lott, appearing on the ABC news program ``This Week,'' speaking of
the resolution sponsored by Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona
and Richard Lugar of Indiana. ``We don't need a divisive debate
that could give aid and comfort to Mr. Milosevic.''

COMMENTARY: DEFEAT'S 19 FATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Public statements conflicted with the private,
unattributable thoughts of celebrants at Washington's NATO golden
anniversary weekend.
</P>
<P>
   How come, I demanded of an armed forces pooh-bah, it has taken
more than a month to get Apache helicopters in position? Didn't
anybody know that only close-in, low-flying aircraft could hit the
Serb killers in Kosovo? What military dunce requested Stealth
strategic bombers to fly halfway round the world and back to carry
out a tactical mission?
</P>
<P>
   The pooh-bah replied: You seem to think the Apache was the
weapon that could have taken out tanks and saved refugee lives in
Kosovo. All wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The little choppers are designed for close support of ground
troops. Spotters give pilots their assignments, he explained; the
pilots dart behind enemy lines, fire their rockets at targets they
can eyeball, and then race back to safety. They are too vulnerable
to roam around looking for targets of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO tank expert agreed. ``You don't need surface-to-air
missiles to defend against Apaches. ``A man with a good arm and a
rock,'' he added figuratively, ``can knock one of those babies
down. Apaches can be most effective against emplacements and small
units, but only as part of a coordinated ground attack. By
themselves, they're no salvation for the Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Scratch one panacea; unless NATO ground troops are ready to move
in, tactical airstrikes will not trouble Serbs now in their second
month of burning villages and systematically expelling the
un-Serbian population.
</P>
<P>
   To the bigger picture: What about massing troops in Macedonia
and in Hungary, as well as in Albania, to threaten a three-front
attack before September's snows that would require Milosevic to
pull his 40,000 Kosovo marauders back to defend Belgrade?
</P>
<P>
   Now you're talking a strategy for victory, said the military
types, but have you checked with the Hungarians about Vojvodina?
</P>
<P>
   I did. Vojvodina, like Kosovo, is a province of Serbia, but on
the border of Hungary and filled with several hundred thousand
ethic Hungarians. If NATO should strike through Hungary, Milosevic
might put those civilian lives at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hungary is overjoyed to be part of NATO, its diplomats
looked pained when asked about Vojvodina. They said that allied
forces would have to strike hard, fast and not only on that front
to reach Belgrade and win the NATO-Serb war.
</P>
<P>
   I just used the verb never uttered by the assembled
Atlanticists: win. Sorry, but winning is not on the table. Among
the NATO Nineteen, defeat may be a rhetorical orphan, but victory
has no father.
</P>
<P>
   The fervent desire is to find a compromise that ceases
expulsions and bombing, moves some displaced refugees back to
southern Kosovo and allows both NATO and Milosevic to claim
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Lie undergirding the deal is already in place: that
ethnic-cleansing was caused by NATO bombing, not the other way
around, and that the creation of a million terrified refugees is no
worse than the NATO punishment intended to bring the expulsion to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   That repugnant rationale for a face-saver is what you hear from
the Russians, who were officially not here, and from the Ukrainian
observers who were. Here's what the code phrase ``diplomatically
involving Russia'' means:
</P>
<P>
   For Serbia, full sovereignty over Kosovo and repair of bombing
damages. For the raped and ruined Kosovars, the right (but not the
incentive) to return, unarmed, under the ostensible protection of
U.N. observers wearing only sidearms and led by Russians. For NATO,
the withdrawal of Serb regular forces but not ``police,'' War
crimes trials will be balanced between low-level Serb paramilitary
and KLA members.
</P>
<P>
   As this sellout was privately being dressed up as ``autonomy for
the Kosovars'' among diplomats, I dropped in on the ceremony that
provided stark contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment for Democracy awarded its highest honors
to the AFL-CIO's Lane Kirkland and to Poland's Lech Walesa.
Together these two anti-Communist patriots fought the Soviet empire
when the weak-kneed were bleating ``convergence.'' Their refusal to
compromise with evil exemplified the leadership that helped win _
the word is win _ the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Will such necessary moral courage skip a generation?
</P>

EX-CON AYALA HOPES TO REBUILD CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago Tony Ayala walked into prison as a rapist and
one of the most talented fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he walked out a changed man, or so he says _ a
36-year-old who wonders if the magic of his youth will be just a
memory when he returns to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   To Ayala, the former is far more significant than the latter:
His principal concern is his performance as a person, not as an
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, it appears Ayala has come a long way since New
Year's Day of 1983, when he raped a female neighbor in Paterson,
N.J., while on heroin and alcohol, substances that ruled his life
at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who was on probation at the time of the rape for beating
a woman and breaking into a San Antonio home, was sentenced to 35
years. He was released after 16 for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Ayala, with the help of therapist Brian Raditz,
tackled the horrors of his own troubled childhood _ he was sexually
molested by a male friend of the family _ and the despicable person
he had become.
</P>
<P>
   After an ongoing series of painful sessions with Raditz, Ayala
insists he has emerged a ``normal'' person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I knew I had to deal with the issue that was tearing
me apart, the issue that got me in prison,'' Ayala said. ``I had to
find out why I committed such a horrible crime, I had to find out
whether I was just an animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made a very clear decision that if I was just a mad dog,
just a sick individual, I didn't want to live. I didn't want to
feel the guilt of knowing I was hurting people. That's when I
sought help from Brian.''
</P>
<P>
   Raditz, a prison therapist who became a close friend and now
Ayala's manager, said Ayala worked as hard on dealing with his
demons as he once did in the gym and believes Ayala now has ``a
great handle on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no doubts that his patient is ready to return to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had masked a lot of fears, a lot of pain,'' Raditz said.
``He's developed significant insights into who he is. And then he
took it a step further: He shared his insights. He became a peer
counselor in the prison system and, the last two years, they've
brought in students from the outside for his seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should feel proud of himself. He's come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ayala doesn't see boxing as his essence, it is important
to him.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to prison he was 19 years old, the WBA's top-ranked
junior middleweight and 22-0 (with 19 knockouts). It appeared the
next step was superstardom and untold riches.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was gone and he was left to wonder how great he
might've been. Now, at an age when the careers of most fighters are
winding down, he wants to find out whether it's too late finish
what he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some unresolved issues . . . with boxing, that I want
to be done with,'' said Ayala, who also freely admitted that the
prospect of a few big paydays is another reason he wants to resume
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . A lot of dreams were dashed because of what happened.
This is a way of affirming what I've believed about myself. I was
compared to some great, great fighters, and I don't know if I
belong in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   How good Ayala might be is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently remained in good shape in prison. He claims he can
do 300 pullups, 300 pushups, 300 dips and 2,000 crunches and run
eight miles. However, he weighs at least 20 pounds more than the
junior middleweight limit of 154, the weight he'd like to get down
to.
</P>
<P>
   The first significant test will be in the gym. Ayala, who will
be trained by his father, Tony Sr., as he was before his
incarceration, said he plans to begin training immediately and
fight this summer.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't work out, he won't be heartbroken.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to die a better person than I was,'' he said. ``. .
. . I know a lot of people will measure my success on whether or
not my comeback in boxing is a success. The fact is, I'm already
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived 16 years in prison, I'm not out of control, I've
gained insights of who I was, and I have no desire to go out and
drink or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, quote, unquote, normal.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Juan Carlos Ramirez will replace Wayne
McCullough as the opponent of WBC super bantamweight champion Erik
Morales on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough was injured during sparring.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is 17-1 but has only seven knockouts, which means he has
no power and will be overwhelmed by the unbeaten and immensely
talented Morales. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Former three-time flyweight champion Michael Carbajal continues
his comeback against former contender Oscar Andrade on May 8 in
Miami. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Don King has weighed in on the open-scoring issue, saying boxing
can't survive without it.
</P>
<P>
   Don King speaking on salvaging the integrity of the sport? Does
anyone have a problem with that? . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Sharmba Mitchell-Reggie Green fight on Saturday provided
evidence that open scoring is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell knew by the 11th round that he would win if he avoided
a knockout. Thus, he cruised the final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was robbed of a good finish,'' said Harold Weston,
Green's promoter. ``Sharmba did nothing in the last two rounds.
Open scoring is just a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston was biased but right. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Olympic teammates and world junior middleweight champions David
Reid and Fernando Vargas have initiated a war of words.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was quoted in a magazine as saying Vargas is ``making
little money, (and) fighting with nobody watching'' and that Vargas
``hasn't been in the ring with anyone as fast or hits as hard as
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas response: ``I respected David Reid before, but now he
wants to open his mouth. Well, I'm going to shut it. I want Reid as
soon as possible. I want to unify the title. If he's any type of
man, he'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't happen soon. That's the kind of matchup
promoters want to build over a few years to maximize return.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, a resident of Oxnard, is expected to headline an HBO
``Boxing After Dark'' show on July 31. His opponent has not been
determined. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Pettway is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The over-the-hill former junior middleweight champion is
scheduled to fight unbeaten IBF welterweight titleholder Felix
Trinidad on May 29 in Trinidad's home country of Puerto Rico with a
possible shot at Oscar De La Hoya hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Trinidad will be motivated?

`RESURRECTION' UNEVEN AT TIMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CHARLES WARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ From preparation to performance, Houston Grand Opera's
latest premiere seemed destined to succeed. In the end,
Resurrection by American Tod Machover foundered on its
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   The opera seemed to have it all: A potent story of spiritual
rebirth from Leo Tolstoy's last novel. A first-class production
capped by a visually chilling evocation of an ice-bound Siberian
winter. Two fine young singers as the prince and the prostitute. A
performance with the sure imprint of Houston Grand Opera's new
music director.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, there was a treacly conclusion almost straight
from the 1960s peace movement and with no more depth than We Shall
Overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrection is HGO's 24th world premiere and the 14th for the
main company, all since 1974. In intention, realized at many
moments Friday at the Wortham Theater Center, Resurrection
fulfilled the current aesthetic of HGO general director David
Gockley: producing works that potentially can have broad public
appeal and, therefore, justify presenting them again quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Machover has created a score driven by insistent, restless
rhythmic energy (an acquaintance likened the surging orchestral
opening to the beginning of Bach's St. Matthew Passion). Constantly
shifting meters created urgency while avoiding the monotony of a
Philip Glass work.
</P>
<P>
   The music was fundamentally tonal with dissonance used liberally
for mood and effect. For moments of quietude and reflection, mainly
arias and duets, Machover opted for an overpared harmonic language
almost nave in its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Being best known for his work in electronics (The Brain Opera
and hyperinstruments), Machover combined a traditional opera
orchestra with electronics. They enhanced the sound overall, added
color and occasionally created atmosphere by themselves. The
blending was effective and completely unself-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   A troubling note, however, was the periodic amplification of the
singers. The ``general vocal enhancement,'' as HGO described it,
was used when the orchestra was playing ``at its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Partial justification would be the awkward set that pushed
singers to the rear and sides of the stage, or in between two slabs
of ice. Still, with an orchestra of only 32 acoustic instruments
and three electronic keyboards, the choice must be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy told the story of a young Russian noble, Prince Dimitry
Nekhlyudov, who meets the orphan Katerina Maslova living with his
aunts. The two young people are initially attracted; later, when
the prince returns from army duty, he forces a sexual encounter
(vividly simulated in this production) and impregnates her.
</P>
<P>
   He goes on his libertine ways until he serves on a jury that by
chance is judging Maslova for her part in a murder-by-poison plot.
When the jury botches the verdict and Maslova is sentenced to eight
years in Siberia, Dimitry pledges to free Maslova and marry her. He
sells everything, dismisses marriage to Princess Sofia Korchagin
and sets out to gain Maslova a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   He does, but when he brings it to Maslova in Siberia, he finds
she has fallen in love with a political prisoner, Peter Simonson.
They want to marry but she will do so only with the Prince's
blessing. He gives it and, in doing so, finds himself freed to
pursue life anew.
</P>
<P>
   During the preparation of the two-act Resurrection, the
dramaturgy was put through several operatic wringers by HGO music
director Patrick Summers, seasoned theater director Braham Murray
of Manchester, England (in his professional opera directing debut),
and the rest of HGO's artistic staff.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the bitter consequences of their one-time
sexual encounter eventually transforms both people became what
Murray calls ``the spine.'' The narrative was unveiled in a tightly
focused sequence of scenes, some with flashbacks (as in the novel).
</P>
<P>
   It all should have worked except for the tone of the libretto by
Laura Harrington, with extensive reworking by Murray. It had the
flatness of ``I'm OK, you're OK'' sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Left out was poetry. The opera Harvey Milk by Stewart Wallace
proved that political windbagging doesn't work in opera;
Resurrection shows that sentimental moralizing doesn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was fatal in the final scene when people chattered on
about how ``the world is changed by one man to another.''
</P>
<P>
   In carefully developing his work, Machover had pointed it deftly
toward the end. He created many fine moments, particularly the
humorous dinner scene when Princess Korchagin tries every which way
to seduce Dimitry. A finale of soaring lyricism enhancing words of
soaring idealism would have made for a triumphant evening. It
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are a large number of secondary and tertiary
roles in Resurrection, there are only two principal ones, sung very
well by products of HGO's Houston Opera Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Baritone Scott Hendricks, a current studio member, moved from
his understudy position to the lead late in the rehearsal process.
As he did in a smaller role in the HOS's spring staging of
Monteverdi's Orfeo, he scored a big success.
</P>
<P>
   Handsome, with strands of hair falling down over the right side
of his face, Hendricks was preeningly good as the arrogant, lustful
prince. On the other hand, the earnestness of the transformed
prince was a little labored.
</P>
<P>
   He sang as a person with a future: a rich sound, even, unforced,
unstrained at its top, capable of an almost animal vocal intensity.
If carefully shepherded in the transition from the studio to the
real world, he could have a major career.
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, a studio graduate, equaled
Hendricks' challenge with ringing tone and great ease. The range of
her emotional expressiveness was somewhat constricted for a
character who turned to prostitution after the prince's rape, only
to be reawakened to true charity during the march.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other singers and their multiple roles, Judith
Christin was humorously playful as Princess Sofia Korchagin. As
Peter Simonson, tenor Raymond Very, an opera studio alumnus, was
strongly impassioned as he implored Dimitry for Maslova's hand.
Mezzo-soprano Katherine Ciesinski was regally icy as Dmitry's aunt
Sofia Ivanovna.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, conducting his second opera as HGO's music director,
was at ease with the rhythmically complex score. (He did have to
restart the piece a few moments into the performance when a dimmer
switch failed to function, a company representative said.)
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Grand Opera Orchestra, which is replacing the
Houston Symphony as the opera's ensemble over several seasons,
played satisfactorily. A group with more experience playing
together and playing such complex music would have made the
complexities seem clearer. One of Summers' challenges is to create
such an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's experience showed via deft touches and an easy fluidity
in the movement. The brutality during the march to Siberia was
particularly frightful.
</P>
<P>
   In the jury scene, however, he was hampered by the hulking
blocks of seats for judge, jury and prisoners (which moved away for
the flashbacks). They pushed the singers far enough back into the
rear and sides that only Hendricks, DiDonato and Dale Travis (the
court president) could be heard easily.
</P>
<P>
   The production itself was handsome but spare. When the curtain
went up for Act Two, the blinding whiteness of the Siberian winter
provoked instinctive applause. If only the entire work could have
engendered similar spontaneity at the end.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Four days before the shootings, the principal
of Columbine High School, Frank DeAngelis, told his students at an
emotional pep rally in the gym that he did not want to bury another
young person. With the prom set for the next night, Saturday, he
implored them not to drink, or drink and drive, or put themselves
at risk in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to attend another memorial service,'' he had
said, recalling students who had died in car accidents, including a
baseball player he had coached and two girlfriends of his teen-age
daughter. ``I do not want to put up another memorial plaque.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said he told them, ``I want to see all your smiling
faces here on Monday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday morning, after a weekend in which not so much as a
fender bender was reported, the principal said, ``One of the
students came up to me and said, `I think all our smiling faces are
here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis was talking by telephone from his home on Saturday,
only hours after he had attended one funeral, and two days before
he would attend four more. All were for victims of the shootings at
Columbine on Tuesday that left a teacher _ DeAngelis' close friend
William David Sanders _ and 14 students, including the two teen-age
suspects, dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the shootings, the visible presence of the
police investigation has taken center stage, with briefings by law
enforcement officials and news conferences with the governor, the
district attorney and the superintendent of Jefferson County
Schools.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis, 44, has been meeting with his faculty and students,
paying his respects to the families of the victims and, in the few
private moments he has had, anguishing over the young people, and
the friend, he has lost.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said that he had asked two aides to handle the press.
``My first priority is my faculty and kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, DeAngelis has no explanation for the actions
of the two suspects, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. ``I'm still
baffled by it all,'' he said. ``I cannot explain what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike everyone else, DeAngelis was in charge. Columbine was
his school. He had started there as a social studies teacher in
1979, and worked his way up, first to dean of students, then to
assistant principal and, in 1996, to principal.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were his students. ``I knew them
by name and by face,'' he said, but he could not remember any
dealings with them.
</P>
<P>
   After shepherding a group of students to safety outside the
school amid the gunfire on Tuesday, and then maintaining a vigil
into the night for those trapped inside when police would not let
him re-enter, DeAngelis faced his faculty the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized,'' he said. ``I stated, `I'm so sorry for what
you are experiencing, for what you went through with this tragedy.'
I told them, `Right now I'm feeling guilty. I've asked myself I
don't know how many times in the last several hours if there was
anything I could have done to prevent this.' I said, `I'm sure some
of you are feeling that too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They cried together, he said. ``I told them how proud I was of
each and every one of them for putting their lives on the line for
our students.''
</P>
<P>
   From that meeting, one of his assistant principals drove
DeAngelis to a nearby church to address the community, parents and
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what to expect,'' he went on. ``I was concerned
that I had let them down. Here I am the leader of this high school,
with over 1,900 kids, this fantastic community, a leader in our
school district, and I just felt that I had let everyone down, and
I wasn't sure if I was going to be accepted. I was worried that I
had disappointed people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was encouraged when two seniors, Kelly Beers and
Kelly Dickson, ran up and hugged him when he walked up and took his
place in the group of administrators on the stage. He awaited his
turn to speak. ``They announced, `Here's the principal of Columbine
high school,' and they gave me a standing ovation,'' DeAngelis
said. ``I just broke down.'' He was so overwhelmed, DeAngelis said,
that he turned his back to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just overtaken by emotion. I got rejuvenated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, DeAngelis focused on the students. ``I told them
how proud I was of them,'' he said. ``I told them that I've been
proud of Columbine for 20 years, that I have never been prouder of
these students than I am now for what they have done. We've heard
stories of students stopping to help other students, of two
students administering first aid to one of my teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, DeAngelis recalled how on Tuesday morning he
had walked out of a meeting in the school, and into an eerily quiet
north hallway. Suddenly, his secretary, Susan White, came running
out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``She said there was a shooting downstairs in the cafeteria. I
said, `I don't believe it. Call 911.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His secretary ran back into the office, leaving DeAngelis alone
in the hallway. ``Then I noticed the gunman coming down the hall,
firing his weapon,'' he said. ``I said, `I'm dead, my time is up.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In that same moment, DeAngelis said, he heard voices and
laughter around the corner. He ran down the hallway and found a
group of about 20 girls, oblivious to what was happening, heading
from the locker room to gym class. DeAngelis said he herded the
girls into a locked storage room in the gym, assuring them that
they were safe and that he would be back to get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went outside to try to see what was happening,'' DeAngelis
said. ``It was then that I saw fire alarms had gone off, kids
exiting the building, teachers helping kids out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of us went back in to get the girls out of the storage
room. We got the girls outside to the park'' across the street, he
said. At that point police warned everyone to stay out of the
building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when he got to the park, the principal said, and
possible suspects were named, that he realized the awful
possibility: The gunman he had seen might be one of his own
students.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said he waited outside for the next nine hours,
drawing maps of the school for the SWAT teams, sharing information
with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point when a tank is moving down Pearce Street
with the SWAT team,'' he said. ``I just looked up and there were
helicopters hovering around and ambulances. I just thought to
myself, `This is only the beginning of this nightmare.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, DeAngelis sounded exhausted and
grief-stricken, but determinedly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe there's such a strong foundation, it will
continue to be a great high school,'' DeAngelis said. ``There's
just a lot of loving and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   He had 12 funerals before him, the friends and families of the
dead to console, the wounded to visit in the hospital,
investigators' questions to try to answer. He has a school to lead,
even if, with Columbine closed indefinitely, he will be doing it
out of a neighboring high school. And he has a family of his own.
In addition to his 15-year-old daughter, Hayley, DeAngelis, a
native Coloradan, has a wife, Cheryl, and a son, Bryant, 24.
</P>
<P>
   His teachers will return on Tuesday, his students on Thursday.
Together, DeAngelis said, they will figure out how to finish the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I've said, why were the 15 killed?'' the
principal said. ``Why? Life is so unfair. But I've also felt that
tough times make us tougher people, tough times challenge us, tough
times teach us how to get it done. Somehow I'm getting it done.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Only four days shy of his 48th birthday, Dale
Earnhardt may be past his prime at most NASCAR tracks. But he's
still ``The Intimidator'' when it comes to restrictor-plate racing
at the two superspeedways.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earnhardt was the dominant driver for most of Sunday's DieHard
500, guiding his Goodwrench Monte Carlo to victory in front of more
than 175,000 spectators at the Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my kind of racetrack,'' Earnhardt said. ``The crew
needed this win, and it's a special win for (crew chief) Kevin
Hamlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the 72nd Winston Cup victory for Earnhardt, a
seven-time series champion. But it was the first for Hamlin, who
took over as Earnhardt's crew chief midway through last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Hamlin said. ``Dale is absolutely the greatest at
restrictor-plate racing. He drove the heck out of that car today.
He is unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt led the most laps, but he fell back to 16th after a
pit stop under a caution with 40 laps to go. He quickly moved up
and took the lead for good with 14 laps left in the 188-lap event,
holding off Dale Jarrett and Mark Martin at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't know who would work with who all day out there,''
Earnhardt said. ``I moved up and was going to stay in second
(behind Jarrett) until the last lap or two, but they all started
jockeying around behind me, and I got an opportunity to go to the
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, Jarrett and Martin pulled away from the pack during
the last two laps, but Earnhardt finished .137 seconds ahead of
Jarrett (about half a car length) when Jarrett tried to go inside
to pass him at the line. Martin finished right behind Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the master at restrictor-plate racing,'' Martin said of
Earnhardt. ``He's the best I've ever come up against.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin felt he could have made a run at Earnhardt if the
drivers behind him _ teammates Bobby Labonte (who finished fourth)
and Tony Stewart (who was fifth) _ would have stayed in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we were catching the leaders,'' Martin
said. ``It was shaping up to be extremely exciting at the end, but
I lost my pushers when Bobby and Tony got hung up side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, too, thought he might have won had more than one car
been behind him to help push him in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only Mark behind me, I knew my chances were slim, because
Earnhardt is so tough at this place,'' Jarrett said. ``You have to
have some help, especially against Dale. I don't care to have him
in front of me or behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said he tried to slow down to put some distance between
his Quality Care Ford and Earnhardt so he would have a chance to
get enough suction from the draft to shoot past Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dale's hard to pass because he knows where to put that 3
car in the draft,'' Jarrett said. ``I would pedal back (let off the
throttle) to maybe get a push from Mark, but Dale was smart enough
to pedal back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a record ninth career victory for Earnhardt in
restrictor-plate races, which were instituted in 1988 at Talladega
and Daytona to try to slow the cars by limiting air flow into the
carburetors.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a record 12th victory at Talladega for Earnhardt _
eight Cup races, three IROC wins (including Saturday) and one Busch
Grand National victory. But he also has had his low moments at
NASCAR's fastest track.
</P>
<P>
   He was burned on the face last year when his car caught fire
after crashing with Bill Elliott's in a multiple-car accident. And
the worst injury of Earnhardt's career came in 1996 on the 2.6-mile
tri-oval when he suffered a fractured sternum and scapula because
of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love-hate situation for me here,'' Earnhardt said. ``I
like going fast and using the draft, but I've had two serious
crashes here that broke me up pretty good and burnt me up pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first victory for Earnhardt since his dramatic
win in the Daytona 500 to start the 1998 season. He was second to
Jeff Gordon at Daytona this year, but he has struggled everywhere
except the two restrictor-plate tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona last year and Talladega on Sunday are the only two
victories for Earnhardt in the last 101 Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things are going to turn around for us now,'' he said.
``We have a brand new car going to California (next weekend). If it
doesn't run well, it will be the driver's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt managed to avoid the one major accident of the day
when eight cars were involved in a crash on lap 49 after Mike
Skinner and Tony Stewart bumped on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was one of the cars involved when he was T-boned by Rusty
Wallace. Gordon finished 38th, and Wallace finished 41st.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Earnhardt from 15th to a tie for ninth, with
teammate Skinner, in the points standings. Earnhardt still hopes to
pass Richard Petty and become the first driver to win eight Winston
Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing for the points is what this is all about,'' Earnhardt
said. ``We have a lot of things going on now that will make us
better everywhere. We still have time to climb back in this thing
and make a run at that eighth championship.''

BASEBALL COLUMN: BEHIND MEMORY'S VEIL, STILL LARGER THAN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through smooth, singular voices Joe DiMaggio was most
artfully remembered on Sunday. Bob Sheppard recited the last
lineup. Paul Simon sang a fond farewell. The grainy black-and-white
video-screen images paled in competition with recollections of the
way things were, or we wished them to be.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have blooper videos when DiMaggio played, or 24-hour
cable sports news. They didn't have cameras trained on the dugout
to record for posterity every eruption of ire. The images are
spare, the memories select. Yogi Berra said he couldn't recall the
Yankee Clipper having ever made a mistake. Jerry Coleman thought of
one that DiMaggio had made, quickly realized and corrected, in two
simple steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught a fly ball and thought there were three outs,''
Coleman said Sunday before DiMaggio's monument was unveiled, and
the Yankees' center fielder, Bernie Williams, took his mystical cue
and drove in the winning run in a 4-3 victory over Toronto at
Yankee Stadium. ``He took two steps with his head down and then
reacted immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Coleman said, DiMaggio threw to the right base,
a perfect strike.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio was the last of his kind, a gifted American
original who was mostly filtered through radio, immortalized in
print, perfected by memory. Long into retirement, right to his
death, he worked obsessively at insulating himself from the
double-edged sword that often accompanies contemporary fame.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the camera, the bigger the blemish. When DiMaggio
played, there were a dozen newspapers in New York City, but there
were also private places where the public eye could not go. Hank
Bauer stood in the clubhouse Sunday and pointed to where DiMaggio
had once sat, in the vicinity where Tino Martinez now sits. He
recalled how DiMaggio used to spit between closed teeth on the post
that is no longer there.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say it, another thing to show it. Beyond his
indisputable grace and greatness on God's green grass, DiMaggio
might not have argued with a modern marketing slogan, Image Is
Everything. People who knew him always said that what DiMaggio
feared most was looking bad. He was no child of the television age,
but he married the most famous actress of his time. He learned from
her that the stars of most moving pictures play to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   So, what the heck. Most of the men who played with DiMaggio
didn't understand him or were completely in awe of him. They are
not about to start an argument with Americana. Nobody could seem to
recall on Sunday one time that DiMaggio got picked off first, or
broke in on the ball when he should have broke back.
</P>
<P>
   He was blessed by New York's cardinal and sainted by several
former teammates as gracious and charitable, the ultimate teammate,
a man's man, even though the whispers have always suggested
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Simon slipped into a Yankees cap, lugged his acoustic guitar out
to shallow center field and sang his famous verse about lost
innocence, soundtrack for cinematic drama. For only those touching
moments when the voices of Simon and Sheppard turned a grand old
ball park into a Bronx time machine was it possible to forget that
innocence was lost last week not in song but within the supposed
sanctity of a school.
</P>
<P>
   Those Stadium flags were not flying half-staff Sunday for Joe D.
These are harsher, less private times, when power is visual and
images are unforgiving. It is fair to wonder: If DiMaggio played
under today's ``Truman Show'' conditions, would he have come across
more as Michael Jordan or as Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who has been calling games on the tube since he laid
down his glove, said he believed that DiMaggio, cranky as he was
with the concept of up-close, would have survived quite well under
the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can transfer people decade to decade,'' he said.
``The great stars could handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a Yankees second baseman for DiMaggio's last three
years, joined the team in 1949, a season in which an injured heel
limited DiMaggio to 76 games. There was a weekend in Boston,
though, when DiMaggio dusted off the cobwebs and hit four home runs
that empowered a Yankee sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the difference that year,'' Coleman said, his
point being that the great ones rise to the moment and transcend
their time, and that is why they could operate in any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have Jordan, Gretzky in hockey, and now you have a
quarterback going out,'' Coleman said. ``These people are giants.''
</P>
<P>
   When the venerable Sheppard enunciated the lineups from Game 6
of the 1951 World Series against the New York Giants, all it took
was closing one's eyes to feel as if 48 years had been erased. When
he announced DiMaggio, No. 5, batting fourth, playing center field,
who would have wanted to remember that DiMaggio had even made an
out in his life, much less a mistake?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan went out to global tributes a few months ago. Wayne
Gretzky made Canada cry and the rest of the hockey world sigh when
he quit last week. John Elway will get the forever treatment this
week when he announces he's through. We make the best players
bigger than the game, but Joe DiMaggio, with some stretching of the
truth, has for decades been made to be larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's left and gone away and, in all likelihood, taken the
concept with him.

 &HT;    Smoltz overpowers Marlins in 5-1 win
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Strange things have been happening at night around here,
but by daylight on Sunday, Part III of the Braves-Marlins series
looked much more like you'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   The best the Braves starting staff has to offer this young
season in John Smoltz was significantly better than the best the
Florida staff had to offer in Brian Meadows, who has three of the
Marlins' five wins.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz pitched Atlanta to a 5-1 win, earning his third victory
and helping the Braves take a 2-1 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it would have been a night game,'' Marlins manager John
Boles said. ``So maybe then Smoltz would have gone and played golf
and maybe that would have thrown off his game. He overmatched us,
pure and simple. But he does that to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Tom Glavine loss and the fluky win by Greg Maddux,
Smoltz left little to chance as he plowed through the Marlins
order. He scattered six hits and two walks while striking out seven
to move to 3-0 in four starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Marlins to one run in 7 2/3 innings to beat them for
the sixth consecutive time dating back to June 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team I can go after with my fastball,'' he said.
``There's no, like, setting them up. It's not like facing guys
you've faced for seven or eight years, where you pick up
tendencies. These guys all are hungry to play baseball, just
waiting for mistakes and drilling them. You've just got to make
good pitches to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz made his longest outing of the season, pitching into the
eighth inning with 118 pitches, 81 of which were strikes, before he
was replaced by John Rocker after three consecutive hard-hit balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoltz pitched like every other game he's pitched this year,''
Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``Right on. He was good, really good
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As for coming back to Rocker _ who retired all four hitters he
faced _ in that situation, Cox said: ``I wanted to get him going
again. He struggled (Saturday night) a little bit. He threw the
ball fine today.'' Brian Jordan hit his sixth home run of the year
on the first pitch he saw from Meadows in the first inning with
Chipper Jones on base for a 2-0 lead. That was enough for Smoltz.

 &HT;    Earnhardt captures 2nd win in 101 races
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ The question dogged Dale Earnhardt for more
than a year. Was the seven-time Winston Cup champion washed up, or
would he win again in NASCAR's highest series?
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Earnhardt, only four days shy of his 48th birthday,
proved that he still has some intimidation left, holding off Dale
Jarrett and Mark Martin to win the DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Earnhardt's second victory in his last 101 Winston
Cup starts, and his first since winning last year's Daytona 500,
snapping a 40-race winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt won for a record eighth time on this 2.66-mile,
high-banked oval, giving him nine wins in 46 starts at Daytona and
Talladega, where restrictor plates have been required since 1988 to
curb speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Earnhardt is the best,'' said car owner Richard
Childress. ``If anyone has given up on him, I think they've
probably lost their minds. (Sunday) probably answered a lot of
questions. A lot of people question him and his ability and what
he's got going on. I feel like he can still win anywhere for four
or five years, it just depends how long he wants to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who never led a race this season before Talladega,
led 70 of 188 laps on Sunday, including the final 14. He climbed
six spots in points to ninth place, 315 behind leader Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work on the points, and racing for the points
championship is what it's all about,'' Earnhardt said. ``That's why
you're here. We've had a real poor year so far, but I think it's
going to turn around for us. If the guys make some mistakes, we can
still get up there and race them. The top-five finishes and the
wins are going to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was second and moved to within 40 points of Burton, who
finished 11th. Martin was third, followed by Joe Gibbs Racing
teammates Bobby Labonte and rookie Tony Stewart, who finished in
the top five for the first time in his Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon suffered
another disappointing setback when he was involved in an eight-car
pileup during the 49th lap. He finished 38th and endured his third
DNF in nine races this season, the most since he had five in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having one of those years that everybody has been
waiting for,'' Gordon said. ``It's not because we're not running
good. We're running really good. We're just not having the good
fortune that we've been having and that's what it takes to win a
championship and be consistent. ``
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who started 17th, led 56 of the first 150 laps. But
it seemed he wouldn't be a factor after the final pit stops during
lap 135. Earnhardt complained of mechanical problems on the left
side of his car. His crew also changed four tires, allowing several
drivers to beat him off pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a little extra time,'' Earnhardt said. ``Everything
looked good, so we came out a little further back than we wanted
to, but we had the race car to come back to the front.''
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti was one of several drivers who took only two
tires, enabling him to move from seventh to first after the pit
stop. Andretti led 13 laps laps, before Earnhardt rallied from the
middle of the pack to grab his sixth lead. Michael Waltrip took the
lead only three laps later, but lost it when he fell out of line
and the critical draft.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte and Jarrett combined to lead 23 of the final 37 laps,
but Earnhardt clearly had the faster car down the stretch.
Earnhardt passed Jarrett for the final time on the backstetch of
lap 175, and Jarrett couldn't get enough drafting help from Martin
to mount a serious challenge the rest of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jarrett) kept jockeying around and jumped out of line and
jumped in line,'' Earnhardt said. ``Finally, I got the opportunity
to go to the front. I didn't know if it was the right thing to do.
I was going to settle in there with Jarrett, but they kept racing
behind me and I figured maybe I'd like to be in front and maybe
they'd get to racing each other and help me win.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and Jarrett pulled away from a pack of cars, but
Martin eventually caught Jarrett's bumper. When Labonte and Stewart
fell out of line, Martin says he knew he couldn't muster enough
power to push Jarrett past Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shaping up to be extremely exciting there at the end,
but I lost my pushers and wasn't able to help Dale any by myself at
the end,'' Martin said. ``We would have been able to (pass
Earnhardt) if I wouldn't have lost my partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said help from the two Pontiacs might not have been
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Earnhardt's) sort of the master at restrictor-plate racing,''
he said. ``He's the best I've ever come up against.

 &HT;    McReynolds puts blame on Skinner
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Larry McReynolds, crew chief for Mike Skinner
and the No. 31 Chevrolet, said he was upset at his driver for
causing an eight-car pileup only 49 laps into Sunday's DieHard 500
at Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds took out his frustration on a tow-truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   When Skinner tried to push rookie Tony Stewart's No. 20 Pontiac
into the grass on the backstretch of the 2.66-mile oval, the cars
made contact. The bump sent Skinner's car sideways across the
infield grass, before it caromed back on the track, collecting the
cars of Jeff Gordon and Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds says his driver made the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll walk off the side of a mountain for the driver I work
for,'' McReynolds said, shortly after the accident. ``But I'll also
put him in his place when he's wrong. He's like the kid that's in
trouble. He better hope this race lasts a long time, because I'm
gonna get him when it's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds got to a tow-truck driver first. When the truck
pulled into Skinner's pit stall to tow the car to the garage area
for repairs, the driver jumped on Skinner's car. McReynolds angrily
pulled him off and pushed him away.
</P>
<P>
   When Skinner returned to the race 29 laps later, he received a
two-lap penalty from NASCAR officials for ``abuse of a tow-truck
driver,'' according to team owner Richard Childress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just trying to get us (to the garage) quick,'' Skinner
said. ``He was just trying to help. He didn't do anything on
purpose. He was excited and stopping and going, and he tore the
nose of the car off worse than it already was. It wasn't his fault.
The guy jumped on the nose of the car and upset some of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   What about teamwork?
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the finish of Sunday's race, John Andretti
screamed at fellow Pontiac driver Stewart for leaving him out to
dry late in the race. When Andretti made a move to challenge the
leaders with less than five laps left, Stewart didn't follow him,
instead hooking up with Ford driver Mark Martin for drafting help.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished fifth for his first career top-five, while
Andretti slipped to ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun, other than John Andretti coming over
yelling at me and asking me what make of car I drive,'' Stewart
said. ``The last time I checked it was a Pontiac. The last time I
checked, Pontiac didn't pay me to run behind their drivers,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton bounces back
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Jeff Burton was 11th, finishing
outside the top 10 for only the second time this season. But Burton
knows it could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the pace laps before the start of Sunday's race, Burton's No.
99 Ford started smoking badly. Burton, who qualified third, pulled
onto pit road to check the problem, so he was bumped to 43rd to
start after the unscheduled pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, crew chief Frankie Stoddard told his crew to
``round up some spare parts.'' The car continued to smoke, but
somehow lasted 188 laps. NASCAR officials inspected the car after
the race to determine what was causing the problem.

CANTTEST (UNDATED) It's an increasingly popular excuse among
today's AIMS-anxious. At the mere mention of the looming state
graduation test, students shriek, ``But I'm a bad test taker!''
Symptoms include blurred vision, stomach pains, sometimes loss of
sleep and bad dreams, and, of course, a bad test grade. And today,
when high school sophomores take the first of the controversial
AIMS tests, some of these symptoms will reach their peaks. BY

TESTPREP (UNDATED) The ink is barely dry on the AIMS forms.
Students who take the test this year are exempt from having to pass
it to graduate. Yet the phone has been ringing for weeks at the
Sylvan Learning Center in the Ahwatukee Foothills. `Parents are

COPSHOOT (PHOENIX) The post-prom party broke up when police knocked

BWAY (NEW YORK) David Ira Goldstein is putting on weight. Not

swelling with pride as he stands in front of the Longacre Theatre,
a landmark of Manhattan's theater district since 1913. On the
stucco wall in front of him is a poster for The Gershwins'
Fascinating Rhythm. Its flashy graphics haven't caught Goldstein's
eye. He's wrapped up in the fine print. One incomplete sentence in
particular has set his pulse racing: ``Subsequent development
production at Arizona Theatre Company.'' It's the first time the
theater company's name has appeared on a Broadway poster. Every

CAMPUS (PHOENIX) A group of Phoenix players _ people with clout and
access to plenty of money _ is proposing a new, four-acre, downtown
campus to house a shelter and services for homeless people. These
services now work out of crumbling buildings, mostly along Madison
Street, where the new campus would be built between 12th and 13th
avenues. The proposed site is a mostly empty, city-owned lot except
for an emergency shelter still operated by Central Arizona Shelter
Services 14 years after it was officially designated `'temporary.''
It remains the largest emergency shelter in the Valley. Members of

 &HT;    Troutman brothers shot dead
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco and Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ R&AMP;B recording artist Roger Troutman and his older
brother Larry, part of one of Dayton's most famous musical families
and pioneers of the famous rock-funk ``Dayton sound'' of the 1970s,
died Sunday morning in an apparent murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Troutman, 47, died at Good Samaritan Hospital and Health
Center. Dayton police said he had been shot several times in an
alley behind the music studios that his family owned.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Troutman, 54, was pronounced dead after police found him
in his car on Harvard Boulevard with an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger, he was unique,'' said Ohio Players drummer and leader
Diamond Williams, a musical contemporary of Troutman's who went to
the shooting site when he heard the news. ``Very, very talented.
The world has lost a truly talented entertainer by another
senseless act.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were part of the Troutman family, which formed the 1970s
band Zapp. The band's self-titled debut album hit the pop top 20 in
1980 and scored a major hit with the song ``More Bounce to the
Ounce.'' Roger Troutman eventually went solo, recording under the
name Roger. He hit No. 1 in 1987 with the single ``I Want to Be
Your Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Troutman had jump-started his career, finding
new audiences with the song ``California Love,'' a Grammy-nominated
collaboration with hip-hop superstars Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre.
Troutman released a greatest-hits album in 1996 and apparently
planned to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Dayton police were called at about 7:20 a.m. to the
alley behind Roger Tee Enterprises Inc. Officers found Roger
Troutman, who appeared to have been shot several times, Sgt. Gary
White said. Witnesses told police the gunman had left in a black
car.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, dispatchers got a call about a car hitting a
tree, White said. Officers found Larry Troutman in the driver's
seat of a black Lincoln. He appeared to have shot himself in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what this is about,'' White said. Witnesses
weren't able to say anything about the dispute. Detectives planned
to interview family members on whether there were problems in the
family or the business.

 &HT;    Flowers serve as lovely, living memorial
 &HT;    Rachel Sauer

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The first person in line had daisies, a great
white bunch of them that grew gradually smaller as each person
passing by took one or several.
</P>
<P>
   The next person had snapdragons, an armful of red and purple
blooms that loked saucy and vibrant against a backdrop of dark
winter clothes, a hovering layer of clouds and immeasurable
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   On down the line, people entering the memorial service for the
12 students and one teacher slain at Columbine High School on
Tuesday gathered one flower, then two, then four, until tens of
thousands of people carried vivid bouquets of life affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having these flowers is so important to helping people
heal,'' said Bic Nguyen, owner of Jade's Floral in Littleton, as
she handed out individual lilies. ``They're beautiful and alive and
help people think about the families and friends who are still
living.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Barbara (Calif.) Flower Growers' Association donated
20,000 individual flower stems for the memorial service and the
Colorado Flower Growers' Association donated 5,000 more, so the
first ones who got to Sunday's memorial service walked through a
canopy of flowers as they entered the parking lot at Mann Theaters,
where the service was held.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of volunteers handed out the flowers, often giving
comforting words to those already crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an incredibly sad situation,'' said Sherie
Johnson, owner of Cobblestone Gardens in Littleton, as she handed
out white carnations. ``These flowers give people joy.''
</P>
<P>
   As people wandered closer to the theater, they often clutched
flowers in one hand and the hand of a loved one in the other. The
flowers were a connection to life, a reminder of growth and
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, many people raised their bouquets over their
heads, perhaps to show the fuchsia and yellow and purple blooms
that beauty can conquer ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   And when the service was over, thousands walked down Bowles
Avenue to the memorials in Clement Park and laid their flowers next
the ones already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Justin Rousselot, 18, who helped hand out
flowers, ``that people need to remember that life can be
beautiful.''

(ATTN: Mich.)  (nk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON and JODI WILGOREN

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Something in Dylan Klebold's voice had
spooked his mother that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goodbye had an edge to it,'' the mother, Susan Klebold,
told a family pastor, describing her son's tone last Tuesday
morning as ``almost fatalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought, maybe he's in a bad mood,'' the Rev. Don
Marxhausen said. ``Maybe he's got a test today or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning, Klebold, 17, and his best friend, Eric
Harris, 18, ambushed their classmates and teachers at Columbine
High School with a storm of gunfire and pipebombs, taking 13 lives
before fatally shooting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's father, Thomas Klebold, 52, a former geophysicist who
runs a mortgage business from his house, told the pastor he had
detected ``this slight tension'' in his son a few days before the
attack. Klebold made a mental note of it and thought he would get
back to it, the pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   These were not the only possible signs of the violence to come.
As new details of the young men's behavior comes to light, a
portrait is emerging of their friendship and of their relationship
with their families. It is a portrait littered with contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Many students in the school have described the young men as
being obsessed with Nazi history, and the police now say that the
suspects planned the attack for Adolf Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold is the great-grandson of a prominent Jewish
philanthropist. His father is Lutheran, and for a time the family
attended a church. At Passover this year, the Klebolds had a seder,
Marxhausen said, and Dylan asked the traditional four questions at
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances of the suspects have said that they detested
athletes because of the way they were treated by them. But Klebold
participated in a baseball fantasy league.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of the Boston Red Sox, he was one of a dozen students who
took part in a fantasy baseball draft party recently, said one of
the participants, who did not want to be identified. In an apparent
display of his penchant for slurs, Klebold called his team the
Border Hoppers, and chose the Taco Bell logo as his team symbol.
</P>
<P>
   They affected the trappings of Goth culture, wearing black
clothing, spouting German phrases, and listening to German
techno-pop. But they were also good students and like hundreds of
other Columbine youths, held after-school jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While Klebold, 6-foot-4 and lanky, was often outgoing, Harris
was much quieter. Other students say Harris often scowled in return
to a greeting.
</P>
<P>
   A former teammate of Harris' in youth baseball in Plattsburgh,
N.Y., said that young Eric had lacked self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really like baseball a lot, but said that his dad
pushed him to play Little League because every kid in Plattsburgh
played it,'' said the former teammate, Brendon LaPier. ``He was the
kind of kid who didn't mind being alone and he spent a lot of time
in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harris family also lived for a time in Oscada, Mich. The
Rev. William Stone, a neighbor there, said he recalled Harris
putting up a basketball backboard in the driveway and playing ball
with Eric and his brother, Kevin, who is two years older. Kevin
would go on to play football for the Rebels of Columbine High. He
was seen as popular, ``just the kind of guy his brother was gunning
for,'' said Steve Berg, a classmate of Eric Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said that the Harris family ``cared for each other,'' and
that the parents ``seemed to enjoy their children.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, Harris lived in a new two-story house at the end
of a cul-de-sac. The Klebold home was much grander, a sleek
glass-and-cedar house that backed up to the spectacular redstone of
Dear Creek Canyon. The Klebolds also had a carriage house that they
rented out.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of both boys, described by friends as decent and
caring people from stable homes, have issued statements of sympathy
over the attack. But the authorities have come to the conclusion
that the parents should have had some idea of what was going on
inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said on Saturday that the
sawed-off barrel of a shotgun and bomb-making materials were
``clearly visible'' in the bedroom of one of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the weapons were in places where stuffed
animals might be found in the bedrooms of other teen-agers. ``The
parents should have known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen, one of the clergymen who conducted a private funeral
service for Klebold on Saturday, said the young man's father told
him he ``felt Dylan was his soulmate, and felt that he knew what
was going on all the time.'' The pastor said the elder Klebold had
told him, `` `I thought I was ready to let him go _ he was a
finished product.'''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the shootings, Mrs. Klebold sent off a deposit
for their son's dormitory room at the University of Arizona, where
they believed he had planned to enroll in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the diary found by the police shows that the two young men
expected to die in the attack they had been plotting for a year, an
act of revenge on the popular crowd they blamed for making them
feel like outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young people who knew Klebold and Harris were
shocked at the shootings. Some friends, however, say they had heard
Klebold and Harris make comments about blowing up the school.
</P>
<P>
   And the two young men, members of a disaffected clique known as
the trench coat mafia, produced a video in school that simulates an
armed attack on athletes. They had a well-known fascination for
death, gore, and Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Harris even maintained a Web site that advertised his
machinations of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to wonder, how could people not have known what was
happening?'' said Debbie Wilder, 38, who lives a few doors from the
Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend before the shootings, neighbors said the two
young men had made such a ruckus smashing glass in the Harris
garage _ making shrapnel for bombs, residents now suspect _ that
the noise disturbed children playing in the nearby cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think you'd be aware that kids are building
bombs in your house,'' Mrs. Wilder said.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, Harris posted violent threats. He had also
mused about killing large numbers of people in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the law, if you don't like it, you die,'' he had written.
``If I don't like you or I don't like what you want me to do, you
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brown, who said his son, Brooks, a fellow student, had
been threatened by Harris with menacing messages on the Internet,
says he took a 14-page printout of the rantings to the police. The
sheriff's department acknowledged receiving a report about Harris'
writings, but said that no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold had a fondness for role-playing games and the
violent computer games Doom and Quake. They listened to the
sado-masochistic tinged music of German techno-rock. They were
arrested last year for breaking into a car to steal tools, and were
placed in a diversion program for juveniles, where they earned high
marks in an evaluation for being bright and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   They were also good students who held jobs and caused no grief
to school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lau, who owns Blackjack Pizza, where the two young
men worked three to five nights a week, said they always showed up
on time and worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for answers and looking for answers,'' Lau
said. ``There's no clear answers. It's going to haunt us _ it's
going to haunt me for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Valentine, who runs a computer store in Littleton, said
Klebold had applied for a job, sending a resume that claimed he
``built my personal computer and helped build those of friends and
family.'' He said he offered the young man a job _ ``He has all the
right stuff to be a technician'' _ but that Klebold failed to show
up on his first day.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stair, who was a member of the trench coat mafia before
graduating from high school last year, said he chatted with Klebold
and Harris last fall in a car outside the school, as they smoked
cigarettes during lunch period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about being hassled by the jocks,'' Stair
said, saying that athletes in the school often picked on Klebold
and Harris, among other students deemed unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of the Class of '99 at Columbine High School
appears to be a striking example of the marginalized status of
these two young men. In a sea of mostly smiling faces, Klebold and
Harris, heads bent and eyes a bit downcast, are as far toward a
corner as they can be _ quite literally on the fringes of the
crowd.

LAKERS IN MUST-WIN BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Out of psychological necessity as much as anything,
the Lakers have dismissed the importance of wins and losses in
favor of accentuating simple progress. But now comes the brutal
reality. Tonight's game against the Rockets is an indisputable
must-win.
</P>
<P>
   For the hope of home-court comfort in the playoffs. For what's
left of their confidence. For their sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, we need every win, man,'' Derek Harper
said. ``It's not one particular win. We need a win, period. You
start losing, it snatches the air out of you. Winning sort of fills
you up a little bit, makes you feel better about your team and
yourself. You gain confidence from winning.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Lakers need to reassert their ability to
beat quality opponents. Losers of five of their last seven, the
Lakers have beaten just two teams with winning records in the last
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But this game has much more at stake. The Rockets and Lakers are
almost assured of meeting in the first round of the playoffs as the
fourth and fifth seeds in the West, and Houston has a tenuous hold
on the higher seed.
</P>
<P>
   A win, and the Lakers put themselves in control of home-court
advantage. A loss would be their third straight, and that streak
could easily reach five with games against Portland and Seattle
coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go in there and play well,'' Shaquille O'Neal said.
``We match up pretty well with those guys. We're a similar team.''
</P>
<P>
   More similar than either would care to admit. As are the Lakers,
the Rockets are a mess. They've lost three straight, including
losses to two of the league's worst teams _ Dallas and the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   These are two desperate teams meeting in a playoff prelude with
playoff implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very big. I don't think we can really understate how
important this game is,'' Derek Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   But a must-win? He wouldn't go that far, at least not out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really all about wins and losses at this point,''
Fisher said. ``We've pretty much solidified a fourth or fifth
(seeding). It's about how we're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, horribly. And with just five games left to reverse the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ourselves as a basketball team,'' Harper
said. ``I don't think the cohesiveness is where it needs to be for
us to be successful. Say what you want, you don't have to sleep
with each other, go to bed with each other, but you need to be tied
together as a group. So where it is, I'm not sure. All of that
aside, we've got to find a way to get things turned around, find a
way to get back on track and win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Reserve swingman Ruben Patterson skipped
Sunday's practice because of an upset stomach and possible flu
symptoms. His status for tonight's game is uncertain.

 LITTLETON, Colo.: their children.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Littleton, Harris lived in a new two-story house at the end
of a cul-de-sac. The Klebold home was much grander, a sleek
glass-and-cedar house that backed up to the spectacular redstone of
Dear Creek Canyon. The Klebolds also had a carriage house that they
rented out.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of both boys, described by friends as decent and
caring people from stable homes, have issued statements of sympathy
over the attack. But the authorities have come to the conclusion
that the parents should have had some idea of what was going on
inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said on Saturday that the
sawed-off barrel of a shotgun and bomb-making materials were
``clearly visible'' in the bedroom of one of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the weapons were in places where stuffed
animals might be found in the bedrooms of other teen-agers. ``The
parents should have known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen, one of the clergymen who conducted a private funeral
service for Klebold on Saturday, said the young man's father told
him he ``felt Dylan was his soulmate, and felt that he knew what
was going on all the time.'' The pastor said the elder Klebold had
told him, `` `I thought I was ready to let him go _ he was a
finished product.'''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the shootings, Mrs. Klebold sent off a deposit
for their son's dormitory room at the University of Arizona, where
they believed he had planned to enroll in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the diary found by the police shows that the two young men
expected to die in the attack they had been plotting for a year, an
act of revenge on the popular crowd they blamed for making them
feel like outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young people who knew Klebold and Harris were
shocked at the shootings. Some friends, however, say they had heard
Klebold and Harris make comments about blowing up the school.
</P>
<P>
   And the two young men, members of a disaffected clique known as
the trench coat mafia, produced a video in school that simulates an
armed attack on athletes. They had a well-known fascination for
death, gore, and Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Harris even maintained a Web site that advertised his
machinations of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to wonder, how could people not have known what was
happening?'' said Debbie Wilder, 38, who lives a few doors from the
Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend before the shootings, neighbors said the two

 &HT;    Memorial attendees urged to turn love, sadness into action

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Vice President Al Gore on Sunday bid farewell
to Columbine High School's dead, issuing a ringing challenge to
parents and schools before a crowd of 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,''
said Gore, in a forceful speech filled with religious references
less than a mile from the site of the worst school killing in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under
threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed
Tuesday when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school
wielding guns and bombs. Authorities believe Columbine students
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then
killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens acted as master of ceremonies during the
75-minute memorial service that included speeches from Archbishop
Charles Chaput, and Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy
Graham. Singers Amy Grant and Michael Smith joined a large bagpipe
band in providing music for the crowd, joining two Columbine
students who wrote a song in honor of their fallen classmates.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd were people who had driven hundreds of miles to pay
their respects. ``It's something that can help us personally by
coming and seeing and sharing the hurt and the pain. It's just
something that struck my heart,'' said Tim Weitzel, who with his
wife, Donna, drove from Grand Junction to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   Owens extended his sympathy to the families of the slain and
wounded, some of whom gathered in front of the crowd, while the
archbishop told them that ``love is stronger than death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Confronted with an unimaginable evil, this community has grown
closer,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation and the world have joined in grieving for the
students of Columbine, Gore said. He asked the crowd ``to feel the
embrace of hundreds of millions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hidden truths of the human condition is that
suffering binds us together,'' Gore said. ``Here in Jefferson
County, the spring has yielded to the cold winter of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked that the shootings serve as a wake-up call for
parents and schools. Decrying the violence and cruelty of pop
culture, Gore said parents must cushion their children against
hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a parent, your children need your attention,'' Gore
said. ``If you are a grandparent, they need your time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy for children to get guns, and schools must focus
on discipline in teaching character, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In his only comment that addressed the killers, Gore called for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have the courage not to look away, either in life or
in death, from those who feel despised or hated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for
more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts
from the popular students at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were not mentioned by name during the service,
although Chaput also asked they be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Graham praised the Columbine community for uniting under the
pain of a tragedy that could have torn it apart. He seized the
opportunity to chastise public schools for being empty of ``the
teachings of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are indeed dangerous places,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens closed the memorial by reciting the names of the 12
students and one teacher killed and releasing a white dove for
each, as many in the crowd wept and light rain fell.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message of hope that was repeated throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is stronger than death _ I believe that,'' Chaput said.
``Love is stronger than death.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Jonathan Cohen, a slender 17-year-old lost in
an oversized sweatshirt, stood Sunday before a sea of silent faces,
closed his eyes, and sang in a clear tenor, ``Do you still hear
raging guns, ending dreams of precious ones?''
</P>
<P>
   In this community torn by violence, many students who heard
Jonathan at the memorial service for the victims of the Columbine
High School shootings knew that he wrote the words from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Jonathan, a junior, was trapped in the school
choir room when the shooting started. His older brother, Stephen,
who accompanied him Sunday on the guitar, had been in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine, rose blood red, heartbreak overflows my head,''
Jonathan sang to the still audience. ``Columbine, friend of mine,
peace will come to you in time.''
</P>
<P>
   As clouds and a cold rain shrouded the nearby Rocky Mountains,
the outdoor memorial service drew 70,000 _ nearly double the
population of the suburban neighborhood served by the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the families of all those who died here, I say: You are not
alone,'' Vice President Al Gore said from a makeshift stage erected
in a movie theater parking lot. ``May you feel the embrace of
literally hundreds of millions who weep with you.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday when religious leaders across the nation tried to
find meaning in a massacre that left 15 people dead, including the
two gunmen, many speakers at the service here cited the example of
Cassie Bernall, a 17-year-old junior. Asked by one of the gunmen if
she believed in God, she answered, ``Yes'' and was shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Franklin Graham, citing her final words, compared her
death to the suffering he had seen among Kosovo refugees on a
recent visit to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of hatred and violence must not be allowed to
gain,'' exclaimed the son of the Rev. Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Although bagpipes played, a religious singer played the trumpet,
and four F-16s scraped overhead in a ``missing-man formation'', the
most remarkable aspect of the huge gathering was the silence. With
ribbons on their lapels in the school colors, blue and white,
mourners wiped tears and bowed heads, holding hands or simply
embracing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it really puts any peace to it, because it's
still so fresh,'' said Taylor Brown, a 19-year-old who graduated
from Columbine last year. ``I'm still in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Many clutched flowers, lilies or purple and white sprays, some
of 25,000 flowers donated by Colorado and California flower
growers. When the Cohen brothers opened the service with a simple
``Hi,'' mourners spontaneously released blue and white balloons
they had been holding. One hour into the service, when a light rain
began to fall, people quietly popped open umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, as Gov. Bill Owens read the roll call of victims, he
released a white dove into the air for each of the victims. For a
few moments, the doves wheeled overhead, then flew away. Columbine,
Colorado's state flower, derives its name from a Latin word meaning
``like a dove.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens read only 13 names, omitting those of the two dead gunmen,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they took far too many precious lives,'' the governor
told the somber crowd. ``But they failed in their goal to kill
hundreds more, and to burn the school to the ground. Behind you
stands the charred remains of Columbine High School. This community
will not be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night at the park across from the school that has
been filled with makeshift memorials, a man brought a sign reading,
``We miss you Eric and Dylan.'' Someone seized the sign from him
and burned it on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for
the spirit of America,'' Gore said Sunday in a rare reference to
the gunmen. ``America is a good and decent place, and our goodness
is a light to all the nations of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several political leaders, including retired Gen. Colin Powell
and most of Colorado's congressional delegation, were on the stage
but did not speak. Those politicians who spoke urged Americans to
spend more time with their children and to purge popular culture of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more raising of children who do not value human life,''
appealed Owens, a Republican. ``No more children forced to grow up
in a culture of death and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Democrat, sounded a similar note, urging as he
gesticulated with his right forefinger, ``All of us must change our
lives to honor these children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a parent, they need your attention, if you are a
grandparent, they need your time,'' he said. ``We must teach them
right from wrong. We must teach them about violence in popular
culture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Clinton appealed to parents, the media,
and the entertainment industry to ``pledge ourselves to the task of
putting an end to the culture of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, Clinton said in his weekly radio address, ``should turn
off the television, pay attention to what's on the computer screen,
refuse to buy products that glorify violence.''
</P>
<P>
   To entertainment industry workers, he said, ``I ask you to make
every video game and movie as if your own children were watching
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Denver, Charles Chaput,
led the gathering in prayer, asking God to ``help us to turn away
from violence and selfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the memorial service, funerals were held for
two slain students, Kelly Fleming and Daniel Mauser. The funerals
were at the St. Francis Cabrini Roman Catholic Church, across the
street from the house of Eric Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 wounded in the high school attack, 11 remained
hospitalized Sunday. Of the injured, one was in critical condition,
six in serious condition and four in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the day of the last scheduled funeral, Columbine
students are to return to school, attending classes at Chatfield
High School, a few miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators, who have already catalogued 2,000 pieces
of evidence, do not expect to release the crime scene until early
May.

   NEW DELHI, India _ A week after the Hindu nationalist-led
government collapsed, India appeared to be headed for its third
general election in three years as the opposition's efforts to form
a new government disintegrated Sunday in acrimony and finger
pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi, the widowed heir to the
nation's political dynasty who actively campaigned to bring down
the government, admitted Sunday that her first attempt to lead the
party back to power had failed.
</P>
<P>
   She was unable to win enough support from other opposition
parties for Congress, which has only about a quarter of the votes
in Parliament, to form a government by itself. And she ruled out
supporting a coalition that would have necessarily included more
than 20 squabbling, demanding parties in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not ready to bargain,'' Mrs. Gandhi said.

<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi's reputation for calm, shrewd leadership was
tarnished in the past week as Congress helped shatter one
government but was unable to put together the shards of the
opposition to form a new one. In what now appears to have been a
bluff, she claimed on Wednesday that she had the 272 votes for a
majority, but confessed Sunday that she had come up with only 239.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who has never held elective office, informed
President K. R. Narayanan of the political stalemate. It is now up
to him to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said there was an outside chance the
president would give the coalition that narrowly lost a confidence
vote a week ago another chance. But so far, that coalition, led by
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, has claimed 270
supporters, still two votes short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely option is to hold general elections since no
alliance of the more than 40 parties in Parliament has mustered a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who resigned on April 17
but stayed on as a caretaker, announced Sunday evening after
meeting with Narayanan that he would call a Cabinet meeting on
Monday morning to discuss the political crisis. He did not say what
action they would take. Nor did he describe what the president had
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said it is likely that the Cabinet will request
dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, and
call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tired and dejected, Vajpayee, 72, pointedly noted that
some in the opposition had claimed a new government would be formed
in five minutes. If there are elections, leaders of the Bharatiya
Janata Party will undoubtedly portray their main rival, the
Congress Party, as a destructive force more interested in coming to
power than in the country's need for political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, a grandfatherly looking man with an understated
manner, is generally thought to be more popular than his party,
which has had trouble shaking its reputation for being anti-Muslim
and, more recently, anti-Christian, in its pursuit of an idea of
India as a nation united by a Hindu way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee has said in the past that his current stint as prime
minister would be his last in government, but on Thursday, during a
somber dinner party at the home of a supporting member of
parliament, he chuckled mirthlessly when asked if he would run
again. Then he fell silent. Munching from a plate of sweets, he
drifted away to another conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If parliament is dissolved, elections must take place within six
months. Pulling off national elections in India _ the world's
largest democracy with more than 600 million voters _ is a costly,
gargantuan task. And because of the timing, voting would either
have to take place in the near future, during the scorching summer
when temperatures routinely top 105 degrees in some parts of the
country, or during monsoon rains that leave parts of the country
flooded, muddy and impassable.

<P>
   The way the last week has played out seems likely to have
damaged the Congress Party politically and created sympathy for the
Bharatiya Janata Party, which lost a confidence vote by the
narrowest margin ever in independent India _ a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   The government's fall came after Jayalalitha Jayaram, head of an
18-seat party from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, withdrew her
support, but Mrs. Gandhi is seen to have encouraged Jayalalitha, a
former actress who is known by her first name, to jump ship by
attending a tea party in her honor, a step that suggested Congress
might be a friendlier port of call.
</P>
<P>
   After Jayalalitha quit, Mrs. Gandhi personally lobbied many
party leaders to vote against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say her advisers badly miscalculated the
degree of support Congress would get to run a government that left
all its allies on the outside looking in. Mulayam Singh Yadav,
leader of a party in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh,
that is a bitter rival of Congress, flatly refused to support any
government that excluded his party. Without his 20 votes, Mrs.
Gandhi's gambit was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Until the current debacle, Mrs. Gandhi had won plaudits for her
restraint in seeking power. Repeatedly, she had stressed that
Congress needed to rebuild its corroded foundations before it took
power.
</P>
<P>
   She had begun installing a younger generation of leaders at the
state level. Attempting to rebuild the party's fractured coalition,
she had pushed through a measure requiring that 53 percent of party
officials at all levels be women, Muslims or low-caste people.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy had seemed to be working. In November, Congress
clobbered the Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections, largely on
the issue of rising vegetable prices.
</P>
<P>
   But some Congress Party officials said that in recent months
party leaders had begun to worry that the Hindu nationalists were
consolidating their hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Prices had come down. Attacks on Christian churches and schools,
which many believed were fomented by groups allied with the party,
had dwindled. The government had introduced a budget that was well
received. And after months of mixed signals, it had pressed forward
with a number of economic proposals to encourage investment and
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   When Jayalalitha's withdrawal deprived the government of a
majority, Congress went into action to insure that Vajpayee's
coalition lost the vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gandhi had played her hand very cooly and unhurriedly in
favor of waiting for a few more state assembly elections,'' said
Pran Chopra, a political analyst at the Center for Policy Research
in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   But this time she listened to advisers who told her that
Congress could win control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very bad advice,'' Chopra said. ``But the advisers were
appointed by her and the responsibility of that advice belongs to
her.''

ENFORCEMENT OF OIL BLOCKADE PRESENTS POLITICAL, DIPLOMATIC RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to change 1995 to 1996; 6th graf to describe how
embargo would increase tensions between Serbia and Montenegro.) (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The mechanics of imposing an oil embargo against
Yugoslavia enforced by NATO warships plying the Adriatic Sea should
be fairly simple, military officials said Sunday. The legal,
political and diplomatic risks are far greater, particularly with
Russia, which has furiously denounced the plan and thus raised the
specter of clashes at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, allied warships enforced such a ban on
arms to all six republics of the old Yugoslavia in the same
Adriatic waters. Some 6,000 ships were boarded and inspected, and
only six were caught trying to smuggle weapons. Arms shipments
overland still found their way into the hands of the warring
factions _ as did oil shipments to Serbia and Montenegro, despite
comprehensive U.N. sanctions that virtually barred all foreign
trade with the oil-starved republics.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban on oil shipments to Yugoslavia that NATO has now
authorized is trickier to enforce. And stopping oil tankers from
countries not party to the agreement, like Russia, is an expansion
of the month-long war with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Sunday sought to dismiss
the Russian threats of war with a verbal wave: ``The Russians,
every now and then, they make phrases which go a little bit beyond
where they should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as forcefully, Solana said on the ABC news program ``This
Week'' that Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's military commander, was
writing a draft plan that considers ``all the possibilities so that
the embargo can be guaranteed not only by NATO and NATO-friendly
countries, but also for others. If it's an embargo, it will apply
to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the embargo is dry up the flow of oil into ports on
the coast of Montenegro, the small republic which supplies its far
larger partner in Yugoslavia, Serbia. The blockade could further
undermine the democratic government in Montenegro by introducing
more tensions into its relations with Serbia. NATO has also ordered
heavier air strikes against overland roads, pipelines and railroads
that carry the fuel to Serbia. ``Without oil, the Yugoslav military
machine will come to a halt and very quickly,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO officials say that with Serbia's two main
refineries knocked out of operation, Yugoslav military officials
are so desperate for fuel that they are siphoning fuel out of the
abandoned cars belonging to refugees, and using it for tanks and
other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence analysts estimate that Montenegrin ports
have unloaded 40,000 to 45,000 metric tons, or about 300,000
barrels, of oil in the past month, undercutting the air campaign's
goal to dry up Belgrade's ability to resupply the 40,000 Yugoslav
troops in Kosovo who are expelling ethnic Albanians and destroying
their villages.
</P>
<P>
   France and Italy, in particular, have raised questions about the
legal justification for mounting a blockade against third-party
countries, as distinct from an embargo restricting only shipments
from cooperating nations. Solana's scenario would cover countries
that do not belong to NATO or the European Union, such as Russia or
Ukraine, whose tankers have unloaded oil in Montenegrin ports since
the air war started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make the choice of a blockade, then we have to recognize
we risk war with a third party who hasn't agreed to the blockade,''
said one French diplomat. ``For that you need a U.N. mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema explained to Italian
journalists Sunday that the embargo by NATO and European Union
countries can be carried out with on-board searches and
inspections. But a blockade, as such, does not exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Norway's foreign minister, Knut Vollebaek, said in an
interview, ``As for third parties, we would like to see a U.N.
Security Council resolution in order to make this binding.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Pentagon official said that while there may not be
a specific Security Council resolution authorizing the ban, ``the
laws of armed conflict'' justify such an embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea acknowledges that ``there would have to be a political
discussion as to who is covered by such a regime.'' And Solana, in
his closing briefing Sunday, made light of objections to the
embargo, asserting that all 19 members would be in agreement on
Clark's draft plan. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's political
arm, is expected to review that plan this week, military officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As outlined now, American and other NATO officials said, the
embargo would not try to exclude all ships from Yugoslav ports.
Instead, NATO would create a kind of seaborne police force to check
manifests and board selected ships to investigate cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Ships caught carrying contraband oil would be turned back or
diverted to other ports, but NATO military officials said the legal
consequences of interdictions have not been worked out. ``There are
some legal questions that have to be answered,'' the Dutch defense
minister, Frank de Grave, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Other military experts said the issue could be rendered moot
simply by the stated purpose of the naval armada. ``The very
presence of NATO ships would be a deterrent, and would induce ships
to go back,'' Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed
Services Committee, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot tell our pilots to fly high-risk missions against
petroleum storage facilities in Yugoslavia, and then let this other
oil creep in through the back door,'' said Warner, a former
secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   At Clark's headquarters outside of Brussels, top aides are
pouring over the details of the operation. Military officials said
they must define where the NATO maritime interdiction force will
operate in the Adriatic and Ionian seas.
</P>
<P>
   Clark must also determine how many ships, helicopters and
surveillance planes, like U.S. Navy P-3s, the operation will need.
Navy officers said that a dozen ships, rotating duty, would likely
be sufficient. Eight NATO ships are assigned to the region now.
</P>
<P>
   A delicate part of the mission would be the actual rules of
engagement. Once NATO affirms a specific plan, a notice would go
out to all international mariners with the rules. NATO warships
would likely establish checkpoints off the Montenegrin coast for
checking vessels.
</P>
<P>
   If ships were suspected of carrying contraband, they would be
boarded and inspected. Allied ships could fire on any vessels that
refused to comply, first as a warning, and then to disable,
violators. Navy officers say there are also nonlethal means of
stopping a rogue tanker dead in its tracks, including devices that
would entangle a ship's screw or rudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tactical sense,'' Adm. Luc Kroon, the Dutch chief of
defense staff, said in interview, ``it's no problem to execute
this.''

NATO VOWS TO PROTECT NEIGHBORS OF YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As bombs rained down on various parts of
Yugoslavia, NATO leaders Sunday promised Albania, Macedonia, and
five other countries neighboring Serbia that the alliance would
fight for them if the conflict spills across their borders and help
them rebuild after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, NATO also announced a further troop buildup in
Albania and Macedonia. And early Monday, bombs rocked the northern
city of Novi Sad, destroying the last remaining bridge over the
Danube River.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hungary, which borders Yugoslavia on the northeast
and is one of three new members of NATO, agreed to allow NATO to
use its air bases to stage some of the bombing raids on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic threatens them for helping us, we will
respond,'' President Clinton said on the final day of the NATO
summit.
</P>
<P>
   During a 60-minute telephone conversation, Clinton urged Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to press Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to comply with NATO demands that he pull out of Kosovo
and allow ethnic Albanian refugees to return under international
military protection.
</P>
<P>
   While again declaring that NATO does not intend to launch a
ground war, officials announced that 4,000 more troops in two
battle groups, one German and one British, were being deployed to
Macedonia to stand ready to go into Kosovo once Yugoslav forces of
Milosevic pull out.
</P>
<P>
   That brings the number of NATO troops in Macedonia to 16,000.
The British defense secretary, George Robertson, said the NATO
force level would grow to 28,000, the number originally planned
under the pre-war Kosovo peace treaty that Milosevic rejected.
Robertson said NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, would study
whether ``further numbers'' were needed.
</P>
<P>
   With the noose around Yugoslavia getting tighter, a high-level
member of the Yugoslav government said people in his country must
realize that ``we are alone'' against the world and accept a
compromise peace plan if one is drafted. Vuk Draskovic, deputy
prime minister and a voice of opposition before the war, said he
expected Russia and the West to work out a settlement under UN
auspices.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Clinton dispatched his top Russia envoy, deputy
secretary of state Strobe Talbott, to Moscow to meet with Yeltsin.
Last week, Yeltsin's Balkan envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin met with
Milosevic. Clinton and other NATO leaders are concerned that a
naval embargo of oil imports to Yugoslavia could risk a high seas
confrontation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO warplanes targeted Serb TV, which was knocked off the
air for the second time in three days. In an airstrike on Friday,
15 people were killed. The station quickly resumed broadcasting.
Missiles also hit the northeastern industrial area of Nis, causing
extensive damage, according to the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
Five other missiles hit a chemical plant in Lucani, about 60 miles
south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   -- Refugees gave more accounts of mass murders by Serb forces.
Richard Redmond, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, said evidence suggests the Serbs are expelling Kosovar
Albanians ``with clinical precision.''
</P>
<P>
   -- During their phone conversation, Yeltsin reportedly briefed
Clinton on the visit of former Russian prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to Belgrade. German sources said Chernomyrdin is
likely to brief key NATO foreign ministers this week. French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in Washington that Russian
participation, under UN auspices, in a Kosovo peacekeeping force,
might offer a possible solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's capital battened down for a third day to
protect the hundreds of officials and dignitaries from 40 nations,
the NATO summit focused on the alliance's eastern and southeastern
borders. The main focus was a meeting with the presidents and prime
ministers of the seven ``front-line'' states that share a border
with Yugoslavia: Albania, Macedonia, Hungary, Bosnia, Croatia,
Romania, and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the group had assured these leaders that it has ``a
direct interest in their security.'' While they are not being given
the same defense priority as NATO members, where an attack on one
is considered an attack on all, Solana said the alliance ``will not
tolerate a threat to their security.''
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of southeastern Europe, public opinion has
strongly opposed the NATO air campaign. National leaders from these
nations, however, have all offered NATO use of their air space,
condemned Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign against
Albanians, and are eager for closer relations with the West. Few
beside Albania and Macedonia are seriously concerned about
Milosevic lashing out at them militarily.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, NATO intends to work out a settlement that will
end the ethnic violence and instability that has plagued the
Balkans for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must make the Kosovo conflict a turning point for
southeastern Europe,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. ``We must
exorcise once and for all the demon of nationalism in that part of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending such conflicts and fostering democratic values is part of
NATO's new ``strategic concept,''a 65-point statement approved
during the summit that aims to take the alliance far beyond its
Cold War defensive posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's role now is not just territorial defense,'' said Cook,
the British foreign secretary. ``NATO's role embraces crisis
management, humanitarian assistance, and peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to reporters, said the alliance would champion
freedom, security, and prosperty in areas remote from its old
western Europe heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be committed to building that kind of future for the
people of central Europe, for the people of southeastern Europe,
and for our other partners going all the way to the central Asian
states,'' he said.

IN NEW YORK SURVIVAL IS STILL HINDERED BY SLOW EMS RESPONSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: This story originally moved 4-18 and was held. It has been
re-edited and is now released) 
(ATTN: Wash.)   By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years after the Fire Department took over New
York City's Emergency Medical Service, fire officials have begun to
make good on some of the bold promises made during their aggressive
campaign to seize control of the beleaguered public ambulance
system.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no hard evidence to show that more New Yorkers who
suffer cardiac arrest _ the most dire and the most easily measured
medical emergency _ are being saved.
</P>
<P>
   When lobbying in 1995 to take the Emergency Medical Service from
the city's Health and Hospitals Corp., fire officials had said they
would apply their management know-how and expertise in maintaining
vehicles to make the emergency service better, faster and more
efficient. They suggested that many more lives would be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Once they took control in March 1996, fire officials bought new
ambulances, moved dozens of paramedics and emergency medical
technicians out of administrative jobs and back into ambulances,
and trained thousands of firefighters to respond to medical
emergencies. The result: the average response time for
life-threatening situations has been cut by more than two minutes,
from eight minutes 58 seconds in 1996 to six minutes 43 seconds
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain whether this swifter response has produced
clear-cut medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, it has not. In 1996, 13.4 percent of people
whose hearts stopped beating reached an emergency room alive, EMS
officials said. In 1997, the rate was 13.6 percent and last year it
was 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fire and EMS officials contend, though, that earlier responses
to life-threatening emergencies may be helping cardiac patients.
They noted that the annual number of cardiac arrests in New York
had declined, to 6,030 in 1998 from 6,969 in 1996. They theorize
that emergency crews now arrive so quickly that they prevent some
patients from ever going into cardiac arrest, when the heart stops
beating properly, usually due to an abnormal rhythm, which can be
caused by a heart attack or underlying heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering their theory, EMS officials said, is a sharp increase
in the number of respiratory arrests they treat each year; by
arriving quickly, emergency crews may be preventing some
respiratory arrests from developing into more serious cardiac
arrests, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're doing very, very well and we're going to
continue to improve,'' Thomas Von Essen, the fire commissioner,
told a City Council committee last month.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent medical experts said, though, that more must be
done to produce a significant increase in the number of New Yorkers
who survive cardiac arrest _ and that some important factors may be
beyond the control of city government.
</P>
<P>
   Response times might have to be pushed much lower before medical
benefits become obvious, many doctors said. People who go into
cardiac arrest must receive medical care within four to six minutes
to have a good chance of surviving, emergency physicians said. That
usually involves cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and, most
importantly, an electric shock from a machine called a
defibrillator to jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander E. Kuehl, who was medical director of EMS in the
1980s and is a proponent of the Fire Department's takeover, said
that average response times would have to go below five minutes for
many cardiac patients to be resuscitated successfully. ``By the
time you get out to six minutes, you're not saving any lives,''
said Kuehl, who is now director of emergency care at the Champlain
Valley Physicians and Hospital Medical Center in Plattsburgh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last few years have defibrillators become portable
and easy to use, and their use has become the key element to
survival. ``If somebody is standing by with a defibrillator when
someone goes into cardiac arrest and the patient is instantly
defibrillated, you can have a survival rate of as much as 70
percent,'' said Dr. Lynne D. Richardson, vice chair of emergency
medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. ``But it drops off
quickly. Once you get over five minutes, it is in single digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Many factors can prevent emergency workers from reaching
life-and-death emergencies quickly enough to apply defibrillation
in time. New York's persistent traffic and its high-rise buildings
add critical minutes to the race to reach people in cardiac arrest.
It is not surprising, medical researchers say, that medium-size
cities and suburban areas produce the best emergency response
times.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs of Seattle, a region noted for advanced emergency
care, firefighters and ambulances get to life-threatening
emergencies within four to six minutes, on average, said Thomas R.
Hearne, director of the King County Emergency Medical Services
Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, where every firefighter is also a trained emergency
medical technician, the average is 4 minutes, 12 seconds, said Bob
Khan, a battalion chief in the Phoenix Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle and King County, a vast suburb of 1.7 million people,
about one-third of the population has been trained in
cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, Hearne said. Through CPR,
bystanders can buy precious time for cardiac patients by
artificially propelling blood to vital organs until a normal heart
rhythm is restored by a defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates from cardiac arrest vary widely, with different
standards and competing claims. Even so, survival rates in King
County are impressive: More than 30 percent of patients in cardiac
arrest are resuscitated and ultimately go home from the hospital,
Hearne said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a 1994 study by three emergency doctors from
hospitals in the Bronx found the rate in New York is only 1.4
percent. The doctors used the same rigorous standard now used by
most medical researchers: A survivor is defined as someone who,
after undergoing cardiac arrest, eventually is discharged, healthy,
from a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that may be inhibiting survival rates in New
York, according to many paramedics, is that they are still not
getting to cardiac arrests quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   In taking over EMS, fire officials promised, in writing, to
achieve a number of statistical goals. Among them was that
paramedics _ the most highly trained emergency workers _ would
arrive at life-threatening emergencies within eight to 10 minutes
90 percent of the time. Last year, they reached such scenes within
10 minutes only 45 percent of the time, according to the Mayor's
Management Report.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters or emergency medical technicians can reach a
cardiac patient quickly and use a defibrillator, but that only
stabilizes a patient temporarily, many paramedics said. Because
paramedics can administer medicines that stabilize the heart more
permanently, they must also arrive promptly, paramedics said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems has been high turnover among paramedics, many
of whom have left EMS for higher paying jobs with private
hospitals. ``We want to continue to work on that,'' said Von Essen,
who was not yet commissioner when the department lobbied to get EMS
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In persuading the City Council to approve the takeover, fire
officials said they would reconfigure the agency, in part by
building as many as 60 ambulance battalion stations around the
city. That plan, and others, have been either scaled back or
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials promised the Council that ambulances or
fire-engine companies would reach patients in life-threatening
situations within six minutes 90 percent of the time. They have
come close.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews with emergency medical technicians _ who operate
basic life support units but who cannot administer most medicines _
reached patients in life-threatening situations within six minutes
59 percent of the time last year, according to the mayor's
Management Report. When trained firefighters were included,
emergency crews reached critical cases within six minutes 80
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not met the goals that we reached together in our
memorandum of understanding,'' said Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler,
who is chairman of the Public Safety Committee. ``Response time has
improved significantly, and that's important and that's good. But
in terms of achieving the other goals _ to provide basic life
support 90 percent of the time under six minutes and advanced life
support 90 percent of the time under 10 minutes _ that they have
not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler said he was disappointed that neither EMS nor
independent researchers had rigorously studied whether the Fire
Department's management had caused more lives to be saved. ``That
was their main selling point when they sought to get the merger
through, that there would be a major reduction in the number of
people who died,'' he said.

TENS OF THOUSANDS ATTEND VIGIL FOR VICTIMS

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Tens of thousands journeyed for miles Sunday
in a search for solace at the first formal vigil held for the 13
victims of the Columbine High School shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 70,000, twice as many as expected, came to hear
Vice President Al Gore and popular Christian rock singer Amy Grant.
</P>
<P>
   They were beckoned by the bittersweet sound of bagpipes and the
promise that they might someday return to the lives they knew
before Tuesday. But the people of Littleton, whose initial shock
has given way to a lingering pain, also know they will have to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,''
Gore told the overflow crowd at a movie theater parking lot a few
blocks from where two presumed killers, Columbine students Eric
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, went on a rampage, killing 13
and wounding more than 20 before taking their own lives. ``More
than ever, I realize every one of us is responsible for all of the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have the courage not to look away from those who feel
despised and rejected,'' Gore said. ``If you are a parent, they
need your attention. If you are a grandparent, they need your
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen opened the service with a
simple ``Hi,'' and sang a song they wrote in tribute to the
massacre's victims.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cohen, a junior at Columbine, was trapped in the choir
room when gunfire erupted. Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria
where many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious
ones?'' they sang. ``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain
will take our pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and retired General Colin Powell led an array of
dignitaries. Afterward, they walked slowly to nearby Clement Park
to place more flowers at an impromptu memorial that has been
growing daily since the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Foss, 18, who was grazed by a bullet while helping teachers
and students hide in a closet and overhead air ducts, limped in the
processional behind Gore and Powell. He was supported by Columbine
High School Principal Frank DeAngelis, and mourners applauded as
they passed.
</P>
<P>
   Four F-16 fighter jets from the Colorado National Guard soared
overhead, led by Columbine graduate Captain Scott VanBek. A private
plane trailed a banner overhead reading: ``Our love and prayers are
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   From her vantage point at the edge of the crowd, 17-year-old
Sarah Dix said she felt like an outcast, as she always has in this
city. While she cannot comprehend why Harris and Klebold seemed
determined to kill so many, she said she believed she knew why her
two friends felt so hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the way Dylan and Eric felt,'' she said. ``Everyone is
so judgmental. They look at me, and they call me a junkie just
because I dress different from them. The people here are scared of
me; they think I represent all this evilness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dix said she left Columbine High School last year because of
what she felt was an enormous pressure to conform.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Dix and her friends were eyed warily by adults who
have reason to remain fearful, with investigators apparently
convinced that the two presumed killers had help carrying out their
well-planned attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two passersby told 25-year-old Columbine High School dropout
Robert Hopkins, who was wearing his usual wardrobe of oversized
hooded sweatshirt and baggy pants, that he should have dressed more
appropriately for the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to go right back to the same scene,'' Hopkins said.
He said that high school athletes have tossed glass bottles at him
as he waited at a bus stop. Just two days ago, Hopkins said, a
group of football players challenged him and his friends at the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of them who don't act like that,'' Hopkins
said. ``But there are plenty who pick on everyone. I guess it's
about their egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Though these so-called outcasts say they have little hope that
this community of grieving parents and children will embrace
alternative groups, others are urging Columbine High to set a
nationwide example.
</P>
<P>
   Posted on the doors of the city's largest movie theater and
printed on pamphlets handed out by volunteers, are messages of
hope. ``Turn to that person who doesn't look like you. Turn to that
person who looks strange to you. Stop by their table in the
cafeteria, and extend your hand. Together we can make a
difference,'' reads a sign posted at the popular FunPlex, one of
the city's entertainment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many people alternating between sorrow and outrage
here, it is clear that tensions among teenagers will not disappear
soon.
</P>
<P>
   At Clement Park this week, high school athletes said they were
sure their school was no different from any other in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, kids get picked on,'' said Brandon Jones, a 17-year-old
football player. ``But it's just like anywhere. They want to stand
out as being different, and they don't like us, and I guess we
don't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold was buried Saturday at a private service. Neither his
name not Harris's was mentioned by speakers during Sunday's outdoor
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold's parents released a short statement, saying they loved
their son as best they knew how, and extended their sympathy to
other parents who lost children this week.
</P>
<P>
   Because Klebold and Harris are believed to have spent hours
building bombs and accumulating weapons at their homes, their
parents have been targets of criticism, with local talk radio shows
filled with callers expressing incredulity that they could not have
known what their sons were doing.
</P>
<P>
   While scores turned out for Sunday's service, investigators
continued their probe into the shootings, questioning other members
of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' _ the name of Harris and Klebold's
group. Police have said the number of explosives found in the
hallways and the number of weapons recovered from the school
indicate the pair must have had help. During the hourlong shooting
rampage, 15 died, including one teacher, 12 students, Harris, and
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who escaped the school as shots rang out have
told police they recognized a third teenager wielding a gun.
Jefferson County officials say they are hopeful that a diary found
in the home of one of the gunmen will help them in their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, mourners are being asked to hold fast to their faith
and work toward a time of greater understanding and less pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the past week is about as much suffering as any
community can bear,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput
of Denver, who opened the service with a prayer. ``Love is stronger
than death. I believe that. Perhaps beyond all this suffering,
something good can be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Above him, the voices of a church choir floated skyward, along
with hundreds of blue and white balloons and 13 doves, released in
memory of the 13 who were slain.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ More than 10,000 followers of a religious cult
surrounded China's leadership compound Sunday, demanding
recognition from authorities who are wary of any group not easy
controlled. It was the biggest protest here since the democracy
movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Coming as a complete surprise to the authorities, the protest
drew followers from all over China. Eerily silent and devoid of
banners or slogans, the protesters seemed to materialize out of
nowhere, suddenly appearing in large numbers at the seat of Chinese
power in the middle of the morning and remaining immovable all day
long.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying remarkably good organization and discipline, with
demonstrators remaining motionless and calm and seated on the
sidewalk while organizers communicated by mobile telephones. Many
protesters apparently tried to use meditation to persuade leaders
to see them in a more favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   The cult, known as Buddhist Law, asserts that it has more than
100 million members in this country of 1.2 billion, the largest
among hundreds of cults that have flourished in China in recent
years as socialism evaporates as an ideology. Preaching good
behavior to win salvation from an increasingly evil world that is
headed for catastrophe, followers believe that they can cure
illness and eviscerate wickedness from the world.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's popular leader, Li Hongzhi, 48, moved to New York
City two years ago, under pressure from the authorities to restrict
his activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in simple clothing, followers converged from many
provinces of China, sitting all day on worn squares of cotton
padding in long rows that stretched for nearly two miles along two
sides of Zhongnanhai, the compound in central Beijing where China's
leaders live and work.
</P>
<P>
   The police, apparently eager to avoid a confrontation, did not
force the protesters to move, and the gathering dispersed
peacefully by 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The protest came right in the middle of a most politically
sensitive time, the 10th anniversary of the student movement that
began in April, 1989, and just weeks before the anniversary of the
crackdown in Tiananmen Square on June 4. China's leadership is
already deeply concerned about the potential for social unrest as a
wrenching transition to a market economy is throwing tens of
millions out of work.
</P>
<P>
   As China becomes a less regimented society _ with people
confused over conflicting laws and regulations and with tens of
millions of people losing their jobs as state-run industries close
_ religious cults with mass followings like this one appear to pose
a greater threat to social order than democracy advocates do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities can surgically take out political activist
groups, but this is a whole new thing, far harder to control,''
said Robin Munro, a China scholar who researched Chinese political
opposition groups for years as head of Asiawatch in Hong Kong.
``Sects are inherently peaceful, but only become politicized, and
then potentially explosive, when repressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the strong role that secret societies played in the
downfall of the last imperial dynasty, in 1911, China's leaders are
juggling their need for social order with popular demands for
greater religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   To many Chinese bewildered by a fast-changing society, perhaps
the greatest appeal of a cult like Buddhist Law lies in its
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we stand for is good for the nation and good for society,
so how can we threaten anyone?'' said a 47-year-old woman in a worn
green jacket who sat near the corner of Zhongnanhai. ``They don't
understand us. We want understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other followers nodded in agreement as the woman spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay as long as it takes,'' said a 52-year-old man in
a tattered grey sweater. ``A day, a week, a year. We are not in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, wary of giving their names or talking in detail
about their organization, said they were demanding a meeting with
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. In the late evening, as the protest
dispersed, organizers announced to small groups that they had been
promised a meeting with members of the State Council, China's
Cabinet. The government made no announcement, and state-run news
media were conspicuously silent about the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law is a sect of qigong, a traditional Chinese teaching
that incorporates a broad range of healing techniques, martial arts
and meditation. The overwhelming majority of Chinese believe in
some form of qigong, while some join cults built on the teachings
of a particular master, like Li.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party denounces cults as superstitious remnants of
an earlier age and asserts that many charismatic qigong masters
fool followers with get-rich-quick schemes and fake medicine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cult followers carried a book by Li. Buddhist Law,
founded by Li in 1992, preaches that evil lurks in the modern
appearance of rock 'n' roll music, television, drugs and
homosexuality. Although the group is vehemently opposed to modern
science and technology, many members use the internet to spread the
group's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your diseases will be eliminated directly by me,'' wrote Li in
one of his five books, regarded by followers as sacred texts.
</P>
<P>
   Li's teachings echo ancient Chinese civilization, asserting the
power of healing by using qigong to tap into a person's ``inner
energy.'' The cult also uses the Buddhist notion of karma, which
holds that people's good and bad deeds determine their fate in the
next life.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of Sunday's protest apparently lay in a recent
article in an obscure academic journal published in the coastal
city of Tianjin, that warned of the dangers posed by cults in
China. Several protesters said they were deeply offended by the
article and that a dozen followers were arrested in Tianjin last
week after a small protest there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after Beijing Television broadcast a program critical
of Buddhist Law, organizers engineered a protest outside the
television station. Two employees of the station were later said to
have been dismissed because of inaccuracies in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law has apparently earned tens of millions of dollars
by selling Li's books and videotapes of his preachings, as well as
meditation cushions and pictures of Li. But the full size and scope
of the operation remains hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, secretive about its operations, has a network
of support in the United States, and the followers say that many
Communist Party members, senior officials and police officers are
among its members.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who asserts that he has a higher spiritual authority than
Jesus, Mohammed or Buddha, teaches that he was sent to earth by a
``supreme being'' to save mankind from moral corruption caused by
consumerism, modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese society has disintegrated so seriously, Li contends,
that many humans are reincarnated as demons, some of them disguised
as monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in Taiwan,'' he has written, ``many famous monks or
lay Buddhists are actually demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing for followers with other cults, Li has denounced other
qigong masters as ``possessed with foxes or yellow weasels, and
some with snakes.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's protest, followers extolled the virtues of their
cult, talking more about the beneficial effects of moral discipline
than about the greatness of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a better father and husband and citizen,'' said a
48-year-old man from Hebei Province, who said he had been a member
of Buddhist Law for six years. ``We are making a better society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get sick anymore,'' the man continued. ``If everyone
is healthy, it will save medical costs and be good for society as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest, populated mostly by people from outside the
capital, elicited much fascination but limited sympathy from
Beijing residents, thousands of whom gathered to look on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're crazy,'' said Li Xiaoming, 27, who works for a
transport company. ``But there are a lot of them, so the government
has to listen.''

SECURITY VOWED FOR 7 NEIGHBORS OF YUGOSLAVIA: NATO ENDS SUMMIT WITH
CALL FOR TALKS WITH RUSSIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By DAVID IVANOVICH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO extended security guarantees to seven
countries bordering Yugoslavia Sunday, prompting a number of the
front-line nations to fuller cooperation with the allies' monthlong
Balkans war.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's 50th anniversary summit ended, a German official
called for foreign ministers of the seven leading industrialized
democracies to confer with Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin this
week in hopes of finding a diplomatic end to the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military chiefs continued to work on how to implement a
planned oil embargo against Yugoslavia as NATO announced additional
attacks on a refinery in Novi Sad. Bad weather hampered weekend
bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders promised the former Yugoslav republics of
Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, as well as
Albania, Bulgaria and Romania protection from any encroachment or
attack by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO made its position very clear,'' President Clinton said.
``We said unambiguously, `If Belgrade challenges its neighbors as a
result of the presence of NATO, we will respond.'''
</P>
<P>
   The assurances gave Macedonia a strong enough sense of security
to accept up to 16,000 new British and German troops to augment the
12,000 allied soldiers already stationed there, NATO officials
said. The original troops were sent to Macedonia to serve as the
vanguard for a peacekeeping force NATO wants installed in Kosovo
after a cease-fire and withdrawal of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the decision to deploy those units now because
obviously we want to be ready for all contingencies,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Romania and Slovenia have agreed to give NATO aircraft access to
their air space. Bulgaria is expected to follow suit today.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, despite joining NATO last month, has been reluctant to
play host to troops from the other alliance countries. Hungarian
officials fear Belgrade will retaliate against ethnic Hungarians
living in Vojvodina. It is a province of Serbia and, like Kosovo,
was an autonomous region until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the front-line countries _ all but Bosnia and Croatia _
are on a list of nine candidates for admission to NATO. The allies
are considering expanding again within the next three years, and
the conflict in Kosovo has heightened interest in the protective
umbrella of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was struck by the
earnestness of countries wanting to emulate NATO's democratic
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something quite humbling about their desire to be
part of our family,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven front-line countries and representatives from another
17 countries represented in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council
sat in with the full NATO members for the final summit session in
the sprawling, new Ronald Reagan Building two blocks from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was the only member of the expanded group to boycott the
summit. With its religious and ethnic ties to Serbia, Russia has
adamantly opposed the air attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin phoned President Clinton on
Sunday to brief him on Chernomyrdin's recent meeting with Milosevic
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The White House dispatched Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott to Moscow to discuss the situation further. Canadian and
Swedish officials also planned consultations in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said he is trying to
organize a meeting this week in Bonn between Chernomyrdin, a former
Russian prime minister, and foreign ministers from the major
industrial powers to seek a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is the current chair of the so-called Group of Eight as
well as president of the European Union for the first six months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have been concerned about Russia's unwillingness to
abide by a planned, NATO-imposed oil embargo on Yugoslavia. Despite
the fighting, Russia has continued to ship petroleum products to
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said that
the embargo did not come up during the Clinton-Yeltsin conversation
which lasted 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin is well aware of the decisions that have
been taken here including the decision with respect to stopping
resupply,'' Berger said. ``President Yeltsin did not raise the
question of this issue, gave no indication that they would not
comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how the NATO countries will implement an oil embargo has
yet to be decided. ``All 19 countries agree that it is important to
cut down the supply of fuel going into fuel his war machine,'' said
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The alliances is contemplating some kind of naval blockade,
which officials described as a ``visit and search'' operation.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's two oil refineries, in the cities of Novi Sad and
Pancevo, have been frequent targets of NATO bombing raids. Other
recent targets included an ammunition storage depot in northern
Kosovo and a highway bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air campaign began, the allies have flown more than
9,000 sorties and have lost one aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already spent more than a $1 billion on
the effort, with some projecting the U.S. share of the campaign to
cost $6 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill argue that Congress must go beyond
just paying for the war and increase military spending overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should take this opportunity to look at
adding every military need we may have been aware of,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on ABC-TV's This Week.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lott said that he favors increasing troops' pay and
improving their retirement systems to ``give the troops the
assurances that we know they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said total cost of such a bill would be at least $11
billion.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM SHOWS INTEREST IN ONE 2 ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Telekom AG, which is trying to
merge with Telecom Italia for more than $80 billion, may also have
its sights on a mobile-telephone acquisition in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Two German publications reported Sunday that Telekom was
preparing a bid of about $17 billion for One 2 One, Britain's
smallest mobile-phone operator, which is a joint venture between
Cable and Wireless PLC and Mediaone.
</P>
<P>
   One 2 One's parent companies put it up for sale last month, and
the company has drawn intense interest throughout the European
telecommunications industry. People close to Telekom said it was
unquestionably interested in the British company, though it is
unclear that Telekom has made a firm offer.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, said last week that he
was actively looking for additional acquisitions after _ or if _ it
manages to complete a deal with Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   One 2 One has yet to turn a profit, and it came under heavy new
pressure when its archrival in Britain, Vodafone Group PLC, reached
an agreement to acquire Air Touch Communications, the huge U.S.
wireless company that was spun off from Pacific Telesis Group
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Telekom is probably not the only company interested in
bidding on One 2 One. Executives at Mannesman AG, which competes
against and indeed overtook Telekom in the German
cellular-telephone market, have said they are looking at a possible
bid as well.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom executives refused to comment publicly Sunday on the
reports in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag and in Focus
magazine, dismissing them as ``pure speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry executives said Deutsche Telekom would be negligent
if it did not seriously look at acquiring One 2 One. Though the
company is the smallest of Britain's four cellular carriers, it has
a nationwide license and has been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Such an acquisition would significantly shore up Telekom's
European presence. If the merger with Telecom Italia comes through,
the new company will have a strong base in Germany as well as
Europe's largest mobile-telephone operator, Telecom Italia's mobile
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has a big war chest to finance expansion, and
those resources are about to get bigger. The company recently
announced plans for a huge new stock offering, possibly worth more
than $10 billion, and said the money would be used primarily for
``global expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger with Telecom Italia would not interfere with other
acquisitions, because the two companies are merely exchanging
shares without using up scarce cash or taking on new debt. Indeed,
because Telecom Italia has far less debt than its German
counterpart, the merged company will have a stronger balance sheet
than Telekom itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Mannesmann could become a formidable opponent. In Germany,
its Mobilfunk mobile-telephone subsidiary has higher revenues than
Telekom's own, older cellular service.
</P>
<P>
   Telekom executives view the Telecom Italia acquisition largely
as a stepping stone to further expansion and consolidation.

SPORTS COLUMN: LEMIEUX'S NEXT GOAL: SAVE PENGUINS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ In gold, black and white with the Penguins' logo,
the ``Lemieux 66 1984-1997'' banner hangs high in the Civic Arena,
while the franchise's future hangs in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire former superstars in every sport are supposed to
fade away into the sun and fun of celebrity golf tournaments, but
Mario Lemieux, who led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup in both 1991
and 1992, is trying to buy the Penguins franchise in order to keep
it alive and well in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the usual story of a franchise about to move. This
isn't the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn, or the Raiders leaving Oakland,
or the Browns leaving Cleveland. Those franchises were not only
solvent, but also profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins are bankrupt. The Penguins are $120 million in
debt, and co-owners Howard W. Baldwin and Roger M. Marino are now
seldom in sight. Zillionaires who might ordinarily want to buy a
National Hockey League franchise as a toy have shied away from the
Penguins as a bad investment.
</P>
<P>
   But the most famous player in Penguins history, Mario Lemieux,
along with the food-chain multimillionaire Ron Burkle, have joined
in a bid for this small-market franchise in the NHL, where
revenue-sharing doesn't exist. If the bid is successful, Lemieux
will be the principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux isn't just putting up his name; he's putting up $10
million of his reported $20 million in deferred income. If he
succeeds, it will be more important to the Penguins' future than
any, or all, of his goals as a center.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier eras, players didn't make enough money to even think
about being a club owner. It's different now. Michael Jordan wants
to be an owner of the Charlotte Hornets and Lemieux is hoping to
take over the Penguins, whom he watched take a two-games-to-one
lead on the New Jersey Devils in their opening-round
four-of-seven-game Stanley Cup playoff series with Sunday's 4-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Without hockey's best player, Jaromir Jagr, who was benched by a
groin injury for the second straight game, and in the confusion
over the bankruptcy situation, the eighth-seeded Penguins weren't
supposed to challenge the Devils, the Eastern Conference champions,
but the Devils are in jeopardy of being eliminated in the first
round for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any control of it, so we don't worry about it,''
Penguins Coach Kevin Constantine said of the bankruptcy. ``And it'd
be a lame excuse if we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they don't worry about it, but the Penguin players surely
are aware that the franchise is awaiting its real playoffs _
discussions on Wednesday about the arena lease and a hearing on
Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux will meet Wednesday with Wes Westley Jr., the president
and chief executive of Spectacor Management Group, which operates
the Civic Arena for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux will try to reduce the lease that costs the Penguins $7
million a year. In contrast, the Steelers and the Pirates will each
pay $350,000 in their lease arrangements with the city for the
approved new separate football and baseball stadiums. Lemieux
reportedly wants a $500,000 lease.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday in bankruptcy court, Judge Bernard Markovitz will
conduct a hearing on the Lemieux group's bid.
</P>
<P>
   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has supported Lemieux's bid, so
much so that he has threatened to dissolve the franchise, or sell
it to another local ownership group or to an owner in another city
if the judge doesn't approve of Lemieux's bid, hopefully by June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of time,'' Bettman said at Saturday's game.
``We have a schedule to do for next season. It's virtually done,
but if we have to redo it, we have to know soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL could also liquidate the franchise's assets and conduct
a dispersal draft of its players, notably Jagr, the NHL's leading
scorer this season, whose contract calls for a $9 million salary
next season. Should that happen, the Rangers would presumably be
the franchise best able to afford him.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what all those Penguins fans want. And it's not
what Jagr wants.
</P>
<P>
   When the Penguins were in Madison Square Garden last Sunday for
Wayne Gretzky's going-away party, Lemieux, who was there as what
Gretzky described as ``the best player I ever played against,''
happened to walk by the Penguins' dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howya doin', boss,'' Jagr said wishfully.
</P>
<P>
   From his lips to the bankruptcy judge's ears.

ANGELS GET RAIN BREAK, LOOK AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ There was good news for the Angels Sunday _ they
didn't lose.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they didn't play either. Their game against the
Kansas City Royals was postponed because of rain. It will be made
up as part of a doubleheader Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have struggled lately, losing six of seven _
including four of five on the just-concluded trip to Toronto and
Kansas City. So a day off to gather their thoughts and forget their
troubles was welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it's stopping our momentum,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``We need to take a deep breath and get ready
for next week. Toronto's playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels play four against the Blue Jays, who swept three from
the Angels to start the trip and four against the White Sox. After
having played 12 of their first 18 games on the road, the Angels
say it will be nice to have an extended stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to approach it,'' Collins said. ``You
can say we've got eight games coming up at home, so yes, we need to
get it going. We're a good baseball team. We've haven't played
well. We're not making excuses, but we're better than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get it moving and it starts in all areas. We need
to run the bases, have a game plan at the plate, have a game plan
on the mound and stay aggressive. We'll be fine, but it's time to
get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, the Angels' scheduled starter for Sunday, will
start tonight against the Blue Jays. He would have preferred to
play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play every game we can play and get ourselves
right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Baby steps: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, recovering from surgery
to repair a broken bone in his left forearm, made progress last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tied my shoes for the first time in seven weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Little things mean a lot to DiSarcina, who is expected back
around the All-Star break. He hasn't played at all since he walked
into the path of coach George Hendrick's fungo bat on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to play,'' DiSarcina said. ``But if you had to
choose an injury, this is a pretty good injury. You have a time
frame that's set. You can see the X-rays and see the break. You
know it's there, you can see it. It's not like a pulled muscle or a
strain.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina will be examined by team medical director Dr. Lewis
Yocum today or Tuesday and find out if he can increase his
activity.
</P>
<P>
   __ No (Mo)und charging: Mo Vaughn saw his former teammates in
Boston fight with the Indians last week, and he also watched as
Angels teammate Todd Greene charged the mound and started a fight
with the Mariners. Vaughn, though, has never charged the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in charging the mound,'' he said. ``I'd rather
just hit a home run and stand there. Or I could call him in his
hotel room after the game and ask, `What's your problem?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Vaughn will continue to DH. His sprained
left ankle is too tender to try to play first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he's mobile enough to bounce around and come off the
bag, we're not going to take any chances,'' Collins said. ``We'll
leave him in the DH spot until he can show me he can play first
base.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Glaus cooling: Third baseman Troy Glaus, off to such a hot
start, cooled off on the trip, hitting .200 (4 for 20). Even so,
Glaus went into Sunday ranking among the league leaders in six
offensive categories: runs (15, tied for fifth), hits (24, tied for
eighth), total bases (45, tied for fifth), doubles (12, first),
extra-base hits (15, first) and slugging percentage (.682, sixth).

SEMINARIANS SEEK TO TEACH THROUGH THEIR DISABILITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When four students from Union Theological Seminary
held a worship service in November, each one talked about her
disability or emotional impairment and how it related to her
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the service, dozens of people came up to us
individually and collectively, many in tears,'' said Jennifer
Pader, one of the organizers. ``We realized right away something
really special had happened and saw that there was a need not being
filled.''
</P>
<P>
   The four now call themselves ``By Our Wounds, We Are Healed,''
and their mission is to awaken churches to the struggles faced by
clergy members with disabilities. In addition to Ms. Pader, a
Unitarian Universalist, the group includes Mary Ramsay, who belongs
to the United Church of Christ; Barbara Rasero, a Roman Catholic,
and Elizabeth Schell, a Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   They have joined to create and lead worship services, conduct
workshops and do counseling in an effort to demolish barriers that
limit what disabled clerics can do and alter the perception that an
impairment is retribution for sin or moral failing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the four conducted their second noontime
community service at the seminary's James Memorial Chapel, on its
campus in Morningside Heights. They recalled their unexpectedly
successful debut in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We embarked on a journey out of the safety zone of the
seminary,'' Ms. Pader told the congregation. `` In this very
worship community, we outed ourselves as women living with physical
and psychiatric disabilities that had shaped our lives in some very
fundamental ways.
</P>
<P>
   `` These disabilities that make us uncomfortable and wanting to
avert our eyes from those who are different, can lead us toward a
new theology of liberation,'' she continued. ``This refusal to
accept the limited space that society has made for us and we have
made for ourselves, will make us better church members and more
insightful pastors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pader suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological
condition that causes involuntary movement of the vocal muscles in
the larynx that lead the voice to tremble and crack. Though there
is no cure, it can be treated with injections of a toxin known as
Botox that temporarily paralyzes the muscles to control the spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Ms. Pader, who is also a freelance copywriter,
approached Karen Wood, associate dean for student life at the
seminary, with the idea of conducting a service focused on issues
of disability. Wood put her in contact with Ms. Ramsay, who was
newly diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a painful muscle disorder that
has no cure. ``Together we decided we wanted to lead a service that
would move away from the idea of victimization, and toward the
liberation of people with disabilities,'' Ms. Pader said.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by two other seminarians who broadened the
group's definition of disability to encompass emotional problems as
well. Ms. Schell, who was raised by a schizophrenic mother, twice
attempted suicide during adolescence. Barbara Rasero, in her 20s,
has a social phobia so severe that she fainted the first time she
had to speak at a service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had great chemistry,'' Ms. Pader said. ``I like to
think of us as the Spice Girls, although the rest of them really
hate that.''
</P>
<P>
   They intend to continue pursuing their cause after they
graduate, Ms. Pader in May, the three others next year, and after
their ordinations.
</P>
<P>
   They have engagements to preach at the Union Methodist Church in
the Park Slope section of Brooklyn and at the Fourth Universalist
Society on Central Park West. They also plan to conduct workshops
and offer counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the advice they offer about surmounting limits imposed
on the disabled and combating prejudice, they also question the
meaning of disability in God's plan for humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My illness is not unrelated to my life and my call,'' Ms.
Ramsay said of her fibromyalgia at the November service. ``It is an
essential characteristic of the fullness of a life called to God's
service. For each of us, ministry comes through the truth of who we
actually are.''

ECONOMIST AT HARVARD AWARDED PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrei Shleifer, a Harvard University economist who immigrated
to the United States from Russia when he was a teen-ager, has won
the John Bates Clark Medal, the most prestigious prize in economics
short of the Nobel. The medal, awarded every two years by the
American Economic Association, goes to an outstanding economist
under 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer, who is 38, was honored for his empirical research into
the workings of financial markets, commercial law and corporate
securities, particularly in countries making the transition from
socialism to a market economy. Some of his research has focused on
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Shleifer represents a continuation of the empirical
tradition that really started with Lawrence Summers and continued
through David Card and Kevin Murphy,'' said Dale Jorgenson, a
Harvard economist and president-elect of the American Economic
Association, which chose Shleifer at an executive board meeting in
Chicago on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, then of Harvard, Card at the University of California
at Berkeley, and Murphy, at the University of Chicago, are the
three previous Clark medalists _ Summers in 1993, Card in 1995 and
Murphy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They are all prominent empiricists. Rather than focus on theory,
they focus on what amounts to experiments that elaborate on
existing theory, amend it or create new theory.
</P>
<P>
   Summers is now deputy director of the Treasury Department; Card
and Murphy are labor economists. Shleifer won out over four or five
others who had been considered by a selection committee, including
Alan Krueger of Princeton University, who was the most prominent on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Shleifer's work elaborates on a theory developed by
others that holds that it is impossible to write a contract between
two parties _ whether they are two individuals or a corporation and
its shareholders _ that covers all contingencies in a binding
fashion. As a result, a strong court system is necessary to resolve
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets work best in countries with such a system,
Shleifer has found. They do not work well, he maintains, in
countries where parliaments have a bigger say, and politicians and
powerful shareholders can influence legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award to me is to some extent a recognition of how
important finance is to economics and vice versa,'' Shleifer said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the discussion leading to Shleifer's selection, the economic
association's executive committee did not consider a
conflict-of-interest case in which Shleifer was involved in 1997.
``It was not even mentioned,'' Jorgenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer had been a steward of a program financed by the U.S.
government to help Russia develop capital markets and new
commercial and civil laws. The Harvard Institute for International
Development ran the program under a $57 million contract from the
U.S. Agency for International Development. AID canceled the
contract in May 1997, contending that Shleifer and another official
had benefited from private business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer was said to have invested in Russian securities while
advising the Russian government. Shleifer has never been formally
charged with a misdeed, and he has denied any wrongdoing. He has
separated, however, from the Harvard Institute, whose director is
Jeffrey Sachs, also a Harvard economist. Asked about the
announcement that Shleifer had won the Clark award, Sachs declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer finished high school in Rochester, N.Y., where he had
settled with his parents after coming from Russia. He excelled in
mathematics, which was his major as an undergraduate at Harvard
University, but he became a research assistant to Summers, who drew
him into economics. Shleifer earned his Ph.D. at MIT in 1986 and
five years later, at age 30, he was a full professor at Harvard.

WILLIAMS' HIT GIVES DIMAGGIO A FITTING TRIBUTE AS YANKS SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-ARATON-COLUMN) 
 (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his day, Joe DiMaggio liked to lounge at his
locker, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. On Joe DiMaggio Day
at Yankee Stadium, Bernie Williams lounged at his locker and played
guitar with Paul Simon, royalty in these parts because of the
lyrics he wrote about Joltin' Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Oblique and direct lines bind DiMaggio to Williams, Yankee
center fielders and cleanup hitters from different generations, and
those ties extended all the way into the 11th inning Sunday, when a
single by Williams scored Chuck Knoblauch with the decisive run in
the Yankees' 4-3 victory over Toronto. Jason Grimsley (1-0) threw
two perfect innings of relief for his first victory as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   The win gave the Yankees a three-game sweep of the Blue Jays
(12-7), extended their winning streak to five and improved their
record to 12-5.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio and Williams have their differences, of course: At the
moment Knoblauch slid home ahead of the throw from right fielder
Shawn Green, Williams reacted in a manner that was mostly foreign
to DiMaggio. Williams, who has been overeager at the plate and
struggling to drive in runs, turned and fired his helmet to the
ground, ripped apart the Velcro binding of his batting glove and
stalked to the dugout, outwardly elated he had succeeded, and
disgusted it had taken him so long to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to get a base hit and produce in the clutch,''
said Williams, who has just four extra-base hits and seven runs
batted in over his first 68 at-bats this season.
</P>
<P>
   Like DiMaggio's Yankees, these Yankees have come to expect the
best from themselves, and only because of their own late-inning
struggles were they playing so late into Joe DiMaggio Day. David
Cone pitched well, allowing just six base runners in six and
two-thirds innings and turning over a 3-1 lead to the bullpen in
the seventh, but the Yankees' lack of left-handed relief hurt them
in the eighth and ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mike Stanton, the only lefty in the Yankees' bullpen,
pitched out of trouble in the seventh and Jeff Nelson followed
Stanton, Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, had to turn to
the closer Mariano Rivera in the eighth when Nelson ran into
trouble _ the third appearance in three days for Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched out of a jam in the eighth, his fastball appearing
unhittable in the shadows that reached for home plate in the late
afternoon. But with Toronto trailing, 3-2, Carlos Delgado blooped a
single to short center leading off the ninth, and took second and
then third when catcher Jorge Posada was charged with two passed
balls; he just could not see the ball in the shadows, Posada
explained.
</P>
<P>
   With Rivera tired, the tying run scored, and only a perfect
relay from right fielder Paul O'Neill to second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch to Posada prevented the Blue Jays' Willie Greene from
scoring the go-ahead run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch walked to open the bottom of the ninth for the Yankees
and moved into scoring position, but Williams struck out and Tino
Martinez grounded out. The Yankees' leadoff hitter reached scoring
position again in the 10th, and again they could not capitalize.
Zimmer would muse later how the Yankees really have not played that
well, how their big hitters have not really started mashing the
ball. He did not use names, but he could have been talking about
Martinez, batting .220 with four RBIs in 17 games, and Williams,
whose .324 batting average is deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Williams mashed the ball in spring training, batting .397 with
11 extra-base hits in 78 at-bats, but once the season began,
Williams seemingly lost his patience at the plate, swinging at the
first pitch in most of his at-bats and hacking with reckless
aggressiveness. Williams averaged 3.75 pitches a plate appearance
last year, and as Sunday's game began, he had averaged only 2.83
pitches a plate appearance this year _ the fewest in the American
League. Williams went on to swing at the first pitch in four of his
first five plate appearances Sunday. ``Maybe I've been trying too
hard, instead of just letting things happen and trusting my
ability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was first to bat for the Yankees in the 11th, and he
turned away from an inside fastball from Toronto's Robert Person
and then immediately began moving toward first base, pointing at
his left hip, claiming he had been hit by the pitch; Mike Reilly,
the plate umpire, agreed. The Blue Jays argued angrily and
futilely; later, Knoblauch showed off a small mark on his hip to
reporters, promising he had not pinched himself.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter struck out, but O'Neill walked, advancing Knoblauch
into scoring position and bringing Williams to the plate. This had
been a good day for Williams, before the game started: He had
chatted in the outfield with Simon while the singer was doing a
sound check, and before the game, Simon sat with him and Grimsley
with guitars, ``and we just jammed,'' Williams said. ``It was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   With each failure at the plate, however, Williams appeared even
more frustrated, lingering between pitches, concentrating so
intently that a thought balloon might have appeared above his head.
</P>
<P>
   But Person (0-1) threw a fastball on the inner half of the
plate, and Williams, batting left-handed, turned on it, lacing the
single between first and second; Knoblauch churned around third and
easily beat the throw from the outfield, jumping into the rush of
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Williams purposefully high-fived other Yankees on his way back
to the dugout, saluted loudly by the crowd of 51,903, and suddenly
and finally, this was his day, no matter how obliquely, on Joe
DiMaggio Day.

ARTIST ARRESTED AFTER 150 PEOPLE POSE NUDE FOR HIM IN TIMES SQUARE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn artist who says he has persuaded people in
all 50 states to pose nude in public was arrested after coaxing
more than 150 people to lie naked in the middle of Times Square
early Sunday so he could photograph them.
</P>
<P>
   On a morning cold enough to see his breath, the artist, Spencer
Tunick, 32, was arrested and his camera confiscated at 6:15 a.m. at
47th Street and Seventh Avenue. Tunick, who did not disrobe, was
charged with unlawful assembly, which means a failure to have
proper permits for a parade or demonstration. None of the models
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he did it,'' said Officer Lee Ann Tracy, a
Police Department spokeswoman. ``But supposedly he's a renowned
artist, and he does this all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tunick has been arrested four times previously in New York. But
unlike his previous arrests, when he was quickly released, he was
still in custody Sunday night. Tunick's lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby,
described the arrest as part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
``crackdown on the quality of life and on naked people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuby said that Tunick typically takes his pictures around dawn
to minimize traffic disruption. The lawyer said that charges of
unlawful assembly, a misdemeanor that carries no mandatory penalty,
are often dismissed. Kuby said police sometimes resort to ``street
justice,'' by keeping people charged with that crime in jail
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick has been working on what he calls the Naked States tour,
in which he poses nude volunteers in public settings. In New York,
he passed out more than 6,000 postcards to elicit volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas C. Donahue, 30, who is editing a 90-minute independent
documentary on Tunick, joined in. ``At first,'' he said, ``I had
reservations about lying down in Times Square because I thought the
street would be grimy. But actually it was flat with no big
potholes, and all I could see was blue sky, and the marquee of the
nearby Palace Theater advertising ``Beauty and the Beast.''''

70,000 SALUTE LITTLETON'S FALLEN 13; WE MUST CHANGE, GORE SAYS AT
MEMORIAL
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ For years the small community of students and
alumni of Columbine High School have used three words to show their
school pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the mantra became a chant of support and sorrow for
tens of thousands of people _ including Vice President Al Gore _
attending an open-air memorial service for the 12 students and
coach who were gunned down in the halls of the school Tuesday. Two
gunmen, students at the school, committed suicide after the attack,
which wounded 23.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a voice at times thunderous, told the crowd that
Americans should ``change our lives to honor these children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a culture rife with violence where too many young people
place too little value on a human life, we can rise up and we can
say 'No more,''' Gore said to applause. ``We have seen enough of
violence in our schools. We must replace the culture of violence
and mayhem with one of values and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At such a time we need each other,'' Gore said. ``To the
families of all those who died here I say 'You are not alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Gore, his wife Tipper and community leaders on a
makeshift stage in the parking lot of a movie theater near the
school were the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Colin Powell; Sen. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; Colorado Gov. Bill
Owens and singers Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith and Phil Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70,000 people, some who knew the victims, many who
did not, stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the parking lot and lined
the sidewalks across the boulevard. They carried flowers and wore
blue ribbons as they hugged and wept.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 volunteers greeted people as they arrived, handing
out flowers, ribbons, programs and tissue.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, Columbine student body president Amber
Burgess told the crowd that the memories of her classmates and
beloved coach would not be lost. Then she shouted ``We are'' and
the crowd responded ``Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the speakers offered condolences to the
families of Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, the names of
the two killers were not mentioned. Officials said the gunmen had
plotted the massacre for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities put their investigation at the high school on hold
Sunday to give officers and their families a chance to attend the
service. Steve Davis, Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman, said
the investigation will resume today with continued processing of
evidence and interviews with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Colorado Army National Guardsmen, including 111 from
the 220th Military Police from Golden, Colo., were posted around
the campus for security.
</P>
<P>
   The service Sunday opened with a song written by brothers
Jonathan and Stephen Cohen. The two were trapped in different areas
of the school during the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine flower blue, Columbine there's hope for you,'' they
sang. ``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious
ones. Columbine, friend of mine, peace will come to you in time.''
</P>
<P>
   As the brothers sang, people in the crowd released hundreds of
blue and white balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of Denver, the mayor of Littleton and other local
dignitaries then praised the heroism of the students and faculty of
Columbine and thanked the community and people across the country
who offered support after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Performers Grant, Smith and Driscoll sang emotional tributes.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore implored the country to become more active
in children's lives, saying ``the young killers of Columbine High
School'' were not what America stood for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen in this community so much goodness, so much
healing, so much of what is best in our country,'' Gore said. ``You
have shown us that even in this ashen moment there is a spark that
lights our way forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we are brought to our knees in the shock of this moment,
what say we, what say we into the open muzzle of this tragedy,
cocked and armed at our hearts. All of us must change our lives to
honor these children.''
</P>
<P>
   Applause erupted from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president asked parents to pay more attention to their
children, grandparents to spend more time with their grandchildren
and childless adults to set a good example.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we as a people can work our way to that place where caring
and compassion open us to the lives of all our children, then those
children who died here will not have died in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches and songs, the Colorado Air National Guard _
led by pilot Scott VanBek, a 1986 Columbine graduate _ flew over
the service in what is called the missing man formation.
</P>
<P>
   And white doves were released as the governor read off the names
of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bagpipers then led the dignitaries on a procession to Clement
Park, next to Columbine High, where memorials of flowers, notes and
stuffed animals have been set up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore laid flowers at a wreath in the park, then consoled family
members of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public attending the ceremony had to walk by
protesters holding the American flag upside down and carrying signs
that read ``God Hates America.'' The protesters, a religious group
from Kansas, said they blame society for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As Don and Connie Baker arrived, Connie began weeping,
remembering Dave Sanders, the coach who was killed trying to
protect students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He coached our daughter-in-law,'' Don Baker said. ``We came
out mainly for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Baker, a sophomore at neighboring Chatfield High School,
attended to show support for the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way of really showing how the community has
come together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High School principal Frank DeAngelis said the
ceremony was ``the end of a nightmare'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of Columbine High School,'' he said. ``Columbine
High School, because of its strong tradition, will continue on.''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: ONE HUGE COMEBACK FOR CHECKETTS' TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There were lots of hugs to go around on Sunday
afternoon. With six-tenths of a second left and the New York Knicks
on the verge of stealing a game from the despised Miami Heat, Larry
Johnson hugged Kurt Thomas and Patrick Ewing hugged Charlie Ward.
Herb Williams was hugging everyone he saw on the bench. This was
like a giddy college team on the verge of winning a tournament
game, or a team of Davids who had just defeated Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Dudley finally punched the ball away and the buzzer
sounded, the Knicks' bench emptied to celebrate their 82-80
victory. The players were as unrestrained as they had been composed
a few moments earlier during a fracas between Thomas and the Heat's
Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, Chris Childs and Marcus Camby hugged. In the stands, Dave
Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, Ed Tapscott, a
Knicks vice president, and Barry Watkins, a Garden spokesman,
looking as if they had been dragged through a wringer, shook hands
and accepted congratulations as they went to greet the team.
Checketts' team.
</P>
<P>
   His presence in Miami and the demotion of Ernie Grunfeld as
general manager last week served notice that Checketts, who used to
be the Knicks' president, is out of the ivory tower and back in the
trenches, taking the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was encouraging about today,'' Checketts said, ``was the
effort and the mental toughness to never, ever give up. Never get
out of the game. Don't let it sleep. Keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not simply a victory over a hated rival. This was the
second consecutive victory for a beleaguered team that was supposed
to challenge for a championship and finds itself struggling to make
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team of severe peaks and valleys. On Friday they were
up by 17 points and needed a last-second shot by Ewing to beat
Charlotte. On Sunday, Ewing wasn't even playing, hobbled by
tendinitis, which will keep him in and out of the lineup from here
on out.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were down by as many as 20 points. As the turnovers
mounted and the bad shooting continued, I kept looking over at
Checketts, Tapscott and Watkins, eight rows up behind the Knicks
bench. How would they ever recover from such a loss?
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Knicks staged the comeback of all comebacks, and
I'm still not convinced they know how they did it. All they know is
that Johnson capped the comeback by hitting a 3-pointer with 56.1
seconds left that tied the game at 77-77. Tim Hardaway came right
back with a 3. In days of old they most likely would have folded.
This time Childs drove, and then dished to Camby, who dunked with
verve, drew the foul and converted the free throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He earned his stripes today'' Allan Houston said of Camby.
``We all earned our stripes today. This was special because of the
history we have with them. But it's only big until Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two final pieces to put in place. Hardaway put up a 3
that missed and bounced long. In the past _ indeed, in the first
half _ the Heat simply would have beaten the Knicks to the loose
ball and run down the clock. This time Childs beat P.J. Brown to
the spot and sealed off the ball. Brown shoved him and was called
for the foul, and Childs gave the Knicks an 82-80 lead with 20.1
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a lot of games this year on last possessions, on
rebounds,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``That loose ball was
great.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one more drama to play out, indicating that this
patchwork team might be grafting.
</P>
<P>
   With 20.1 seconds left, Van Gundy took out the slender Camby and
inserted the heftier Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, the Knicks' captain, who is alternately accused of being
the savior and a burden, met Camby as he came off the court. Ewing
grabbed Camby, who was traded for Ewing's friend Charles Oakley,
and looked him in the eye as if to say: Hey, you played a great
game; you played your role.
</P>
<P>
   Now let Dudley play his. The Knicks needed Dudley to use his
bulk and muscle to bump Alonzo Mourning, keep him just out of his
comfort zone. On this day the Knicks didn't need overtime. They
needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   The locker room was empty. In the corridor, Checketts nodded at
players as they passed by, and said he would see them on the team
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts has been pressed back into service at the grass-roots
level to save the bottom line: For the first time since 1977,
Madison Square Garden is threatened with being dark during both the
National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League
playoffs, because the Knicks, expected to be a legitimate contender
in this first season of the post-Jordan era, have been
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care very much about this team, this organization,''
Checketts said. ``This is where I first got started in New York. It
feels good to be in the trenches, but when you're responsible for
so much more, it's very hard to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I got back involved was I was convinced for
eight games in the playoffs the organization had to put all the
distractions, divisions, whatever, had to put them all aside and
focus on making the playoffs, focus on effort. Talent alone is not
going to win for you. What will win for you is great effort. That's
what you saw today.''

PIAZZA BACK WITH A HIT, BUT SOSA GETS THE HIT THAT COUNTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was supposed to be a day for celebration. Instead,
the Mets' 8-4 loss to the Chicago Cubs left Mike Piazza feeling
only frustration Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Piazza's first game back from a 15-day stay on the disabled
list, the Mets gave up the 3-0 lead they took into the bottom of
the fifth inning, built on solo home runs by Edgardo Alfonzo, Robin
Ventura and Rickey Henderson. The loss was their second straight at
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was one for five with a run batted in during the ninth
inning in his first appearance since April 9, when he sprained a
ligament in his right knee in Montreal. But Piazza hit the ball
hard. And he said he did not feel anything wrong in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels strong,'' Piazza said. ``But after the way
we lost today, it doesn't feel much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's bad feelings had nothing to do with his health. He said
he was even going to switch from wearing a cumbersome knee sleeve
with hinges to one without hinges.
</P>
<P>
   That was the good news. The bad news was that the Mets (11-8)
finished a six-game road trip at 3-3 after dropping two of three to
the struggling Cubs (7-9).
</P>
<P>
   Six of Chicago's runs Sunday afternoon came in a fifth-inning
outburst that began against Orel Hershiser (1-2) with a bloop
single, a walk, a bunt single that died near the third-base line, a
two-run double off John Olerud's glove and a hit batsman that the
Mets thought did not hit anything, much less the bill of Mickey
Morandini's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Hershiser, who had somehow tossed four shutout
innings even though, as he said, he did not know where each pitch
was going. On came Turk Wendell, the quirky former Cub, to face the
reigning National League most valuable player, Sammy Sosa, with the
bases loaded and the Mets clinging to a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Wendell had not allowed a run in his last nine
outings, it was hard to imagine a more difficult situation. To
compound matters, the crowd of 39,265 on a Sammy the Bear Beanie
Baby giveaway day was not only the largest of the season at Wrigley
this year, but the throng also greeted its favorite player by
chanting ``Sam-my! Sam-my!'' as he strode to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good baseball,'' Wendell said. ``I'd like to come into
the same situation when I had good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wendell described the two-ball, two-strike pitch he
threw Sosa as ``a slider that didn't slide.'' Sosa belted the
hanger into the left-field corner for a double. Three runs scored,
and the Cubs had a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not going to hit a home run every time up,'' Sosa
said. It only seemed that way last season, when Sosa hit 66 of
them. Still, Sosa said he was upset with himself for swinging for
the fences with two strikes. ``I said to myself I needed to calm
down and relax,'' said Sosa, who hit another double in the seventh.
``I just wanted to hit it hard and bring in some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the runners Sosa brought in was Morandini. But the Mets
thought he should not have been on base in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in here said it didn't hit him,'' Hershiser said of
his up-and-in 1-2 pitch to Morandini. Bruce Dreckman, the plate
umpire, said it did, however. ``Maybe the umpire heard his bat hit
his helmet,'' said Hershiser, who yelled over to Morandini after
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Where did it hit you?''' Hershiser said. ``He said,
`Right here,' and pointed at his helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Morandini said: ``I thought it hit the bill of my helmet. I
heard something nick. I was trying to get out of the way. Piazza
didn't catch it, so it obviously hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not what Hershiser wanted to hit, which was pretty much his
story for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see that very often,'' said Hershiser, who allowed
five runs on four hits and five walks in four-plus innings. ``I had
great movement, just no location.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser had thrown only 56 pitches heading into the fifth, but
for the afternoon, 36 of his 69 pitches were balls. ``That's not
Orel,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Mets' bullpen, which led the league with a 2.11 earned
run average going into the game, had one of its worst showings of
the season. Even Armando Benitez, who had previously allowed only
two hits in eight and two-thirds innings, had a rocky outing,
allowing Tyler Houston's two-run triple in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we were making that critical pitch, we didn't make it
today,'' the Mets' pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so many missed opportunities,'' Piazza said. ``I just
want to try to forget this game.'' &QL;

SOCCER COLUMN: NOW THERE ARE TWO GREAT RIVALRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This summer's Women's World Cup gained
instant credibility on Sunday. This was apparent from the steamed
looks on the faces of the American players, who discovered that
they can, in fact, lose on the green, green grass of home.
</P>
<P>
   They had not lost in the United States in 50 games, but lose
they did, 2-1, to China in a highly competitive exhibition that
reminded everybody there are no Dream Teams this summer, no Charles
Barkley whupping on the Angolans.
</P>
<P>
   The American public and also the news media have not yet come to
grips with this event _ 16 national teams coming to the United
States in what will be the best-attended sports event held only for
female athletes. The third Women's World Cup, from June 19 through
July 10, gained a huge amount of respectability Sunday if only
because it showed the United States is vulnerable, at least in the
medal round.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters have sold 325,000 tickets, aiming toward 475,000,
and they can probably sell more tickets from bone-rattling hits
like the ones that leveled Mia Hamm and Michelle Akers on Sunday
than from potential double-digit romps.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is the favorite right now,'' said Dr. Robert
Contiguglia, the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, shortly
after China won the game three minutes into injury time.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crowd of 23,765 might have been bigger if prospective
fans had not feared they had to watch the MetroStars first, like
taking your medicine before a tasty dinner. The locals lost to
Tampa Bay, 1-0, probably not setting back major-league soccer more
than six or eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The women promptly aired out the joint. China against the United
States would be the best women's team rivalry in the world, except
that Norway-United States got there first, and besides that, the
Norwegians all speak English, so little gibes have built up, along
with the bruises. China-United States, however, is getting there.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese were stunned at losing early in the first Women's
World Cup, which was in their country in 1991, but time, as
somebody once said, is on their side. They studied and traveled and
trained, and now they can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so fast and so technical,'' said Hamm, who now has
gone seven straight games without scoring. ``That gave them the
opportunity to win on a random clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has still won 11, lost five and tied five
against China, with significant victories for the Summer Games gold
medal in Georgia in 1996, and for the Goodwill Games title last
summer. Then in March, China upended the Americans, 2-1, in the
final of the prestigious Algarve tournament in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   There was another sign that the Yanks are not going to dominate
their festival this summer. In February, just after the draw for
the World Cup, the United States lost, 2-1, to a group of world
all-stars who had literally held one workout together the day
before. It wasn't only feisty Linda Medalen of Norway playing
traffic cop in the back four; it was emerging players from Japan
and Nigeria and Canada giving what-for to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties do wear out, like the Boston Celtics of the Bill
Russell-K.C. Jones era, or the Islanders of the early '80s, the
games and the miles adding up like dog years. But this is more a
case of other nations catching up.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States beat China, 2-1, last Thursday in
Hershey, Pa., the Chinese played without their star goalkeeper, Gao
Hong, who was said to be injured. Late in the game, the Yanks
forced the play for a goal in the 92nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we are,'' said their coach, Tony DiCicco, on
Sunday. ``They treat a tie as a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   They faced a loss Sunday when China's top scorer, Sun Wen,
hammered a goal past Briana Scurry in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, Julie Foudy said: `This is a test for us. It will
show how we handle adversity,''' Hamm said later. ``It didn't turn
out the way we wanted, but we did come back.''
</P>
<P>
   They tied the game in the 58th minute when Cindy Parlow crossed
the ball to Foudy, who made an intricate fake to her left, and then
waited for traffic to clear and smacked the ball past Gao, who
played a terrific game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have short-term memory,'' Foudy said, still steamed
after the game. ``I can't remember the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   They could only remember how, on home turf, the Chinese swarmed
around Hamm in extra time and then whacked the ball downfield,
where a speedy Zhang Ouying burst past Carla Overbeck and Christie
Pearce and put the ball under Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we just lose that game?'' Foudy blurted into a television
microphone a few seconds after the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   They did indeed lose. But the 1999 Women's World Cup was the
biggest winner. Patriotism sells tickets, but parity sells even
more.

KNICKS USE THEIR ANGER AND LOATHING TO BEAT THE HEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., Ohio, Canada)   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas passed an initiation Sunday
and found themselves in a club reserved for those whose animosity
for the Miami Heat obliterates common logic.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, the New York Knicks had no chance to win. Not inside
a simmering Miami Arena, where a crowd was taunting and teasing
them as they trailed by 20 points near the end of the third quarter
and by 15 points with seven minutes left in the game. Not with the
injured Patrick Ewing in a suit and helpless to counter Alonzo
Mourning, who was smiling devilishly each time he touched the ball
for three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   While Larry Johnson's bile for Mourning likely stirred him into
his best performance of the season, and Allan Houston's recall of
Miami moments lifted him from his funk, it was two newcomers to
this kind of loathing, Camby and Thomas, who delivered in an
improbable finish that left the Knicks with an 82-80 victory
against the mightiest team in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare regular season and playoffs,'' Coach Jeff
Van Gundy said, pondering last year's Game 5 playoff victory in
Miami without Ewing. ``But certainly, this year, without a doubt,
this is the biggest win.''
</P>
<P>
   It came when the spindly Camby fearlessly ducked inside for
dunks, produced a cool free throw with 33 seconds left and scored 9
of his 15 points in a rousing 34-point fourth quarter for the
Knicks. It also came when the immovable Thomas sneered right back
at Mourning as he denied him the ball and helped keep the most
valuable player candidate to 2 points in final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them fit right into the hostile nature of this
rivalry and revealed how a fight for survival and a sense of pride
can revive a hopeless situation. The Knicks had done so much to
come back in this game, and still topped it off with a big stop in
the last eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had fouled out, so it was up to Chris Dudley to produce
in his only cameo of the fourth quarter. Mourning backed into the
paint, and with no shot, wheeled the ball to Jamal Mashburn with
four seconds on the clock. Mashburn lost the ball off his leg and,
it rolled down the baseline, where Chris Childs grabbed it and
wrapped it up to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down like we were, it's give-up time for a lot of
teams,'' said Johnson, who scored a season-high 23 points. ``But we
didn't care how bad it looked, we weren't going to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps logic is for losers. The Knicks (23-21) provided the
first evidence of the season that they could not only land a
playoff spot but also prosper once the post-season began. If they
are the eighth seed and meet Miami as the first _ which is how the
two stand with six games left in the Knicks' season _ Sunday's
outcome must fortify the Knicks' faith and unsettle the nerves of
the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   That's how quickly things can change. With seven minutes left,
the Knicks looked like a team headed for the kind of blowout loss
that could have sapped their confidence and nudged them toward a
tailspin to end the season. But then Thomas found Camby darting
toward the basket for a dunk, and Houston shrugged off his 2-for-10
start and hit two jumpers in a row to begin a 17-4 run that ended
with a 3-pointer from Johnson to tie the game at 77-77 with 56
seconds left. All Miami Coach Pat Riley could do was watch how his
team failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't recognize when another team is desperate,'' Riley
said. ``They were down and desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat seemed afraid to shoot the ball. Mourning _ who had
collected 27 points in three quarters _ failed to score a field
goal against the very player Riley traded to Dallas three years
ago, Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't score a field goal, did I?'' said Thomas, who was 0
for 4 for the game. ``That's OK I just wanted to defend and defend
hard. I wouldn't say I got in Zo's head. I just wanted to give him
a different look and keep coming. When you get traded from a place,
you're really up to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But all of the Knicks' emotion _ which included technical fouls
called on Childs and Thomas in separate skirmishes _ it could have
been misplaced had they failed to finish off this game in the last
56 seconds. After a Tim Hardaway 3-pointer, they shrugged off the
ghosts of all those failed fourth quarters of the past this season
and grabbed the victory. After turning the ball over five times in
his chaotic drives to the basket, Houston barged into the paint and
flipped the ball to Camby for a dunk with 33 seconds left. On the
play, Mashburn fouled him.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was on his way to shedding his image of a flimsy player,
but his mentality would have been thrown into question again if he
had missed the free throw. He nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I came down here, I didn't break a sweat,'' said
Camby who did not play because of Van Gundy's reticence to toss him
into the physical fray. ``I got my chance and was feeling pretty
good. I had my confidence and stepped to the line.''
</P>
<P>
   They all produced when everything was on the line. And when it
was over. Childs jumped in Johnson's arms as a beer bottle was
tossed onto the floor by a Heat fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge, incredibly big,'' Childs said. ``It's always
sweeter to come down here and win one, especially one that meant as
much as this one did. Every time we leave here with a loss, it zaps
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't losing this game. It didn't look good for a while.
But with everything between these two teams, there was plenty to
feed off of. Everyone was apart of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone joined the club.

BROADCOM TO ACQUIRE EPIGRAM IN A DEAL WORTH $316 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to offer high-speed Internet links within homes, the
Broadcom Corp. said Sunday that it had agreed to acquire Epigram
Inc., a private maker of microchips for data communications, for
$316 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Epigram, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is a leading developer of
chip sets for offering office-caliber data links within homes,
using the telephone wiring that is already in place. Though Epigram
does not expect to have significant revenue until the third
quarter, the company already counts the 3Com Corp., Northern
Telecom of Canada and Matsushita of Japan among its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom, based in Irvine, Calif., is a big maker of chips for
cable modems and digital set-top boxes. Broadcom executives are
among many in the data communications and personal computer
industries who contend that as high-speed Internet connections
become available to more people, more families will want to link
multiple devices within their homes at similar speeds.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow multiple people in one home to share a single
Internet connection or to share such peripherals as printers or
scanners. Epigram, which was advised by Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in the
transaction, is developing technology to allow those in-home
connections while not interfering with normal telephone use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will create a dynamism where we will incorporate this
technology into every cable modem and set-top box we sell,'' said
Henry T. Nicholas, Broadcom's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Thermond, Epigram's chief executive, said, ``The
bottom line for all of us is that this accelerates our ability to
bring our product to market.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Broadcom's got a very entrepreneurial culture. When
we started these conversations three or four weeks ago, we were
struck with how similar the cultures were.''

QUICK STRIKES LEAVE THE DEVILS LOOKING UP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Some members of the Devils called the mental lapse
that led to two quick Pittsburgh goals a brain cramp. Whatever the
choice of words, the New Jersey Devils, the top-seeded team in the
Eastern Conference, now find themselves trailing the eighth-seeded
team, just as they did last season in their first-round elimination
by the Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Two Pittsburgh goals 27 seconds apart in the first 40 seconds of
the third period Sunday led the Penguins to a 4-2 triumph and a
two-games-to-one lead in the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Some Devils players attributed their collapse to a lack of
concentration. All the Devils appeared shocked and stunned by the
two quick scores.
</P>
<P>
   The game had started well for the Devils. Pittsburgh's Jaromir
Jagr was sitting out his second game because of a groin injury, and
the Devils appeared to be the better team for the first two
periods. They went into the dressing room for the second
intermission leading by 2-1 on power-play goals by Sergei Brylin in
the first and Jason Arnott in the second.
</P>
<P>
   After two periods, the Devils had outshot Pittsburgh by 25-13,
and had had numerous chances to score more than the two goals. They
failed to convert their chances, which has been a problem the
Devils have had almost all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have opportunities, you want to put them in,
especially when you have so many shots,'' said coach Robbie Ftorek,
who made four lineup changes from Saturday's second game, a 4-1
Pittsburgh victory. ``We played real well in the first two periods,
and maybe we should have had a bigger lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins came out on fire in the third and tied the score at
2-2 on Martin Straka's second goal of the game, just 13 seconds
into the period. Aleksei Kovalev's second goal in two days, just 27
seconds later, put the Penguins ahead by 3-2. An empty-net goal
with 17 seconds left gave Straka his hat trick and sealed the
victory for the financially troubled Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into brain cramp for a couple of minutes there in the
third,'' Devils defenseman Brad Bombardir said. ``But we brought it
back for the next 13 minutes and we had our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombardir echoed several of his teammates, who said that last
season's first-round loss to Ottawa had been erased from their
memories. All the players who made such a claim, however, seemed to
be looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we didn't feel good about ourselves,'' Bombardir
said. ``This time we feel good. We're angry at ourselves, but we're
not frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik was upset that the Devils had dropped a game behind
the Penguins entering Tuesday night's game here. The series will
return to New Jersey on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had strictly a lack of concentration,'' Holik said. ``We
made some mistakes, and we should be harder on ourselves for making
such mistakes. It's a matter of focus. We played well for the most
part, but not at the start of the third.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ken Daneyko, standing across from Holik in a quiet
dressing room, was already talking about what the Devils would have
to do in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 4 is vital to us,'' Daneyko said. ``We were shocked and
stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Constantine, the Pittsburgh coach, said he didn't say
anything special to his players during the second intermission that
sparked them to come out with such enthusiasm in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Eaves is the guy who talks to the team between periods,''
Constantine said, referring to one of his assistant coaches.
``Whatever he said worked out. They just played a great period.''

AS GOVERNORS FEUD, DOCKWORKERS FEAR FOR THEIR JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 29 years since James Stolpinski arrived on the
finger piers of Staten Island as an 18-year-old with a broad back
and a longshoreman's union card, he has unhappily watched New
Jersey supplant New York as the region's cargo hub. He blames New
York governors for being ``asleep at the wheel'' for decades as New
Jersey ports ascended at the expense of those in Brooklyn and on
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Then, George Pataki became New York's governor, and Stolpinski
and many other longshoremen decided he might be a stand-up guy.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki gave voice to the accumulated resentments of New York
dockworkers when he criticized the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, the transportation agency that controls the region's
ports, railroads and airports. He also won points after helping to
prod the authority into a planned expansion of the Howland Hook
Marine Terminal on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Stolpinski and other New York longshoremen find
themselves in an awkward position. Pataki may be their champion,
but as they watch him battle his cross-harbor counterpart, New
Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, over revenue from the Port Authority,
many worry that he is playing politics with the jobs of all
longshoremen.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that New York deserves a larger cut, Pataki has
threatened to block a deal by Whitman to keep her state's two
largest shipping lines, Sea-Land Service and Maersk Line, from
moving to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bylaws of the Port Authority, the governors of New
Jersey and New York both have veto power over the agency's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To Stolpinski, who heads Staten Island Local 920 of the
International Longshoreman's Association, the choice is painfully
clear: Even though he agrees that New York deserves more from the
Port Authority, he cannot back his governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sign the deal,'' he said. ``Make the Sea-Land thing happen.
Then do what you've got to do with Whitman to get a fair share for
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the shipping leases is really a proxy battle in a
larger war over control of the authority, and the longshoremen on
both sides of the water say they are unfairly caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Whom do they blame? It depends mostly on where they work. At
Howland Hook on Staten Island, there is plenty of sympathy for
Pataki's argument, if not his tactics. But at the Sea-Land terminal
in Elizabeth, N.J., Pataki is regarded as a political meddler.
</P>
<P>
   The two carriers employ 1,000 people in New Jersey with a $100
million payroll, including benefits. Many of the employees live in
New York. Others may work at Howland Hook or other New York docks,
but they also work overtime in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part of it is I'm a political pawn because of two
governors,'' said Lee Sobieck, 53, a mechanic, who was checking
trucks recently at the Sea-Land terminal in Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieck has worked at Sea-Land for 20 years and is paid about
$60,000 a year. ``It's hard to imagine looking for a job at 53,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieck joined the ILA at the age of 27, when the job entailed
little more than heavy lifting. Now, dockworkers operate
computerized cranes, forklifts, transfer trucks and other pieces of
heavy equipment. Depending on seniority and the amount of overtime
worked, a longshoreman can be paid between $30,000 and $110,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good job,'' Sobieck said. ``It had a future. I figured
I could work here until I'm 65.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the region's $20 billion shipping industry, Sea-Land and
Maersk account for about a quarter of the cargo moving annually
through the harbor. An original offer made to the companies by the
Port Authority included a host of subsidies, and Whitman sweetened
the deal two weeks ago by also offering $120 million in state
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New Jersey, as well as union officials, fear that
if the two carriers move to Baltimore, others may follow, hurting
not only longshoremen, but also myriad related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McNamara, spokesman for the ILA headquarters in Manhattan,
said the rank and file in New Jersey did have some protections if
the two lines do leave. Under the current regional contract,
McNamara said the 1,000 workers laid off in New Jersey would
probably qualify for the $36,000-a-year salary guarantee in the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the contract expires Sept. 30, 2001, and McNamara said union
officials worry that other carriers might follow Sea-Land and
Maersk to Baltimore rather than pay out the benefits of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sullivan, the union foreman at Sea-Land, said the critical
point overlooked by the politicians is that the boundaries between
New York and New Jersey are artificial where shipping is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the New York area,'' he said. ``It's the region we're
worried about. We're not New York and New Jersey. Pataki is worried
about New York. Christine Todd Whitman is worried about New Jersey.
As far as politics is concerned, I would like the two governors to
get together to preserve these jobs.''

DUBAI CONNECTION AND FILLIES SPICE DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Michael Osborne, manager of the racing stable
that sent two colts halfway round the world to the Kentucky Derby,
put it bluntly: ``We are going into the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   What was unknown was this: Could you take two colts, keep them
in Dubai on the Persian Gulf all winter with no formal races, work
them in a couple of trial races that resemble scrimmages, then fly
them to Louisville and run them at a mile and a quarter in the
Kentucky Derby against the best colts in America?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mystery came unwrapped at 6:30 Sunday morning when
the two colts, Worldly Manner and Aljabr, went to the track at
Churchill Downs and held their first formal workouts on American
soil since their arrival last Monday. They drew a large and curious
crowd along the backstretch as each worked seven furlongs in rather
slow time with reasonably fast finishes, which was what their
trainer had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner, with Jerry Bailey riding, as he will be on
Saturday in the Derby, languished through the first quarter-mile in
28 2/5 seconds, worked half a mile in 54 seconds and turned it up a
notch to complete the seven furlongs in 1:29 4/5. He finished up a
mile in 1:43 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Albertrani, assistant trainer to Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid
al-Maktoum and his Godolphin Stables, said: ``I thought it was a
good work. He started off a bit steady, and picked it up well and
finished strong. Jerry said he always felt there was something
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, all his works are fairly consistent. They are slow
and steady the first part, and then finish up. He usually goes in
1:27 and change to 1:29.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey then drove to Cincinnati to fly to New York, and Worldly
Manner was led back to his stall in Barn 45. Meanwhile, it was
Aljabr's turn on the track. And with Brian Procter riding, the colt
ran a quarter-mile in 28 2/5 seconds and seven-eighths in 1:31.
Hewing to the party line, Albertrani said, ``I thought he went
well, and finished up good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sheik's horses weren't the only ones going into the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, who became one of the favorites by winning four of his
five starts, including the Blue Grass Stakes, turned in a snappy
five-furlong workout later in the morning in a minute flat. Both
his owner, Arthur Hancock, and his trainer, Elliott Walden,
expressed pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for a good sharp workout over the track,'' said
Hancock, who won the Derby in 1982 with Gato del Sol and in 1989
with Sunday Silence. ``It tells me whether they like the track.
This horse had it this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden, who trained Victory Gallop last year when the colt ran
second in the Derby and Preakness and first in the Belmont, said:
``He worked super. He had running on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other unknowns in the Derby was whether fillies would
challenge the colts or stick to the Kentucky Oaks the day before.
So far, only Three Ring was an announced candidate for the Derby.
But Bob Baffert has two exceptional fillies in his barn,
Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting, who breezed five furlongs
Sunday morning in 59 1/5 seconds and finished out six furlongs in
1:12 flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both fillies will run in the Oaks,'' Baffert said
afterward. ``But we may cross-enter Excellent Meeting in the Derby.
Both of them have been so impressive in their works here. The key
at Churchill Downs is the turns, and both fillies just smoke around
the turns.''

<P>
   Question: What do you get when you add two and two?
</P>
<P>
   If you think the only possible answer is four, you are obviously
not an accountant who specializes in mergers. These days, there can
be wildly different answers depending on which method of accounting
you use, not to mention what country you are in.
</P>
<P>
   Now the people whose job it is to set accounting standards are
trying to standardize things. That effort is bringing fear and
trepidation to corporate boardrooms amid forecasts that anything
that reduces accounting flexibility could depress the merger wave
that has enriched both stockholders and investment bankers. The
deal makers may well provoke a battle in Congress if the rule
makers are not nice enough to them.
</P>
<P>
   The first salvo was fired last week when the Financial
Accounting Standards Board _ the American rule maker _ voted
unanimously to abolish a type of merger accounting called pooling.
That accounting, which is not allowed in other countries, lets a
company that buys another one pretend it paid far less than it
really did. So assets go on the books at a fraction of their value,
and when they are sold it looks as if there was a profit even if
there was not. Companies that want to make acquisitions love
pooling.
</P>
<P>
   The FASB is to be commended for that decision, but harder work
lies ahead. Now it will decide what changes need to be made in the
other form of merger accounting, called purchase accounting.
Corporate America hopes the board will set rules that let companies
get costs out of the way as quickly as possible, ideally in a way
that investors will be more likely to overlook and that minimizes
the reduction in profits that are to be reported in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the board does not go along with corporate wishes, says
Robert Willens, an accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers, ``people
will not stand for it'' and ``it is almost inevitable that Congress
will get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   What is amazing about all this is that the accounting should not
matter, since it does not affect the actual cash income of the
merged company. But, says Ed Jenkins, the chairman of the FASB,
corporate executives tell him that they fear investors will not
understand and will send a stock price down if reported earnings
are affected. He notes, many executive bonus plans are tied to
reported earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The current system has been widely abused and has needed
reforming for years. Because accounting for deals is so complicated
and contradictory, it has become difficult even for accountants to
compare companies. Moreover, it sometimes turns out that one
would-be buyer of a company can use a preferred accounting
treatment but a rival bidder cannot. That gives the first bidder a
big advantage. Standardization will help, even if the rules are
generous.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules once were highly technical things that drew
little attention from Congress. But that changed in 1994 when the
Senate voted against a proposed accounting rule that would have
reduced reported earnings by companies that issue a lot of stock
options. The FASB backed down, and companies were emboldened. But
an effort to get Congress to overturn a new rule on accounting for
derivatives flopped last year.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech companies that were the angriest about the options
rule are up in arms again because they fear that investors will be
alarmed by lower reported earnings. If the accounting board does
get tough, it will be interesting to see if Congress again
intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the prospect of tough accounting rules on
mergers is likely to intensify the merger boom, as companies try to
get deals done before the end of next year, when the new rules
would likely take effect.

YALE PROPERTY LINE EXPANDS AGAIN, TO NEIGHBORS' IRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Residents' anger over expansion by Yale
University, the city's largest employer and landowner, goes back
decades.
</P>
<P>
   When the university wanted to build two new dormitories in the
early 1970s, the Board of Aldermen rejected the plan, which Yale
eventually dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and early 1990s, Yale added three buildings to its
central campus as total enrollment grew by more than 950 by the
fall of 1993, to 10,975, a number it has hovered around since.
</P>
<P>
   Then Richard Levin became Yale's president. As a New Haven
resident for 23 years, he was well aware of the town-vs.-gown
hostility, but he stepped up the pace of property acquisition: Over
$20 million has been spent for at least 19 New Haven properties
since he took office in July 1993, according to city records and
Yale officials. And more acquisitions have been announced,
including a $5 million purchase of 10 properties on College and
Chapel streets.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents worry about the extent to which the university is
shaping the city. ``There is a concern that Yale is a little like a
conquering army, cleaning out the culture of what they conquer and
replacing it with their own,'' said Anstress Farwell, a founder of
a New Haven preservation group that is suing Yale to prevent it
from demolishing a 19th-century cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Yale officials like Bruce Alexander, the university's vice
president and director of New Haven and state affairs, disagree
with that characterization. Alexander, a former executive with
Rouse Corp., the developer of the South Street Seaport in New York,
said, ``This is not Yale's imprint on planning and development;
this is a partnership between Yale and the city.''
</P>
<P>
   While many New Haven residents have mixed feelings about Yale's
efforts _ they like seeing buildings spruced up but hate seeing
longtime businesses evicted _ some people are furious about the
university's plans to demolish the cottage at 85 Trumbull St. as
part of its plan to build a formal entrance to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   A group of preservationists called Friends of Hillhouse Avenue
is suing the university to save the building, known as Maple
Cottage, which is in a district listed on the National Register of
Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   And an even wider circle of historians and preservationists
objected to a bill introduced in the state's General Assembly at
Yale's request that would have made it harder to sue educational
institutions over the destruction of historic buildings. The bill
died in committee in early April, and legislators say it is
unlikely to be reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
   Yale is also managing its retail properties more aggressively.
In a retail strip near campus that stretches from Mory's restaurant
on York Street around the corner to the new Barnes &AMP; Noble Yale
Bookstore on Broadway, Alexander would eventually like to carve
room for a student clothing store and a large restaurant, plans
that would shuffle existing tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Yale already owns most of the retail properties here, and many
of the tenants are mom-and-pop stores that say they depend on the
university for 80 percent of their customers. Alexander insists the
university wants a balance of chain stores and independents. But
its reputation among the family-owned businesses sank when the
university removed the 111-year-old Yale Co-op bookstore in favor
of Barnes &AMP; Noble in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners acknowledge that Yale's involvement in the area has
been beneficial. The area was ``a dump'' before Yale got involved,
said George Koutroumanis, a co-owner of Yorkside Pizza and
Restaurant, which is in one of the few buildings on York Street
that the university does not own.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, Yale ``has to take into consideration not just
the students' needs, the needs of the school, but the people who
have been the stronghold of this area for years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tony Mongillo, who runs Y Haircutting on York Street, said Yale
wants his business to move upstairs from the Yale-owned
street-level space because the university sees it as a
``destination'' business, meaning customers would come no matter
where it is. But he disagrees. ``It's a walk-in business; we don't
have appointments,'' he said. ``We move upstairs, we're going to
lose the walk-in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Brause, the owner of the Quality Wine Shop, which has
been on Broadway since 1934, would also have to move a short
distance. Yale will cover the costs of new lighting, heating and
air conditioning, Brause said, but he estimates that the move will
cost him $25,000 to $30,000 for shelving, computer-system wiring,
custom lighting, and a new walk-in refrigerator. ``It's not
cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yale is also increasingly moving into residential neighborhoods.
In the Dixwell neighborhood north of campus, for example, Yale
hopes to acquire a two-acre plot on Lock Street, the site of an old
laundry-company building. To the west of the site lies the
university gym and a new residence hall; to the north are housing
projects. A Yale police substation is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the neighborhood have embraced Yale's desire to buy the
land, preferring the university to an asbestos company that had
also considered the property. But others are wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sleeping with an elephant,'' said Jerry Tureck, head
of a Dixwell community group. ``It can be the friendliest elephant
in the world, but every time it turns over you worry you might get
in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale officials say they have made big strides in bettering
town-gown relations. Alexander, for instance, spends much of his
time at community events, speaking at neighborhood association
meetings and dining regularly with Mayor John DeStefano Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said one thing that has reduced tensions is a state
law that gives local governments partial reimbursements for the
revenue they lose on tax-exempt property owned by colleges and
hospitals. This year New Haven will receive $19.5 million for taxes
lost on land owned by Yale, a city spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, Yale's president, said better relations with the city are
crucial to Yale's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous historical suspicion of the university's
motives in the city,'' he said. ``In earlier years, Yale would try
to accomplish things without truly having laid the groundwork,
without having a strong relationship with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, he said, ``our effectiveness depends on being taken
seriously as a partner by the community.''

EUROPEANS COUNT ON U.S. TO CARRY OUT KEY NATO ROLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States leads in NATO because if there is
to be such a grand Euro-Atlantic alliance the United States must
lead it.
</P>
<P>
   Britain or France could lead, but no one would pay much
attention for long. Germany could lead, but everyone would pay too
much attention and quickly start talking about 1870, 1914 and 1939.
</P>
<P>
   For thin-skinned Europeans, the only thing worse than the United
States leading is the United States not leading.
</P>
<P>
   So, from the alliance's founding until its 50th anniversary
summit that concluded Sunday, U.S. leadership has been a
cornerstone of NATO and its success.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has brought Europe closer than ever to a wholly free,
democratic continent, what the State Department's John Holum called
``one of history's most elusive dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that strategic American role is to continue or how it
will be changed was a subtext to the summit proceedings, just as it
has been on both sides of the Atlantic since the end of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   For most, it's not much of a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is going to remain the key European power
for a long time to come,'' Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the
French Institute of Foreign Relations, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   That ``may not be good news'' for Americans, Moisi conceded,
because it will not be an inexpensive project _ most often the
point raised by U.S. politicians who take any exception to
Washington's dominating role in the defense alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The key U.S. position in the alliance is especially visible
during a conflict such as the Balkans _ ``the kind of war we cannot
wage without you,'' Moisi said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is providing and delivering the vast majority
of the missiles and bombs against the forces of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The centrality of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization is why the Clinton administration's reticence on even
planning for a ground invasion of Yugoslavia was troubling to many
policy-makers, analysts and ordinary citizens. It was a strange
display of U.S. reluctance in the lead-up to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   It was such an unusual vacuum that British Prime Minister Tony
Blair rushed to fill it. He pressed until the leaders of other NATO
member nations at least consented to telling the allied military
planners to dust off some six-month old blueprints for ground
troops in Kosovo and to update them.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's move excited the neo-isolationist right in the United
States, with Republican presidential contender Pat Buchanan on
Sunday calling the British leader ``the mouse that roared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not going to be British troops hopping up that road to
Belgrade, but American kids, U.S. Marines, airborne divisions, and
that is not a vital interest of this country,'' Buchanan said on
NBC's Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., argued the
importance _ for the United States, Europe and the world beyond _
of succeeding against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Without a NATO victory, Lieberman said, ``there will be no fear.
Tyrants in Europe and Asia and the Middle East will run wild,
because there's no one on the block to speak for the values and the
security that we hold dear.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, some analysts argue, the United States is
better off with a fight in Europe. For the United States, ``Europe
is still the best available and reliable partner,'' said Margarita
Mathiopoulos, a senior adviser at British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still questions about sharing the financial and
personnel burdens of such an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans have to do more than talk'' about their own security
arrangements, said retired Gen. George Joulwan, the former NATO
commander. For one thing, he said, they must begin to pay more of
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in NATO's history, costs were not as difficult for some
Americans to swallow as the mutual-security concept itself.
</P>
<P>
   In his toast at a White House dinner on Friday night for the
leader of NATO nations, Clinton pointed out that forming the
alliance was ``a radical departure'' for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been warned from the time of our first president,
George Washington, against entangling alliances with other
nations,'' Clinton recalled. ``But we learned the hard way, after
World War I, that the warning was no longer valid in the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   And since World War II, the United States has been firmly
anchored in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At some times, as Czech Ambassador Alexander Vondra pointed out
recently, a U.S.-led NATO serves to ``keep one European power from
taking over.'' And even that can lead to continental grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Blair, on Meet the Press, urged Americans not
to take the frequent criticism to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you may read and hear about Europeans and what they
think and say about America, I tell you people are truly
grateful,'' Blair said.

ASYLUM RULE URGED FOR SEX-BASED PERSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., said Sunday that the case of a 29-year-old woman
from Ghana who says she fled to the United States because she
feared that her tribe's leaders were going to cut her genitals,
demonstrated the need to turn immigration guidelines on sex-based
persecution into binding regulations or laws.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, introduced by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in 1995, advise asylum officers that certain forms of
sex-based persecution can be grounds for asylum. Other guidelines
cover persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political
opinion or membership in a particular social group.
</P>
<P>
   However, because guidelines are not binding, they are often
disregarded, the Democratic legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to the case of Adelaide Abankwah, who has been held
for two years at the Wackenhut Detention Center in Queens while she
awaits final judgment on her asylum petition. Ms. Abankwah has been
at the center longer than any other detainee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah said she fled her village because she had lost her
virginity in violation of the customs of her tribe and she was
afraid tribal elders were going to cut her genitals as punishment.
An immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Review have
denied Ms. Abankwah's petition, saying that while her fear of
returning home is genuine, she has not proved that she would be
subjected to cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the guidelines are good, but they're not
mandatory,'' Schumer said at a news conference at Federal Plaza in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Justice Department to turn the sex-based guidelines
into binding regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maloney said she would reintroduce her bill that would turn
the sex-based guidelines into law. The measure failed to get out of
committee last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers were joined by about a dozen supporters of Ms.
Abankwah, among them Gloria Steinem. Some wore T-shirts with Ms.
Abankwah's picture and the words, ``Free Adelaide Now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no length that we would not go to free Adelaide,''
Ms. Steinem said. ``We have met her, and there is a human bond
between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah's case is scheduled to be heard May 3 by the 2nd
U.S Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Through letters and telephone calls, Ms. Maloney and Schumer
have urged the Justice Department to drop its objections to Ms.
Abankwah's petition. They have also asked that Ms. Abankwah be
released while she awaits a final judgment.

TV REVIEW: MEET THE SMALL FAMILY, AFTER THE DIVORCE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It must take a great deal of effort to turn out an animated show
that looks and sounds like a clever rough draft. The producers of
``Home Movies,'' which starts its run Monday night on the UPN
network, are clearly proud of their techniques, which they also use
in their Comedy Central hit, ``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist.''
They have aptly named their sketchy, jumpy visual style
Squigglevision. And if the dialogue seems hastily ad-libbed and out
of sync with the animation, that's on purpose, too. The dubbing
technique had been dubbed Retroscripting.
</P>
<P>
   The central character in ``Home Movies'' is an odd but bright
8-year-old who makes precocious videos with titles like ``The Dark
Side of the Law'' (followed by the sequel, ``The Dark Side of the
Law II''). The boy's name is Brendon Small, which is also the name
of the man who provides his voice. Brendon's newly single mother,
played by the comic Paula Poundstone, is called Paula. His best
friend, Melissa, has the voice of Melissa Bardin Galsky. And
Brendon's fool of a soccer coach, McGuirk (``rhymes with jerk''),
is H. Jon Benjamin, who also plays Ben on ``Dr. Katz.'' Benjamin
does double duty here, also playing Brendon's friend Snot-Nosed
Jason. Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast shares writing credit. That's Retroscripting for
you.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's episode, the only sample of the series
provided for review, McGuirk takes Paula on a date. Brendon is
understandably traumatized. Paula, who keeps her expectations as
low as possible, wears her sweat suit and red baseball cap to the
restaurant, where McGuirk says, ``I don't want to get into a whole
conversation about anything.'' (None of these characters,
apparently, ever changes clothes.)
</P>
<P>
   Paula turns down McGuirk's invitation for another date,
prompting him to declare to Brendon, ``Women are like men, but men
are not like women.'' If you're the least bit tempted to wonder if
that means something, this show is definitely not for you.
</P>
<P>
   The dry dialogue is mumbled in an odd singsong cadence
reminiscent of a Woody Allen film or an old Nichols and May
routine. But while this improv team may have the rhythm, that's not
enough to sustain interest between the sprigs of wit that pop up
organically during Retroscripting.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the producers could only invent Retrovision, you could
come back later and see this show when it's finished.

   NEW YORK _ Clothes may make the man, but they surely shouldn't
make the musical. Yet what lingers in the memory about ``The
Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' is not the way the cast members
treat the old material; it's the way they wear the new material.
</P>
<P>
   The revue, which opened Sunday night at the Longacre Theater,
consists of 27 tunes by George and Ira Gershwin _ among them
standards like ``Embraceable You,'' ``Nice Work If You Can Get It''
and ``Someone to Watch Over Me'' _ performed in a jukebox
revolving-song format by an eager cast of 10.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been a suave showcase for up-and-comers, a kind
of ``New Faces of 1999.'' But as conceived by the director Mark
Lamos and the musical arranger Mel Marvin, the lackluster
production wastes talented young dancers and singers like Michael
Berresse, Darius de Haas, Adriane Lenox and Patrick Wilson. Instead
of warm echoes of the New Faces series on Broadway, you get tinny
and sweaty reminders of television's ``Star Search.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamos, who first staged ``Fascinating Rhythm'' two years ago in
Hartford, Conn., where he was the longtime artistic director of
Hartford Stage, never achieves the brooding, sultry pop-and-soul
updating of the Gershwins' ebulliently romantic song book that he
apparently has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pushiness in the effort to be chic, glamorous and
sexy that undercuts the Gershwin style; glistening abs and tight
T-shirts are false fashion statements in the more sophisticated
universe the Gershwins evoked. It's one thing to turn ``Isn't It a
Pity?'' into a lesbian duet, and quite another to cheapen the song
by ending it with one of the performers unzipping her top.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute show is obsessed with getting actors in and out of
clothes. It's almost as if the costume designer, Paul Tazewell,
thought his job was to draw attention away from the music. For
Woody Allen, Gershwin evokes dusk in Gramercy Park; for Lamos, it's
an afternoon at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The song stylings make much punier impressions than the
Gap-style outfits in which they are rendered; you're likely to
recall individual numbers by their color coding. De Haas sings
``Little Jazz Bird'' in yellow hat and shoes and purple jacket; Ms.
Lenox is in a silver skintight bodysuit with a pink fake-fur collar
for ``My Cousin in Milwaukee'' and for ``I Love to Rhyme,'' and the
ensemble dons black suits with exaggerated pinstripes that look
like lane dividers on major highways.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, even the oversize tap shoes used in ``I Got Rhythm''
make the dancers look klutzy. And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yeargan's unappealing set, resembling something you see
on televised award shows, reinforces the notion that this is all a
mock fashion shoot. Its main feature is a wall that closes like the
shutter on a camera.
</P>
<P>
   The songs are almost all well known, drawn from the Gershwins'
Broadway shows, including ``Lady Be Good'' (1924), ``Strike Up the
Band'' (1927) and ``Girl Crazy'' (1930), and from the 1930's movies
they wrote for, like ``Shall We Dance?'' and ``The Goldwyn
Follies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some numbers seem wholly reimagined _ ``Clap Yo' Hands,'' from
the 1926 musical ``Oh, Kay!'' is sung to a '60s rock 'n' roll beat
by the single-named performer Orfeh _ while others are given fairly
traditional renditions, among them a tepid ``Let's Call the Whole
Thing Off'' by Orfeh and de Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, what works is what isn't tampered with. Wilson, with
a big, embracing power, does well by ``But Not for Me'' and ``How
Long Has This Been Going On?,'' and a quintet's straightforward
``Someone to Watch Over Me,'' allowed to breathe, is lovely in its
simplicity. These, however, are infrequent oases. Most songs come
and go in a forgettable roundel, which is something of an
accomplishment given the breathtaking assault of the Gershwins' hit
parade.
</P>
<P>
   With their glazed smiles, the performers, unfortunately, develop
no rapport with the audience or one another. Having seen many of
them excel in other surroundings, it's hard to hold them
accountable.

OUTLOOK GRIM FOR SITTING DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Grim Reaper made a house call to the Pond on
Sunday, but it was one Stu Grimson and the Mighty Ducks would just
as soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 239-pound goon received a match penalty for cross
checking Detroit's Kris Draper at 3:04 of the second period. Eighty
seconds later Steve Yzerman put the Red Wings in front to stay and
they went on to defeat the Ducks 4-2 before 17,174.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings take a 3-0 series
lead into Tuesday night's Game 4. The Ducks have lost seven
straight postseason games to the Red Wings, dating back to
Detroit's sweep in the second round of the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Guy Hebert's allowing a soft goal to Sergei Fedorov
at 1:43 of the first period, the Ducks were nearly flawless in the
opening 20 minutes and took a 2-1 lead to the dressing room on the
strength of power play goals by Marty McInnis and Jason Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   But all the Ducks' hard work went up in smoke in the first 4{
minutes of the second period. Detroit's Tomas Holmstrom tied the
game 2-2 at 1:51 when he was credited with a goal even though the
replay appeared to show that his stick was above the level of the
crossbar when he deflected the puck past Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1{ minutes later, Grimson leveled Draper in front of
the Detroit bench, just moments after a delayed penalty had been
called on Travis Green. That put the Ducks at a two-man
disadvantage for two minutes and Yzerman cashed in the opportunity
on a rebound at 4:24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a bad break on the high stick (Holmstrom's goal), but
then we cracked and gave them a five-on-three,'' said Anaheim coach
Craig Hartsburg. ``That's all that team needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to win a game, but we took it away from
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimson, who was brought back to Anaheim to protect the likes of
Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne, said he was coming to the defense of
Antti Aalto but admitted his timing was far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any momentum, it was theirs, but we were still in
the game,'' said Grimson, who was waiting for reporters when the
dressing room opened. ``I really think that the game turned on that
one specific incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg wasn't about to quibble with his enforcer's
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just undisciplined. You can't do that any time,
especially in the playoffs,'' Grimson said. ``You hate to learn a
lesson like that. You are playing the best team in the world right
now and those kinds of mistakes cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks managed to kill off the remainder of Grimson's
penalty, but Detroit expertly protected its lead, especially after
Vyacheslav Kozlov scored on a rebound at 1:54 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they took the lead, we really had a tough time generating
any scoring chances,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks managed only 11 shots in the final 40 minutes after
outshooting Detroit 13-4 in the first period. Teemu Selanne was
held without a shot in the game and Kariya managed only one in the
last two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' last gasp came with eight seconds left in the second,
when the red light came on behind Detroit goalie Chris Osgood after
Kariya's wrist shot from the right circle beat him cleanly. But
referee Don Koharski quickly ruled that the puck had merely hit the
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it went in,'' said Kariya. ``But obviously it
didn't, according to the replay.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Hebert failed to stop Fedorov 35-footer on Detroit's
first shot of the game, Anaheim came storming back.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis tied the game at 9:33 when Fredrik Olausson's centering
pass deflected off Selanne's skates right to the Anaheim forward.
The Ducks took a 2-1 lead at 15:14 when Jason Marshall picked up
his first NHL playoff goal, beating Osgood on the glove side at the
end of a four-minute high sticking penalty to Doug Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But Detroit is hard to keep down for long, especially if the
other team is helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why they've won two Stanley Cups,'' said
Kariya. ``They are experienced and confident. . . . We are learning
a lesson now.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Something in Dylan Klebold's voice had
spooked his mother that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goodbye had an edge to it,'' the mother, Susan Klebold,
told a family pastor, describing her son's tone last Tuesday
morning as ``almost fatalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought, maybe he's in a bad mood,'' the Rev. Don
Marxhausen said. ``Maybe he's got a test today or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's father, Thomas Klebold, 52, a former geophysicist who
runs a mortgage business from his house, told the pastor he had
detected ``this slight tension'' in his son a few days before the
attack. Klebold made a mental note of it and thought he would get
back to it, the pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold never did. On Tuesday, Dylan Klebold, 17, and his best
friend, Eric Harris, 18, ambushed their classmates and teachers at
Columbine High School with a storm of gunfire and pipe bombs,
taking 13 lives before fatally shooting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As new details of the young men's behavior come to light, there
is an portrait of their friendship and of their relationship with
their families. It is a portrait that remains as puzzling as their
attack on their school.
</P>
<P>
   Many students in the school have described the young men as
being obsessed with Nazi history, and the police now say the two
planned the attack for Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But Klebold is the great-grandson of a prominent Jewish
philanthropist. His father is Lutheran, and for a time the family
attended a church. At Passover this year, the Klebolds had a seder,
Marxhausen said, and Dylan asked the traditional four questions at
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances of the gunmen have said they detested athletes
because of the way they were treated by them. But Klebold
participated in a baseball fantasy league.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of the Boston Red Sox, he was one of a dozen students who
took part in a fantasy baseball draft party recently, said one of
the participants, who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent display of his penchant for slurs, Klebold called
his team the Border Hoppers and chose the Taco Bell logo as his
team symbol.
</P>
<P>
   They affected the trappings of ``Goth'' culture, wearing black
clothing, spouting German phrases and listening to German
techno-pop music. But they were also good students and, like
hundreds of other Columbine youths, held after-school jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While Klebold, 6-foot-4 and lanky, was often outgoing, Harris
was much quieter. Other students say Harris often scowled in
response to a greeting.
</P>
<P>
   A former teammate of Harris' in youth baseball in Plattsburgh,
N.Y., said young Eric lacked self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really like baseball a lot, but said that his dad
pushed him to play Little League because every kid in Plattsburgh
played it,'' said the former teammate, Brendon LaPier. ``He was the
kind of kid who didn't mind being alone, and he spent a lot of time
in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harris family also lived for a time in Oscada, Mich. The
Rev. William Stone, a neighbor there, said he recalled the father
putting up a basketball backboard in the driveway and playing ball
with Eric and his brother, Kevin, who is two years older. Kevin
would go on to play football for the Rebels of Columbine High. He
was seen as popular with the crowd, ``just the kind of guy his
brother was gunning for,'' said Steve Berg, a classmate of the
elder Harris brother.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said that the Harris family ``cared for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, Harris lived in a new two-story house at the end
of a cul-de-sac. The Klebold home was much grander, a sleek
glass-and-cedar house that backed up to the spectacular redstone of
Dear Creek Canyon. The Klebolds also had a carriage house that they
rented out.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of both boys, described by friends as decent and
caring people from stable homes, have issued statements of sympathy
over the attack. But the authorities have come to the conclusion
that the parents should have had some idea of what was going on
inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said on Saturday that the
sawed-off barrel of a shotgun and bomb-making materials were
``clearly visible'' in the bedroom of one of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the weapons were in places where stuffed
animals might be found in the bedrooms of other teen-agers. ``The
parents should have known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen, one of the clergymen who conducted a private funeral
service for Klebold on Saturday, said the young man's father told
him he ``felt Dylan was his soulmate, and felt that he knew what
was going on all the time.'' The pastor said the elder Klebold had
told him, `` `I thought I was ready to let him go _ he was a
finished product.'''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the shootings, Mrs. Klebold sent off a deposit
for their son's dormitory room at the University of Arizona, where
they believed he had planned to enroll in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the diary found by the police shows that the two young men
expected to die in the attack they had been plotting for a year, an
act of revenge on the popular crowd they blamed for making them
feel like outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young people who knew Klebold and Harris were
shocked at the shootings. Some friends, however, say they had heard
Klebold and Harris make comments about blowing up the school.
</P>
<P>
   And the two young men, members of a disaffected clique known as
the trench coat mafia, produced a video in school that simulates an
armed attack on athletes. They had a well-known fascination for
death, gore, and Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Harris even maintained a Web site that advertised his
machinations of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to wonder, how could people not have known what was
happening?'' said Debbie Wilder, 38, who lives a few doors from the
Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend before the shootings, neighbors said the two
young men had made such a ruckus smashing glass in the Harris
garage _ making shrapnel for bombs, residents now suspect _ that
the noise disturbed children playing in the nearby cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think you'd be aware that kids are building
bombs in your house,'' Mrs. Wilder said.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, Harris posted violent threats. He had also
mused about killing large numbers of people in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the law, if you don't like it, you die,'' he had written.
``If I don't like you or I don't like what you want me to do, you
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brown, who said his son, Brooks, a fellow student, had
been threatened by Harris with menacing messages on the Internet,
says he took a 14-page printout of the rantings to the police. The
sheriff's department acknowledged receiving a report about Harris'
writings, but said that no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold had a fondness for role-playing games and the
violent computer games Doom and Quake. They listened to the
sado-masochistic tinged music of German techno-rock. They were
arrested last year for breaking into a car to steal tools, and were
placed in a diversion program for juveniles, where they earned high
marks in an evaluation for being bright and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   They were also good students who held jobs and caused no grief
to school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lau, who owns Blackjack Pizza, where the two young
men worked three to five nights a week, said they always showed up
on time and worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for answers and looking for answers,'' Lau
said. ``There's no clear answers. It's going to haunt us _ it's
going to haunt me for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Valentine, who runs a computer store in Littleton, said
Klebold had applied for a job, sending a resume that claimed he
``built my personal computer and helped build those of friends and
family.'' He said he offered the young man a job _ ``He has all the
right stuff to be a technician'' _ but that Klebold failed to show
up on his first day.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stair, who was a member of the trench coat mafia before
graduating from high school last year, said he chatted with Klebold
and Harris last fall in a car outside the school, as they smoked
cigarettes during lunch period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about being hassled by the jocks,'' Stair
said, saying that athletes in the school often picked on Klebold
and Harris, among other students deemed unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of the Class of '99 at Columbine High School
appears to be a striking example of the marginalized status of
these two young men. In a sea of mostly smiling faces, Klebold and
Harris, heads bent and eyes a bit downcast, are as far toward a
corner as they can be _ quite literally on the fringes of the
crowd.

JOKER IS WILD: BAFFERT BIDS FOR HIS THIRD KENTUCKY DERBY VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz, Calif., Ore.)  (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The camera crews hustled to get out of his way
and their subject was uncharacteristically oblivious to them. Bob
Baffert was working. He had a two-way radio in one hand, a
stopwatch in the other, and a chestnut gelding barreling around the
turn beneath those twin spires that make Churchill Downs horse
racing's signature postcard.
</P>
<P>
   He paced. He stood on tiptoes to get a better view. He cooed
instructions in the two-way to his horse, first through his
exercise rider's headset who relayed them to General Challenge
through her hands. When the likely Kentucky Derby favorite
blistered six furlongs in 1 minute 12 seconds, Baffert asked for
more. ``Let him gallop out strong,'' he barked. ``Keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   That worked for him and his horse.
</P>
<P>
   When General Challenge pounded out a mile in 1:38 3/5, Baffert
popped both arms in the air and shouted, ``Goooooaaaal!'' in the
exaggerated manner of soccer announcers.
</P>
<P>
   That worked for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Without dead-fit horses and telegenic exuberance, Baffert
wouldn't be in the position he is in now: with the chance to win an
unprecedented third consecutive Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Strict preparation and high spirits have always coexisted within
Baffert. His acumen as a horseman has taken him from small-time
Arizona quarter-horse trainer to thoroughbred racing's most
successful conditioner. His manic charisma has brought
deep-pocketed owners to his stable and celebrity beyond his sport.
</P>
<P>
   He has won the last two national training titles, leads the
current earnings standing with more than $4.5 million and, in
General Challenge and Prime Timber, will saddle two top threats for
the Derby _ maybe four if he enters the fillies Excellent Meeting
and Silverbulletday, the only two horses among the Derby's current
candidates to have earned more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect me to win this year; I'm not going to be able to
sneak up on anybody this time,'' Baffert said, sounding sorry about
it. ``But none of this happened overnight. I've been a student of
this game for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, 46, says he is different than the funny guy who, at his
first Derby in 1996, cut a startlingly fresh figure with his white
hair, shades like John Lennonuse to wear, pressed jeans and
starched shirts. He was here with a horse named Cavonnier, a single
groom and a pocketful of witty just-happy-to-be-here observations.
</P>
<P>
   When Cavonnier lost by a nose to Grindstone, it was nearly a
dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   The dream did come true in 1997 with a victory by Silver Charm,
a gray purchased for $85,000. And what was it like last year, when
Real Quiet, a $17,000 purchase, won for Baffert's friend, Mike
Pegram, who prodded and then bankrolled Baffert's switch from
quarter horses to thoroughbreds?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Baffert said, ``it was a rush, a sense of overwhelming
gratitude, and it made me want to keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Baffert is not only back, but also has become a vivid
illustration of how big-time racing outfits are born in a sport in
which the stars are four-legged and the average trainer is a hybrid
of coach, general manager and ticket seller. The compact Baffert
outfit that accompanied Cavonnier has been replaced by 15 stable
hands, two assistant trainers and 32 horses _ double last year's
string _ all of whom will remain stabled at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The modestly priced Silver Charm and Real Quiet have been
replaced by the $375,000 Prime Timber and the $175,000
Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber is owned by the Oregon timber magnate Aaron Jones,
a longtime horse owner who had scaled back his involvement in the
late 1980s, when Baffert got his attention. Jones didn't know
Baffert, but he was impressed by his eye for talent. Silver Charm.
Real Quiet. Jones contacted him and told him to buy him a Kentucky
Derby horse.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday is a Pegram splurge made affordable by his and
Baffert's successes.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow trainer, Eddie Plesa, said: ``The No. 1 thing we do is
recruit, recruit, recruit. We got to find the horses. We got to
find the owners to buy the horses. The bottom line is to win, then
you need national exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Plesa, whose small Derby contingent with the filly Three Ring
brings back memories of Baffert's Cavonnier days, said: ``I was the
under bidder for Prime Timber. I saw Bob buy him and I knew why.
We're all working to afford those kind of horses.''
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert's shades and western wear remain in place and he
continues to entertain the growing news media throng outside his
barn, he operates now with a more sober perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I don't make that much money,'' he said.
``I've got a huge overhead. I have 90 horses in training I'm
responsible for. I'm working on next year's Derby. I'm looking for
horses to buy for the Derbies down the road. The part I like best
is actually training the horse, and that's just a small part of my
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before two-way radios and television cameras were a staple
of Baffert's workouts, he had a knack for making horses run.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard-learned. He grew up on a farm in Nogales, Ariz., and
learned to train horses from his father. He rode briefly as a
quarter-horse jockey and then, in 1976, showed up at California's
Los Alamitos race track with four horses and a goat that he says
was ``worth more than all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a proficient trainer, but couldn't break through with
a victory in the lucrative Futurity races. In the late 1970s, after
his father took a horse away from him to train himself, he quit. He
worked as a substitute teacher for $20 a day. When he was assigned
a junior-high history class for the remainder of the year, he was
the one that got the best education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed up the night before and read the history book before
each class,'' he said. ``It taught me there was plenty I could
still learn.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He returned to quarter horse racing and by 1990 was a two-time
winner of one of the sport's showcase races, Champion of Champions,
at Los Alamitos, and saddled 90 winners that year.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Pegram, who owns McDonald's franchises in the
Northwest, had chipped in $1 million and told Baffert to train
thoroughbreds. He scratched out just 9 victories in 69 starts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, though, he won the Breeders' Cup sprint with Thirty
Slews. It was around then that Bob Lewis introduced himself to
Baffert at the so-called Clocker's Corner on the Santa Anita back
stretch. Lewis had overheard the animated Baffert commiserating
about his luck in a fashion that had a cluster of horsemen
rollicking, but immediately discovered the qualities that have
Baffert on the verge of making Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for compatibility, chemistry, and here was this
guy willing to have some fun,'' said Lewis, who with his wife,
Beverly, owns Silver Charm and 22 other horses in Baffert's stable.
``But he had this humility. One of the first things he told me was:
`I do pretty good with sprints. I don't know nothing about going
long and I need to take some lessons.'''
</P>
<P>
   He took them by watching a trainer in the barn across from him:
the legendary Charlie Whittingham, who died last week at 86. As
Whittingham did, Baffert works his horses hard and fast. He decides
what is best for them by feel, not program. The two-way radio
allows him to dictate workouts as he sees them. Baffert is the rare
trainer who can successfully guide horses through the grueling
Triple Crown series and on to successful careers as older horses,
as he has done with Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my horses dead fit,'' Baffert said. ``I don't believe
in racing them into shape. If they aren't ready they don't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the cameras, Baffert concedes he feels the pressure
and is braced for a backlash _ hinted at by some recently
publicized piques. One was an argument with the agent for jockey
Chris McCarron after he named Gary Stevens to ride General
Challenge in the Santa Anita Derby. The McCarron camp thought they
had the ride; Baffert thought he made it clear that Stevens, his
No. 1 rider, would be up if available.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert apologized, but the incident, along with some words
exchanged with writers over their coverage of the recent losing
efforts of Silver Charm and Real Quiet, have injected a little
heartbreak in what had been a long-running romance.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert still insists that he wants his Derby week to be the
mini-vacation it has been the past three years _ a time to
celebrate accomplishing his stable's real goal no matter how large
the operation has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting here. Horse racing's ultimate joker knows too well
his sport can't be all fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have humbling times,'' he said. ``Nobody is bigger
than this game. It can kill you at any time. Charlie's best quote
of all time was `Horses are like strawberries _ they can go bad on
you at anytime.'''  &QL;

   Stewart Macdonald, a former executive of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association who started its foundation and helped it
raise millions of dollars for education, died on April 18 in the
Hospice of Northern Virginia in Leesburg. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said Sig Gissler, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald was born in Newton, Kan. He graduated from the
University of Wisconsin in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   His award-winning promotional work for The Milwaukee Sentinel
and later The Waukegan News-Sun in Illinois brought him to the
attention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, the
trade association for daily newspapers, which hired him in 1963.
The group is now called the Newspaper Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Its foundation successfully promoted newspapers in schools.
Macdonald also led the association's program to establish
scholarships for black journalism students.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 until retiring in 1983, Macdonald was director of
public affairs for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lydia Irvine Macdonald of Reston,
Va.; three daughters, Laura Gunning of Portsmouth, N.H., Marcia
Macdonald of Wilmington, N.C., and Sarah Macdonald of Stillwater,
Okla.; a son, Andrew Macdonald of Carbondale, Ill., and his mother,
Pauline Macdonald of Reston.

KARIYA LEADING BUT NOT ON SCOREBOARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Paul Kariya was held scoreless in Sunday's
Game 3 loss to Detroit, but don't try to convince Anaheim Mighty
Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg that Kariya wasn't effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned in the playoffs is how competitive and
how much of a leader Paul Kariya is. That's why he's our captain,''
Hartsburg said. ``He has been unbelievable. If anybody needs to
look somewhere (for inspiration), Paul is where they should start
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who has a goal and four points in the series, was
credited with three shots, not including the one that rang off the
left post in the second period. But it was his physical play that
really stood out. He had three hits, including one that nearly
knocked Chris Chelios' helmet off in the first period. He also put
a big hit on veteran Larry Murphy in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   __ Them's the breaks:Detroit certainly got its share of good
breaks on Sunday. Tomas Holmstrom's deflection was ruled a goal on
a play that even Detroit coach Scotty Bowman admitted ``had to be
close, since they (the video goal judge and referee) took so much
time.'' The Wings also watched Kariya's bid to tie the game bounce
off the post in the second.
</P>
<P>
   But Teemu Selanne said Detroit is far from lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got breaks, but they earned them more,'' said Selanne.
``Good teams seem to get those breaks.
</P>
<P>
   __ More bad breaks:Kris Draper of the Red Wings had his jaw
broken by Claude Lemieux in the 1996 Western Conference finals, but
the gritty winger still knows how to use his jaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to talk with a stick in the mouth,'' said
Draper, who was cross checked by Stu Grimson in the second period.
``But we were able to put the puck in the net (on the ensuing power
play).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to shut me up. . . . I'm going to keep
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Worth every million:Bowman got more than his money's worth
from defensemen Nicklas Lidstrom and Chelios. They were matched
against Kariya and Teemu Selanne almost the whole game, limiting
the Ducks duo to one point (a power play assist by Selanne).
</P>
<P>
   Bowman thought the Red Wings were aided by the long television
timeouts; as a result, Lidstrom played 34:37 and Chelios 33:52. The
Detroit coach also said Chelios is benefiting from playing
alongside the underrated Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris hasn't had a partner like this since (Gary) Suter left
Chicago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defenders down: The Ducks were down to five defensemen most
of the game. Ruslan Salei suffered a right shoulder injury in the
first period and played less than six minutes. Hartsburg refused to
elaborate on the injury, but did say that Salei ``is questionable
for Tuesday's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Salei's injury put most of the load on Fredrik Olausson, Kevin
Haller, Jason Marshall, Pavel Trnka and Kevin Haller.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and Haller have been steady all series long, but the
Ducks needed better play from youngsters Pushor and Trnka, and
Sunday they got that.
</P>
<P>
   Trnka was especially impressive; he played nearly 23 minutes and
was credited with six hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played very well,'' said Hartsburg.

 (SUBS to delete the term ``a man's man'' from last sentence of 8th
graf, beginning ``He was blessed ...'')  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through smooth, singular voices Joe DiMaggio was most
artfully remembered on Sunday. Bob Sheppard recited the last
lineup. Paul Simon sang a fond farewell. The grainy black-and-white
video-screen images paled in competition with recollections of the
way things were, or we wished them to be.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have blooper videos when DiMaggio played, or 24-hour
cable sports news. They didn't have cameras trained on the dugout
to record for posterity every eruption of ire. The images are
spare, the memories select. Yogi Berra said he couldn't recall the
Yankee Clipper having ever made a mistake. Jerry Coleman thought of
one that DiMaggio had made, quickly realized and corrected, in two
simple steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught a fly ball and thought there were three outs,''
Coleman said Sunday before DiMaggio's monument was unveiled, and
the Yankees' center fielder, Bernie Williams, took his mystical cue
and drove in the winning run in a 4-3 victory over Toronto at
Yankee Stadium. ``He took two steps with his head down and then
reacted immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Coleman said, DiMaggio threw to the right base,
a perfect strike.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio was the last of his kind, a gifted American
original who was mostly filtered through radio, immortalized in
print, perfected by memory. Long into retirement, right to his
death, he worked obsessively at insulating himself from the
double-edged sword that often accompanies contemporary fame.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the camera, the bigger the blemish. When DiMaggio
played, there were a dozen newspapers in New York City, but there
were also private places where the public eye could not go. Hank
Bauer stood in the clubhouse Sunday and pointed to where DiMaggio
had once sat, in the vicinity where Tino Martinez now sits. He
recalled how DiMaggio used to spit between closed teeth on the post
that is no longer there.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say it, another thing to show it. Beyond his
indisputable grace and greatness on God's green grass, DiMaggio
might not have argued with a modern marketing slogan, Image Is
Everything. People who knew him always said that what DiMaggio
feared most was looking bad. He was no child of the television age,
but he married the most famous actress of his time. He learned from
her that the stars of most moving pictures play to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   So, what the heck. Most of the men who played with DiMaggio
didn't understand him or were completely in awe of him. They are
not about to start an argument with Americana. Nobody could seem to
recall on Sunday one time that DiMaggio got picked off first, or
broke in on the ball when he should have broke back. He was blessed
by New York's cardinal and sainted by several former teammates as
gracious and selfless, the ultimate teammate, even though the
whispers have always suggested something else.
</P>
<P>
   Simon slipped into a Yankees cap, lugged his acoustic guitar out
to shallow center field and sang his famous verse about lost
innocence, soundtrack for cinematic drama. For only those touching
moments when the voices of Simon and Sheppard turned a grand old
ball park into a Bronx time machine was it possible to forget that
innocence was lost last week not in song but within the supposed
sanctity of a school.
</P>
<P>
   Those Stadium flags were not flying half-staff Sunday for Joe D.
These are harsher, less private times, when power is visual and
images are unforgiving. It is fair to wonder: If DiMaggio played
under today's ``Truman Show'' conditions, would he have come across
more as Michael Jordan or as Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who has been calling games on the tube since he laid
down his glove, said he believed that DiMaggio, cranky as he was
with the concept of up-close, would have survived quite well under
the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can transfer people decade to decade,'' he said.
``The great stars could handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a Yankees second baseman for DiMaggio's last three
years, joined the team in 1949, a season in which an injured heel
limited DiMaggio to 76 games. There was a weekend in Boston,
though, when DiMaggio dusted off the cobwebs and hit four home runs
that empowered a Yankee sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the difference that year,'' Coleman said, his
point being that the great ones rise to the moment and transcend
their time, and that is why they could operate in any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have Jordan, Gretzky in hockey, and now you have a
quarterback going out,'' Coleman said. ``These people are giants.''
</P>
<P>
   When the venerable Sheppard enunciated the lineups from Game 6
of the 1951 World Series against the New York Giants, all it took
was closing one's eyes to feel as if 48 years had been erased. When
he announced DiMaggio, No. 5, batting fourth, playing center field,
who would have wanted to remember that DiMaggio had even made an
out in his life, much less a mistake?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan went out to global tributes a few months ago. Wayne
Gretzky made Canada cry and the rest of the hockey world sigh when
he quit last week. John Elway will get the forever treatment this
week when he announces he's through. We make the best players
bigger than the game, but Joe DiMaggio, with some stretching of the
truth, has for decades been made to be larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's left and gone away and, in all likelihood, taken the
concept with him.

   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   The moving man was tallying my possessions as I led him through
my Upper West Side apartment _ ``this bookcase, that bookcase,
sofa, four chairs, table, that bookcase ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's your new address?'' he asked, pencil poised.
</P>
<P>
   I named an Upper East Side building and he cocked a skeptical
eyebrow. ``You won't live there long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This observation from a stranger took me aback and I asked him
what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're obviously a West Sider _ you've got more books than
clothes,'' he said. ``East Siders have more clothes than books.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago. This month I hired him again to move me
back to the West Side.

Koutzen's memory of an incident when an old Columbia University
building on West 60th Street was being demolished. She stopped to
watch as the crew was removing doors and windows before swinging

``Why don't they take the bottom out first, and then the whole
thing'll go down.''

   Dear Diary:

   I was at Pennsylvania Station to catch a train to Long Island on
a recent Sunday when I saw a police officer approach a musician who
had a guitar, microphone and speakers. I thought I was going to
witness a ``quality of life'' arrest but instead, the officer
pointed to the microphone and with a nod from the musician, picked
it up and started to sing. Unaccompanied, but perfectly in tune, he
sang an Elvis Presley ballad.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow passengers had also stopped to listen and, like me,
were smiling. It was a real boost to the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   I know the problems the New York City Police Department is
having with the public cannot be fixed with a song, but it seemed a
good place to start.

   The two very chic women, who apparently had not seen each other
in some time, exchanged effusive salutations. One of the women had
a small poodle. Camilla Harris was nearby as the friend bent down
to pet the dog and gushed, in typical doggy and baby language,
``What a sweet little doggy you are _ how old are you now?'' There
was, of course, no reply, but the dog owner felt she should explain
why. ``You'll have to speak up,'' she said. ``She's hard of
hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple in Astoria, Queens, who wish to remain anonymous moved
a backyard grape vine to a new spot and started a compost pile to
help it along. Last fall, they had a bumper crop of grapes. When
the wife was turning over the compost recently, she found a bottle
of Viagra that had disappeared. The bottle had fallen out of a
cabinet into the container where the compost was collected. The
bottle was still capped but the two are convinced that its very
presence _ and osmosis _ account for the vine's stunning result. It
proves, the husband said, that ``even Father Nature needs help.''

   The other day, while in the Park Avenue offices of Bloomberg
Financial Markets, I went to the men's room.
</P>
<P>
   Standing right next to me was another man who, out of the blue,
said, ``What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Surprised, I turned slightly and asked, ``What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no response for a couple of seconds and then he said,
turning farther away from me: ``Listen, I've got to go. I'll call
you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard the beep of a cell phone being turned off.
</P>
<P>
   I know we are all more pressed for time these days and it's
pretty hectic at Bloomberg, but I had to laugh.

next to the window. As I was gathering my things to get off, I
heard a clink _ my house key had fallen into the slot under the
seat. My attempts to retrieve it were unsuccessful. I informed the
driver and he told me he would stop at 96th Street to inform his
dispatcher. The dispatcher advised him to take me to the garage at
the last stop where he thought the seat could be taken up by
maintenance workers.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher had radioed in by the time we got to the garage
and the maintenance crew was waiting. They retrieved the key and
the driver delivered me back to my stop. It made me proud to be a
New Yorker.

   Ms. Zabar told them about TKTS, the ticket booth at 47th Street

JIM COPP, 85, PRODUCER OF CHILDREN'S MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Copp, a creator of children's records with loony tunes,
literate lyrics, occasional dark themes and wacky characters like
the Dog That Went to Yale, died at Midway Hospital in Los Angeles
on April 7. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1958 and 1971, Copp and his partner, Ed Brown, composed,
performed and recorded on their label, Playhouse Records, sketches
for nine albums with titles like ``East of Flumdiddle,'' ``Gumdrop
Follies'' and ``Thimble Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics for ``The Dog That Went to Yale'' capture their flair
for the nonsensical:
</P>
<P>
   When I was eleven and Linda was five
</P>
<P>
   We owned the most talented doggy alive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tricks that he mastered were cause for acclaim
</P>
<P>
   He also possessed a remarkable name.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable name, you say.
</P>
<P>
   What was the name?
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Garrison Bobblety Bee
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Aurelius Rover McGee
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Huntington Harrington Thaddeus Hop
</P>
<P>
   Hopperdee Hoppidy Archibald bane.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Kate Higgins,'' on the album ``Agnes Mouthwash
and Friends,'' was darker:
</P>
<P>
   Kate Higgins, I regret to state
</P>
<P>
   Grew mutinous one night at eight
</P>
<P>
   And stamped her foot
</P>
<P>
   And screamed and cried
</P>
<P>
   And punched her father in the side.
</P>
<P>
   Kate winds up hiding in the phonograph and emerges after her
parents have given up looking for her and gone to bed. She then
stuffs herself with rhubarb pie, jelly beans and chocolate cake
only to wake up the next morning ``wishing she were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   After a reviewer for The New Yorker called the recordings
``deliciously fresh and funny'' in 1958, Playhouse Records began
appearing in upscale stores and soon developed a loyal following.
More accolades ensued. Time magazine pronounced the records
``fresh, clever and inventive'' and The Atlantic said they were
``funny, sophisticated, uncondescending.''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, the records were a potpourri of extraordinary sounds
from instruments like pump organs, kazoos, autoharps and bongo
drums, all played by Copp. Working without current audio
technology, Copp went to great lengths to create a lush soundtrack.
To create the crackling sound of a fire, he built one in his shower
and recorded the noise. To create the crashing sound of a falling
chandelier, he smashed a barrel of glasses.
</P>
<P>
   In the story ``Miss Goggins and the Gorilla,'' a classroom
filled with children was required to sing off-key. Copp achieved
that effect by dubbing his voice 24 times. On another occasion, he
dubbed his voice 90 times to create the roar of a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Copp was the main creative force behind the albums, while Brown
played some of the characters, designed the album covers, handled
the marketing and contributed clever puns.
</P>
<P>
   The albums disappeared from stores in the 1980s after Brown died
and Copp did not want to go on recording without his collaborator.
But the albums found a new audience in the 1990s after their
reissue in CD and cassette formats by Playhouse Records
(http://members.aol.com/playhytone/).
</P>
<P>
   Copp was born in Los Angeles in 1913, the son of a lawyer. He
studied at Stanford and Harvard universities before developing a
nightclub act called ``James Copp III and His Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in an intelligence unit.
Returning to Los Angeles after the war, he wrote a society column
for The Los Angeles Times. In 1958, he met Brown, and they produced
an album a year for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Copp left no immediate survivors.

JULIAN COLE, 74, RENOWNED MATHEMATICIAN WHO SPECIALIZED IN
PERTURBATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julian David Cole, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy, N.Y., and an internationally acknowledged expert
on the applied-mathematics technique known as perturbation, died
April 17 at Albany Medical Center Hospital. He was 74 and lived in
Loudonville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was multiple myeloma, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Perturbation is a powerful and widely used tool of applied
mathematics that has practical applications in heat flow,
elasticity, wave propagation and problems with solidification in
materials processing. Cole was an originator of singular
perturbation techniques, which involve solving problems dealing
with two or more scales of measurement. He also wrote
``Perturbation Methods in Applied Mathematics,'' a classic textbook
first published in 1968 and translated into many languages.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Science recognized his accomplishments
with its Award in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis in
1995. It cited his ``fundamental contributions'' in those
categories, adding, ``His work is characterized by its deep
physical and mathematical insights.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole's research encompassed basic theories of aerodynamics and
fluid mechanics, particularly in transonic flow, which is
fundamentally important in airplane and turbine design.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Cole was born in Brooklyn and graduated with a degree in
mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1944. He earned a
Ph.D. in aeronautics and mathematics in 1949 at the California
Institute of Technology, where he was on the faculty until 1969,
rising to professor.
</P>
<P>
   Before he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic in 1982, he was chairman
of the department of applied science and engineering and a
professor of mathematics at the University of California at Los
Angeles. At Rensselaer, he was the Margaret Darrin distinguished
professor of applied mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Susan Cole, a professor of
mathematics at Rensselaer; four sons, David, Benjamin, Thomas and
Brenden; three daughters, Jennifer, Melody and Amy Rose, and a
brother, Gerald Cole.

DOUGLAS W. PRTICHARD, OCEANOGRAPHER, DIES AT 76
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald W. Pritchard, an oceanographer and expert on the Long
Island Sound and the Chesapeake Bay, died on Friday at the
University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore. He was 76 and lived
in Severna Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a stroke, said his daughter Jo Anne
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard was a teacher and administrator at State University of
New York at Stony Brook from 1978 to 1988. He was a professor of
oceanography and the associate director for research at the
university's Marine Science Research Center from 1978 to 1986. In
his last years there, he became acting dean and director, then
associate dean of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Before teaching at SUNY Stony Brook, Pritchard was the chairman
of the department of oceanography at Johns Hopkins University from
1950 to 1968, founder of the university's Chesapeake Bay Institute,
its director from 1949 to 1973 and its senior research scientist
from 1973 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with Long Island newspaper Newsday, he said
that cleaning up the Long Island Sound had lagged cleaning up the
Chesapeake Bay partly because Long Islanders were less concerned
about the Sound than people living near the Chesapeake Bay were
about it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in 1987, he spoke about
purifying the Sound. He said that improving waste processing would
become more and more expensive and added, ``You have to either
restrict the development of the area, and hence restrict the source
of the problem, or you've got to restrict the waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in
1993 and received many other honors.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Santa Ana Calif., and received a bachelor's
degree in meteorology from the University of California at Los
Angeles in 1946. He received a doctorate in oceanography in 1951
from the University of California's Scripps Institution of
Oceanography at La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter Jo Anne Mitchell of Severna Park, he is
survived by his wife, the former Thelma Lydia Amling, whom he
married in 1943; another daughter, Marian Caldwell of Severna Park;
two sons, Albert, of Harwood, Md., and Donald Jr., of Severna Park,
and 11 grandchildren.
