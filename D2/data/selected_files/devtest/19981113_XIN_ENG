<HEADLINE> Indonesian Security Forces Fire Tear Gas at Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Several persons were injured
as Indonesian security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse thousands of student demonstrators in front of the
Jakarta police headquarters here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
At about 18:30 local time, demonstrators from different
universities began their action by ramming a car into a wall of
security officers trying to block them as they were heading for
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) building.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 representatives from across the country were
holding a special MPR session to discuss important political
events that faces the country. The special session is scheduled to
end on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency quoted a witness as saying that the number
of the demonstrators was 150,000, split into three groups after
the security personnel fired three warning shots.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at 18:28, the security officers urged the demonstrators
to abandon the street leading to the MPR building after
negotiations with the students failed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several hundred students successfully broke through
the blockade of the security forces at Semanggi area at around
18:00 and were parading towards the assembly building.
</P>
<P>
Another group of students from eastward Cawang were walking
through the toll road passing towards the MPR building in their
effort to reach the building.
</P>
<P>
Security forces fired water cannon at around 19:00 to disperse
these students.
</P>
<P>
This was the second day of successive clashes in the last two
days. On Wednesday, security forces fired five warning shots and
brandished batons to block thousands of students marching toward
the MPR building.
</P>
<P>
Several people, including photographers, students and security
personnel, were injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Students rallied almost every day this month to demand that
former president Soeharto, his family and cronies be brought to
trial, and that the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) quit its
political role.
</P>
<P>
Students have warned members of the MPR that they will hold
mass demonstrations if the four-day special session starting on
Tuesday does not issue decrees in the interest of the Indonesian
people.

<HEADLINE> Britain Recognizes Ceasefire of LVF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The British government on
Thursday recognized a ceasefire declared by the Loyalist Volunteer
Force (LVF) in Northern Ireland six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said, "I am now satisfied
that they have established a complete and unequivocal ceasefire
and over a significant period of time, since May 1998, they have
demonstrated that that ceasefire is being maintained."
</P>
<P>
The Loyalist Volunteer Force is a hardline, Protestant,
pro-British guerrilla organization.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to push forward the Northern Ireland's
peace process by putting pressure on Republican guerrillas to
match a pledge by the LVF to start handing in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The LVF has pledged to hand over "a small but very real amount
of arms" within two weeks of the government acknowledging its
ceasefire and allowing it to join a scheme under which guerrilla
prisoners are let out of jail early.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that could help persuade the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Statement of Arab Countries on Iraq </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomed
on Thursday the statement of the Arab countries calling on Iraq to
reverse its ban on U.N. weapons inspections, saying refusal could
have serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries made the call at a conference in Doha, the
capital of Qatar, a Persian Gulf emirate by Egypt, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the statement
"reflects the growing and near unanimity, especially in the Arab
world, that Iraq is responsible solely for the consequences."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. feels this is a pretty good indicator of where the
key Gulf countries stand on the latest crisis," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen and other administration
officials have tried to rally Arab states to support the United
States, particularly in the event of a military strike.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's assistance could be vital if President Bill
Clinton's orders an attack, although there is enough American
firepower in the Gulf area and on the way for the United States to
act unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Among the Arab countries, only Kuwait have publicly expressed
support for a military action against Iraq so far.

<HEADLINE> RFU President Faces Tax Probe: Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Football Union (RFU)
president Vyacheslav Koloskov could face legal action from
Russia's tax police after the RFU was found possessing two
illegal Swiss bank accounts, local media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both accounts, which reportedly contained funds received by
the RFU when Russia played abroad, had opened in 1995 without a
license from the Russian Central Bank, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the RFU received 3.6 million Swiss francs (around 2.8
million dollars) for Russia's involvement in the Euro 96 finals
in England, and 846,543 Swiss francs (around 1.4 million dollars)
for the 1994 World Cup in America.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of these payments was lodged in Switzerland, said
Russian daily Novye Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
The tax police has called on Moscow's prosecutor's office to
start legal proceedings against the RFU chief, who together with
his deputy Alexander Tukmanov had handled the accounts privately,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The re-election of the RFU president have been on the agenda
of an extraordinary RFU conference slated on December 8.
Koloskov is challenged by eight other candidates for the post
after the bid close on November 8.

<HEADLINE> Indian Researcher Says Indian Peninsula Is Mosaic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- An Indian researcher said
that the present-day Indian peninsula is a mosaic of four ancient
blocks of land that were sutured and welded together millions of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The suturing of the four blocks took place in steps and areas
of joining are weak zones that are potential sites for
earthquakes, said P. K. Maithy, deputy director of the Birbal
Sahni Institute of Paleobotany based in Lucknow, some 500
kilometres southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
The four blocks are Dharwar, Bundelkhand, Trans-Aravalli and
South Indian-Sri Lankan blocks, Maithy told the Press Trust of
India Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four merged with other blocks of land to form Gondwanland,
the ancient supercontinent that subsequently fragmented to form
the present-day continents millions of years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of fossil rocks collected from the region for over 50
years showed that the Dharwar block assembled with eastern
Antartica and Bundelkhand along the eastern Ghats and Satpura Belt
about 1800 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Maithy said, the fourth block, the south Indian-Sri
Lankan belt sutured along the Palghat-Cauvery belt 500 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The merger of east Gondwanaland brought about several
geographic changes such as uplift of the Indian Subcontinent,
rapid erosion of newly folded and uplifted mountains along the
suture zones, according to the research findings.
</P>
<P>
The new theory of how the Indian peninsula formed explains the
recent frequent occurrence of quakes in the region which most
geologists believed was quiescent, Maithy said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Benefit Claims Edge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment
benefit claims climbed up to a seasonally adjusted 321,000 last
week, the highest level in last four months, the Labor Department
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
First-time benefit claims during the week were 12,000 more than
the week before. The total was the highest since the week ended
July 11, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes
fluctuations in the volatile data series, rose to a 14-week high
of 312,500, up from 311,000 during the four-week period ended a
week earlier.
</P>
<P>
During the week ended October 31, California, Texas,
Washington, South Carolina and North Carolina led the list of
states with significant increases in joblessness. They cited
layoffs in agriculture and manufacturing, particularly at
factories producing metal products, machinery, electrical
equipment and rubber and plastic products.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the world-wide economic turmoil is
taking a toll on American jobs, particularly at factories
exporting goods to Asian nations mired in slumps. The unemployment
rate, which hit a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in the spring, was
4.6 percent in October.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Israeli Opposition Pan Har Homa Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and Israel's opposition on Thursday sharply
criticized Israeli government's plan for settlement construction
at Har Homa, a controversial hill slope near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath told the Voice of Palestine Thursday the Israeli decision
to start construction in Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) is a violation of
the Wye River accord signed by Israeli and Palestinian leaders
last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat said that this
Israeli move could only lead the Palestinians and Israelis to
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the opposition Labor Party and other
peace-supporting groups also criticized this decision. Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak called it "bad" and "bad timing."
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ministry of Construction and Housing published
Thursday the first tender for the construction of housing units at
Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
According to the tender, Israel plans to build 1,025 apartments
at Har Homa as part of a comprehensive plan of building 6,500
apartments there.
</P>
<P>
Har Homa is a small hill situated between Jerusalem and
Bethlehem in the West Bank. The Israeli government decided to
build housing units there in March 1997, which brought the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to a prolonged deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the Israeli decision, the Palestinian side said Har
Homa is a Palestinian territory in the West Bank and Israel has no
right to build any house at that site.
</P>
<P>
The United States also opposes such move by Israel, calling on
it to have a timeout on settlement activities. Even during Wye
Plantation talks last month, the U.S. reportedly warned Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against building at Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Several right-wing Jewish groups urged the government to speed
up construction at Har Homa. But Netanyahu said that housing
units there would be built by the year 2000.

ATHENS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday expressed
its unwillingness to participate in any possible military actions
by the U.S. against Iraq, which decided last month to halt its
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Athens might not participate in any
military operations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was an agreed international framework which
had not changed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also indirectly confirmed that during recent
meetings between U.S. ambassador to Greece Nicholas Burns and
Greek government officials, both sides had discussed the issue of
Athens' participation in the military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Souda base on the southern Greek island
of Crete would be used in the military actions against Iraq,
Reppas did not give a direct reply by saying that Souda was a base
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeated that the Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons
inspections should be solved through peaceful means while Iraq
must comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions concerned.

<HEADLINE> New No-Confidence Motion Presented Against Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Republican People's
Party (CHP) Thursday submitted the parliament another
no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz in a bid
to bring his government down.
</P>
<P>
In the motion, the CHP accused the minority coalition
government led by Yilmaz of abuse of power and connection with
mafia and asked the prime minister to resign.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), the largest
party in the parliament, and the True Path Party (DYP) led by
former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller jointly submitted a
no-confidence motion to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The joint motion accused Yilmaz of interfering in the
privatization plan of the Turkish Trade Bank and helping a
businessman linked to mafia.
</P>
<P>
Korkmaz Yigit, a businessman, confessed that Yilmaz and State
Minister Gunes Taner had opened the way for him to buy the Turkish
Trade Bank and that they knew the process of the bidding.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Yilmaz and Taner were aware of his involvement
in a conspiracy relating with a mafia leader.
</P>
<P>
The CHP leader Deniz Baykal said that the claims of Yigit
against Yilmaz and Taner should be taken up by courts, but Yilmaz
has to resign first.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stated in a private TV on Wednesday that he
would not resign although the opposition parties lodged
no-confidence motion against his minority government.
</P>
<P>
"This is a plot and a trap," said he, adding that it can not be
a reason for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Yilmaz's coalition government could
collapse if he loses majority in the parliament as the CHP, which
supports the government from outside, withdraws its support for
the coalition.

JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 Students were allowed
to enter Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) complex

<P>
They were received by the ruling Golkar (Functional Group)
faction in MPR represented by Bomer Pasaribu and Andi Matalat who

affairs of the country would cause them to ignore their original
tasks of preserving peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Talks With Mugabe on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- New U.N. special envoy to
Angola Issa Diallo Thursday met Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe in Harare to seek advice and support for the Angolan
government on the deteriorating situation in that country.
</P>
<P>
Diallo told journalists after meeting Mugabe that violence has
escalated in Angola ever since dialog between the government and
rebels of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) faltered.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Angola is becoming worse and war is on its
way there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diallo said Mugabe had expressed the determination of the
Zimbabwean government to act on the situation.
</P>
<P>
There was need to join forces to deal with the situation in
Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to join forces, the U.N. regional and sub-regional
groups and say louder enough is enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop this exercise of obstacles and stand by the
Lusaka protocol which is best for Angola," Diallo said.
</P>
<P>
Diallo will go to Burkina Faso via Cote d'Ivore to brief
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity Blaise Compaore on
the Angolan situation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's First Satellite to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The first ever South
African-built satellite will be launched into space in the United
States early next year, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be launched from the Vandenberg air force
base near Los Angeles on January 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
It will orbit the earth and send pictures of cultivated
fields, natural vegetation and pollution to South African
scientists to help with environmental research.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, called Sunsat, was designed and built by the
electrical and electronic engineering department of the
Stellenbosch University. It took seven years and dozens of
research staff to complete the work.
</P>
<P>
The 63-kilogram device is set to orbit the earth once every 90
minutes at an altitude of between 500 and 850 kilometers, and
beam down full-color, high-resolution pictures to the
Stellenbosch University's electronic systems laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The United States National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) is to launch Sunsat free of charge in
exchange for the attachment of NASA-supplied surveying equipment
to the satellite. The launching could otherwise cost 4.2 million
Rand (750,000 U.S. Dollars), said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Sunsat project leader Garth Milne said the launch would be a
milestone for the country, and a contribution to its
technological stature "that our academics and students are
pleased to have made."
</P>
<P>
South Africa spends between 450 million and 550 million Rand
(80-98 million Dollars) annually on leasing transponder capacity
from international satellite operators to support the country's
telecommunications and other businesses.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Britain to Extradite Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday officially asked
Britain to extradite former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, said
the French Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
``The request and the document of support for the demand of
extradition formed by the French judicial authorities against
Augusto Pinochet have been transmitted to the French Foreign
Ministry for being immediately presented to the competent
authorities of the United Kingdom,'' said the ministry in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Britain are signing countries of the 1957
European Convention of Extradition.
</P>
<P>
This request for extradition was made after a Parisian judge,
Roger Le Loire, issued an international mandate of arrest against
Pinochet on November 2 for alleged ``sequestrations and tortures''
of several French nationals during his dictatorship from 1973 to
1990.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London on October 16 and is under house
arrest waiting for a final decision by the five judges in the
British Chamber of Lords whether to release him or not.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- German finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine warned Thursday in his first assessment of Germany's
financial situation under Bonn's new government of a 10 billion
marks (5.9 billion dollar) gap in the 1999 federal budget.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine also said that tax revenues were expected to slacken
of next year, weighing in 1.4 billion marks lower than previous
estimates, to 866.4 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The new Social Democratic minister said he would aim for a
"strict consolidation course".
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in his
government policy speech to parliament, had spoken of the need for
structural adjustments to the budget.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine noted that this year's tax revenues were going to be
7.8 billion marks higher than previously projected, but said this
was "no cause for sounding the all-clear".

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Fail to Reach Understanding on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan failed to
reach any understanding on their perceptions on terrorism and
narcotic smuggling at the bilateral talks held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both sides agreed to set up a mechanism for
regular meetings and exchange of operational information between
India's Central Bureau of Investigation and the Federal
Investigation Agency of Pakistan for expeditious assistance to
each other for combating various types of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press after the talks, Indian Home Secretary B. P.
Singh said that India asked Pakistan to immediately close down 30
terrorists training camps and hand over 32 underworld operators of
Indian origin sheltered in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Singh said that India handed over to the Pakistani delegation a
list of the 32 top-ranking terrorists, drug lord, fugitives and
underworld operators from India.
</P>
<P>
A brief joint statement issued after the talks merely said
that the two sides stated their respective positions and agreed to
continue their discussions during the next round of the dialogue
process.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation placed on record what they said concrete
evidence regarding Islamabad's role in sponsoring and harboring
terrorist activities during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan delegation, led by Interior Secretary Hafeezullah
Ishaq, refuted New Delhi's allegations that it was sponsoring
cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, the joint statement said the talks, held as part of
the composite and integrated dialogue, were held in a frank and
cordial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
India also raised that issue of border fencing which it said
was helpful in checking infiltration, smuggling and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the drug smuggling issue, the two sides discussed measures
to check the flow of narcotics from Afghanistan and Pakistan
through India's northern borders.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors held their first round of talks Tuesday on
commerce and trade with initial signs showing that only marginal
headway has been made in resolving key issues relating to
telecommunications, railways and power sector.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to make any progress Monday on their
long-pending Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute with New Delhi
firmly rejecting Islamabad's proposal for third party arbitration
during their talks which were also reportedly held in a frank and
cordial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is the second phase of the scheduled
nine-day dialogue between the two countries which have so far not
turned out any positive results on three of the six outstanding
identified issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on both a navigation project and the Siachen
Glacier held here last week had also ended in a deadlock.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- William J. Luers, a
former diplomat who has been president of the New York-based
Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1986, is to be the next chairman
and president of the United Nations Association of the USA, the
New York Times newspaper said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a bold move for the organization, which does research and
organizes chapters of United Nations supporters across the United
States, Luers will combine the two top jobs, chairman and
president, when takes office in February next year.
</P>
<P>
He succeeds John Whitehead as chairman and Alvin Adams as
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
Adams, a retired career diplomat, will leave the association.
Whitehead plans to stay as as one of two vice chairmen, to be
joined by Richard Jobll, chairman of the Business Council of the
United Nations, a corporate group that is likely to be combined
with the United Nations Association this year.
</P>
<P>
Luers, who is retiring from the museum presidency on January 31
next year, said on Wednesday that he was first asked five or six
months ago to serve as chairman, but that proposal to combine the
top jobs emerged only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"The more I got involved, the more intriguing I thought it
was," he said, "both in terms of what could be done at this
difficult stage in the United States' relationship to the United
Nations, specially on the debt issue, and generally."
</P>
<P>
The association has long been advocating that Washington should
pay its back dues to the United Nations in full, on time and
without any conditions. Washington has secured its vote at the
General Assembly next year by paying 195 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here said that the U.S. face-saving move
does not necessarily mean a complete relief of the U.N. financial
crisis, which originated from some member states' delayment and
unwillingness to pay its arrears.
</P>
<P>
Luers, a former U.S. State Department official and Ambassador
to Czechoslovakia and Venezuela, said he has been watching the
association from the sidelines for years and is fascinated by its
roots in the American people and what they think about the world.
He has also stayed in touch with the United Nations.

PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- France will send its
representative to Iraq back to Baghdad and has again expressed its
wish that United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan can help
defuse the on-going crisis between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the section of French interests in Iraq, Yves
Aubin de la Messuziere, who was recalled last week for
consultations, will return to Baghdad in the coming days, French
Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he will not carry any special message from the French
government to Iraq, Agence France-Presse quoted Rivasseau as
saying.
</P>
<P>
``The ball is clearly in the camp of Iraq,'' he said, adding
that Paris wishes that Iraq go back on its decision to suspend
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recalled that U.N. Secretary General has called
on Iraq to make a gesture and show the sign of good will by
resuming cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors immediately.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Start Moving to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. B-52 bombers and F-117
stealth fighters will leave for the Gulf region on Thursday to
bolster forces gathering for a possible military strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The 12 B-52 bombers and the 12 F-117s will fly from U.S. Air
Force bases in Louisiana, North Dakota and New Mexico to the
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, the U.S. Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
The eight-engine B-52s, used in the Vietnam War and updated
periodically since, have a wingspan of 56.4 meters, carry a crew
of five and can launch up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles far
from Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
The F-117, built to foil enemy radar detection, is able to drop
precision laser-guided bombs. Its speed is slower than sound, but
destroyed targets in heavily-defended Baghdad almost at will on
night missions during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes have used the British base on Diego Garcia in
previous Gulf actions. The island is within striking range of
Iraq, but beyond the reach of Iraqi missiles including Soviet-made
Scuds.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday ordered substantial new
forces to the Gulf, including 129 aircraft and 3,000 more Army
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Veterans Day ceremony, Clinton said the United
States would be compelled to act without further warning unless
Iraq reversed an October 31 decision to halt U.N. inspections of
its weapons program.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Albania Vow to Strengthen Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Albania Thursday
pledged to further strengthen the already close cooperation
between the two neighboring countries following the talks between
their premiers in Athens.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and his visiting Albanian counterpart Pandeli Majko, both sides
discussed ways of improving political and business cooperation
between the two countries as well as cooperation in tackling
ethnic Greek and Albanian minorities in their countries and the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a 5 billion drachmas (about 17.4
million U.S. dollars) loan agreement within the framework of a
bilateral agreement already signed which provides for a Greek loan
to Albania of 20 billion drachmas (about 69.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration was also signed providing for the
construction by Greece of a national theatre in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Simitis said that Greece desired
close cooperation with Albania in two directions, namely Athens'
support for the neighboring country's efforts to join
international bodies such as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU) as well
as economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Majko said that his first visit to Greece as
premier had confirmed the high level of relations and confidential
partnership with Greece.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the ethnic minorities in the two countries
served as a bridge for cooperation between Greece and Albania.
</P>
<P>
As for the Kosovo problem, they stressed the importance of
resolving the problem through dialogues between the political
forces concerned in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Describing the use of force as "unacceptable," Simitis
advocated greater autonomy for Kosovo within the framework of the
existing borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Majko, who also met with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos
and visiting Swedish Foreign Aid Minister Pierre Schori, said that
if an agreement concerning the peaceful settlement of the Kosovo
crisis was reached and guaranteed internationally, Albania would
support it.
</P>
<P>
However, he was dissatisfied with the present situation in
Kosovo, saying that there was a dangerous vacuum in Kosovo with
neither war nor peace prevailing.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Control System to Be Used in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Ministry of
Fisheries announced here Thursday that a satellite control system
will be in use next year to monitor the fishery resources and
fishing in the coastal areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Fisheries Fatima Jardim said the first
phase of the satellite system project will cost some 3.5 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said that for the first phase, a control center will be
set up on land while 50 fishing fleets need to be equipped with a
global positioning system (GPS).
</P>
<P>
All the materials needed haved arrived in Angola, the minister
said, adding that the only thing to do is to install and put them
to the test.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the satellite control system, Jardim noted,
"we can know how the fishing fleets are doing in coastal Angola
and where they are."
</P>
<P>
To protect the schools of spawning fishes and the little
fishes, the Angolan government has marked a "blue line" 13
nautical miles away from the coast and demands the fishing fleets
work beyond the line in its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
And the forthcoming satellite control system will through the
GPS identify the location of the fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has plan to install the GDP on all the
licensed fishing boats so that the monitor and control center can
locate the boats with the help of the satellite information.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Angola has a commercial potential of 850,000 tons
of fishing resources annually. But the catches in Angola for 1997
just reached 241,800 tons, and out of them 100,400 tons were
caught in Angolan waters by foreign fishing fleets.
</P>
<P>
These foreign fleets unload a certain part of their catch at
the Angolan ports for disposal by the Angolan government while
exporting the rest directly.
</P>
<P>
The satellite control system to be in operation next year will
monitor whether the foreign fishing boats sail to the local ports
and unload the share they owe to the Angolan government.

BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Thursday rapped the U.S. government for "blocking"
Iraq's way toward sincere cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors
and "blocking" the alleviation of Iraqi people's hardships.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said there has been sincere Iraqi compliance and
cooperation with the U.N. over weapons inspections over the past
seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the other commitments of the U.N. resolution
687 have not been fulfilled by the Security Council because of the
U.S. opposition, referring to the lifting of sanctions as
stipulated by the Paragraph 22 of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are serious about lifting sanctions, we are serious about
living peacefully in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the U.S. has blocked all attempts of the
U.N. Security Council to seriously review the implementation by
Iraq of the U.N. resolutions and the lifting of the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq as a "subsidiary organ" of CIA.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tripartite Talks Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The talks between the
Zimbabwean government, the trade unions and the employers failed
Thursday without reaching any agreement on the trade union
demands for a 20 percent salary increment.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Public Service, Labor and Social
Welfare Ministry July Moyo said the government agreed that some
form of wage adjustments was necessary to cushion workers against
increases in the prices of basic commodities, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moyo, however, said different industries were not operating at
the same level and, therefore, it was unrealistic for the
government to recommend the 20 percent salary increase across the
board as demanded.
</P>
<P>
He said the way forward was for employers and employees to
agree according to each industry on what percentage they could
afford to award their workers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same meeting, Secretary-General of the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Morgan Tsvangirai said
the government should take cognizance of the hardships currently
experienced by the people and find urgent solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the labor movement's position was that workers be
urgently awarded a 20 percent salary increment.
</P>
<P>
Employer representatives said even if salaries were to be
increased, it was likely that prices of goods would go up,
considering the instability of the Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsvangirai could not say whether the labor movement
would call off or continue with the national strikes set for
every Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government officials said that the labor movement and
employers should hold further consultations on how much workers
in each sector should get.

<HEADLINE> 3 African Leaders Excluded at Africa-France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
invited all but three African heads of state to a summit on
security in Africa in Paris from November 26 to 28, a French
diplomat said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of the French Embassy in Zimbabwe Sebastien
Surun told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the summit is the 20th
biennial Africa-France conference of heads of state from which
leaders of Libya, Somalia and Sudan are excluded as they are
under United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is a very flexible gathering which adapts its
agenda to the current matters to be discussed and provides heads
of state from all over Africa an opportunity to meet informally,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Each summit focuses on a specific theme and usually adopts a
final statement in the form of a resolution, a communique or a
final declaration depending on the matter," said Surun.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's theme is cognizant of the deteriorating
security situation on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"It is an interesting and timely topic which heads of state
would be hoped to discuss earnestly and come up with proposals
and solutions to the worsening state of security in some parts of
Africa," said Surun.
</P>
<P>
"Heads of all these troubled spots and others involved in them
are expected to come to the summit where there will be
opportunities to meet separately from the main conference," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the French diplomat ruled out the possibility of the
rebels in all conflict areas being allowed even observer status
at the summit.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen warned Iraq on Thursday that U.S. military strikes
could be "significant" if the Iraqi government does not resume its
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary made the remarks in Norfolk, Virginia,
where he is visiting a U.S. Navy base.
</P>
<P>
"They will be significant should they be carried out," Cohen
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen cut short his trip by an hour to return to Washington for
a high-level meeting on the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that no time frame had been decided as to
when military strikes might be launched, but stressed that the
United States already has a major force in the region in addition
to warplanes now being sent.
</P>
<P>
"I have not seen anything coming out of Baghdad that would
indicate he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) is interested in
complying with the Security Council resolutions," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said the United States was consulting closely
with its allies for support on Iraq. "We are not seeking to go to
war. We are trying to avoid it. The choice is his (Saddam's) at
this point," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz strongly
criticized the United States for the blocking the lifting of
sanctions against Iraq.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United State, in
response to criticism from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
said Thursday that "the whole world" sees Iraq should be
responsible for the weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a special briefing
that "the easy way" to lift the sanctions against Iraq is Baghdad
complies and resumes cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Aziz rapped the U.S. government for
"blocking" Iraq's way toward sincere cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors and "blocking" the alleviation of Iraqi people's
hardships.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said there has been sincere Iraqi compliance and
cooperation with the U.N. over weapons inspections over the past
seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the other commitments of the U.N. resolution
687 have not been fulfilled by the Security Council because of the
U.S. opposition, referring to the lifting of sanctions as
stipulated by the Paragraph 22 of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are serious about lifting sanctions, we are serious about
living peacefully in the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders MD-11 Electrical Switch Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on Thursday ordered airlines to inspect two
lighting dimmer switches in the cockpits of MD-11 aircraft because
they may overheat and smoke.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said airlines will have 30 days to determine if the
switches are one of two models that have been found to be
defective. If they are, the switches must be repaired or replaced
within a month.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said there is no evidence the overheated switch caused
damage beyond the part, and there is also nothing to indicated
that these switches are related to the Swissair crash.
</P>
<P>
A McDonnell Douglas MD-11, operating as Swissair Flight 111,
plunged into the ocean off Nova Scotia on September 2, killing all
229 aboard. The crash came 16 minutes after the pilots reported
smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said it typically reexamines the service history of an
aircraft model whenever one crashes.
</P>
<P>
During a review of the MD-11, an agency statement said, "the
FAA found that when brighter cockpit lighting was needed (such as
during a thunderstorm), and, as a result, higher voltage was
required, the part sometimes overheated and emitted a burning odor
and smoke."
</P>
<P>
The FAA order affects 65 U.S.-registered planes. There are 174
such aircraft worldwide. While FAA orders do not apply to
foreign-registered planes, their operators frequently follow U.S.
safety suggestions.

<HEADLINE> Government Invites Turkish Cypriots to Join EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government Thursday
reiterated its invitation to the Turkish Cypriots to join the
government in accession talks to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said the Greek Cypriot side's proposal "is
on the table, so that we can proceed together toward the
difficult road which will secure the future of the people of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"We wish to walk along with the Turkish Cypriots toward the
EU," Stylianides said, adding that "it is up to Ankara to free the
Turkish Cypriots from its strategic interests to let them
participate in the procedure."
</P>
<P>
The EU accession procedure will definitely be to the advantage
of the Turkish Cypriots, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but the
Turkish Cypriots opted out of the peace negotiations last year to
protest the EU's decision to begin accession talks with Cyprus
while scraping Turkey off its immediate membership candidates list.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong objections from Turkish Cypriots and their
supporter Turkey, the EU started accession talks with the Greek
Cypriot-dominated Cypriot government last March.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish foreign ministry's statement Wednesday
that EU-Cyprus accession talks are not binding for the whole
island, Stylianides said the statement clearly shows "anxiety and
bewilderment (of Turkey) over the start of the substantive
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the new development shows that Turkey's
"blackmail cannot affect the accession course, and that they
should revise their position on this issue."
</P>
<P>
The second ministerial meeting on EU membership talks was held
in Brussels, Belgium, Tuesday, signaling the start of substantive
accession negotiations between Cyprus and the EU.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief, Security Council to Meet on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and 15 Security Council members are scheduled to have a
meeting on Friday afternoon on the current Iraqi crisis, and the
Security Council "is waiting for positive response from Iraq," the
Council president, Peter Burleigh, announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in New York agrees that the ball is in Iraq's court,
it's not in the Secretary-General's court, and it's not in the
Security Council's court," Burleigh, also charge d'affaires of the
U.S. Mission to the United Nations, told reporters at the end of
the Council's morning session, which he said did not touch upon
the latest Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
After Baghdad rescinds its non-cooperation decision, "a lot of
things could happen, including a comprehensive review" on the
sanctions against Iraq imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long been pressing for a comprehensive review
conducted by the United Nations on the 8-year sanctions, which has
brought about great sufferings to Iraqi civilians. The Security
Council has agreed on the comprehensive review shortly before
Baghdad on October 31 announced the suspension of cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's position in New York is very clear," he said,
referring to the Security Council's stance and a recent statement
by the Secretary-General, all sang in one voice to urge Baghdad to
back off to the full cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and
compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraqi crisis has prompted Annan to cut short his
North Africa tour and return to the U.N. headquarters in New York.
He is scheduled to be back in New York on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced its suspension of the cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission (UNSCOM), in charge of disarming the Mideast
nation, on October 31, following a similar announcement on August
5 this year.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM, headed its chairman Richard Butler, decided on Tuesday
night to pull its staff out of Iraq on "strong recommendation"
from the U.S. Government and safety concerns for U.N. arms
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Raps U.S., Hopes Annan to Intervene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Thursday rapped the U.S. government for "blocking"
Iraq's way toward sincere cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors
and expressed welcome to U.N. chief Kofi Annan if he intervenes.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told a press conference here that there has been sincere
Iraqi compliance and cooperation with the U.N. over weapons
inspections over the past seven and half years.
</P>
<P>
But "The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly,
illegally by (Clinton's) government," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"Who is blocking the way toward sincere cooperation? It's he
(Clinton) and his government, not the president of Iraq and the
government of Iraq," Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
"When speaking of compliance, it's the United States that's not
complying,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the other commitments of the U.N. resolution 687 have
not been fulfilled by the Security Council because of the
U.S. opposition, referring to the lifting of sanctions as
stipulated by the Paragraph 22 of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are serious about lifting sanctions, we are serious about
living in peace in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the U.S. has blocked all attempts of the
U.N. Security Council to seriously review the implementation by
Iraq of the U.N. resolutions and the lifting of the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq as a "subsidiary organ" of CIA.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq did cooperate with UNSCOM although it was
"bitter, difficult and sometime disgusting experience.
</P>
<P>
He accused UNSCOM chief Richard Butler of acting according to
U.S. needs. Aziz said that Butler pull out of UNSCOM staff from
Iraq without consulting the U.N. security council and Secretary
General Annan.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that UNSCOM has finished its job of disarming
Iraq after seven and half years and Iraq is entitled to have the
sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
"If this crisis is going to escalate into an aggression, it's
their decision ... and It's not the responsibility of Iraq because
Iraq showed cooperation'' with U.N. inspectors charged with
verifying that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi people refuse and condemn a possible
U.S. military attack but are not afraid of it. "It is not because
of defiance," he said, "it makes no difference (for Iraqis) to die
in hospital due to lack of food and medicine, or die under
U.S. bombs."
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions are a war by itself - it is killing Iraqis," the
deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed welcome to Annan to come to Iraq and play what he
called "productive and positive" role in defusing the crisis, as
he did in the previous Iraqi-U.N. standoff in February. "We will
cooperate with him," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. said the time for diplomatic efforts is over and
there is nothing to negotiate with Baghdad. If Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein really wants the lifting of sanctions, he should
allow the U.N. weapons inspectors in and continue their work, said
Joe Lockhard, White House press secretary, in reaction to Aziz's
tirade.
</P>
<P>
But Aziz said it is time for the other party to offer
something to end the crisis. "We offered compliance, we offered
cooperation, but we got nothing," he blamed.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the polemics against the U.S. as Washington is busy
preparing a military Strike against Iraq to force it fully
cooperate with UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to halt all cooperation with UNSCOM on October
31, starting the new crisis with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has withdrawn more than 400 non-essential staff from
Iraq, obviously in anticipation of a U.S. flexing of muscles.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Central Bank Accused of Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda (BOU) has
been accused of failure in its supervisory role over operations
of commercial banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
This accusation was made at a public lecture held at Sheraton
Kampala Hotel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Trade Manzi Tumubweine and other
participants asked the government to reduce central bank powers
by appointing an independent organization which will efficiently
monitor and supervise private commercial banks without due
interference from the politicians.
</P>
<P>
He recognized the role of commercial banks in mobilization of
resources and savings and called for review of some of the laws
affecting the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Erisa Ochieng, President of Uganda Economics Association, said
that poor management, connected or inside lending and concealment
of problems by banks are major causes of bank failures in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Some participants at the lecture demanded that owners of
commercial banks be separated from management and called for a
limitation on inside lending.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the management of BOU was called in to answer
questions from a parliamentary committee on finance and economic
planning over the closure of three commercial banks in September
this year.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the commercial banks has sent waves of panic
among the public and investores in particular, in addition to
people's worries over the continued depreciation of shilling in
recent months due to sharp reduction of coffee exports and the
volatile security situation in the region.

<HEADLINE> Arab States Urge Iraq to Reverse Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Damascus Declaration
signatory states' foreign ministers on Thursday called on Iraq to
reverse its decision on suspending cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
A statement released at the conclusion of the two-day meeting
in Doha called for Iraqi full compliance with the relevant
U.N. resolutions and the memo signed by Iraq and U.N Secretary
General Kofi Annan in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The 16th ministerial meeting held Iraq responsible for any
eventualities resulting from its decision to halt cooperation with
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for disarming Iraq, which it
accused of serving U.S. interests and blocking the lifting of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The participants hoped the wisdom and logics would prevail so
that the U.N. may be able to find a diplomatic solution to the
crisis, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed sympathy with the Iraqi people and
stressed their countries' firm attitudes that Iraq's territorial
integrity and unity should be respected.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that Iraq should abide by U.N.
resolutions adopted following the Gulf crisis caused by the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and related modalities.
</P>
<P>
The modalities demanded that Iraq hand over the Kuwaiti and
other prisoners-of-war, return the looted Kuwaiti properties and
refrain from any hostilities or provocative actions against Kuwait
and other neighboring states according to U.N. Resolution 949.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called for the restoration of all occupied
Arab territories according to U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights,
south Lebanon and the Palestinian territories including East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Urging Israel to secure the Palestinian legitimate rights,
including an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital,
the statement reiterated the member states' attitude on fair
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
The ministers confirmed rejection of the Israeli expansionist
settlement policy in the occupied territories and the Israeli
government decision to expand geographical boundaries of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement pledged firm support to the Palestinan people and
leadership, urging Israel to fulfill its commitments.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called on the U.S. to continue efforts to force
Israel to honor and implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords and revive peace talks on the Israeli-Lebanese and
Israeli-Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the eight member states, namely Egypt,
Syria, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia and Oman, attended the meeting.

He said that "work should be done to pave the way for Jordanian
commodities and products to enter the West Bank markets," Jordan's
official Petra news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the U.S. will do its utmost to remove the
obstacles hindering the flow of Jordanian goods to the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Delay, who is on a Mideast tour, said that he will raise the
issue and discuss it with regional leaders during his upcoming
visits to Egypt, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
Delay also called on Israel and the Palestinians to hold talks
to facilitate access of Jordanian commodities to the Palestinian
markets.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's efforts to gain access to the Palestinian markets have
been thwarted in recent years as Israel maintained a monopoly
there by establishing an outpost line around the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel is believed to intend to enslave the Palestinians by
such a monopoly. Above 90 percent of the Palestinian self-rule
area's imports has come from Israel in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been keen on developing the Palestinian markets
because its traditional markets in the region, mainly Iraq, did
not have as much demand for Jordanian goods as in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The withering of the regional markets has a negative influence
over Jordan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel are the U.S.' strategic partners in the
Mideast region. The U.S. has helped the two countries sign a peace
treaty in 1994 and the Al Hassan Industrial city is one of the
fruits born of the treaty.

<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) - European stock markets began the
day Thursday in extremely sluggish fashion. Bourses moved down
following on the heels of Asia's sharp decline.
</P>
<P>
Stock opened lower after a disappointing close on Tokyo's
Nikkei index. But the growing threat of military strikes against
Iraq pushed up the price of oil and oil shares.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices gained 35 cents to 12.46 US dollars, helping
Shell up 5p to 349p and BP 8p ahead to 894. Smaller rivals
Enterprise Oil and Lasmo also gained, jumping 25p to 400p and 5p
to 173p respectively.
</P>
<P>
But the gainers were a rare breed on the stock market boards as
London took a heavy tumble on falling international markets and
profit taking.
</P>
<P>
Leading shares pulled off session lows as dealers looked to
Wall Street for fresh direction. The FTSE 100 opened 1.2 percent
lower, at 5,410.3 and closed at 5,445.8, which was 31 points lower
than the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax was down 59.43 points while the floor DAX
was down 1.7 percent at 4,639.89.
</P>
<P>
Computer problems at the Paris bourse delayed the opening of
many stocks, giving investors more time to peruse nine-month sales
figures from tire maker Michelin.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index closed up 15.49 points, or 0.44 percent, at
3,560.23.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss market also began the day in extremely lackluster
fashion, with stocks down across the board, but little corporate

<P>
BEIRUT, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schussel is expected to arrive in Lebanon Saturday as
part of a regional tour aimed at promoting the stalled Mideast
peace process, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Schussel, whose country currently holds the six-month rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU), will also visit Israel, the
Palestinian areas, Jordan, Syria and Egypt, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit to Lebanon, Schussel will hold talks
with his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz on the peace process,
especially the Wye Plantation accord and its impact on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
The interim peace agreement, signed by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Washington on October 23, broke a 19-month deadlock in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered deal, Israel agreed to withdraw from
anther 13 percent of the West Bank in three months in return for
the Palestinians' crackdown on "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Schussel will discuss with Boueiz over the role the EU will play
in reactivating negotiations on Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli and Lebanon-Israeli negotiations have been
suspended since hard-line Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Thursday called on the
parties concerned in the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff to exercise
restraint in order to avert new disasters in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government suggested at its Thursday's cabinet
session that a comprehensive review be conducted on the current
situation to find a solution that can head off any escalation of
the crisis and possible military confrontations, the official
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Such a review should also be designed as a positive step
towards the removal of the U.N. sanctions, which was imposed on
Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-U.N. tensions heightened after Iraq halted all
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which
oversees Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it will not resume its cooperation with UNSCOM unless
the Security Council set a timetable for the lifting of the
devastating sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that the sanctions will not be lifted
until UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has come clean of all weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is sending more troops and warships to the Gulf in
preparation for a military strike to force Iraqi compliance.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged the Ugandans to eradicate poverty from
homesteads in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when addressing a rally in Jinja
district, some 80 kms east of the capital city Thursday, at the
end of his visit to Busoga Region in eastern Uganda, said a press
release from the President's office.
</P>
<P>
Museveni stressed that the government has already addressed
the bottlenecks which in the past inhibited efforts to eradicate
poverty from homesteads across the country.
</P>
<P>
The participants were urged to meet their obligation to work
to banish poverty through planned agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to the people not to treat the
Entandikwa funds, which were extended to them to fight poverty,
as a donation, adding that the money is a credit that must be
paid back for others to benefit from.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is reported to have also stressed the importance of
immunization, hygiene, nutrition and safe drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Extend Debt Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A ranking official of the
Russian Central Bank said Thursday that it will not extend the
90-day moratorium imposed in August on the payment of Russian bank
debts to nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Kozlov, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, said
banks would have to pay their debts, but not all banks would be
able to meet their commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank "will help our banks maintain the negotiating
process" with foreign creditors in order to keep the situation
from deteriorating "to loud and sensational processes," Interfax
quoted Kozlov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Kozlov told lawmakers at a meeting of the
Budget Committee of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
that some 720 commercial banks may be shut down during the
restructuring of the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has already divided all banks into four groups
according to the criteria spelled out in the restructuring
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 40 billion rubles (about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars) is
needed to make the banking system work, and to rescue all banks
would cost 141 billion rubles (8.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We do not have that much money," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first group of banks, those able to operate on their own,
numbering 590-600, or 38-39 percent of the total number of banks
in Russia without taking account of the Savings Bank (Sberbank),
are mostly "small and medium-sized ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
These banks account for 8.4 percent of the total amount of
private bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
The second group of banks, numbering 190, or 12.5 percent of
the total, will receive assistance. These regional banks account
for 18.3 percent of overall bank deposits, Kozlov said. Some 6.5
billion rubles (406.25 million dollars) will be required to bail
out these banks.
</P>
<P>
The third group includes 18 banks that are socially important,
12.2 percent of the total number, Kozlov said. They account for 40
percent of overall private deposits and will need 47.5 billion
rubles (about 3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fourth group are banks slated for closure. It includes 720
commercial banks holding 32 percent of all private deposits in the
country. It would take 80 billion rubles to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
At present, just over 1,500 banks are continuing operations in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
In another development, World Bank President James Wolfensohn
arrived here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the airport that he had come to support
the Russian Cabinet in difficult times.
</P>
<P>
His discussions with Russian government officials will center
on an economic stabilization program and World Bank projects in
the social, financial and other sectors of the Russian economy,
Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank has been doing its best to meet the
needs of the Russian people and has invariably had friendly
relations with the Russian cabinet, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that friends arrive at difficult times, which
is what I have done," Interfax quoted Wolfensohn as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Blames Iraq Shifts Responsibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States, in
response to criticism from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
said Thursday that "the whole world" sees Iraq should be
responsible for the weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a briefing that
"the easy way" to lift the sanctions against Iraq is Baghdad
complies and resumes cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Aziz rapped the U.S. government for
"blocking" Iraq's way toward sincere cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors and "blocking" the alleviation of Iraqi people's
hardships.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said there has been sincere Iraqi compliance and
cooperation with the U.N. over weapons inspections over the past
seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the other commitments of the U.N. resolution
687 have not been fulfilled by the Security Council because of the
U.S. opposition, referring to the lifting of sanctions as
stipulated by the Paragraph 22 of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are serious about lifting sanctions, we are serious about
living peacefully in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
In response, Rubin said Iraq could take a "simple path" to
defuse the crisis by agreeing to international demands to resume
weapons inspection but there was no sign Baghdad was moving in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly Iraq is desperately trying to shift responsibility for
the crisis from its doorstep to the United States. That effort is
failing completely and totally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had telephone
conversations on Thursday with at least six other foreign
ministers -- Germany, Slovenia, France, Portugal, Japan and Sweden
-- and was also speaking with key members of Congress, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to parse all the details of this, other than to
say that the international community is united; and that is that
what they really want is not what Tariq Aziz said today," Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough warnings from the United States and a
military buildup in the Gulf, the Clinton administration does not
rule out a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a briefing: "We have
said all along and continue to say that the president and the
international community prefer a peaceful resolution to this
situation."
</P>
<P>
"We prefer the circumstance where UNSCOM is allowed to do their
work, an aggressive and intrusive UNSCOM, to go in and look and do
the work that they were sent to Baghdad, to Iraq, to do," Lockhart
told reporters.

WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Dennis Ross will
fly to the Middle East Thursday to continue work on the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Ross does intend to leave this evening for the
Middle East," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the approval of the Wye agreement signed by Israel
and the Palestine Authority on October 23 in Washington, Rubin
said "the focus of both parties must now be on implementation."
</P>
<P>
Ross had been planning another Mideast mission for more than a

the new land-and-security accord, signed in Washington on October
23 after marathon U.S.-brokered negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday but
attached a series of conditions that Palestinians view as attempts
by Israel to backtrack on the deal.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to talk to both sides about the need to follow
through on implementing the agreement and to move quickly toward
negotiations on a final peace accord involving the most difficult
issues such as the status of Jerusalem, refugees and Palestinian
demands for a state.
</P>
<P>
"It's essential that we move ahead and accelerate permanent
status negotiations so that the parties can begin to deal with the
core issues," said Rubin.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
Thursday said that all the parties concerned should remain
committed to the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
agreement signed last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the remarks in meeting with Mahmoud Abbas,
secretary general of the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), Jordan's official news agency, the
Petra, reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan fully supports the Palestinians in their request to
obtain their legitimate rights and establish their independent
state on their national soil, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's meeting with Abbas mainly focused on measures to
implement the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and issues about the
Palestinian-Jordanian coordination in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the recent Palestinian-Israeli accord, Israel will pull
back its troops from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in
three months while the Palestinians intensify crackdown on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was conducted within the framework of consistent
consultation and coordination between Jordan and the PLO in the
peace process, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab states to sign peace
treaties with Israel. The other Arab country is Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Abbas arrived in Amman earlier Thursday on a brief visit in the
backdrop that Israeli cabinet has just approved the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes the two sides can implement the accord as soon as
possible to help facilitate Jordan's access to the Palestinian
markets that under Israel's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has pledged to break the barriers exerted by Israel
around the Palestinian self-rule areas to help made-in-Jordan
products enter Palestinian markets.

National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) during
their attack last Saturday on five villages in north Angola's
Malanje Province.
</P>
<P>
People fleeing from Calandula City near the villages said, a

Cateco-Cangola and looted food and poultries before setting fire
on villagers' houses. The 14 people who failed to escape were
burned to death, the Angola News Agency reported Thursday.

The UNITA militiamen also planted landmines on the road
leading to Calandula City in the southeast of the province to

<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Kills Three Germans, One Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Three German tourists
and a Tanzanian pilot died in a plane crash Wednesday in
southwest Tanzania's Mbeya Region, the police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Laurian Sanya, regional police commander, told reporters that
another German tourist was critically injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Narrating the incident, Sanya said, at around 12:30 p.m. in
the fateful day, a six-passenger aircraft landed at the Chankonde
airstrip at the Usangu National Park to pick the tourists to
Zanzibar isles.
</P>
<P>
After taking off one meter above the ground, the plane which
was owned by Air Zanzibar, failed to make an upward movement
because of engine problems, Sanya said.
</P>
<P>
The plane managed to land and was attended before taking off
again. But when it flew some 450 meters above the ground, the
plane experienced similar problems which made it fall and crash
in fire, reports reaching here quoted the police commander as
saying.
</P>
<P>
One of the dead tourists was only identified as Kusswetter.
The other two tourists who died in the accident included Von Bary
and Claus Kara Edward, both aged 58. The pilot of the aircraft
was named as Claudis Molley.
</P>
<P>
The survivor, Norbet Friedrich Herman, 59, suffered critical
injuries and has been admitted to the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es
Salaam for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the deceased have been taken to the Muhimbili
Medical Center in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Sanya said the four visitors entered the country on November 3
through the Dar es Salaam International Airport and on the
following day they left the city to Usangu as tourists and
hunters as well.

<HEADLINE> 14 Villagers Burned to Death by UNITA Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Angolan police revealed here
Thursday that 14 people were burned to death by the forces of
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) during
their attack last Saturday on five villages in north Angola's
Malanje Province.
</P>
<P>
People fleeing from Calandula City near the villages said, a
pocket of UNITA soldiers attacked five villages including
Cateco-Cangola and looted food and poultries before setting fire
on villagers' houses. The 14 people who failed to escape were
burned to death, the Angola News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA militiamen also planted landmines on the road
leading to Calandula City in the southeast of the province to
prevent government army from coming to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, armed UNITA bandits reportedly killed 24
people in a diamond mine in east Angola's Lunda-Norte Province
during their looting.
</P>
<P>
Luis Paulino dos Santos, governor of Bie Province, central
Angola, disclosed the other day that a total of 129 people in his
province have been killed by UNITA forces since January this
year, while 2,485 others were kidnaped in forced recruitment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the insecurity in the province has led to an
addition of 30,000 new refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Rebels fighting to overthrow
President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) have announced another important military gain, the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
RNA quoted rebel-controlled Radio Goma monitored in Rwanda as
saying that Kongolo, located in Katanga Province in east DRC,
fell to the rebel forces on Monday night. The rebel forces are now
heading toward Lubumbashi, DRC's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
The radio also denounced the Sudanese engagement on the
side of Kabila, accusing the Sudan of having dispatched a cargo
airplane to Mbandaka Town to supply the Chadian contingent based in
that town of Oriental Province.
</P>
<P>
Congolese Democratic Coalition (RCD) Chairman Wamba dia Wamba
held a meeting with other RCD officials Wednesday, the Radio
reported. Wamba was returning from a trip abroad which took him
to Zambia, South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Wamba denied that the troops of a self-proclaimed rebel
leader, Jean Pierre Bemba, were involved in the fighting with
Chadian troops at Aketi Town in north DRC.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the RCD officials have expressed great
concern about the massive influx of Hutu extremists from refugee
camps in Congo-Brazzaville, Central African Republic, and the
Sudan to the DRC to prop up Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The RCD has warned the asylum countries, the United Nations,
particularly the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), about the consequences of the involvement of the Rwandan
Hutu extremists in the war in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the gravity of the situation, the RCD calls
upon brother countries, the UNHCR to take necessary measures to
assume the entire responsibility about the involvement of the
refugees, in violation of the Geneva international convention,"
said a RCD statement.

<HEADLINE> Euro May Pose Strategical and Tactical Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of the
single European currency, the Euro, would pose strategical as well
as tactical problems to the economy of Romania, an associate EU
country seeking admission, the Rompres news agency Thursday quoted
Romania's Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Romanian bankers and economists could not be indifferent to the
future of Euro in the international payment system and as a
reserve currency, the evolution of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate,
the relations which will be established between the national
currency Leu and Euro, or Euro's effect on Romanian commercial and
payments balance, Isarescu said at a Wednesday colloquium on Euro
by the Romanian Society of Economics.
</P>
<P>
The answers to these matters represent the precondition for
identifying the monetary and currency policies which might ensure,
in the shortest delay, the criteria for a convergence between the
Romanian economic and monetary system, on the one hand, and the
Economic and monetary Union, on the other hand, the Governor
added.

<HEADLINE> New Istanbul Mayor Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Islamic candidate Ali
Mufit Gurtuna was elected Thursday Istanbul mayor in the city
assembly to succeed Recep Tayyip Erdogan who was removed for for
inciting religious hatred.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that Gurtuna,
member of the Virtue Party (FP), won by a wide margin, gaining
111 out of 196 votes in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The election was another victory of the Islamic movement in
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, which won victory in
the city for the first time in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Another two candidates for the post were Motherland Party
(ANAP) member Bahtiyar Uyanik and Republican People's Party (CHP)
member Ozkan Yigici.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the
sentence of 10-month imprisonment for Erdogan who was found
guilty by the State Security Court in Diyarbakir, southeast
Turkey, in April "for inciting hatred based on religious
differences" in a speech at a political rally in December last
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the conviction, the 45-year-old Erdogan would not be
able to hold an elective office for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan, elected mayor four years ago on the Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) ticket, joined the FP after the RP was shut down early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Known as an orator, he was widely viewed as the person who
would eventually lead the Islamic movement in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Show TV reported Thursday night that
pro-Islamic Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek was also detained on charges
of tampering with municipal contracts worth 240 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gokcek is being interrogated for allegedly favoring private
companies linked to a pro-Islamic foundation in the bids.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Receives Top Brass of U.S. Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, November 12 (Xinhua)--Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings said Thursday that conflicts rocking some parts of
Africa are carry-overs from the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
He said that during that era when the east and west fought
their ideological war, pitching capitalism against communism, the
''hot war'' was transferred to Africa, touching off several
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said this when the top brass of the United States Bar
Association called on him at the Castle, Osu. They are in Ghana
to interact with their local counterparts and to explore
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said the consequences of policies pursued
during the Cold War era could be seen in Angola, Zaire and some
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Several countries in Africa have made progress in
terms of development, but it is sad, he noted, that this is not seen
and rather conflicts are given prominence.
</P>
<P>
''During the era of the Cold War, Zaire under the late
President Mobutu Sese Seko was used to destabilize a whole
region."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said he has been doing his best to explain
Africa's complex situation to the international community and has
been calling for understanding of the continent's problems.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings briefed the US lawyers about Ghana's recent
political history, its era of coups and general instability, and
said significant successes have been achieved over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
William Hanay, Leader of the U.S. delegation, said the intention
of the delegation is to expose U.S. lawyers to their Ghanaian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
''We have come because of the achievements Ghana has made and
we have come to learn more and take the message back home," he
said.

MAPUTO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Demining
Commission Director Osorio Mateus said here Thursday that a total
of 53,132 anti-tank and -personnel mines have been cleared in the
country since the campaign started in 1992.
</P>
<P>

in addition to 90-km railroad and 379-km transmission lines,
Mateus made the remarks at the opening of an international
seminar on institutional reform of the demining sector.
</P>
<P>
About two million landmines had been planted in Mozambique
during its 16-year long civil war. The de-mining campaign
began in 1992 at the end of the war, with the assistance of
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
To date, 116 million U.S. Dollars has been spent on de-mining.
</P>
<P>
The current seminar which aimed at simplifying procedures and
increase efficiency in de-mining institutions was supported by
the United Nations Development Program.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets with Japanese LDP Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said here
today that the CPC hopes to deepen friendly exchanges with Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and all other parties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also the Chinese president, in meeting with visiting LDP
Secretary-General Mori Yoshiro, expressed the hope that statesmen
in both China and Japan will continue to work together and be
far-sighted in order to deal appropriately with issues affecting
bilateral relations and ultimately accelerate the growth of
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
It is enormously significant that the LDP secretary-general is
visiting China on the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-Japanese Treaty on Peace and Friendship, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is about to visit Japan, pointed out that Sino-Japan
relations are going through an important historical period right
now, and that the kind of Sino-Japanese relationship that is
brought into the 21st century is a major topic facing statesmen
in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Only by seriously summarizing the positive experiences while
taking into account the negative lessons of the history of
Sino-Japanese relations in this century, and by respecting history
and seizing opportunity, can a good-neighborly Sino-Japanese
cooperative relationship of long-term stability be built, one that
will see friendship between the people of the two countries for
generations to come, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the party-to-party relationship, Jiang noted that exchanges
between parties are an important component part of the
state-to-state relationship. Exchanges between parties of both
countries, which have become increasingly active, have greatly
increased mutual understanding and promoted the growth of
state-to-state relations, added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Mori delivered a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi to Jiang, and said the Japanese government and people are
looking forward to President Jiang's upcoming visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
This is a major event in the history of bilateral relations
between China and Japan, and will surely promote friendship and
understanding between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
As an eyewitness to the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty on
Peace and Friendship two decades ago, Mori expressed his sincere
hope that long-term and stable friendship and cooperative ties
oriented toward the 21st century be shaped between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the guests on China's current domestic
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese guests have come to visit China at the invitation
of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Assembly Agrees to Probe Soeharto's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent response to
mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian
legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into
former president Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
All five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR),
the country's highest legislative body, agreed to add a provision
in a decree on clean governance, preventing centralization of
power, corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough
investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends,
the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed
its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary meeting on Wednesday, Golkar spokesperson
Marwah Daud Ibrahim said the implementation of a clean government,
with no traces of corruption, collusion and nepotism, is a
prerequisite to achievement of the aims of the 1945 proclamation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Golkar officially declared war against
corruption, collusion and nepotism. During the 32 year rule of
Soeharto, Golkar had been in the government bandwagon, given an
amen to virtually all the regime's policies and whims.
</P>
<P>
However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special
MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's
wealth. It said it would be more relevant if the call for the
probe into the riches of the former president and his family was
made part of the decree on corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a
separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials,
former officials and their families.
</P>
<P>
The faction's spokesman Djuhad Mahja told reporters that they
finally agreed with the decree on anti-corruption, collusion and
nepotism because the faction's proposal had been accommodated in
it.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the stand of the Golkar on the subject, the
Jakarta Post said, "This is another display of their halfhearted
commitment to clean up corruption. A clause in a decree can easily
be ignored, but a specific decree would give the needed impetus to
kick start the investigation."

BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of officials and noted
figures attended a local panel discussion today to commemorate the
centennial anniversary of the birth of Zhu Ziqing, a well-known
Chinese scholar, writer and educator.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference National Committee, Ding Shisun, vice
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and
Minister of Education Chen Zhili attended the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The panel was jointly sponsored by the United Front Department
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Ministry
of Education. President Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription for
the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, who is also head of the United Front Department,
spoke to the gathering. He said that Zhu's great spirit and
lofty personality will live in the world forever, though he lived
for only 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"We commemorate Zhu Ziqing today to inherit and display his
lofty spirit of patriotism and the national integrity of the
Chinese nation," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's literary works, mostly prose pieces such as "Gazing at
His Father's Receding Figure" and "Lotus Pond in the Moonlight,"
have been widely adopted in school textbooks in nearly all
Chinese-language schools around the world.

PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- France welcomed on Friday an
agreement reached by Cambodian parties on forming a coalition
government and called for its implementation.
</P>

"France hails the acceptance by the concerned parties to

assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
France calls on all the parties to show their responsibility by

The spokesman also praised King Norodom Sihanouk for his effort

</P>
<P>
He said that France noted that opposition leaders have been
given a guarantee of personal security or parliamentary immunity by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh has
agreed to set up a coalition government with Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after several months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The general elections held in July in Cambodia failed to give
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party enough votes to form a
government alone.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Allot Funds to Private Fund Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
announced Friday that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
will allot 10 billion Singapore dollars (about 6.06 billion U.S.
dollars) to private sector fund managers in the next three years
to make Singapore a premier asset management center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 25th anniversary dinner of the ACI Singapore --
the Financial Markets Association (SFMA), Minister for National
Development and Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang said MAS
will initially make the placement to "qualifying fund managers of
good, proven track record and who show commitment to developing
the Singapore asset management industry."
</P>
<P>
"This would include bringing in additional funds for management
in Singapore, as well as building up locally-based fund management
expertise," Lim Said.
</P>
<P>
"These funds will act as seed money to encourage existing fund
management companies to continue to grow in their operations as
well as to attract other fund management companies to set up
offices in Singapore," Lim noted.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the announcement in February by Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong that the Government Investment
Corporation (GIC) would be placing an additional 25 billion
Singapore dollars (about 15.15 billion U.S. dollars) with external
fund managers over the next three years, Lim noted that the GIC
has already granted mandates worth 6.5 billion Singapore dollars
(3.94 billion U.S. dollars) in the period from January to
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim, the latest MAS Survey of Treasury Activities
shows that total treasury revenue for 1997 had increased by 70
percent over the previous year to a record 4.6 billion Singapore
dollars (about 2.79 billion U.S. dollars) while treasury profits
have doubled to 3.1 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.88 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lim said the financial industry has an equally good year in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Act to Cut Widening Current Account Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's widening current
account deficit has prompted the government to prepare a number of
counter measures, the Saigon Times daily reported Friday, quoting
an official of the State Bank of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Doan Hung, director of the central bank's foreign
exchange department, said current accounts have been in the red in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The deficit is estimated to be some 1.3 billion U.S. dollars
this year and 1.9 billion U.S. dollars next year," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Exports have dropped drastically due to the impact of the
regional financial crisis. The official said domestic exporters
are holding large foreign funds in their overseas bank accounts
for fear that the dong will further depreciate, the Saigon Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily said in the near term, the
government will hardly be able to raise sufficient foreign funds
to ensure the balance of current accounts because foreign currency
flowing into the country is mainly channeled into scheduled
investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's non-trade payments have fallen into the
red for the first time in years due to large foreign debt
repayments and foreign investors' repatriation of local profits.
</P>
<P>
Hung added that first of all, the government will adopt
measures to encourage exports and curb imports.
</P>
<P>
Exporters bringing foreign earnings home will be offered a
foreign exchange rate higher than the official rate, the daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Regarding imports, the government will consider imposing
restrictions on the import of unnecessary goods by adjusting
import tax. The move will help cut foreign currency spending.
</P>
<P>
New regulations on state management of foreign reserves will be
issued, according to the daily.

<HEADLINE> France: Iraq Can Still Avoid U.S. Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- France said on Friday that Iraq
can still avoid a U.S. military strike and obtain the lifting of
U.N. sanctions by resuming cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"France still hopes to see a diplomatic solution" to the
crisis caused by Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with
U.N. inspectors in late October, said French Foreign Ministry
assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan and the U.N. Security Council have indicated that the
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq can be lifted if Baghdad fully
cooperates with the inspectors by allowing a "comprehensive
examination."
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Iraq to make a gesture. Once again, the ball is
in the Iraqi camp," he said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to speculate on the French position once the United
States launches an attack on Iraq, but said that resorting to
force is only one of the options, which could be approved by the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The French representative of interests in Baghdad, Yves Aubin
de la Messuziere, was expected to return to the Iraqi capital, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Favors Negotiated Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy believes that "there is
still room for a negotiated solution" to the latest crisis between
the United States and Iraq, Italian Foreign under-Secretary
Umberto Ramieri said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the same solution has been expressed by Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramieri said a negotiated solution will be possible
only "on the condition that the Iraqi government show its
readiness to collaborate and immediately allow the resumption of
inspections by the United Nations in areas suspected of harboring
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Ramieri said,"Contacts with Iraqi leaders
are underway by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and our
allies are making efforts as well."
</P>
<P>
As for Italy's decision to evacuate its citizens from Baghdad,
Ramieri said, "it's an inevitable measure when tension has reached
such a level that military action would be possible."
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister D'Alema on Friday told the press that
"the attitude of Saddam Hussein is very negative," but it was
"very important that "the whole Arab world has called on the Iraqi
leader to resume collaboration with the U.N."
</P>
<P>
"No one can predict what is going to happen," D'Alema said,"Let
us hope that international political pressure will produce a
positive effect to find a way out of this crisis."

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman Meets ROK President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said
here today that NPC would like to strengthen its ties with
the parliament of the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with ROK President Kim Dae-jung, Li noted
that exchanges and cooperation between the parliaments of the two
countries constitute an important component part of Sino-ROK ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that President Kim's current state
visit will make a great contribution to the further development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and the ROK are good neighbors, and the
peoples of the two countries enjoy a long-term friendship, Li said
that China would like to join the ROK in pushing bilateral ties to
a new level.
</P>
<P>
Kim called his meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Thursday "very good," and said that the two countries will carry
out effective cooperation in more fields through this visit.
</P>
<P>
The ROK president gave a briefing on measures adopted by his
country to overcome its economic difficulties. He expressed his
appreciation for China's stand not to devalue its currency, and
for maintaining Asia's economic development and financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "the financial crisis tells us that while economic
globalization brings about many opportunities to developing
countries, unreasonable economic relations have made many
developing countries face grave challenges and difficulties, and
proper attention have not been paid to their interests."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the developing countries know how
to protect themselves, and the international community should make
efforts to change the unreasonable and unjust economic order and push
forward the establishment of a new international political and
economic order.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization should be conductive to the formation of
a new economic order in the world, Li said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, inspected the National Institute of Procurators today.
</P>
<P>
Luo visited an exhibition on the history of the institute and
spoke highly of the institution for its fruitful work. Luo is also
secretary of the Political Science and Law Committee of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the staff of the institute, Luo said that
Chinese procuratorates are facing heavier and harder tasks and the
country needs a large number of politically reliable, well-trained
and skillful professionals, along with the deepening of reform and
opening, and the gradual establishment of the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The top criterion for a qualified Chinese procurator is his
political stand and faithfulness to the Party, the people and the
law, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Luo was accompanied by Procurator-General Han
Zhubin and Chairmen of the Chinese People's Political Consultative

<HEADLINE> South Korea Thumps China 3-0 at Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea blanketed China
3-0 in a soccer friendly match held between teams formed by top
players from the two countries leagues here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Forward Choi Yong Soo put the visitors ahead in the 21st
minute and Kim Doh Keun made it 2-0 in the dying moment of the
first half to make it 2-0 at break.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans sealed the victory with a penalty kick by
Ahn Jung Kwan in the 36 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Choi Yong Soo silenced the sell-out crowd when he blasted home
the opening goal after he latched on to a heading cross just in
front of the goal, leaving the goalie Han Wenhai helpless there
without any response.
</P>
<P>
China replied with their quick counter-attacks but failed to
find the net with the lack of finishing power.
</P>
<P>
Qi Hong had a chance to drove a ball in the middle following a
consistent organization, only to chip the ball to the hand of the
goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Kim exploited a blunder from the host defence, volleying home
comfortably just before the whistle in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The host shuffled the line-up in the second half with most
coming from Shanghai Shenhua club, the champion of China's League
Cup.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to save their grave in front of the
enthusiastic crowd under the attacking pressure from South
Koreans.
</P>
<P>
South Koreans killed the hope of the host when the forward Ahn
Jung Kwan converted the penalty kick awarded after he was fell by
a Chinese defender in the area with a tackle from behind.
</P>
<P>
Both sides feature line-ups composing of the elites from the
domestic league, with the South Korean squad boasting 12 players
who had attended the 1994 and 1998 World Cups.
</P>
<P>
The line-ups for Asian Games from both coutries will clash
with each other in Shanghai on November 22.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier: National Health Campaign Should Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's decades-long national
patriotic health campaign should be continued, Li Lanqing, member
of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a vice premier, made the remark at the 12th
plenary session of the National Committee of the Patriotic Health
Campaign, which he also heads.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the campaign, which was first advocated by the
older generation of revolutionaries 46 years ago, is now to
improve people's health conditions and advance economic
development and social progress, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The health campaign has played a huge role at various stages of
China's socialist construction and has generated good social and
economic benefits, Li told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The patriotic health campaign is an important part of China's
effort to advance socialist cultural and ethical progress, and an
effective way to raise the overall quality of the entire nation,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the campaign must be continued," he said, noting
that the vast rural areas should be a focus of the health campaign
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in the health conditions of farmers and in their
living standards will greatly promote rural work, Li said, adding
that the health campaign should be united with reconstruction in
the flood-damaged areas to avoid the spread of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the health campaign in the rural areas is to
continue efforts to improve the quality of drinking water and the
sanitary conditions to prevent and reduce various diseases, the
vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts should also be made to improve medical
conditions in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the patriotic health campaign should be
carried forward in the urban areas, with emphasis on reinforcing
the residents' health consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Li urged governments at all levels to attach keen importance to
the patriotic health campaign and create a favorable environment
for the progress of this work.

<HEADLINE> Common Virus Kills Cancer Cells, Study Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have
discovered that a common, normally benign virus often found in
children can destroy cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue
unscathed, the National Post newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Large tumors on mice disappeared within weeks of being injected
with the tiny microbes, said Dr. Patrick Lee of the University of
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
Lee's team has published details of its work on Friday's
edition of the Science Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have also shown the virus kills a wide range of
human cancer cells in the test tube. The more malignant the cancer
cells, the faster they die.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lee has worked with the virus for 20 years. He stressed that
much work still remains to be done to find out if it will work its
cancer-arresting magic on people.
</P>
<P>
His team has applied to the federal Department of Health for
permission to start tests on people with advanced breast, head and
neck cancer as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to inject millions of live viruses into cancer
patients' tumors in the hope the micro-organisms will eradicate
the growth while sparing nearby tissue.
</P>
<P>
The virus is described by Dr. Lee as "ubiquitous, relatively
harmless and easy to grow in the lab." It is often found in
children and symptoms of its presence include runny noses, mild
headaches, fever and possibly diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The discovery raises the hope that the virus will be able to
eradicate cancer without damaging normal tissue the way
chemotherapy, radiation treatments and surgical procedures do.
</P>
<P>
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in Canadians, after
heart disease. It is diagnosed in as many as 128,000 Canadians
each year.

<HEADLINE> Sino-South African Relations Satisfying: SA Communist Party Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South African (SA) Communist
Party General Secretary Blade Nzimande said here today that he is
satisfied with the growth of bilateral relations SA established
with China 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary, who is visiting China at the
invitation of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said in an
interview with Xinhua that the establishment of diplomatic
ties with China has brought an evident increase in bilateral
cooperation in many fields.
</P>
<P>
As a leading member of the African National Congress (ANC),
Nzimande was one of the primary figures in SA calling for
diplomatic relations with China. He has visited China five times
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"We regard to the establishment of diplomatic relations
between our two countries as a milestone in the history of our
relationship," he said, "We are very, very satisfied (with the
growth of relations) ...it has opened enormous opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Nzimande said the most evident change after the establishment
of relations was the surge of bilateral trade. Though he gave no
figures, trade volume between China and SA has been reported at
1.57 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Now, many Chinese enterprises have started doing business in
South Africa, he said, and the largest brewery in South Africa has
established ventures in China, while South African banks have
opened offices in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Nzimande said there are still great potentials to be explored
in bilateral trade and economic cooperation, adding that South
Africa welcomes Chinese investment in such fields as information
technology, tourism, construction technology and expertise.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary held talks with Jiang Zemin, General
Secretary of CPC Central Committee, earlier today. He described
the talk as conducive to bringing relations between the two
parties to a new level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
visiting Republic of Korea (ROK) President Kim Dae jung reached
consensus during their meeting here today that China and the ROK
have reaped considerable achievements in their cooperation in
various fields, and have become important trade partners.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic and trade relations have witnessed rapid
progress since the establishment of diplomatic relations as shown
by annual increases in trade volume, Zhu said, citing the 1997
figure of 24 billion U.S. dollars, and the fact that China has
become an important ROK investment target.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is very concerned with the trade imbalance
between the two countries, and seeks a solution through active
expansion of bilateral trade. China is willing to close the gap in
its mutually beneficial cooperation with the ROK by tapping their
economic complementarity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kim affirmed that the ROK will take practical measures to
achieve a balanced growth of bilateral trade. He also expressed
his appreciation for China's quick recovery from the unprecedented
floods under the guidance of the Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that China's reform is still heading forward
toward its designated goal despite the influence of the Asian
financial crisis and the great losses caused by the exceedingly
big floods.
</P>
<P>
Kim also thanked the Chinese government for maintaining the
stability of the Renminbi yuan, noting that the ROK and other
Asian countries have benefited from this in their economic
restoration.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that China has helped ease the financial
crisis and safeguarded regional stability by maintaining the value
of its currency, and providing possible financial assistance to
some countries through international financial institutions or
bilateral channels. China will continue its efforts in this
regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he expressed the hope that the ROK and other relevant
countries will overcome the crisis and reinvigorate their
economies by drawing lessons and making necessary adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Zhu recalled his meeting with Kim and their in-depth talks on
bilateral relations and other issue of common concern in London in
April this year, and said he hopes Kim's current China visit will
be a success and help promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Zhu hosted a banquet in honor of President
Kim and his party.

Lucienne Robillard, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
hopes to introduce the legislative changes in the parliament
before Christmas, according to Canada's leading newspaper, the
Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
One of the main focuses of the proposed new law is to ensure
that all immigrants remain in Canada for at least three years
in a five-year period before they apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Present law requires that immigrants reside in Canada for three
out of four years before the date of application.
</P>
<P>
Some judges have ruled that a person who is out of the country
for lengthy periods of time may still obtain citizenship if the
person has ties to the country through ownership of a home,
payment of taxes or moving family members here.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some judges have applied the law more
strictly. Therefore, sharper definitions for citizenship are
needed, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The new proposals on residency are likely to bring objections
from those who feel the requirements will scare away international
business people, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A Toronto immigration lawyer said he opposes the proposals
because they could persuade many international investors to seek
citizenship elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Irish Soccer Officials Slam FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Outraged Republic of Ireland
soccer manager Mick McCarthy slammed FIFA on Friday for allowing
English clubs to field Irish players this weekend - ahead of
their Euro 2000 clash with Yugoslavia next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
English Premier League side Charlton had asked the
international football governing body for permission to hold onto
the Republic's Mark Kinsella and Yugoslav keeper Sasa Ilic.
</P>
<P>
The south London club argued that the necessary paperwork had
not been submitted in time for the match in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
And FIFA found in Charlton's favor on Thursday, over-ruling
its own "five-day" regulation, which allows national bosses to
assemble their teams to prepare for big matches.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling means Manchester United pair Roy Keane and
Denis Irwin will also miss the build-up to the re-arranged
European Championship qualifier.
</P>
<P>
McCarthy fumed: "It is a joke. I have no axe to grind with
those English bosses who were protecting their club's interest,
their jobs and their fans.
</P>
<P>
"I am angry with FIFA. I thought the five-day rule was cast in
stone. You either have a five-day release rule or not.
</P>
<P>
"They've moved the goalposts - and it's another nail in the
coffin of international football," he said.
</P>
<P>
And in a statement, Bernard O'Byrne, chief executive of the
Football Association of Ireland, added:
</P>
<P>
"We have received this message with utter disbelief. It is
clear that FIFA has decided not to apply their own rules in this
particular situation."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavia match had been due to take place in October in
Belgrade, but was postponed due to the political tensions in
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Hold General Election in May or June 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's highest
legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Friday
night decided to hold the general election in next May or June at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
In a decree adopted by legislators, the 1999 general election
will be held on a holiday, or a day which is declared being a
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree adopted at the MPR sessions held in March this
year, the general election will be held in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The new decree also stipulated that the Armed Forces (ABRI)
retains its representation through appointment in the House of
Representatives (DPR), but will gradually reduce in size over
time.
</P>
<P>
In the five factions in the MPR, only the United Development
Party faction stuck to its guns and insisted that the military
should not be given seats in the legislative bodies. They said
that if ABRI was to have seats in the two legislative bodies then
it must contest them in elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the other factions said that ABRI should continue to
be represented in the House by a faction.
</P>
<P>
Following the resignation of former president Soeharto on May
21, moving-forward of the 2002 general election to 1999 became
part of the government's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Harmoko said in his speech at the opening ceremony of
the Special Session of the MPR on Tuesday that the general
election is the best way for the people to determine their own
future in a democratic manner.
</P>
<P>
The general election will be followed by a general assembly of
the MPR in December 1999 to elect new president and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's top four leaders on Tuesday declared
that the MPR should elect a new president and vice president at
the latest three months after the general election next May.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders are Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of the 40
million-strong Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama; Amien Rais,
chairman of the National Mandate Party; Megawati Soekarnoputri,
who leads a popular faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party;
and Yogyakarta Governor Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and
opposition groups for his early resignation, President B.J.
Habibie said on Thursday that his Cabinet would continue to serve
the country until the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, South African Communist Party Leaders Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to further
further exchanges and cooperation between the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the South African Communist Party in a bid to
promote healthy growth of state-to-state ties, General Secretary
Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also president of China, made the remark in a meeting
here this afternoon with a senior delegation of the South African
Communist Party led by General Secretary Blade Nzimande.

<P>
Describing Nzimande as an old friend of the Chinese people who

</P>
<P>
Jiang stated that China and South Africa have maintained
good momentum since they established diplomatic relations at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
"China treasures its ties with South Africa, as diplomatic ties
and the strengthening of cooperation are not only in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also conducive to
peace, stability and development in Africa and the world as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that in recent years, various African countries
have been striving to unite among themselves and become
self-reliant, and to explore ways of development suitable to their
own circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"I hold the belief that Africa will surely have a bright
future, so long as these countries and people adhere to their own
proper policies, and strengthen unity and cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang underlined that strengthening unity and cooperation with
African countries is an important part and a long-term strategy
of China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of China and various African nations, he
noted, bilateral close, friendly and cooperative relations will
surely be given further impetus.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the two parties, Jiang said that the South
African Communist Party has rich experiences in its struggle, and
the CPC is willing to further exchanges and cooperation with the
South African party.
</P>
<P>
Nzimande said the friendship between South Africa and China has
a long history and the forging of diplomatic ties at the beginning
of this year is an inevitable outcome of this friendship.
</P>
<P>
Due to the normalization of state-to-state ties, he continued,
bilateral economic cooperation has recorded swift growth which, he
said, should be further expanded.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people's initiatives and their great achievements
have left them a deep impression, Nzimande said, adding that he
hopes to further promote relations and exchanges between the two
parties.
</P>

<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Six of Japan's Self-Defense
Forces (SDF) military planes left for Honduras on a relief mission
on Friday to help the Central American country recover from a
devastating hurricane, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 transport planes, which were packed with medical
supplies, are heading Japan's first SDF mission to be sent
overseas under a law on the dispatch of disaster relief teams.
</P>
<P>
The law was revised in 1992 to let the SDF participate in
overseas relief missions.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government decided earlier in the day to send the
SDF relief team because damage in Honduras from Hurricane Mitch
"is worse than imagined," and the people are in dire need of
medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 80 SDF personnel will leave for Honduras on a
commercial flight.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese relief workers, which also include some 20 members
from Japan's Foreign Ministry and the Japan International
Cooperation Agency, will spend two weeks in Honduras to set up
field hospitals and work to prevent the outbreak of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,400 people were reportedly killed in Honduras when
Hurricane Mitch ripped through Central America recently.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen met
with Kim Dae-jung, president of the Republic of Korea (ROK) here
today.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Sino-ROK friendship and cooperative relations
have witnessed significant progress under the guidance of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Sino-ROK Joint
Communique on the establishment of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that developing cooperative Sino-ROK relations is not
only in the interests of both countries and their people, but is
also conducive to ensuring peace, prosperity and stability in
northeast Asia and on the Asian continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China and Korean Peninsula are linked by rivers and
mountains and thus the nation is greatly concerned about the
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining peace and stability in the region has always been
China's basic principle regarding the peninsula issue, said
Qian. He added that China hopes all concerned parties will
treasure the results thus far reached, practice patience and
restraint, and settle properly all relevant issues through
dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that China, a close neighbor of the Korean
Peninsula, will continue to play a constructive role in easing and
stabilizing the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
Kim agreed that the two countries have witnessed rapid
development of bilateral relations in all fields since the
establishment of diplomatic ties, and noted that he and President
Jiang have agreed to strengthen cooperative relations between
China and the ROK.
</P>
<P>
China's persistent policy on safeguarding peace and stability
on the Korean Peninsula has contributed greatly to ensuring
stability in the region, according to Kim.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Tighten Watch on Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered Friday government agencies to keep a tighter watch
on the beef imports from other countries to protect the local
livestock industry from unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the protection of the interest of local
entrepreneurs is a top priority of his administration.
</P>
<P>
"We're finding out if importation is necessary. If the meat
supply is enough, we'll tighten importation to protect our local
livestock raisers," he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The president also warned businessmen bringing in "hot" meat
(from cattle infected with diseases) that his administration will
not allow them to exploit the consumers, especially during
critical times.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow them to exploit our fellow Filipinos. If we
do, the poor will get hit the hardest," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an international organization warned that carabao beef
from India comes from two areas that have had outbreaks of the
foot-and-mouth disease since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Federation of Hog Farmers Inc. has also
claimed that Indian carabao beef is now sold at the country's
markets and used by some fast-food chains and meat processors.

MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will support
initiatives by members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) to provide fresh credit lines to crisis-hit economies in
the region, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Friday.
</P>

He said another measure which will be supported by the
Philippine government is Japan's initiative to provide 30 billion
U.S. dollars in loans and guarantees to help Asian governments
surmount debt burdens.
</P>

Apart from this, he said, Estrada will also back up U.S.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Urges Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In a parliamentary speech, German
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine Friday urged the central bank to
cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"No one questions the (Bundesbank's) monetary targets," said
Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank's undisputed priority is price stability, but
monetary policy should also have other aims, Lafontaine said. Once
price stability had been achieved, monetary policy should support
growth and the creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said there was room for interest rate cuts, as demonstrated
by eight other European central banks that had cut monetary market
rates recently.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine rejected criticism from the opposition accusing him
of pursuing false and outdated concepts of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) said the
government's planned reform of the tax system represents only part
of the overall measures needed to fight unemployment. Its primary
aim, he said, was justice.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform is to occur in two stages. The first stage in
1999 is designed to benefit primarily low wage earners and
families with children, while removing tax breaks for companies;
the second stage will see tax reductions for companies.
</P>
<P>
The government says the reform will reduce the taxpayer's
burden by 15 billion marks (9 billion U.S. dollars) by the year
2002.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Government Considering Wage Cut Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Ministry of
Manpower Friday confirmed that the government is considering the
National Wage Council's (NWC's) latest recommendations for a cut
of total wages between 5 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the ministry said the government is
studying the recommendations of the NWC and will respond in
parliament when the House meets on November 23-24 to debate on a
report of the Committee on Singapore's Competitions (CSC).
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the NWC made a statement on its revised wage
guidelines for 1998-99, in which it has called for a reduction in
both wage and non-wage costs to help companies regain
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
It has proposed a cut in total wage costs by 5-8 percent, which
together with the 10 percentage point cut in employers' CPF
(Central Provident Fund) contribution will achieve the overall
reduction of 15 percent in wage cost recommended by the CSC.
</P>
<P>
The NWC also recommended the wage cut be mainly in the form of
the variable wage component or end-of-the-year bonus under the
flexible wage system.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that employers consider moderating the wage cut
for lower income employees by implementing a deeper cut for the
higher income executives.
</P>
<P>
The NWC also appealed to the government, as the largest
employer in the city state, to set the tone and example in the
national wage cut.
</P>
<P>
The NWC emphasized the wage reduction recommendation is
national in scope and applies to companies and establishments,
both public and private, unionized and non-unionized.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Manpower said the NWC recommendations will help
Singapore regain cost competitiveness in the global market,
particularly in the light of the sharp depreciation of the
regional currencies against the Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
Only when companies remain viable and profitable can they
safeguard jobs and create new ones, it stressed.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- President Kim Dae-jung of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) told more than 200 economists here today
that he hopes to further increase economic cooperation between the
ROK and China.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Vice-Chairman Jiang Chunyun of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, President Kim
Dae-jung was attending a dinner of the China-ROK economic seminar
co-hosted by the China Council for Promotion of International
Trade (CCPIT) and the Korea-China Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
Kim praised China for keeping the Renminbi yuan stable, and
said that the ROK and China should enlarge cooperation in trade,
investment, industry and construction departments, and in the
fields of finance, environment, energy and technology, especially
in nuclear power and information and communications.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should draw lessons from each
other's experiences in economic development and "share
intelligence in the reform process."
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume has continued to grow since the two
nations forged diplomatic ties in 1992, However, the Asia
financial crisis has caused this volume to decrease in the first
half of this year, while the ROK's investment in China shrank.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, the authoritative economists of the two
countries briefed the attendance on their respective countries'
economic growth and absorption of investment. They also conferred
in depth on stark economic situation and explored ways to
strengthen bilateral cooperation and develop their economies.
</P>
<P>

Korea Electric Power Corporation signed during the seminar a
cooperation framework agreement.

<HEADLINE> Getting Around In Southwestern China Longer Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chengdu, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Getting around in southwest
China's Sichuan Province was notoriously difficult in the past,
but you wouldn't know that today when you go from its capital city
of Chengdu to the neighboring Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The commute between the two cities used to take 12 hours on a
narrow, zigzagging road, but an expressway built three years ago
has cut the time to three hours, making it easier than travelling
by air.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is a basin surrounded by mountains and transportation
used to be a major problem for economic development. Five decades
ago, there were only two railroads carrying coal for a mere 85
kilometers and very few highways.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the reforms and opening up, there has
been more investment in transportation. In the last five years, 20
billion yuan has been spent on transportation construction in the
province and by the end of last year, the province ranked second
in the nation in total mileage of highways, at 760, 000
kilometers. All counties and 85 percent of the villages of Sichuan
are connected by highways.
</P>
<P>
Another 20 billion yuan will be spent over the next few years,
according to Liu Zhongshan, director of the Transportation
Department of the province. The funds will come from the
government, businesses, and probably the stock market.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial government plan, Sichuan is expected
to have 1,000 kilometers of highways by the end of the century,
and by 2002, the figure is expected to be 1,500 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary Visits Lebanon for Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley arrived here Friday on a visit aimed at promoting economic
ties with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, Daley held talks with Lebanese
President-elect Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and
other senior economic officials, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Lahoud, who was elected president by
the parliament on October 15, Daley said that the main objective
for his visit fell within the framework to lift a travel warning
issued by the U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Albright lifted a decade-long travel ban for
Americans but warned that Lebanon was still a dangerous place to
visit.
</P>
<P>
During Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, many U.S. citizens in
Lebanon had become targets of the then-warring militia groups.
</P>
<P>
Daley described his trip to Lebanon as an attempt to improve
and develop ways of trade and economic cooperation between the
two countries, saying it will encourage more American companies
to invest in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Hariri, Daley said that many American
businessmen are becoming interested in resuming their activities
in Lebanon, a country which is going through changes and
improvement from the war-ravaged economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the second biggest exporter to Lebanon following
Italy, sold a total of 515 million U.S. dollars of products to
Lebanon in 1997 while the U.S. imports from Lebanon only stood at
80 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fast-food and financial giants McDonald's and Citibank
have set up branches in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Daley expressed the hope that his trip to Lebanon marks a start
for more visits by the U.S. businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Daley's visit to Lebanon came in part of his regional tour
which will also take him to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Coal Mine Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to further
strengthen management over its growing coal industry in order to
improve the sector's economic efficiency and reduce the number of
accidents, according to Thursday's issue of China Coal Mine News.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for closing 25,800 small coal mines and reducing
coal output by 250 million tons between now and the end of next
year, according to Zhang Baoming, director of the State
Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for closing mines centers excessive waste,
pollution and the lack of safety, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of small coal mines has resulted in an
oversupply of the coal market, and has forced 60 percent of key
state-owned coal mines to reduce output, or some close on a
temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive coal output resulted from the overproduction of
small mines," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said the total income of key state-owned mines fell by 6.73
billion yuan during the January-September period due to sluggish
sales and falling prices. Severe fund shortages have distablized
the production of many mines and created hardships for miners.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the use of obsolete equipment makes small mines
more prone to accidents. Small operations accounted for 73.2
percent of coal mine deaths between 1988-1997, according to the
official.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), met with a delegation led by Matti Kuusimaki, prosecutor
general of Finland here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the visitors on China's democratic and legal
construction, saying that with the establishment and growth of a
socialist market economy in the country, China's democratic and
legal construction has been continuously improved and a series of
laws and regulations have been created and implemented.
</P>
<P>
Strict law enforcement, and ensuring effective and correct law
enforcement, are key links and important legal construction tasks,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese constitution specifies that the
people's procuratorate is the country's law supervisory
institution and its primary duty is to ensure unified and correct
legal practices, so it shoulders major responsibility for the task
of promoting strict law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that all the world's countries need to
strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and exchanges between
judicial and procuratorial institutions constitute part of
state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the procuratorial departments of China and Finland
have forged good cooperative relations, said Li, adding that he
hopes that both sides can realize greater results in judicial
assistance and legal-personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Kuusimaki said the procuratorial departments of the two
countries enjoy a very good relationship, and this visit will
further mutual friendship and understanding between the two
sides. The Finnish side will continue to make efforts to this
end, Kuusimaki noted.

<HEADLINE> Fifty Million Chinese Suffer from Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) - Over 50 million Chinese
Diabetics spend over 170 billion yuan (20 billion US dollars)
annually for medical care, according to a recent national
epidemiological survey.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate for diabetes has reached 3.21 percent,
almost five times the level in 1980, according to recent survey
involving more than 40,000 urban and rural residents in 11
provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
"The estimated incidence rate for diabetes patients over 20
years old stands for 20 million citizen. An additional 30 million
people suffer from impaired glucose tolerance (LGT), the earliest
stage of diabetes," according to Professor Li Tianlin with the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM).
</P>
<P>
Li predicted that disease will remain as a serious public
health problem for the next 50 years due to inadequate measures
covering health check, as well as weak education and prevention
programs and the rapidly growing elderly population.
</P>
<P>
"The potential number of diabetics and LGT sufferers in
enourmous due to the fact that many people have never have checks
for blood sugar levels and lack sufficient knowledge of prevention
procedures," said Li, who works for the CAPM's Diabetes and
Noncommunicable Disease Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate in urban areas is higher than in rural areas
and females are more susceptible to diabetes than males.
Large cities like Beijing and Shanghai reported incidence rates
substantially higher than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes and related complications rank as one of the major
health risks in China, following cancer and both cardiovascular
and cerebral diseases. However, actual figures for deaths
resulting from diabetes have never been reported.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with healthy people, diabetic face a much greater
risk in terms of ischemic cardiovascular diseases, necrosis
of the lower limbs, renal failure and blindness," said Li.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China will attempt to avenge
their Thomas Cup loss against Denmark as the two countries' elite
men's shuttlers will match up with each other in a friendly
competition next week, the organizers said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China will dispatch their Thomas Cup men's singles trio, Sun
Jun, Dong Jiong and Luo Yigang, vying against an equally
formidable line-up from Denmark, including Peter
Gade-Christensen, Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and Kenneth Jonassen,
the Chinese Badminton Association (CBA) said.
</P>
<P>
The friendly is slated for November 22 in the Beijing College
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
China lost a derby 3-2 in the preliminary round the Thomas Cup
in Hong Kong, China last May when world championship runner-up
Sun fell to world top player Gade-Christensen and Olympic silver
medalist Dong was defeated by Jonassen. Luo chalked up the only
singles victory for China in three rubbers.
</P>
<P>
Both teams lost their semi-finals as China were beaten by
Indonesia while Denmark defeated by Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The shuttlers, five of whom are among the top eight in the
world rankings except the 13th-ranked Jonassen, will compete for
a prize check totaled about 220,000 RMB (26,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the match-ups may be different from the Thomas
Cup tournament as a draw will decide which Chinese will meet
which Dane at the opening ceremony next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CBA secretary-general Liu Huacong said they will host more
such high-leveled friendly if the clash proves a success.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to hold women's competition between China and
Indonesia in the future," Liu added.
</P>
<P>
With China and Indonesia dropping from their peak in earlier
1990s, Denmark have been bursting onto the world stage in major

<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines generated a net income of 4 billion pesos (100 million
U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, 2.9 billion pesos

revenues of the bank totaled 17.1 billion pesos (420 million

of the total revenues.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Admits Drafting of Constitution Very Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
admitted that the pace of drafting the new constitution is very
slow, but said it dares not to impose a deadline, according to an
official information document issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Lieutenant-Colonel Hla Min, general
staff officer of the Bureau of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar
Defense Ministry, in an interview with a reporter of the Asian
Wall Street Journal recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that Myanmar is working on the most sensitive and
serious chapter, which is the sharing of power between the central
government and the states and divisions. Myanmar began the
National Convention process in January 1993 to draft a new state
constitution.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of when another parliamentary election will be
held, Hla Min quoted Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, as saying that "once
we resolve power-sharing, it will take about three years to finish
elections and everything," indicating that the last 1990
multi-party general election becomes invalid.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether former Indonesian president Soeharto's downfall
in May alters Myanmar's interest in an Indonesia political model,
he denied that Myanmar is carbon-copying the Indonesian
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five percent of the seats in the parliament will be
given to representatives appointed by the commander-in-chief of
the defense services," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "If the military is not involved in national
affairs, there is no guarantee that we will not have to go back to
square one, fighting all the ethnic groups again."
</P>
<P>
The sessions of the National Convention to lay down fundamental
principles for drawing up a new state constitution have been in
recess since March 1996 after working out detailed principles for
six chapters out of the 15 to be included in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The six chapters cover the Fundamental Principles, Structure of
the State, Head of State, the Legislation, the Executive and the
Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The holding of the convention is a follow-up of the 1990
multi-party general election participated in by 93 political
parties, in which the opposition National League for Democracy won
396 parliamentary seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
The 1990 general election, sponsored by the Myanmar State Law
and Order Restoration Council, now the State Peace and Development
Council, was regarded by Myanmar and the world as a free and fair
one.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Attracts Billions in Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Overseas investment has emerged as an inseparable part of
Shanghai's economic and social life," according to an official
of the municipal investment work committee.
</P>
<P>
A mere 17 overseas-funded businesses became operational in
the five-year period following the founding of a Swiss elevator
company, Schindler, the first Sino-foreign joint venture
established in 1980. He added that total investments for the
period stood at 17 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, an average 2,700 overseas-funded firms have opened in
Shanghai every year since 1992. The city's 18,500 overseas-funded
businesses involved total direct investments of 23.09 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has used 13.9 billion U.S. dollars from
international financial institutions, foreign governments and
foreign commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that overseas funding accounted
for 16.2 percent of Shanghai's total investments in fixed assets
during the 1985-1989 period, with the figure rising to 29.7
percent between 1990-1994 and still further to 31.5 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's six pillar industries -- motor vehicle
manufacturing, telecommunications, power generating equipment,
petrochemicals and refined chemicals, iron and steel, and
household electric appliances -- have used overseas funds to
achieve rapid expansion and upgrades. Overseas funding has
contributed directly to 40 percent of the output for related
industries, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that overseas capital has also helped to create a boom
in three new and hi-tech industries -- integrated circuits and
computers, modern biology and medicine, and new materials -- which
accounted for 14.8 percent of Shanghai's industrial output value
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Shanghai's industrial groups at the municipal
level have used overseas capital. Close to a third of the city's
587 new and hi-tech businesses involve overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has worked diligently to attract investments from
multinational corporations, said the official, adding that 57 of
the world's largest 100 transnational industrial corporations
have invested over 9.56 billion U.S. dollars in 151 projects.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises accounted for 37.5 percent of
Shanghai's total industrial outout for 1997, as well as 42 percent
of local tax revenues and foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The city's 11,000-odd overseas-funded enterprises employed
over 940,000 local residents by the end of last year, a dramatic
six-fold rise on the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 21.6 percent of the 34.19 billion
U.S. dollars in contracted overseas investment received over the
past 20 years came from Europe and the United States, with 68.7
percent generated in Asia, and the remainder from other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Crack Down on Illegal Fuel Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
ready to crack down on illegal fuel dealers who have been held
responsible for the lingering fuel scarcity in the oil-producing
country.
</P>
<P>
Rising from a meeting in Abuja Thursday, the country's
highest-ruling body, the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC),
decided that government's efforts should have resulted in
improved fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
"Very soon, government will place measures that will improve
the fuel supply and those people who have made it their duty to
sabotage government's efforts in this direction will have
themselves to blame," Major-General Idris Garba was quoted by
local media as saying after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a major oil producer with a daily crude output of
over two million barrels, has been witnessing acute fuel
shortages in the last two years, due to ailing refineries.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has resorted to massive importation to
solve the problem, the efforts were hampered by massive hoarding
and black market sales for the benefits of a few.
</P>
<P>
A liter of petrol is officially sold for 11 Naira (about 0.13
U.S. Dollars), but at the black market, it is sold for 40 Naira
(0.47 dollars) or even more.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Accelerated Fourth Quarter Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic
products (GDP) is expected to grow by close to nine percent in the
fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nine percent growth will greatly improved possibilities for
achieving the annual growth target of eight percent, according to
a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Hu Shaowei, a senior economist with the State Information
Center said that economic performance in the third quarter
indicated that investments in fixed assets were a major factor
promoting economic development. Related investments in the fourth
quarter are expected to surge by as much as 24 percent due to
increased government investments in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Adequate funding serves as the main guarantee for the high
growth in infrastructure investments, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
The central government decision to issue state treasury bonds
valued at 100 billion yuan (12.058 billion US dollars) combined
with bank loans of an additional 100 billion yuan and relatively
relaxed financial policies have all been conducive to expanding
capital construction.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish real estate investments have benefited from the the
government decision to abandon the state welfare housing
distribution system, with projections calling for a 21 percent
increase in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Both urban and rural incomes, which are expected to grow as a
result of the favorable economic environment, will further
stimulate consumption, said Hu. The fact that the September
consumer confidence index released by the China Economic Climate
Monitoring Center which climbed by 1.8 point to 91.2 points proved
Hu's point. Anticipated future price hikes will also promote
short-term consumption.
</P>
<P>
Various indices indicate that the retail volume for consumer
goods will rise by 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum of industrial production will be maintained
and is expected to grow by 11 percent in the fourth quarter, up
three percentage points on the previous quarter. Accelerated
growth is mainly the result of increased investments in
infrastructure investment and rising demand for farm materials and
daily necessities triggered by reconstruction following heavy summer
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter will also witness increased domestic demand,
a slowdown in price declines and improved enterprise efficiency,
said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He warned that lingering problems such as inadequate reform,
weak product competitiveness, the lack of entrepreneurs and the
aftermath of the Asian financial crisis will remain.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Publishes 1995 Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers in Nigeria
Friday published the country's 1995 draft constitution, two days
after the government inaugurated a committee to co-ordinate a
national debate on the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution was worked out by the Constitutional
Conference from June 1994 to June 1995 summoned by the country's
late leader General Sani Abacha but was never published.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his succession to Abacha in June 1998, General
Abudulsalam Abubakar has promised to publish the draft
constitution for national debate before it is promulgated.
</P>
<P>
As elections under Abubakar's new transition to civil rule
program approach, there have been increasing calls for the
publication of the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
It is under such a situation that Abubakar inaugurated a
25-member Constitution Debate Committee Wednesday to collate
Nigerians' input into the 1995 draft constitution before its
promulgation.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar asked the committee headed by Justice Niki Tobi to
submit its report by the end of this year so that a clean draft
constitution would be there before governor's election in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
The government suggested 11 major issues for debate, on top of
which is the rotational presidency, according to which the
presidency is to be rotated among the country's six geo-political
zones.
</P>
<P>
This provision is designed to break the monopoly of political
power by the Northern part of the country since its independence
in 1960, but some people worried that it might produce more
problems and is also against principles of true democracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) concluded their two-day
meeting here Friday without reaching a consensus on a final
package for APEC member economies.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Razak Ramly, chairman of the senior officials meeting,
told reporters after the meeting that the senior officials failed
to reach a consensus on a "credible" EVSL (Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization) package.
</P>
<P>
Razak, who expressed optimism over what he termed a credible
package for EVSL at a press conference Thursday after the
first-day meeting, Friday described the senior officials meeting
as a "very difficult meeting".
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have to get the ministers to decide." The 10th
APEC ministerial meeting will be held here from Saturday to
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was generally hoped that a consensus on the EVSL package
could be achieved at the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
The EVSL package covers all the nine sectors -- chemicals,
environmental goods and services, energy, fish and fish products,
forest products, gems and jewelry, medical equipment and
instruments, toys and telecommunications mutual recognition
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The difference which existed was on the flexibility on
end-dates and end-rates for some economies for some sectors under
the EVSL.
</P>
<P>
The APEC senior officials' meeting and the 10th ministerial
meeting are in preparation for the informal meeting of APEC
leaders on November 17-18.

<HEADLINE> SADC Ministers Meet Over Import, Export Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of
South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia, and the high
commissioner of Swaziland, met in Pretoria Thursday, in a bid to
implement value added tax (VAT) on import and export between
South Africa and its four neighbors.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association reported Friday that a joint
statement was issued Thursday night, saying that a VAT export
incentive scheme would be implemented on November 16.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers have further agreed to also keep in close
contact to further enhance cross-border trade with a view to more
effective systems being introduced at the border posts and joint
efforts to reduce import and export fraud," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Measures relating to imports, however, would only become
effective from January 4, next year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana expressed reservations about the implementation of
the export and import measures and proposed an acquittal voucher
system to meet South Africa's requirements.
</P>
<P>
Further discussions on this proposal would take place between
South Africa and Botswana, the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday accused
India of wrecking the process of peace and rapprochement in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Foreign Ministry said the Pakistani
government noted with regret about the statement by Indian Home
Minister L. K. Advani alleging that Pakistan was a "terrorist
state".
</P>
<P>
The statement made by Advani was contrary to the understanding
reached between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India in their
recent meeting in New York, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said Pakistan will make every effort to ensure that the
course of its bilateral dialogue with India is not affected by
such outbursts.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's positive position in opposing terrorism is well
recognized in the international community, said the press release.
Pakistan condemns all types of terrorist activities whether
perpetrated by individuals, organizations, groups or states, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has, therefore, always favored concerted action at the
regional, international and bilateral levels to prevent terrorism
in all its forms and manifestations, it added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Be Linked with Global Cellular Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will be linked next
year with the global tele-communication network by using the
Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) communications technology, The
Guardian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the local company of Motophone Limited
would offer commercial mobile cellular service with a license
from the Nigerian Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
Under a tripartite agreement signed recently, Ericsson of
Sweden will act as technical partner and equipment supplier while
the Iridium Satellite Communcations Services of the United
States will provide the satellite links for Motophone.
</P>
<P>
By the agreement, the paper said, a turn key equipment is
being installed in Victoria Island, Lagos, by Ericsson
technicians.
</P>
<P>
When fully activated, subscribers in Nigeria could use the
mobile phones anywhere within Nigeria and 72 other countries.
</P>
<P>
The new technology will bridge virtually all communication
gaps between the mobile subscribers and their contacts in 72
countries as the existing mobile cellular systems can only do
local calls, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Industry operators here considered the deal as a breakthrough
for the deregulation of the tele-communication sector in the west
African country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Beefs Up Regional Peace Efforts in Sudan, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to seek
more active regional efforts which it believes are key to ending
prolonged conflicts in Sudan and Somalia, a top-level U.N.
official said in the Kenyan capital Friday.
</P>
<P>
The role of the Inter-Governmental Authority of Development
(IGAD) should be firmly strengthened in mediating peace in two of
its seven member states -- Sudan and Somalia -- and the U.N. will
offer help for that, said the official, asking to be anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD, also grouping Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Uganda and
Eritrea, made a major breakthrough in July, 1997, by re-starting
face-to-face Sudan peace talks which had been at a three-year
standstill since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is trying to enforce and coordinate neutral and
impartial regional peace-making mechanism like IGAD but
definitely has no intention to take over, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he met this week with Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, Sudan Ambassador to Kenya and various Somali
factions representatives and is to go to Addis Ababa and Khartoum
next week for more closed-door consultations.
</P>
<P>
"Peace proposals should go out through all these
negotiations," he said, adding that he reached with Moi "wide
agreement on the prospects of the peace talks" over Sudanese and
Somali conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, "IGAD efforts (to end Sudanese
war) have been hampered" with the third round peace talks in
auspices of IGAD ending in no agreement in Addis Ababa in August
this year.
</P>
<P>
All the warring parties agree to the principle of
self-determination in the south but disagree to what the word
exactly means, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya chaired the first two rounds of resumed Sudan peace
talks last year and the fourth round of Sudan peace talks was
expected to open in Nairobi in February next year, a source with
the Foreign Ministry told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war and related famines have claimed more than
1.3 million lives since 1983 when the Sudan People's Liberation
Army rose to fight against Moslem-led Khartoum for a secular
state and more autonomy in animist and Christian-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has not been actively involved in Somalia,
which has had no government since 1991, after the humiliating
withdrawal of a peacekeeping force in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD was set up in 1986 for enhancing cooperation on
anti-drought and economic development in east and Horn of Africa.
Regional political affairs have been on its agenda since 1990s.

BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The international community
should reinforce its diplomatic effort for a peaceful resolution
to the current weapons inspection confrontation in Iraq and
support the U.N. Secretary-General to play his active role,
according to Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao.

Zhu made the remark here today when asked to comment on the

TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in Tokyo
Friday on arbitrage-related buying and speculation that the Japanese
government may consider suspending the consumption tax in a further
bid to stimulate spending.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 193.15 points, or 1.37
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 14,268.21.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, surged 10.59 points or 0.98 percent to 1,093.52.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 455 million
shares from Thursday's 404.79 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The main engine for Friday's advance appeared to be hopes that
Japan's political leaders may suspend the 5 percent consumption tax at
least until 2000 in order to revive spending, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Consumption-related stocks gained while other sectors benefited
from the market's optimism.
</P>

The Japanese government has already signaled its hopes to boost
consumer spending. Details unveiled Thursday of a new stimulus
package, the second of its kind this year, include distribution of 700
billion yen (about 5.7 billion dollars) worth of merchandise coupons
to low-income elderly and children.

<HEADLINE> Australian Shares Falter Further as Leaders Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
drifted further Friday after a sharp dip in key stocks,
particularly News Corp., outweighed a recovery in the gold and
oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 27.0 lower at 2,681.3 points
with industrial stocks among the biggest losers while losses in
the resource sector were less marked.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the five percent fall in the News Corp. shares
accounted for much of the 58.8 point fall in the all industrials
index to 4,685.4.
</P>
<P>
News Corp.'s ordinary shares shed 55 cents and its non-voting
stock dropped 65 cents, which fell after it revealed disappointing
first quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The quarterly profit was significantly less than what the
market had thought and that's what's dragged News Corp. back,"
Macquarie Nevitts client adviser Rick Terpstra said.
</P>
<P>
One of the most dramatic falls of the day was baker Goodman
Fielder which topped the day's trading volume as it retreated
close to 15 percent after revealing an unexpectedly flat profit
outlook.
</P>
<P>
Goodman Fielder ended 31 cents lower on a turnover of 28
million shares.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 375.1 million shares traded worth 1.035
billion Australian dollars (657.22 million U.S. dollars), with 522
rising stocks, 532 falling and 352 steady.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank suffered the most in the banking
sector, down 35.5 cents, while the other majors also fell.
</P>
<P>
ANZ lost nine cents, Westpac gave up eight and Commonwealth
shed seven.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 1.0 point higher at 1,069.5
points, despite a 48.9 cents fall in the second largest miner on
the exchange, Rio Tinto, to 19.969 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fellow diversifieds BHP, down 0.3 cents, and WMC, up 15.4, were
better performed. Oil and gas major Woodside moved two cents
higher.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished firmer Friday, boosted by a burgeoning metals market and
a recovering Japanese currency.
</P>

At the close of the session, the Australian dollar was at 63.78
U.S. cents from 63.04, after trading between 63.40 and 63.82.

</P>

"Sentiment is very bullish at the moment," he added.
</P>

overnight in London 9.00 U.S. dollars higher at 1,579.50 a ton.

Domestically, Australian gold stocks rallied on the back of the

There was consensus in the market that the local currency would
push through the 64.00 U.S, cents level at some stage in the next
few days, with a possible look-in at 68.00 some time next week.

PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- By expelling the U.N. mission in charge of
disarmament, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has closed the door of
diplomacy and lost the support from Arab countries. While the United
States is preparing to bomb Iraq, the United Nations, European
countries and eight Arab countries -- Egypt, Syria and eight member
countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- have held Saddam
Hussein responsible for all the consequences of a U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While France was increasing its rescue personnels and aid to
the Central American states devastated by hurricane Mitch, President
Jacques Chirac pleaded on Thursday in Mexico for a European-American
solidarity in relieving the pains of the victims of the disaster. Up
to 1,400 French rescuers will be working in Central America by
Sunday while the French military are sending planes and warships to
provide food and other emergency materials.
</P>
<P>
-- The military preparations by the United States are now
enough for President Bill Clinton to order strikes against
Iraq. The White House has affirmed that any negotiations with Iraq
is ruled out. The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan will
not go to Baghdad despite a call by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz on him to "solve the crisis".

<P>
BEIRUT, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese boy was wounded in
an Israeli missile attack in south Lebanon Friday, the Orient
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old boy was injured when Israeli troops fired a
guided missile onto the area between Arab Salim and Jarjoua
villages on the edge of the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The targeted area is believed to be a hideout for guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is
fighting against Israeli occupying forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The fresh attack raised to 57 the number of the Lebanese
civilians wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Other 19 civilians were killed over the same period.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fewer than 10 people in the world possess the skill required to
create Tourbillon watches which offer the highest standards of
workmanship. Kiu is the only Asian watchmaker who has created
Tourbillion watches which were invented some 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the period between 1991 and 1992, Kiu created a sensation at
many European watch exhibitions in 1991 and 1992 by showing three
highly complicated, entirely mechanical watch movements that were
considered a closely guarded secret held by only a few of Europe's
master watchmakers. Kiu has since crafted 13 Tourbillon watches
and introduced improvement with each succeeding piece.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Europe quietly admit that Kiu's devices outclass
comparable products manufactured by Swiss companies in terms of
precision.
</P>
<P>
Kiu became a member of the Academic Horlogere des Createurs
Independents (AHCI) in 1992, as well as a member of the American
Antique Timepiece Collectors Association.
</P>
<P>
Kiu, an authority in watchmaking, is proud of his quite
understandably proud of his achievements. "I've brought honor to
the Chinese nation and will continue to introduce new designs in
future." according to the master watchmaker.
</P>
<P>
Kiu's Mystery Tourbillon won patent approval from the State
Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China
last July, and his is determined to obtain at least 12 patents.
</P>
<P>
He expressed willingness to cooperate and enable counterparts
throughout China to mass produce his watches.

LOS ANGELES, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp., a new
star among top U.S. computer makers, announced Thursday its
strategy to sell computers through Internet continues to pay off
as its third-quarter profits leaped 55 percent.

The Texas-based company said it earned 384 million U.S. dollars

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Diplomatic Solution for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
said late Thursday evening that diplomacy, rather than use of
military force, will be effective in settling the
Iraqi-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency the Petra quoted Hassan as
telling reporters that the Iraqis yearn for diplomatic means to
settle the crisis, adding that diplomacy will be effective as can
be seen from the outcome of a similar crisis in last February.
</P>
<P>
In last February, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan visited
Baghdad and reached a relevant agreement with the Iraqi
authorities, averting a military strike by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy is necessary also because the region as well as the
international community can not afford the costs of military
confrontations, said Hassan.
</P>
<P>
However, the crown prince expressed his sorrow while
mentioning that "there is a complete absence of effective
international diplomacy" aimed at settling the current crisis, and
the United States has repeatedly threatened to use military
force on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The current situation is very grave and it is urgent for the
concerned parties to make effective diplomacy to defuse the
tension, he added.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, Iraq announced to halt all forms of cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq until
the Security Council moves toward lifting the U.N. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
The embargo can not be lifted unless the UNSCOM verifies that
Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Power Generating Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to renovate power
generating facilities in order to control pollution, enhance
economic efficiency and guarantee the safe operations of power
grids.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the China State Power Corporation (CSPC)
said the nation should complete technological renovations on
7.5-8.0 million kw low and medium pressure condenser tube
generating units which have been in operation for at least 25
years.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program is to improve the capacity of units to
fulfill peak hour demand, strengthen security, reduce energy
consumption and improve environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the average coal use for power
plants nationwide must be reduced by 34 grams for producing one
kwh of power, and the power consumption of grid lines, by 7.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 95 percent of the voltage in major
cities across the nation will be requited to meet the standard,
and the reliability rate of the power supply must hit at least
99.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted the nation's power grids should increase coordination
of power supplies in order to ensure the capacities of the
country's five major regional and 15 provincial power companies
to reach advanced international levels for the transfer and control
of power supplies.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Urged to Act on Response to Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 13 (Xinhua) -- APEC (Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation) leaders have been urged to act urgently on a
regional response to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a statement of Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) to APEC. PECC is the only
non-governmental, official observer organization of APEC.
</P>
<P>
PECC Chairman Roberto Romulo said at a press conference here
Friday that only APEC leaders have the capacity to act now and to
act boldly on key priority areas.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders will have their sixth informal meeting in Malaysia
on November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
Roberto said APEC leaders must address the difficulties in
obtaining financing needed to fund the recovery due to the high
risks now associated with the crisis-affected economies, their
banks and corporations.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that APEC leaders be resolute at this time
about their commitments, which form the basis of the region's
shared prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposals for immediate concerted action, including
support for the development and effective implementation of social
safety net programs in crisis-affected economies, a joint
undertaking of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to arrest
severe depression, a guarantee scheme for trade financing, a bold
and comprehensive economic and technical cooperation program and
energizing the liberalization agenda. The liberalization agenda,
if properly implemented, would give a much-needed boost to the
individual efforts of APEC economies to restore economic growth
and social stability.
</P>
<P>
These proposals are unlikely to be effective unless they are
developed and implemented in a coherent framework and unless they
embody agreed upon competition principles to ensure the working of
fair and efficient markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We urge APEC leaders to recognize the value of a process of
peer review of macroeconomic performance and, in particular, the
financial sectors of APEC economies," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Business Leaders Wary of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan business leaders have
said they were apprehensive about the European Union (EU)'s
planned single currency, the Euro, because they knew too little
about how it would affect them.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Awuondo, the executive director of the Commercial Bank
of Africa, said manufacturers' basic fear has been that "if they
are importing raw material there will be heavy fluctuation" in
currency values.
</P>
<P>
"We are telling them that it will be easier for them dealing
in the Euro because they will have a common base (for
transactions)," he was quoted by Wednesday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan exporters, most of whom dealt in Dollars, were worried
about how a new currency of payment and settlement might affect
them.
</P>
<P>
Experts urge Kenyan businesses with European links to get
ready for the advent of the Euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Freidrich Verspohl, a leading specialist on the Euro, said the
introduction of the new continental currency was important to
Kenya as Europe remains the country's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Most tourists also come from Europe, apart from the EU's being
a major source of donor funds.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lack of knowledge (in Africa) and that has a
psychological effect on business. People feel insecure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Verspohl told local business community to immediately start
the process of having their book-keeping systems ready to process
Euro and other currencies, enquire when trading partners plan to
change to the Euro and also familiarize their staff with the new
Euro Travelers Checks.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Kenya's largest foreign currency earner.

<HEADLINE> Ashanti's Gold Output Record High in Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ashanti Goldfields Company
(AGC), one of the world's leading mining companies, said its gold
production for the third quarter hit a record of 420,162 ounces,
according to Ghana News Agency (GNA).
</P>
<P>
This feat represents a 12 percent increase over the preceding
quarter and a 45 percent increase from the third quarter of 1997,
Kwamena Anaman, AGC corporate affairs manager, said in Accra,
capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He said the money that AGC puts in its operation was also
reduced to 209 Dollars an ounce, which was achieved through an
enhanced waste management strategy, sustained productivity
improvements at Obuasi, the principle mine, and the successful
development of new cost efficient projects at Bibiani and
Sanguiri mines.
</P>
<P>
AGC also reduced its labor strength by 800 -- about 10 percent
of the total work force through a special voluntary retirement
package and another 10 percent cut in cost to the company's
suppliers, said Anaman.
</P>
<P>
"These and other measures have put us in a good position to
achieve our group target of 1.5 million ounces of gold by the end
of the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anaman said Ashanti's operating cost for the year is likely to
close at 222 Dollars per ounce, but that will reflect a recently
announced increase in the industrial power tariff which came into
effect in September.
</P>
<P>
"The new power tariff adds 15 Dollars to our cash cost and
that is why we are still talking to the power producers to take a
second look at the increase," Anaman noted.
</P>
<P>
Ashanti's earnings for the quarter was also up to 20.3 million
Dollars, about 30 percent higher than the previous year's 15
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Our hedging portfolio also increased to 7.6 million ounces at
an average price of 391 per ounce, providing substantial
protection for the group cash flows," Anaman said.
</P>
<P>
Anaman added that Obuasi mine continues to be the power drive
of Ashanti's "growth strategy" producing 230,709 ounces at a cash
cost of 230 Dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
He said steady improvements in underground tonnage and grade
and tight controls on spending have contributed to the reductions
in cash cost.
</P>
<P>
"These were 11 Dollars per ounce lower than in the second
quarter and 40 Dollars lower than the third quarter of 1997,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ashanti's operations in a dozen of other African countries,
Anaman said, will continue to push the company to perform at all
times.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the second gold producer in Africa next just to South
Africa and the AGC is the most important gold producer in the
west African country.

<HEADLINE> Somali Bandit Killed in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The police have shot
dead a Somali bandit for his involvement in killing nine people
in north Tanzania's Arusha Region.
</P>
<P>
The killed gangster was identified as Yusuf Mohamed and had
come from Kajiado District of Kenya, Tanzanian newspapers Tuesday
quoted a statement from the police headquarters in Dar es Salaam
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eight Somali bandits, armed with sub-machine guns and
light-machine guns, raided Malambo village in Arusha on Saturday
evening and killed nine men of Maasai tribe.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, the police mounted an operation to
track down the bandits and exchanged fires with them at Makorongo
area.
</P>
<P>
During the clash, Mohamed was killed but other bandits managed
to escape. The police are still searching for them.
</P>
<P>
The police have recovered from the bandits two sub-machine
guns (SMGs), three magazines, 74 rounds of ammunition for SMGs,
one bullet belt with 47 rounds of ammunition for light
sub-machine guns, one pair of binoculars and a membership card of
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Tanzanian ruling party, according to
the statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arusha Regional Commissioner Daniel ole Njoolay said the
Somalis are suspected to be using CCM cards to infiltrate
villages and then stole properties.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bandits have come to raid the area possibly
on a revenge mission.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, a group of Somali gangsters killed a
district police commander in Arusha. Following the incident, the
police launched a special operation against banditry in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The bandits often crossed the Kenya-Tanzanian border into the
region and assaulted local villagers, stealing cattle and other
properties.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay has appealed to the government to work out a joint
strategy against the bandits with the Kenyan side.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Exhibtion Features Masterpiece Watches (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign visitors
to the China International Watch, Clock and Jewelery Fair at
the Beijing Exhibition Center paid close attention to the
exquisite workmanship of three handcrafted wrist-watches.
</P>
<P>
The Tourbillon watches were designed and crafted by Kiu
Tay-yu, an antique watch specialist from Hong Kong. Kiu opened a
new chapter in the watchmaking history by creating the first
tourbillon watches in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tourbillon watches feature a kind of escape speed-controlling
wheel typical of mechanical watches. The wheels ensure accuracy by
defying the force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
Kiu created the Model 13 watch to mark the 910th anniversary of
the first Chinese timepiece, "the water-driven clock", crafted
during the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1121).
</P>
<P>
The watch, which is 33 mm in diameter and weighs 60 grams,
features 18K platinum inner works and 18K yellow gold dial plate
and case. Kiu engraved 47 English letters on the case, or
substantially more letters than found on the previous 12 models.
</P>
<P>
The first Tourbillon watch was reportedly crafted in Europe by
Abraham Louis Breguet, a noted swiss clockmaker in the early
1930s. Somewhat later, a German clockmaker improved the watch by
removing the fixed stands. Kiu not only excluded fixed stands, but
also reduced the weight of the wheels by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourbillon watches are known worldwide as the "King of Watches"
because of their accuracy, elegance and perfect craftsmanship. The
present market price for a Tourbillon watch ranges between
20,000-300,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy's Blame on Angolan Govt Labeled as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The criticism by the United
Nations Special Envoy Isso Diallo that the Angolan government has
violate the Lusaka Peace Protocol is "groundless", said a senior
Angolan official.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Nzao Puna, Deputy Minister of Territory Administration,
who is touring the central part of the country, made the remark
in response to a speech by Diallo.
</P>
<P>
The UN official said in a speech in South Africa Tuesday that
the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) has violated the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement, and so has
the government.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, who is on his southern African tour, said in his
speech after meeting South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad, that "Jonas Savimbi (UNITA Chairman) violated the peace
agreement in the day time, while the (Angolan) government did so
at night."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan official said that the whole international
community see that UNITA is violating the peace deal by refusing
to disarm its army, denying the restoration of government
institutions in areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
He said what Diallo said in South Africa should have been said
in Angola, where he can get proper response.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government decided to cut off all its dealings
with UNITA early September after the latter refused to implement
the Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The government declared to recognize the "UNITA Renovation
Committee", a UNITA break-away organization formed in early
September, as the only legal dialogist in future peace talks,
thus bringing the peace process in the country into a dilemma.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's CPP, FUNCINPEC Agree on Power-sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the ruling
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and opposition FUNCINPEC party have
reached agreement on many important issues, paving the way for the
formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk said in a communique issued by him Friday
after the summit meeting that most important issues have been
resolved between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The king said he believed Cambodia will have a bright future
from now on. The country will be getting prosperous and developed
and the people will have a peace and happy life, he added.
</P>
<P>
After nearly five hours of talks, the two major political
parties have made great progress on power-sharing in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The two parties decided at the meeting to amend the
Constitution to establish a senate in the Assembly. Chea Sim, CPP
president, will be elected as president of the senate, and at the
same time, Prince Ranariddh, FUNCINPEC president, will take up the
post of president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
They also reached unanimity on Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
becoming the prime minister of the new government and on voting
for Ranariddh as the president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The two parties' principal leaders, including CPP President
Chea Sim and Vice President Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC President
Ranariddh, were all present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and FUNCINPEC Thursday hurriedly convened a summit
meeting under the chair of the king, aimed at hammering out a
power-sharing deal.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's meeting, the CPP agreed to amnesty the five
persons demanded by FUNCINPEC, such as Nhiek Bun Chhay and Serey
Kosal. In return, FUNCINPEC agreed in principle to form a
coalition government with the CPP.
</P>
<P>
The two parties held the summit just before the King's deadline
of Saturday for his departure for medical treatment in Beijing of
China.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh agreed to return and join the summit after he got
fresh security guarantees from Hun Sen that parliamentary immunity
of opposition MPs would be respected.
</P>
<P>
Absent at the talks were representatives of the Sam Rainsy
Party, which had taken part in previous talks.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have already held one summit and three rounds
of working group meetings but failed to make significant progress
due to the great differences on the power-sharing in the National
Assembly and the government.

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Expected in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South African military
authorities have planned to shed 14,000 staff members and shut
down 13 of 21 infantry battalions by 2001, the daily Business Day
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Army chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Ramano was quoted as
saying that the retrenchment process will begin after 1999
general elections due to be held in May.
</P>
<P>
The army's plan is part of a broader defense force project to
drop its staff complement from 90,000 to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
According to senior staff officer Johan Preller, 1,100 defense
force members are expected to opt for voluntary severance
packages by April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Natural attrition would result in the departure of another
5,200 by that time. Personnel at army headquarters in the
administrative capital of Pretoria would be reduced from 1,800 to
214, Preller said.
</P>
<P>
Kobus Smit, another senior officer responsible for military
transformation, said that the nine territorial commands of the
army should be replaced by five regional task force headquarters
by March 2001. Thirteen of the existing 21 infantry units would
be closed down.
</P>
<P>
These changes and staff cuts would bring about an overall
saving of 35 percent which was required to adhere to the
guidelines of the defense review.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Fined for Playing Coup Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A street vendor in the north
of Zambia was fined 10,000 Kwacha (about five U.S. Dollars) or
one month simple imprisonment for loudly playing an audio tape of
a failed coup announcement.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Phillip Banda slapped the sentence on Mike Malama,
25, for commemorating last year's coup attempt by loudly playing
the tape at the taxi rank in Mufulira on October 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
He was found by two policemen playing the tape. At first the
officers and many other people at the tax rank were alarmed at
the coup announcement.
</P>
<P>
But when the officers drew nearer to get the message properly
on whether there had been another coup, they found that it was
only a tape being played by the accused.
</P>
<P>
The officers confiscated the tape and captured the
tape-player.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutor Boniface Sikokwa said the act of the accused
person in a public place was quite alarming to the people who
were not aware that the message from the radio was an old one.
</P>
<P>
On October 28 last year Captain Steven Lungu, who identified
himself as "Captain Solo", announced on state radio that they had
seized power and order president Frederick Chiluba to surrender
but the coup was crushed a few hours later by troops royal to the
government.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
published the long-awaited Medical Laboratory Technician and
Technologist Bill that will govern their operations.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by the Cabinet, is set to be tabled in the
parliament for enactment, according to Minister of Health Jackson
Kalweo, the Eastern African Standard daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government had shown much concern about
increased malpractices with the profession due to lack of
adequate legislation regulating the training, registration and
operations of members.
</P>
<P>
The Bill will ensure the appropriate training be given to
those in the respect and they will be required to comply with
specific professional ethics and norms, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the legislation will eliminate the misconduct
that exposes the ordinary people to serious health risks at the
hands of unscrupulous professionals.
</P>
<P>
Kalweo said his ministry has set up an inspectorate unit
operating throughout the country to monitor related standards.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Says Snowstorms May Relate to Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist says that
that earthquakes may help predict snowstorms in certain parts of
the earth.
</P>
<P>
Qin Baoyan, of the China Seismology Bureau's Lanzhou Institute
of Seismological Research, tells that earthquakes and snowstorms
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the past several decades indicate
heavy snowstorms always occur soon after a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Qin told the annual meeting of the China Geophysical Society
recently that, between 1955 and 1993, the area had 10 quakes
measuring above 6.5 on the Richter Scale and nine were followed by
heavy snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
One earthquake measuring 6.1 hit the Golog area in Qinghai
Province on December 18, 1995, and a snowstorm hit the southern
part of Qinghai a month later.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 7.1 hit the Mani area of Tibet on
November 8, 1997 and the region was then hit by a heavy snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
Qin explains that the crust movement caused by an earthquake
could lead to the release of moist subterranean gas, which may
result in a low pressure area.
</P>
<P>
The low pressure usually brings in warm and moist currents from
the Bay of Bengal and cold air currents from the north. The
currents would then meet and form a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
He suggests that preparations for a possible snowstorm be made
after each strong earthquake in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area.

<HEADLINE> ROK President Points to Successful China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Kim Dae-jung, president of the
Republic of Korea (ROK), told reporters attending today's press
conference that expected results have been achieved during his
current China visit.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed to "extensive and beneficial" talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin concerning regional and international
issues. He also said a decision reached to establish a bilateral
cooperative partnership geared to the 21st century outlines
specific plans to develop ROK-China relations in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal of his visit is expanding economic
relations developed over the years into comprehensive political,
economic and cultural relations, as well as to promote exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Kim noted that China, home to the world's largest population
and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
enjoys a rapidly growing economy and will constantly elevate its
status in the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said the ROK and China have every reason to join in a
concerted effort to safeguard peace and stability in northeast
Asia, including the Korea Peninsula, and overcome the effects of
the current Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope for more opportunities to exchange views with
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that frequent high-level exchanges between the ROK,
China, Japan and Russia have improved mutual understanding, and
have helped to maintain regional peace and lessen the impact of
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australia to Upgrade Frigates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia's soon-to-be
privatized government defense company ADI has been selected as the
preferred tenderer for an upgrade, worth almost 1 billion
Australian dollars (630 million U.S. dollars), of its navy's fleet
of Adelaide-class guided missile frigates.
</P>
<P>
Australia's newly-appointed Defense Minister John Moore said
ADI, formerly Australian Defense Industries, was selected ahead of
another Australian government defense company Tenix Defense
Systems as preferred tenderer to upgrade the six frigates.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade involves improvements to the capability of the
frigates to defend themselves, particularly against modern
anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
Moore said better defenses against torpedoes and mines would
also be included, along with improvements to the overall
reliability of the frigates and living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The frigates were all commissioned between 1980 and 1993, with
four built in the United States and two in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Moore said ADI had been chosen as the preferred tenderer after
an exhaustive selection process as it provided best value for
money.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to see that Australian industry involvement
in this project will exceed 60 percent of the contract value,"
Moore said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"A substantial amount of the work to be undertaken by
Australian industry will include high technology work associated
with the improved combat systems for the ships, and local
manufacture of a combat system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The contract is expected to be signed in March next year with
the upgrade to be finished by 2005.
</P>
<P>
ADI said it had now won the navy's two biggest projects in the
past four years, having been awarded the 1 billion Australian
dollar Huon- class minehunter ship project in 1994.
</P>
<P>
ADI Managing Director Ken Harris said the company had
reinvented itself to become a major player in the systems
development and integration business.
</P>
<P>
"It has been the restructuring of ADI since 1989 with a new
focus on the electronic systems and software markets rather than
the traditional munitions and heavy engineering businesses that
has enabled us to become Australia's leading defense company," he
said.
</P>
<P>
ADI put in its proposal along with its teaming partners, U.S.
companies Lockheed Martin and Gibbs and Cox.
</P>
<P>
The company said it would form its logistics and management
team once the contract is signed with physical work on the
frigates to start in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Meat Markets Stable in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The price of meat in China has
been basically stable, with little fluctuation in mutton and beef,
and pork remaining high since October, according to China Business
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Beef prices fluctuated at the beginning of the year, but have
been fairly stable since March. The price of mutton has also been
stable since March.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts do however doubt that beef and mutton prices
can remain strong, since output is expected to grow by 10 percent,
higher than market demand. Moreover, increased imports resulting
from reduced tariff are also expected to drag the price lower.
</P>
<P>
Pork prices have remained high after four consecutive months of
increases, a result of large-scale slaughter of female pigs in
many areas in the first half of the year following sharp price
falls and a drop in production because of this summer's flooding.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province lost an estimated 583,000 pigs, and Hunan
Province 460,000 pigs, and Heilongjiang Province 492,000 pigs, as
a result of the catastrophic flooding.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Defense Minister Says Situation in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Defense Minister
and Chief of the Armed Forces Gen. Wiranto has called on all
Jakarta residents to remain cool-headed when facing the
development of present circumstances and perform their normal
duties.
</P>
<P>
"Jakarta is safe and under control. Everybody should do their
respective activities and perform their normal duties," he said in
a press briefing at the House of Representatives here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He called on Jakarta residents, however, to reduce their
presence in the streets as otherwise it is feared to lead to
uncalled-for happenings.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also denied mass media reports, which he considered
erroneous, to the effect that security apparatuses have asked all
offices to be closed.
</P>
<P>
According to field observations, quite a few offices have
allowed their employees to be absent this Friday and some offices
have also been closed earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Wiranto also criticized student
demonstrations, which have gained intensity since the commencement
of the Special Session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of these demonstrations is not clear and they only
disadvantage 200 million Indonesians," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, these demonstrations show that the groups of
students staging them do not adhere to the law, do not care about
the state's honor and ignore the interests of the people at large.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto called on both the soldiers and community members to
take stern action against any parties that have obviously violated
the law.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all people to pray that the special session
of the MPR will come off successfully and safely.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said one police officer died and more than 120
students were wounded during bloodshed clashes between security
forces and students in some areas of Jakarta Thursday night. The
students protested against the special meeting of the MPR and
urged the government to investigate the wealth of former president
Soeharto and his family as well as demanded for speedy political
reform in the country.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Island Farmers Get Rich On Coconuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- For some farmers on China's
Island Province of Hainan, coconuts mean money.
</P>
<P>
The city of Wenchang has one of China's most developed coconut
processing industries, with 4,700 ha of coconut field and 200
processing mills.
</P>
<P>
The coconut industry has an annual output of 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Coconuts used to be worth very little for the farmers and were
used for food and shade. Today, however, family workshops use the
trees to make pillows, candies, icing for cakes, and small
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
The Mayor of Wenchang Lin Shiluan says that almost all farmers
have coconut trees around their homes and some households have as
many as a thousand trees.
</P>
<P>
Wenchang has a coconut growing history of more than 2,000 years
and is building a coconut production base on 20,000 ha. of
land.

<HEADLINE> Likely Big Capital Surplus in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) - The Philippines is expected to
post a large capital surplus this year as the country attracts
foreign loans to beef up its international reserves and finance
local expenditures, the Philippines News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Investment house All Asia Capital and Trust Corporation (AACTC)
was quoted by the agency as estimating that the country's balance
of payments would hit a surplus of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars for
1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts are optimistic that as the business
confidence builds up, the country's long-term foreign capital will
remain at the 1-billion U.S. dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
They said that the foreign investments, which registered a
slightly lower net inflow of 766 million U.S dollars in 1997, may
have already reached 2.0 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter
of 1998 due to the sharp appreciation of its currency peso at that
time.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect for the currency to depreciate is
stronger due to overall regional concerns which continue to
influence market direction, AACTC said.
</P>
<P>
The AACTC said the intervention of the U.S. Federal Reserve to
avert further depreciation of the Japanese yen, was only
temporary. Unless Japan is able to address the bad loans in its
financial system, the situation in the region will be volatile.

JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- After a bloodshed clash
between security forces and students protesting against the
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
Thursday night, Indonesia's capital Jakarta is calm but tense
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Save for a few buses, not many cars are been passing along main
streets. Part of Jalan Gatot Subroto and the Cawang-Grogol toll
road is still closed to traffic and both cars and buses are
diverted to other access roads.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said one policeman died and more than 120
students were wounded in Thursday night clashes in Jakarta during
which security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of university students occupying a section of the
Cawang-Grogol toll road across the Indonesian Institute of Science
(LIPI) building Friday agreed to be relocated by security
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The students, who have been staging a rally since Thursday,
spent the night on LIPI grounds. They said they agreed to be
relocated because they wanted to perform Friday prayers, but that
they want to return to the toll road section afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Several places which have in the past few days been used by
students for freedom speeches are quiet, while shops in and around
Jalan Matraman, Jalan Salemba, Jalan Kramat Raya remain closed.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Defense Minister and Armed Forces chief
Gen. Wiranto Friday denied that the military had asked businesses
in the protest-hit capital to close for the day, saying the
situation is calm.
</P>
<P>
"There was confusing news that military has asked offices to
close, schools to be shut. That is not true," Wiranto told
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Free From Refereeing Worries in Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia stood away from
refereeing controversial to concentrate their energy in training
the practice for the boxing competition at the upcoming Asian
Games in Bangkok next month, the Indonesian Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Didiet Sudijoto, vice-secretary general of the Indonesian
Amateur Boxing Federation, said Thursday that judging mistakes
are understandable, "The judge and jury are only human, and are
error prone. A one second lapse could occur during the undertakin
g."
</P>
<P>
Didiet's remark could be tagged as a cautious sign in wake of
the controversial judgment in the South East Asian (SEA) Games,
where some hosts jury from Thailand were alleged to have been
unfair in some of the events.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will dispatch seven boxers in the 200-strong
contingent to the quad-annual event.
</P>
<P>
Four boxers are currently undergoing practice at a training
camp in Cuba. The program includes random matches with local
boxers as a test before they get into the Games rings where they
may be feel complacent over a one-gold haul.
</P>
<P>
Didiet, himself a former member of the Asian panel, looked set
to try to appease the worries, saying that people tend to judge
on their own opinions, without trying to look into the facts.
</P>
<P>
"We can't allow 'impression-type judging' in the judgment.
From the spectators' view, the last rounds seems to be more
decisive for a boxer who lands more punches," said Didiet.
</P>
<P>
He warned against excessive worries, saying that it might
disrupt athletes' confidence.
</P>
<P>
"We can't say to a boxer 'You have to KO him, otherwise you
will lose'," he said. "Instead, we have to say 'You must fight,
and fight'."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Reaps Windfall After Bumper Coffee Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has harvested its
biggest ever coffee crop, earning around 600 million U.S. dollars
from record exports of over 390,000 tons, according to the Vietnam
News.
</P>
<P>
The high price of coffee on the world market helped exporters
post a 43.5 percent sales increase this year, said the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).
</P>
<P>
This represented a 12.9 percent rise in terms of volume.
</P>
<P>
MARD noted that the bumper exports were achieved despite the
effects of the regional financial crisis, which had increased the
comparative price of Vietnamese goods on the world market.
</P>
<P>
MARD said coffee exports in November and December would likely
gross a further 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The world coffee price has risen this year after several major
coffee-exporting nations were hit by adverse weather which damaged
crops.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported coffee to 52 countries, with average prices up
20 to  25 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which bought 21.15 percent of Vietnam's
exports, is the country's biggest customer, followed by Germany,
17.74 percent, and Italy, 8.81 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to redouble
forestry development efforts over in the next 30 years in order to
improve water conservation and the environment, according to Wang
Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Wang said a massive afforestation program in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River and in the Three Gorges area will
raise forest coverage in the region from 22.1 percent to 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
A massive development program set for the Yellow River Valley
will increase forest coverage in key areas from 10.1 percent to
27 percent, said Wang on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the ambitious plan is the result hard
lessons China learned concerning the importance of forest
conservation following devastating summer flooding in the Yangtze
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
The plan has taken on added significance since experts recently
announced the possibility of unprecedented flooding along the
Yellow River during next year's flood season. Experts also noted
the lower standards of levees and dams along Yellow River compared
to similar facilities along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that forest development programs will also be carried
out along the Huai and Liao rivers, as well as around Taihu Lake
and in various desert areas.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans call for China to carry out forest
development on some 34 million hectares in these areas over the
next three decades.

Thursday, the AIDS specialists underscored the need for AIDS
awareness programs in work place in order to minimize the
socio-economic cost of the killer disease, the Independent
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 100 people who have been tested HIV positive in
Bangladesh, 10 got full-blown AIDS and four of them died, experts
told the seminar.
</P>
<P>
But the number of the real HIV positive cases must be "much
higher," they added, estimating that the figure would be not less
than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
They called for partnership approach of the government,
non-government organizations and the business community to fight
"the century's worst tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Apart from commercial sex workers, unsafe blood transfusion is
another major cause for the alarming spread of the disease, they
pointed out, stressing the need for intensifying awareness for
safe sex and ensuring adequate blood screening arrangement in
health centers.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh is still a less-prevalence country, it is
surrounded by countries with high rates of HIV positive, M.R.
Chowdhury, an AIDS expert, warned.
</P>
<P>
"Since there is no known-vaccine against AIDS and no effective
medical care for HIV, raising awareness is the best alternative,"
Labor and manpower Minister M.A. Mannan emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"Epidemic has already started in Bangladesh, but it's now in
initial stage and still there is time to overcome," the minister
added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's CPP, FUNCINPEC Reach Two Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the ruling
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the opposition FUNCINPEC party
reached two agreements at talks held Thursday night in Royal
Palace, according to a communique issued by King Norodom Sihanouk
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, the CPP agreed to amnesty the five persons as
demanded by FUNCINPEC, including Nhiek Bun Chhay and Serey Kosal.
In return, FUNCINPEC agreed in principal to form a coalition
government with the CPP.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and FUNCINPEC on Thursday hurriedly convened a summit
meeting under the chair of the King, aimed at hammering out a
power-sharing deal.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC President Prince Ranariddh, who returned from Bangkok
Thursday afternoon, sat down with CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen
in an effort to make progress towards forming a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Both parties have expressed their satisfaction over the outcome
of Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting continues Friday. The summit is being held
just before the King's deadline of Saturday for his return to
Beijing to have medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The talks are seen as a step in the right direction, but there
is still a long way to go before the new government can be formed,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh agreed to return and join the summit after he has got
fresh security guarantees from Hun Sen that parliamentary immunity
of opposition MPs would be respected.
</P>
<P>
Absent at the talks were representatives of the Sam Rainsy
Party, which had taken part in previous talks.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have already held one summit and three rounds
of working group meetings, but failed to make significant progress
due to sharp differences over the power-sharing in the National
Assembly and the government.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Growing in Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The fast development of
township and village enterprises has made China's Zhejiang
province a leader in urbanizing rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, a large number of villages have
become small towns. Provincial statistics show 993 towns by the
end of 1997, seven times of the number in 1978, the year China
adopted its reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
They have 14.14 million residents, or 35 percent of the
province's total population, and most of the province's 930,000
township and village enterprises, which account for four-fifths of
the province's industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Local government sources say that small towns have provided
jobs for nearly eight million surplus rural workers while many
Chinese analysts say that this are an efficient way to urbanize
rural areas of a country that has nearly 1.3 billion people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zhejiang has paid greater attention to
infrastructure in small towns to provide them with urban
functions. About 90 percent of the towns plan to follow
international standards of urbanization in developing.

<HEADLINE> Ornamental Plants Bringing Small Fortune to Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Dramatic growth in the demand
for ornamental plants in China has turned a small business into a
large industry in eastern China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land used for growing these plants in Zhejiang
has increased at average annual rate of 10 percent to 4,593
hectares, with about 15,000 households involved in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province provided the rest of the country with
300 types of plants and the output accounted for more than 35
percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to turn the local seedling planting business into a
pillar industry, the province has since the early 1990s set up a
number of cooperatives to coordinate production and marketing of
ornamental plants, and opened a 3,000-sq.m. trading center. A
special information center on plants has also been opened, with a
website on the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Food prices in
October were 4.4 percent higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to a media release issued Friday by Statistics New
Zealand, the annual rise in the food price index of 4.4 percent
is the largest since September 1990 when food prices were 4.6
percent higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The release said that food prices for October were
significantly influenced by price rises for potatoes, bread,
apples, oranges and soft drinks. The prices of apples and potatoes
were both up a whopping 26 percent between September and October.
Major prices decreases in the month included cabbage, lettuce and
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
Grocery food prices in October were 3.1 percent higher than a
year ago and 0.6 percent higher than a month ago. Much of the rise
in grocery food prices was attributed to the weaker New Zealand
dollar, raising the cost of imported foods such as fruit, tea,
coffee, sugar, rice and cereals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Minority Leader Weighing Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Dick Gephardt, minority
leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, said on Thursday he
is seriously considering a presidential race, against the wishes
of some Democratic officials that he remain in the House and set
his sights on the speakership.
</P>
<P>
"I'm actively considering it, and I will continue to do so for
the next two months," the House Democratic leader said of a
presidential bid in an interview with the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt's political future was buoyed November 3, when
Democrats surpassed their own expectations and picked up five
seats in the House, just six short of a majority. He had raised
millions of dollars, campaigned for dozens of candidates and
helped shape the party's midterm message, the AP report said.
</P>
<P>
Does he try to win the House or the White House?
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard decision, but it's a straightforward and simple
decision," Gephardt said. "The decision is: Where do you best
think you can do what needs to be done for the country -- now and
in the next few years?"
</P>
<P>
Supporters say he wants to keep his options open, both because
he hasn't made up his mind and because it's in his best political
interests to remain a presidential prospect as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview, Gephardt, who ran for president in
1988, didn't sound like a man prepared to concede the presidential
race to anybody.
</P>
<P>
The Missouri lawmaker is reportedly in the best position to
raise enough money and call in enough political IOUs for a
Democratic presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats would prefer to see Gephardt in the House
speaker's chair, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said he had heard from some Democratic lawmakers who
were against him leaving. "I'll listen to them and I'll obviously
respect their opinion", but the House could be won with somebody
else leading the Democrats, Gephardt said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Increased Budget for After-School Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday announced that the federal government will spend 200
million U.S. dollars to support after-school programs and urged
Republican-controlled Congress to pass legislation for affordable
child care.
</P>
<P>
The money, five times more than last year, will pay for 183
grants in 600 schools across the nation.
</P>
<P>
"In the New Economy, we can no longer think of high-quality
child care and after-school programs as luxury items," Clinton
said. "We did not pass the child care proposal; I hope we can do
better next time."
</P>
<P>
Congress approved the 1996 after-school program with one
million dollars and the 1997 program with 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 160-million-dollar increase in the 1998 programs showed the
cooperation between Republicans and Democrats on the issue,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
After-school programs are aimed at keeping children motivated
and safe. Studies show that half of violent juvenile crime occurs
between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., when many children are unsupervised.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Files Lawsuit Against Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Mayor Richard M.
Daley on Thursday filed a 433-million-U.S. dollar lawsuit against
the firearms industry, accusing it of creating a public nuisance
by flooding the streets with weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Gun manufacturers and dealers are profiting off the activities
of criminals in Chicago," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants in the lawsuit are 22 firearms makers, 12
suburban gun shops and four individual gun distributors. The
shops were targeted in an investigation by undercover Chicago
police.
</P>
<P>
Daley said suburban shops cater to gang members who can't buy
weapons in Chicago because of tough laws controlling guns in the
city. He said manufacturers pour inventory into the suburban
shops far in excess of suburban demand, knowing the real market is
gang-plagued Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Before Chicago, New Orleans has already taken the gun industry
to court and Miami has similar plans. Experts said other
crime-plagued cities may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Chicago had 759 homicides last year, of which 570 were caused
by guns. About 40,000 people were reportedly killed by guns
across the U.S. in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Most Bulgarians Unsatisfied With Living Standards: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Most Bulgarians are unhappy with
their standards of living, wanting their incomes increased, and
half foresee little improvement in their economic situation.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the National Public Opinion
Center (NPOC) in October and released Thursday, the majority of
the respondents said the average person needed at least 490,000
leva (about 290 U.S. dollars) to cover basic monthly expenses,
nine times more than the minimum monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
A similar survey conducted in the same period last year showed
that the subsistence level was 340,000 leva (about 200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the NPOC said that the inflation rate for the
past year had soared to at least 44 percent, while the official
rate for the first ten months of this year was only 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the respondents were not optimistic about their living
standards and half believed they would never reach a satisfactory
level.
</P>
<P>
As many as 35 percent of the respondents, aged between 30-49,
believed that their living standards would rise within 10 years,
but another 10 percent held that would only be possible later.
</P>
<P>
At present, the average monthly wage in Bulgaria is around 80
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Promotes Business Cooperation With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi delegation of
entrepreneurs is currently visiting Myanmar to seek ways to
promote business cooperation with their Myanmar counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi businessmen, who are accompanying Bangladesh
foreign minister Abdus Samad Azad on the latter's three-day visit
to Yangon, met their Myanmar counterparts Thursday for discussions
on bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
U Aik Tun, vice-chairman of the Asia Wealth Bank Ltd of
Myanmar, said Azad's visit would enhance bilateral economic
cooperation between the two countries which have direct trade
dealings, and help overcome economic difficulties both are facing.
</P>
<P>
U Aik Tun, who is also chairman of the Myanmar-Bangladesh
Business Center, hoped that entrepreneurs of the five nations of
BIMST-EC could conduct trade on a wider scale.
</P>
<P>
Both Myanmar and Bangladesh are member countries of BIMST-EC, a
new sub-regional economic grouping formed in June 1997 by
Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand bordering the
Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw, Azad
arrived here Wednesday for a visit aimed at strengthening
bilateral ties and economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, a Myanmar business and investment delegation
led by U Aik Tun visited Bangladesh. They reached a memorandum of
understanding with the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(CCI) to promote and expand trade, investment and other economic
activities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Two other Bangladeshi organizations -- the Federation of
Bangladesh CCI and the Bengal CCI -- had signed with their Myanmar
counterparts similar MOUs in May 1989 and June 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade stands at about 8 million U.S. dollars a year,
according to Commerce and Industries Minister of Bangladesh Tofail
Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries formally opened border trade in September
1995.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Start "Weapons for Development" Project in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will start
a "Weapons for Development" project in Albania to collect weapons
lost in riots last year and promote economic development, the
Albanian Telegraph Agency (ATA) reported thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project under the U.N. Development Program (UNDP)
will start in one or two communes at first in Gramsh district when
a final agreement is reached among the donors, the Movement for
Disarmament Association (MDA) Chairman Ramazan Bega told ATA.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide funds to strengthen the police force,
build a road for transportation of agricultural products and a
telephone exchange in the district.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by the U.N. Deputy Secretary General
Jayantha Dhanapala when he headed a mission in Albania in June.
</P>
<P>
The MDA will persuade the local people to hand in their weapons
by telling them their gain in the economic development project.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 pieces of weapons were lost in last year's riots
in Albania, with more than 10 percent in Gramsh. Only 500 pieces
have been handed in by local residents in the district, while some
others have been smuggled to neighbor countries threatening the
safety of the area.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- As 1998, the Year of the
Tiger, is drawing to its end, the U.S. National Museum of Natural
History in Washington DC will open its tiger exhibition on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, jointly held by the Save The Tiger Fund and the
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, is dedicated to educating
the public about endangered tigers in wild.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits explores the tiger's life in the wild and its
growing threat of extinction. It also highlights international
efforts to preserve vital habitat along the India-Nepal border.
</P>
<P>
With growing economic development, the habitat and prey for
tigers are getting smaller and smaller, in addition to increasing
poaching.
</P>
<P>
Wild tigers are in serious danger of becoming extinct. At the
beginning of this century, over 100,000 tigers existed. Today
fewer than 7,000 tigers remain in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Within the last 70 years, three subspecies -- Bali, Javan and
Caspian -- have become extinct, and the range of the surviving
five subspecies has been reduced to Southeast Asia and Sumatra,
and isolated areas in China, India, Nepal and Siberia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Changjiang
Agriculture Group, one of the largest agro-businesses in eastern
China, recently decided to spend nine million yuan on the Gansu
Corridor in Gansu Province, to the west of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The company was attracted by the cheap labor, resources, the
unique weather conditions, and large market there, a senior
executive said.
</P>
<P>
What the company is especially interested in is the Malutan
Forest Farm at the eastern end of the Corridor, which uses
drip-irrigation equipment from Israel, said Yun Kuiwen, who is in
charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
And, according to Hu Shengrong, the head of the forest farm,
the group has adequate funds, a large market network, and
export-oriented management sense poorer areas of northwestern
China need.
</P>
<P>
Changjiang, which has over 100 million yuan (12 million
U.S. dollars) in registered capital, is mainly engaged in the
production, processing, and marketing of farm products and has
opened offices in the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The group has introduced 58 foreign vegetable and fruit
varieties to the Corridor and plans to spend more than 10 million
yuan on a farm produce processing factory and on restoring
vegetation to more than 6,000 hectares of desert land in a bid to

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Heart diseases are killing about
150,000 people every year in Bulgaria which has one of the highest
death rates for heart problems in Europe, according to new figures.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Cardiologists in Bulgaria (ACB) announced
the statistics, which cover the last two years, before the opening
of the sixth national congress of cardiologists on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, more than 50 percent of all deaths resulted from
the cardiovascular diseases, with a 2.3 percent annual increase,
a higher rate than Western Europe at 38.5 percent, ACB President
Professor Tihomir Daskalov said.
</P>
<P>
According to the data from the ACB, about 18 percent of
Bulgarians suffered from hypertension, but only half of them are
given treatment.
</P>
<P>
The government needed to attach great importance to preventive
care and treatment and appropriate enough money to help poor
patients pay medical expenses, Daskalov said.
</P>
<P>
The congress of cardiologists, which opened Thursday and is
scheduled to end on November 14, will discuss the latest methods
in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

<HEADLINE> Over 120 People Hurt in Clashes in Indonesian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 people were
injured in clashes Thursday night in Indonesia's capital city
which saw the largest student demonstrations since former
president Soeharto was forced down on May 21 amid the country's
worst economic and political crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
A police officer died in one of the clashes that also left at
least three students with gunshot wounds and more than 120 others
injured, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the Jakarta Police On-the-Alert unit
Col. Arthur Damanik, the officer from the police's elite Mobile
Brigade was beaten by protesters during an incident at the Slipi
intersection in West Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to give details, saying only that the body of
the dead police officer had been sent to a police-owned hospital
in East Jakarta for a post-mortem examination.
</P>
<P>
The three students, who suffered gunshot wounds, were shot in
the chest, hands and legs, medical staff said, adding that the
type of the bullets remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some of the wounded students were still in
a critical condition. Most of the students suffered light wounds
on their heads and legs. Some were taken home by their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Police spokesman Lt. Col. Edward Aritonang refused to
comment on the clashes.
</P>
<P>
"We're still waiting for the final results," he told the
Jakarta post on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of students demonstrating against the ongoing
special People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) session defied a
heavy downpour and a massive security cordon to march toward the
MPR building to press their demand for speedy political reform.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who approached the MPR building from various
directions after long marches around the city, also included a
huge number of members of the public. The latter joined the sea of
people who occupied almost all major streets heading to the venue
of the special MPR session at the MPR building in South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Most of the columns of protesters were stopped well before they
could reach their destinations by riot police and soldiers,
equipped with guns, water cannon vehicles, horses and batons,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Using bottles, stones, bamboo and chunks of concrete as
weapons, the students were face to face with police and military
members. When the heavily armed troops attempted to disperse the
crowd, clashes became inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The students, who came from dozens of universities in Jakarta
and West Java province, such as Bogor and Bandung, have voiced
their disapproval of the members as well as the agenda of the
four-day special MPR session which is scheduled to end on Friday,
saying they were merely a legacy of former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The students are demanding Soeharto be brought to court and the
military's sociopolitical role, known as the dual-function policy,
be dropped.
</P>
<P>
Both matters have not been deliberated as draft decrees by the
MPR. The dual-function draft has been dropped, while the
investigation into Soeharto's alleged ill-gotten wealth was
incorporated into another decree.

<HEADLINE> China's Dairy Business Finds Itself at Cross-Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- After two decades of rapid
development, China's dairy industry is now at a cross-roads and in
need of large-scale improvements to develop Chinese dairy products
market.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, China's dairy industry has grown
tremendously to 8.04 million tons of milk and 560,000 tons of
other dairy products in 1997, from 980,000 tons and 46,000 tons,
respectively, in 1978. Annual per-capita consumption of dairy
products is seven kilograms.
</P>
<P>
But, because of the limited variety of dairy products,
stockpiles of powdered milk amounted to 70,000 tons by the end of
last year, and about 30 percent of the 750-some dairy farms are
operating at a loss. Last year, the industry had an output value
of 12.9 billion yuan, but a mere 206 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
Something needs to be done about this, said Song Kungang,
chairman of the China Dairy Industry Council, adding that China
has great potential in the dairy industry because its per-capita
dairy consumption is far less than the world average of 100 kg.
</P>
<P>
The largest group of Chinese dairy product consumers is people
in urban areas, mostly infants and the elderly and people with a
better education. Exports of milk products are around 100,000 tons
a year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has listed dairy farming as one of the key
areas of development and every June there is a "Milk Week" with
promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, China will change its dairy industry
product mix to more fresh milk and less powdered milk and it
expects to improve the quality of milk products, according to
Song.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Ambassador Returns to Madrid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government
announced Thursday the return to Spain of its ambassador in Madrid
Sergio Pizarro, who was recalled last week for consultations after
the arrest in London of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"He returns because, from the political point of view, we have
good reasons for him to return," said Deputy Foreign Affairs
Minister Mariano Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez rejected statements from the rightist opposition that
the diplomat should remain in Chile for an indefinite time.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations between Chile and Spain changed for the
better after Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Abel Matutes said
that Spain did not pretend to be the judge of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"That is a very forceful statement, and in consequence, there
is no reason for the ambassador to remain here," said Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to comment about the date for Pizarro's
return to Spain, which had been set for next week.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez arrived Thursday in Chile after staying two weeks in
London negotiating the release of former Chilean leader Pinochet,
who was detained last October 16 at the request of Spanish
magistrate Baltasar Garzon.
</P>
<P>
Garzon wants to extradite Pinochet in a bid to judge the former
Chilean president for violations against human rights during his
reign between 1973 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pizarro was recalled to Chile on November 6, in protest at the
decision of Spain's Council of Ministers to process immediately
the extradition request presented to London by Garzon.

<HEADLINE> Book Agent Says She's to Blame for Tripp's Tape-recording </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- New York book agent
Lucianne Goldberg said on Thursday it is her fault that Linda
Tripp faces criminal charges for secretly tape-recording telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"I take all the blame," Goldberg was quoted by media reports as
telling reporters after testifying before a Howard County,
Maryland, grand jury.
</P>
<P>
The jury is considering whether Tripp, a county resident, broke
Maryland wiretapping law by recording about 20 hours of
conversations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The tapes led to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation of the former White House intern's affair with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for breaking Maryland's wiretapping law is
five years in prison and a 10,000-dollar fine. But ignorance of
the law is a valid defense.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said on Thursday that Tripp asked her in September
1997 if recording her calls with Lewinsky would be appropriate.
Goldberg said she asked an associate to research the matter on the
Internet, then incorrectly told Tripp that recording was legal.
</P>
<P>
She said she told Tripp that "she'd better tape her phone calls
or she'd be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Goldberg dismissed reports that Tripp began recording the
conversations to gather material for a book on presidential sex
scandals.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said she gave prosecutors tapes of two conversations
she had with Tripp and two other tapes containing conversations
between Lewinsky and Tripp between September 28 and October 6 last
year -- before Tripp learned the taping was illegal, she said.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli is seeking evidence that
Tripp knew that secret taping was illegal before she began in
September 1997.

North America.
</P>

Quzhou is one of China's largest orange producers, but it has

prices and poor quality.

The local government has taken steps to cut the density of
trees in half to improve the quality of oranges and this year's

JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has reiterated that he has no intention of reshuffling the
cabinet line-up, saying it would continue working until the end of
next year, national newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has denied that he will make changes to the
cabinet line-up. He said the cabinet will continue to work until
the end of 1999," the Secretary-General of the Association of
Indigenous Businessmen Rainal Rais told reporters after a meeting
with Habibie here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government would resign only after the election of a new
president and vice president in late 1999, Habibie was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the President's spokeswoman, Dewi
Fortuna Anwar, indicated on Wednesday that Habibie was considering
replacing his four coordinating ministers in a bid to make the
Cabinet more efficient.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite possible," said Dewi on the sidelines of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) special session.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers believed that the president's reiteration was an
apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition
groups for his early resignation.
</P>
<P>
Four national figures issued a statement after a meeting last
Tuesday that a new cabinet must be formed three months after the
general elections in May next year.
</P>
<P>
The statement was endorsed by Nadhlatul Ulama chairman
Abdurrahman Wahid, Yogyakarta Governor Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono,
Chairman of the National Mandate Party Amien Rais, and Megawati
Soekarnoputri, who leads a popular faction of the Indonesian
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Students throughout the country, demonstrating to press their
demand for speedy political reform, have called for the country to
be led temporarily by a reform council with the main task of
preparing for a general election next year.

BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai labor officials based in
countries neighboring Iraq have been ordered to watch the Gulf
situation closely as the United States is expected to take
military action against Baghdad, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The move was to ensure the safety of some 34,000 Thai workers
in Saudi Arabia, 1,600 in the United Arab Emirates, 3,000 in
Kuwait and 200 in Oman, said Somchai Wattana, a senior official of
the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry.
</P>
<P>
There were some 30 Thai students and embassy officials in Iraq
but no Thai workers there.
</P>
<P>
Somchai said his ministry was ready to assist Thai workers
based in Iraq's neighboring countries if the United States did
attack Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Press APEC Members to Continue Market Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that President Bill Clinton will press Asia to continue a
policy of open markets and resist protectionism at the meeting of
the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Despite the showdown between Washington and Baghdad on weapons
inspection, Clinton still planned to attend APEC meeting on
November 17-18 in Malaysia, said U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Clinton wants to encourage the
other APEC members to keep their economies open despite the
economic crisis that has undermined currencies and cut economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be turning back (in trade liberalization) or
closing up," White House economic aide Gene Sperling told a
background briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of open markets are too important to sacrifice,"
Sperling told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Washington hopes the meeting will strike an
agreement to lower tariffs in nine sectors -- fish, forestry
products, medical supplies, environmental technology, chemicals,
energy, toys, jewelry and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"The environment in the region is a difficult one ... so it
will be difficult for us to make progress," said Lael Brainard, a
White House official who specializes on international economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
Japan, in particular, is resisting lowering tariffs on its
politically sensitive fish and timber industries. U.S. officials
fear that if Japan refuses to sign on, other countries may also
balk.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also expected to continue to press Japan to revive
its moribund domestic economy and to carry out recently passed
legislation to reform its banking industry, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Sector Dealing with Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to solve any
problem it may have with the millenium bug in its fledgling
securities industry by next February, according to the China
Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this month the country's securities and futures
sectors will run a test to see if any computer system will be
affected by the bug and whether the stock and futures markets will
operate as normal when the new millennium comes.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, stock exchanges and securities and futures
companies will move the timers in their computers forward to
December 31, 1999, while doing mock trading in A shares, B shares,
funds, and bonds. Then, any problems that arise will be fixed
before February.
</P>
<P>
The country will fix all of its computer systems by the end of
March, 1999, and will complete the testing by the end of
September, 1999.
</P>
<P>
On September 26-27, China conducted its first test of computers
in the securities and futures sector. The test included an
experiment with a leap year when the timers were moved forward to
February 29, 2000.

<P>
There are 100 buildings with a height of more than 100 meters.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Three Million Farmers Find Work in Sichuan's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The rapid development of the
economy in soutwest China's Sichuan province is freeing more
farmers from the land, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is a large agricultural province with a huge labor
force. In recent years, the private sector has become a way to put
surplus rural laborers back to work.
</P>
<P>
At present, 80 percent of the 3.5 million people who work in
the province's private sector are farmers, whose average annual
income went up to 900 yuan in the first three quarters of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that preferential policies were adopted in
1997 to encourage local people to build small factories by
themselves. This has help reduce farmers' payment in various fees
valued at 200 million yuan since that year.
</P>
<P>
The local government also increased support for village and
rural markets and there are now at least 8,000 of them in the
province.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Issues Worldwide Vigilance Alert Amid Iraq-UN Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
recommended Thursday night that Americans around the world
"maintain a high level of vigilance" and a low profile as the
U.S. is reinforcing a military buildup in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The advice was contained in an unusual "worldwide caution"
announcement designed "to reflect the potential for retaliation in
light of the tensions with Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections."
</P>
<P>
Americans traveling abroad were advised to get in touch with
U.S. embassies for up-to-date information on security conditions.
</P>
<P>
The department advised U.S. citizens to "vary routes and times
for all required travel, and treat mail from unfamiliar sources
with suspicion."
</P>
<P>
Twelve B-52 bombers and 12 F-117s were flying from U.S. Air
Force bases in Louisiana, North Dakota and New Mexico to the
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia and a base in Kuwait, the
U.S. Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Thursday that 139 combat aircraft
are being sent to the Persian Gulf, not 129 as it had stated a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The earlier number did not include 10 Air Force KC-10 tankers
being dispatched to the region, said Pentagon spokesman Col.
Richard Bridges.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen signed a deployment order
Wednesday sending the aircraft and some 3,000 service members to
the region to bolster U.S. forces there.
</P>
<P>
The eight-engine B-52s, used in the Vietnam War and updated
periodically since, have a wingspan of 56.4 meters, carry a crew
of five and can launch up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles far
from Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
The F-117, built to foil enemy radar detection, is able to drop
precision laser-guided bombs. Its speed is slower than sound, but
it destroyed targets in heavily-defended Baghdad almost at will on
night missions during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes have used the British base on Diego Garcia in
previous Gulf actions. The island is within striking range of
Iraq, but beyond the reach of Iraqi missiles including Soviet-made
Scuds.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton warned on Wednesday that the U.S. will
take military action against Iraq if the Iraqi government failed
to comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions allowing
inspectors to finish their job in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Send Anti-Chemical Warfare Troops to Gulf Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Polish Deputy Defense Minister
Romuald Szeremietiew said here on Thursday that his country would
send anti-chemical warfare troops to the Gulf region to
participate in threatened U.S.-led military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Warsaw Television, Szeremietiew referred
to the Gulf crisis in February when "we declared our intention to
send troops, meaning anti-chemical warfare soldiers."
</P>
<P>
As the crisis was resolved by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Anna's mission to Baghdad, which avoided a military strike, the
Polish soldiers did not go, Szeremietiew said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we still foresee the possibility (of sending them) and
the troops are making their preparations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deputy minister, who said he hoped military
action could be avoided, stressed that nobody could expect too
much of Poland or its forces.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 U.N. arms inspectors, all International Atomic
Energy Agency monitors and non-essential staff have begun their
withdrawal from Baghdad, after Iraq announced an end to all
cooperation with the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
With the build-up of U.S. planes, warships and ground troops in
the region, the withdrawal of personnel is seen as a sign of a
possible military action against Iraq.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 66 people were
hospitalized in Tennessee on Thursday when noxious fumes filled a
high school classroom and hallway, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
All 2,000 students at the Warren County High School at
McMinnville, about 100 kilometers southeast of Nashville, were
sent home while investigators were searching for the source of the
fumes, which was variously described as reminiscent of paint
thinner, bug spray or pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
Victims -- mostly students and at least one teacher -- were
treated at River Park Hospital for nausea, headaches and dizzy
spells. No one appeared seriously ill but they were not being
sent home, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The patients were given oxygen while blood samples were taken
for testing but turned up nothing. Investigators scoured the
building trying to find the source of the fumes, but nothing was
found in the air.

<HEADLINE> Jayasinghe to Miss Asiad for Drug Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's sprinter
Susanthika Jayasinghe will miss next month's Asian Games because
of her drug ban, a Chinese athletics official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, vice director of Chinese Athletics Center, said
on Thursday that the International Amateur Athletics Federation
(IAAF) had never lifted the suspension imposed on Jayasinghe, who
failed a random drug test conducted by the world athletics
governing body in April.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka local reports said Jayasinghe, the 200-meter world
silver medalist, had her drug ban lifted and made the
qualification for the Asian Games after setting an continental
record of 11.28 seconds in the 100 meters at the National
Championships on November 1.
</P>
<P>
She will compete in the 100m and 200m events in Bangkok, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Shang, who came back from an IAAF secretary-general meeting,
said that IAAF had received an appeal from Sri Lanka's Athletics
Association for Jayasinghe. The appeal will be handed to the
discipline committee on November 20. But there is less
possibility for IAAF to release Jayasinghe for the Asian Games
slated from December 6-20 in Bangkok, Thailand, Sang said.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe jumped to the fame in Athens World Championships,
where she won the silver medal after clocking 22.39 seconds in
the 200m to become the first international medal winner for Sri
Lanka in 49 years.
</P>
<P>
She skipped the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia because of lack
of training and poor timing.

JINAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese map that reflects
Japan's past aggressive ambition has been found in a city in

The 1.06-meter by 0.72-meter map was printed on January 1,

in the suburbs of Beijing as a pretext in their attempt to annex
the whole of China, marking the beginning of their war of
aggression against China.

The map has circles drawn around three provinces in
northeastern China (Manchuria) and marks China's Taiwan, Lushun
and Dalian as Japanese territory. It has China's highways,

<HEADLINE> OSCE to Place Thousand Verifiers in Kosovo by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will send 1,000 verifiers by year
end to observe the peace process in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province,
OSCE Chairman Bronislaw Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will send some 250 people a week, beginning the second of
December. We hope that before the end of the year we will have in
place 1,000 verifiers," Geremek told a press conference after a
meeting of the OSCE' permanent council in Vienna
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mission, responsible to verify Belgrade's compliance
with United Nations Security Council's demand to end a crackdown
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and withdraw Serb forces, was
part of an accord reached on October 13 between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The mission would consist of a total of 2,000 OSCE verifiers as
agreed by the two men.
</P>
<P>
Geremek urged all parties in the Kosovo conflict to ensure the
safety of OSCE verifiers, saying that "I'm concerned by the
security situation: the ceasefire is breached on a daily basis,
intimidation continues."
</P>

CHONGQING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at Orbis, an
airborne eye hospital, say that as many as 80 percent of blind
people could regain their eyesight through proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, who are here on a three-week training course, said

Others become blind because of eye diseases, and that modern
eye operations could cure these, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, over one million

from last year. Investment in fixed assets totaled 45 billion yuan
in the first three quarters, up 30.4 percent from a year ago.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The industrial output of this
leading economic center of China was 14.6 percent higher this
October than in the same month last year, and the highest monthly
rate so far this year.
</P>
<P>
This rapid growth is expected to help Shanghai reach its 11
percent industrial growth target for the year, according to some
experts.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's industry has met grave difficulties this year due to
unfavorable factors such as the effects of the Asian financial
crisis and inadequate domestic demand, in addition to negative
growth in January, the first such month in years.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this trend, Shanghai has redoubled efforts to
restructure its industry, increase sales, and improve product
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
As a result, stockpiles of petrochemicals, automobiles, building
materials and other leading industrial products have decreased by
15 percent when compared with a year ago, and the value of these
products is now down to three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 68 percent of Shanghai's industrial enterprises
are showing profits.

<HEADLINE> Superb 1,500-Year-Old Porcelain Discovered In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A 1,500-year-old porcelain
cup discovered in Jiangxi Province is believed to represent the
best of a famous porcelain kiln in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
The kiln in Ji'an County, east China's Jiangxi Province, is
called the Jizhou Kiln and dates back to the Song Dynasty
(420-479). Porcelain from the kiln was known for its paper-cut
applique design, black glaze, and color-changing technique by the
irregular application of glaze that resulted in iridescent color
that could change from black to purple.
</P>
<P>
The rare 4.4-centimeter-high and 11.8-centimeter-in-diameter
cup is priceless because it has all three characteristics of the
Jizhou Kiln, according to the archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The Jizhou Kiln's products were well-known and are now
attracting antique collectors from Japan, Europe, and Southeast
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Law On Respecting Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Some recent archeological
research on a 2,000-year-old book has found that China had a law
on respect for the elderly in the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D.220).
</P>
<P>
The book consists of 26 inscribed bamboo slips. It was
discovered in a tomb in the city of Wuwei in Gansu Province. It
contains an imperial edict from 10 B.C. that is the world's
earliest evidence of a law on respecting the elderly, according to
a rearcher.
</P>
<P>
The decree says that a kind of walking stick would be bestowed
on anyone above the age of 70 by the emperor and that imperial
officials were to show their respect to anyone with one of these
sticks by dismounting from his horse or getting out of his sedan
chairs, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
Other privileges were provided for the elderly, according to
the edict. Businessmen above the age of 70, for example, didn't
have to pay taxes. Showing disrespect to the elderly was also
forbidden, and anyone who shouted abuse at or hit the elderly
could receive the death penalty.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac started a state visit to Mexico on Thursday to strengthen
political and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived shortly after Mexico and the European Union (EU)
started formal free trade negotiations, Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo noted at the welcoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said that Chirac's visit would reinforce Mexico's
economic development strategy for the diversification of its
economy, which takes Europe as "a priority".
</P>
<P>
The visit will also give a more ample dimension to political
and economic relations between the two countries, Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said his visit to Mexico, the first by a French
president, would contribute to "a strong and exemplary"
Franco-Mexican relationship extending into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The French president is scheduled to hold talks with his
Mexican counterpart on ways to maintain stability of the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
Mexican official sources said the two countries would sign some
20 agreements on political, economic, education and technological
cooperation during Chirac's visit.
</P>
<P>
The French president, who arrived here late Wednesday night
accompanied by some 50 French entrepreneurs, will conclude his
visit to Mexico on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He will then go to Guatemala to meet Central American
presidents for talks on French assistance to victims of Hurricane
Mitch that devastated the region in the last week of October.

With a new crisis building in the Middle East, the Canadian
Foreign Affairs Department said Thursday that Canadians in the two
countries "should examine their personal circumstances and
consider departing if their presence is not essential."

The department also recommended that Canadians defer
non-essential travel to both countries, as well as the West Bank

WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf of Germany
clinched a spot in the season-ending Chase Championships today
without playing a match as second-round action began at the
$450,000 Advanta Championships indoor tennis event.
</P>
<P>
Graf received help from fifth-seed and former archrival Monica
Seles of the United States, who ousted Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-3,
7-5 to advance to the quarter-finals.
</P>

The combination of Seles' win and the withdrawal of Venus
Williams from the Chase Championships lifted Graf, ranked 17th in
the WTA Tour, into the 16-woman tournament.
</P>
<P>
Graf will face third seed and defending champion Jana Novotna.
Should Graf advance, she would likely face Seles in the second
round at the Chase Championships. Seles plays Russian teenager
Anna Kournikova in her first-round match.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Nathalie Tauziat of France beat American Lisa
Raymond in today's first match 6-3, 6-1. Seventh seed Patty
Schnyder of Switzerland was not as fortunate, losing to Amy
Frazier 6-3, 6-1. Tauziat, seeded eighth, will play Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus. Schnyder will face second seed Martina
Hingis of Switzerland.
</P>

WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
appointed U.S. Former Defense Secretary William Perry coordinator
of U.S. policy on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and will oversee a complete review of that policy.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said on Thursday the
appointment was made as there were growing concerns in the
government that Pyongyang is building what the U.S. claimed a
so-called underground nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
Wendy Sherman, the State Department's counselor and a senior
aide to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will also be part
of the review, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Perry "would analyze current policy and provide his
assessment afterward" in a report to Albright and President Bill
Clinton. He will consult with U.S. allies South Korea and Japan,
as well as Chinese officials. He may also meet DPRK officials,
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Charles Kartman, the U.S. special envoy on DPRK, will continue
to represent the United States in nuclear talks with Pyongyang as
well as U.S.-initiated four-party talks aimed at bringing peace to
the Korean peninsula, Rubin said.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Wall
Street closed mixed on Thursday, with the blue-chip barometer
rebounding only 5 points.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average escaped a fourth session of
plunge, finishing 5.92 points higher at 8829.74, thanks to gains
in the oil stocks. Broad market indicators extended losses since
Monday in the face of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The Dow has lost 150 points in the previous three sessions
after winning 610 points in the prior eight-session winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see this week's downturn as "regular rest" in the wake
of a bearish market, instead of the start of a correction. Many
investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the
third round in two months when it meets on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the October 15 cut of interest rates by 0.25 percentage,
the Dow has undergone two strings of jump with gains amounting to
600 points and 610 points separately.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.N.-Iraqi standoff on the arms inspection in Iraq
boosted oil stocks with Dow components Chevron and Exxon up
obviously.
</P>

On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners beat advancers 5-4
with trading volume down to 689 million shares from 713 million

BAGHDAD -- The U.N. pulled out another 40 relief workers from
Iraq on Thursday morning, leaving only about 30 humanitarian staff
in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
This is the second batch of withdrawal of U.N. relief workers
from Iraq. On Wednesday afternoon, 130 people were already
evacuated from Iraq to Amman, Jordan, as "precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian officials have warned that the reduction of
U.N. humanitarian staff in Iraq will inevitably slow down the
implementation of U.N. humanitarian program in Iraq.

JERUSALEM -- To prepare for the U.S. air strike on Iraq, the
Israeli government has ordered the army to reopen all of its gas
mask distribution centers nationwide to the public from Thursday
to let people update their masks.
</P>
<P>
The government also urged the public to update their chemical
warfare protection kids in light of what Israeli defense officials

JERUSALEM -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
Israel's opposition on Thursday sharply criticized Israeli
government's plan for settlement construction at Har Homa, a
controversial hill slope near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ministry of Construction and Housing published
Thursday the first tender for the construction of housing units at
Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
According to the tender, Israel plans to build 1,025 apartments
at Har Homa as part of a comprehensive plan of building 6,500
apartments there.
</P>
<P>
Har Homa is a small hill situated between Jerusalem and
Bethlehem in the West Bank. The Israeli government decided to
build housing units there in March 1997, which brought the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to a prolonged deadlock.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Thursday
rapped the U.S. government for "blocking" Iraq's way toward
sincere cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors and expressed
welcome to U.N. chief Kofi Annan if he intervenes.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told a press conference here that there has been sincere
Iraqi compliance and cooperation with the U.N. over weapons
inspections over the past seven and half years.
</P>
<P>
But "The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly,
illegally by (Clinton's) government," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the other commitments of the U.N. resolution 687 have
not been fulfilled by the Security Council because of the
U.S. opposition, referring to the lifting of sanctions as
stipulated by the Paragraph 22 of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq as a "subsidiary organ" of CIA.
</P>
<P>
He expressed welcome to Annan to come to Iraq and play what he
called "productive and positive" role in defusing the crisis, as
he did in the previous Iraqi-U.N. standoff in February. "We will
cooperate with him," he said. (BC-Iraq-Aziz-UN)

ministers on Thursday called on Iraq to reverse its decision on
suspending cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, reports reaching

resolutions adopted following the Gulf crisis caused by the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and related modalities.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides Credits for Guatemala, Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday
said it agreed to provide two interest-free credits totaling 88
million U.S. dollars for Guatemala and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The first credit of about 50 million dollars will be utilized
to help finance the Second Social Investment Fund in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
This project will support to the government of Guatemala's
poverty alleviation efforts as well as its immediate emergency and
construction needs in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. This will be
achieved by financing small-scale infrastructure in the areas of
education, health, water supply, sanitation and social
infrastructure in those areas where poverty is most acute.
</P>
<P>
The second credit of 38 million dollars equivalent of early
release by the World Bank is provided for Honduras to help finance
critical needs arising from the devastating effects of Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
The credit was originally approved by the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
wing, in February 1996 and is supporting the government of
Honduras's public sector modernization program.

<HEADLINE> Ion Engine on Deep Space I Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The advanced ion engine
aboard NASA's Deep Space I, blasted off October 24, mysteriously
shut down within minutes of being turned on this week, and the
ground controllers were trying to find out what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said Thursday that the ion-propulsion
engine ran for 4.5 minutes Tuesday before turning off. Ground
controllers tried to turn it on for several times but failed.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since Deep Space I probe's launch two
and half weeks ago that controllers turned on the ion engine
being tested on the 152 million U.S. Dollar mission.
</P>
<P>
Ions are electrically charged particles. A high-speed stream
of exnon ions is supposed to provide gentle yet constant
acceleration for Deep Space I. Ion engines may provide cheaper
space flight because it requires only one-tenth the fuel of
conventional chemical engines.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges India, Pakistan to Make Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday urged both India and Pakistan to take specific steps to
curb nuclear and missile programs and "liberate themselves from
their own enmity" to bring peace to the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of diplomatic exertion on our part, on
nonproliferation or any other subject, will have much effect
unless and until India and Pakistan can liberate themselves from
their own enmity," said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
"While we and others can help through our good offices with
both, that liberation will occur only through direct, high-level,
frequent and, above all, productive dialogue between the two of
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between India and Pakistan were heightened when the
two South Asian nations raced nuclear weapons tests last May. With
the tests, both nations declared their status of nuclear weapons
states, but triggered swift international condemnation and
sweeping U.S. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Last month they resumed talks at the foreign minister level
that include discussion of Kashmir, confidence-building measures
and trading in energy.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said these are "favorable developments," but only a
"breakthrough" would enable the United States to develop broader
ties with both nations.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary of state reiterated that the United States
will never accept India and Pakistan as nuclear weapons states,
but neither will it give them "the cold shoulder until they take
that step."
</P>
<P>
The United States urged the governments of both nations to sign
the global test ban treaty, halt production of fissile material,
limit deployment of nuclear-capable missiles and aircraft, tighten
export controls and pursue India-Pakistan talks aimed at ending
long-standing frictions.
</P>
<P>
As an effort to realize the goals, Talbott held a seventh round
of talks on the issues with Pakistani negotiator Shamshad Ahmad
last week and will meet his Indian partner Jaswant Singh in Rome
next week.

<HEADLINE> RomTelecom Sells 35 Pct of Stake to Greek Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Greek OTE
telecommunications company signed Thursday a contract to buy a 35
percent stake of RomTelecom, Romania's national telecommunication
operator, which is the most important privatization for the last
nine years in the country.
</P>
<P>
Other documents, such as an operation license for both fixed
and mobile telephony and the tariff form, are to be signed within
45 days.
</P>
<P>
The Greek company was designated Saturday the winner of the bid
organized by Romania for the sale of 35 percent of the shares of
RomTelecom. It offered 675 million U.S. dollars for the 35 percent
stock of shares.
</P>
<P>
The OTE company will disburse the money within two weeks after
it gets the Competition Council's decision on the altering of the
structure of the RomTelecom monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The OTE commits itself, under the contract clinched with the
Romanian government, to set up as many as 1.4 million new
telephone lines over the next four years, which entails an
investment amounting to about 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, for the year to come, the new RomTelecom shareholder
has to replace as many as 1 million telephone lines from the
analogue network to the digital one, and to establish at least two
public telephone services in all communes with more than 1,000
inhabitants.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says He Needs to Talk to Council Members First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here on Thursday that he needs to talk to the
Security Council members first before deciding whether to go to
Baghdad to defuse the arms inspection standoff.
</P>
<P>
Annan cut off his African trip and returned to the U.N.
headquarters in New York this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning to his residence from the airport, he told
reporters that he needs to know what has happened in the past
several days.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Iraqis) have always indicated their willingness to
talk to me, but I've just got back and as I have indicated both in
Marrakesh and in other stops, I have no plans to go to Baghdad at
the moment, but I need to talk to the council members," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan would want the Iraqis to indicate that they are prepared
to return to full compliance with Security Council resolutions,
and want the council to support his mediation, his spokesman Fred
Eckhard told the daily noon briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he has got those conditions today," he said,
adding that "He does not at this time see a possible role for
himself".
</P>
<P>
"That is not to say he would not be available if the council
asks him to do something. But at the moment he has no plans to go
to Baghdad," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due to meet council members on Friday, said this
month's council president, Peter Burleigh of U.S., excluding any
council consultations on Iraq today.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is in the Iraqi court to come back into compliance,"
Burleigh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Tensions around Iraq have heightened this month, as the U.S. has
increased military presence in the Gulf area and chief U.N. arms
inspector in Iraq Richard Butler pulled out of Iraq his staff on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The incidents followed Iraq's October 31 decision to suspend
all its ties with the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament of
Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
In the latest council consultations on Wednesday, called at
Russia's request, Russia, France, China and other council members
criticized Butler for withdrawing arms inspectors from Iraq
without informing council members.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he acted on "strong recommendations" from the
United States and for the safety of the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Many council members favored a peaceful solution to the arms
inspection crisis instead of using force, calling for restrait by
all sides, according to sources close to the council.
</P>
<P>
The council voiced its strong support for Annan's statement
made earlier on the day in which he appealed to Iraq for an
immediate and unconditional resumption of cooperation with UNSCOM,
and pledged a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz who signed a memorandum
of understanding with Annan in February to avoid a war, said on
Thursday that he welcomes the U.N. Chief to go to Baghdad again.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the U.S. for blocking the Security Council's efforts
to lift sanctions against Iraq, imposed after the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it will not cooperate with UNSCOM until the
council begins to lift sanctions, which it regards as "a war by
itself".
