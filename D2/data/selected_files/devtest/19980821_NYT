   LOS ANGELES _ After U.S. raids Thursday in Afghanistan and
Sudan, security measures at Los Angeles International Airport were
tightened and police said they would monitor the local situation
for any potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conjunction with the Federal Aviation Administration, we
are tightening our security,'' LAX spokesman Scott Reed said,
advising passengers to expect some delays due to closer screening
of baggage and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officials said the city does not
see any need to activate the downtown Emergency Operation Center
but that officials will watch for any problems with local groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Los Angeles already has tightened security as the
result of past threats and will not be making any changes,
spokeswoman Julia Nagano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already use extreme caution with any of the goods that come
into the port,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the precautions being taken are similar to those that
began in 1995 with a threat from the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers should be prepared to turn on all electronic
equipment and tell security if they have something in their
carry-on bags such as toy guns or lighters that resemble guns,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Some activities at LAX were disrupted during the past several
weeks due to security concerns. Last weekend, a terminal was
evacuated when a guard spotted a gun-shaped lighter. Earlier,
operations were shut down in a terminal after a gun was discovered
in a woman's bag.

SLOPPINESS UNBECOMING TO YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (smw)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ No brooms emerged in the stands at the Metrodome
on Thursday night, even as the Minnesota Twins completed a two-game
sweep of the New York Yankees. Nobody had the gall to think a team
that almost never loses would drop back-to-back games to a
franchise locked in small-market oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened, and rather convincingly. Mike Buddie, normally
a middle reliever, started under emergency circumstances, and the
Twins knocked him around and won, 9-4, with the Yankees making a
season-high five errors.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive losses and losses of this ilk are no small matter
for the Yankees (92-32). Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   _The Yankees were swept for the first time since they lost
back-to-back games at Anaheim to open the season.
</P>
<P>
   _The consecutive losses were the Yankees' first since July
19-20, against the Toronto Blue Jays and the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   _The Yankees did not lead during Thursday's game, the first time
that has happened since June 28, when they lost, 2-1, to the Mets
at Shea Stadium. The Yankees had held a lead at some point in each
of their previous 48 games, a total no other major league team had
ever reached.
</P>
<P>
   _Minnesota, in the midst of its sixth straight losing season,
became the first team to win four games against the Yankees this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances worked in favor of the Twins Thursday. Hideki
Irabu was supposed to start for New York, but could not because he
bruised his left instep in a game last weekend. Manager Joe Torre
intended to use Ramiro Mendoza, but Mendoza came down with what the
Yankees believe is a minor case of tendinitis in his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   So Torre turned to Buddie. In a perfect world _ the world in
which the Yankees have existed most of this season _ Buddie would
have pitched six solid innings and given the Yankees a chance to
win while saving the bullpen from extraordinary stress.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately could do neither.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
He had good stuff, and yet as his pitch count mounted into a range
Buddie does not usually approach, 50 pitches and higher, the Twins
began hitting him hard.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer banged a home run in the Minnesota second, giving the
Twins a 1-0 lead. Tino Martinez tied the score in the fourth with a
run-scoring single off Frank Rodriguez (3-2), but Rodriguez escaped
further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins put Buddie away in the fourth and fifth innings,
scoring two runs in the fourth (helped by a catcher's interference
call the Yankees argued vehemently) and a four-run burst in the
fifth. When Marty Cordova singled home Brent Gates with one out in
the fifth, Torre had to call on Graeme Lloyd, who usually works to
one or two batters.
</P>
<P>
   As the Twins continued to score against Lloyd, the Yankees
abandoned the habits they have been admired for this year. Lloyd
turned to make a pickoff throw to second, and when he tried to stop
himself, the ball squirted out of his left hand and into right
field. A ground ball skipped under the glove of Martinez at first
base, another went past Scott Brosius at third.
</P>
<P>
   When Todd Walker banged a ball off the right-field wall in the
seventh, Paul O'Neill fumbled the ricochet and then haphazardly
tossed the ball toward the infield as Walker took third.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd had to pitch one and two-thirds innings and unless the
Yankees promote a pitcher from Class AAA, they will begin a
three-game series in Texas Friday night with just two rested
relievers, Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera, and their middle relief
exhausted.  &QL; 
INSIDE PITCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bon Tewksbury was a mostly journeyman minor league pitcher
before making a big-league career for himself in St. Louis, where
Joe Torre was manager at the time and where Torre always offered
this philosophy for Tewksbury: There's nothing like being a winning
pitcher yesterday. Tewksbury, now with the Minnesota Twins, found
the statement so profound that he had it printed on T-shirts. And
earlier this year, when the Twins were leaving Cleveland just as
the Yankees arrived, Tewksbury left a note for Torre, now the
manager of a team challenging history. Tewksbury wrote, ``There's
nothing like being a winning manager yesterday _ and the day before
that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day
before that . . .''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-U.S. (Washington) _ Dozens of U.S. cruise missiles struck
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan on Thursday in what President
Clinton described as an act of self-defense against imminent
terrorist plots and of fearsome retribution for the bombings of
U.S. embassies in East Africa two weeks ago. By James Bennet. WITH
PHOTO (NYT29) and MAPS.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-BINLADEN (Washington) _ How Osama bin Laden, the youngest
son of a construction magnate from Yemen, became the world's most
feared sponsor of terrorism. The religious and ideological roots of
his rage lie in the 1980s, when he worked side by side with the CIA
backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his
fellow holy warriors went to work on the U.S. By Tim Weiner. WITH
MAP.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-CONGRESS (Washington) _ A cherished axiom of U.S.
diplomacy is that the opposition party supports the president when
missiles are flying. Thursday it worked, more or less. Most
congressional leaders, from Speaker Newt Gingrich to such reliable
Clinton critics as Sen. Jesse Helms, rallied around the
commander-in-chief. But in the surreal and cinematic atmosphere
that suffused Washington this week, a handful of voices on Capitol
Hill cried foul. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-ASSESS (Undated) _ In the war against terrorism,
experience suggests that any operation, whether an assassination or
the sort of strike launched by the United States, has the quality
of damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-SECURITY (Washington) _ The United States on Thursday
issued a new worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic
personnel ``to exercise much greater caution than usual'' following
U.S. military strikes against suspected terrorist targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MILITARY (Washington) _ The U.S. attacked targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan with roughly 70 cruise missiles fired
from Navy ships in the Arabian and Red Seas timed to strike their
targets simultaneously, senior administration and military
officials said.The missiles struck at precisely 1:30 p.m. ET, after
dark settled over their targets, themselves more than 2,500 miles
apart, the officials said. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ Arrests in Albania show links to the
African embassy bombings: In a series of lightning raids with the
Albanian secret police this summer, American intelligence agents
appear to have thwarted a bomb plot against the American Embassy
here. They also seem to have broken up a ring of Egyptian Islamic
terrorists using this nation's anarchy to set up a base. By John
Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-EVIDENCE (Washington) _ President Clinton ordered strikes
on terrorist-linked facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan after
obtaining credible evidence that leading members of the
international terrorist network sponsored by Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden, who U.S. officials believe was behind the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa, would be gathering Thursday at a
terrorist camp in Afghanistan to plan further attacks against the
U.S. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-BINLADEN (Washington) _ How Osama bin Laden, the youngest
son of a construction magnate from Yemen, became the world's most
feared sponsor of terrorism. The religious and ideological roots of
his rage lie in the 1980s, when he worked side by side with the CIA
backing the Afghan rebels. When that battle was over, he and his
fellow holy warriors _ having defeated the British in the 19th
century and the Soviets in the 20th _ went to work on the United
States. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-SUDAN (Nairobi) _ U.S.-Sudanese tensions finally erupt
into open warfare. The air strike against a drug factory in Sudan
on Thursday marked the first act of open warfare in a
long-simmering cold war between the U.S. and the Islamic regime in
Khartoum. By James C. McKinley. WITH MAP.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MEDIA (Undated) _ After a week of what felt like nonstop
talk about sex, ties and audiotape involving President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, television screens were overtaken Thursday by news
of a different shock value. By Lawrie Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-MIDEAST-REACT (Jerusalem) _ Israel was quick to
congratulate the U.S. night for its missile attacks on suspected
terrorist bases, but the early reaction from many other governments
in the Middle East was a notable silence. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair was alone among European leaders in expressing strong
support. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-WAG (New York) _ Is life imitating art? `Wag the Dog'
springs to many minds. Beginning with a reporter's question early
Thursday afternoon to Defense Secretary Cohen about the film ``Wag
the Dog,'' we cast a wide net in search of reaction. By Frank
Bruni. WITH PHOTO (NYT28)
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-GAS (Undted) _ VX, the chemical nerve agent that the U.S.
alleges Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve
agents known, especially when applied to the skin. A 10 mg drop on
the skin can kill an adult in 15 minutes. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK-IMMIG (New York) _ In the metropolitan region, immigrants
from the Sudan and Afghanistan reacted to bombings by the U.S. on
their respective homelands with surprise, horror and skepticism. By
David W. Chen.

   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ In her second and probably final
appearance before a grand jury here, Monica Lewinsky offered more
specifics about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and
the gifts he gave her as prosecutors sought to draw distinctions
between her testimony and that of the president only three days
ago. By Don Van Natta Jr. and Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDRAISING-GORE (Washington) _ The notes of a senior aide say
that at a November 1995 White House meeting where the distinction
between hard and soft money was apparently discussed, Vice
President Al Gore told the others present to ``count me in'' on
making fund-raising telephone calls that are now the subject of a
Justice Department review on whether to seek the appointment of an
independent prosecutor. By David Johnston. WITH PHOTO (NYT26)
</P>
<P>
   FUNDRAISING-GINGRICH (Washington) _ In 1996, Democratic attacks
on House Spea Newt Gingrich were not a rousing success in much of
the country. But in the left-leaning Northeast, they were
instrumental in defeating six Republican members of Congress. So it
is one of this year's political oddities that across the Northeast,
Republicans are unrepentantly embracing Gingrich, even as Democrats
prepare to bash them for it and opinion polls show that the speaker
remains about as popular up north as Sherman is down South. By
James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   UNABOMBER-REWARD (Washington) _ David Kaczynski and his wife
have been given a $1 million reward from the Justice Department for
turning in David's older brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber. By
Jmes Brooke.

<P>
   DENVER-BY-THE-SEA (Denver, Colo.) _ Denver, landlocked and 1,000
road miles from the nearest ocean, has always suffered from a mild,
municipal inferiority complex. Yes, it is the gateway to some of
the nation's most dramatic mountains, but where's the beach? This
year, the Mile High City is fighting back against geographic
determinism with indoor sand volleyball, Water Worlds and a giant
new Aquarium full of tropical fish. By James Brooke. WITH PHOTOS

</P>
<P>
   MISS-KLAN-TRIAL (Hattiesburg, Miss.) _ Spectators here at the
trial of a former Klansman accused of ordering the murder of a
respected civil rights leader were surprised, to say the least,
when another former Klansman described the White Knights of the KKK
of Mississippi as a benevolent organization that existed to give
money to the rural poor and pass out fruit baskets at Christmas. By
Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-1918-FLU (Spitsbergen, Norway) _ Six young coal miners,
buried in permafrost since falling victim to the Spanish flu of
1918, are being carefully exhumed this week. Scientists plan to
take ``core samples'' from the bodies, in hope of building a
genetic profile of the mysterious virus that killed 20 million to
40 million people before vanishing. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   VIAGRA-WARNING (Undated) _ The American College of Cardiology
issues a report warning that Viagra poses a risk to patient groups
not described on the drug's label. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   MILLION-YOUTH-MARCH (New York) _ The organizers of a planned
Million Youth March sued the city in federal court Thursday, saying
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's refusal to grant them a permit to
hold the event in Harlem next month was both unconstitutional and
reflective of the mayor's discriminatory treatment of the city's
black residents. By Abby Goodnough. WITH PHOTO (NYT24).

PUDGE WILL PLAY ... AND PLAY ... AND PLAY 
(UPDATES WITH RODRIGUEZ HITTING HOME RUN)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ At this point in the baseball season, even
those of us who consider Pudge Rodriguez worthy of his $8 million
paycheck, are forced to register a disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez is overworked, he does become overpaid. Army
mules couldn't carry Pudge's load. And neither can Pudge. His
dedication is commendable, but not baseball profitable for either
Rodriguez or the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   No calendar is necessary at The Ballpark in Arlington. For any
Rangers' fan, the passage of spring and summer months can be
clearly marked by charting Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   April, May and June _ going so good like we knew he would. The
bat and step are lively; the arm is forever deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Early July brings the All-Star Game. They couldn't play that
thing without Pudge. He's as automatic at the ballot box as a South
American dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, here comes the season's second half, bringing
with it a slump. July doesn't lie. There are telltale signs that
the load becomes heavier.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the elephant shows up, looking for a ride. And Pudge
can't seem to get the big fellow off his back or his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the steady fade of statistical numbers tells us September
is near.
</P>
<P>
   This is simply how Pudge Rodriguez's great career in Arlington
is defined. Every season it happens with the same certainty.
Managers may come and go, but the workload doesn't change, nor does
Rodriguez's steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   Pudge, for his part, resists rest, even if catcher is the most
demanding position both physically and mentally. And his immense
talent as a hitter is best illustrated by this being the fourth
consecutive season his average will be better than .300.
</P>
<P>
   But what could his average and his run production be if
Rodriguez didn't hit 40 points less for his career after the
All-Star break, and if his runs batted in didn't fall dramatically
in the same span? Declines in both have already begun this season,
along with a defensive slide.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a surge the last two nights against Cleveland, Pudge
is only a .260 hitter since last July, a long way from his .350
average at the All-Star break. But he finally went deep last night,
causing a divot in Greene's Hill with a mighty home-run blast to
center. Thus ended a career-high stretch of 68 games without a
homer. And from one run batted in during 11 games, Pudge has three
in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's an improvement, but overall the familiar pattern still
sticks. Which brings up another great idea from me, although not
exactly original.
</P>
<P>
   Would somebody please rest this guy?
</P>
<P>
   And right now would not be too late to start, although Pudge
taking off one game a week behind the plate starting back in April
seemed the best plan.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Johnny Oates thinks often over the course of a season about
doing just that, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day's lineup I write down the night before and leave
it on my desk,'' said Oates. ``I'll have Pudge not playing. I'll go
home, get to thinking about it, and then the same thing usually
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates returns to the ballpark the next afternoon, tears up his
lineup card, and makes a new one with Rodriguez catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge is a hard guy to leave out because of everything he can
do, and because there's Pudge's attitude to also consider,'' said
Oates. ``Ivan Rodriguez is a real unique bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my business, we've got guys you have to hit with a 2-by-4
to get them to play every day. But with Pudge, you have to use a
2-by-6 to get him out of the lineup. I love him for that, but I
also understand the wear and tear process he puts himself
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular rest is obviously not a subject Rodriguez wants to
discuss. ``If they decide to do that, I'd take the rest,'' Pudge
said, shrugging, before last night's game. This was his 106th start
of the season behind the plate, an American League high. Last
season he led the majors in games caught with 139.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired because I try to play the game hard,'' added
Rodriguez. ``What I do, however, is come to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, a former catcher, believes that as long as Pudge is at
the position, his offensive numbers will slide in the second half,
even with spotted rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental grind gets you as much as the physical grind,'' he
said. ``Who is to say his numbers would be any better? A lot of
good catchers have eventually been moved to other positions just to
give them offensive relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Oates admits ``it's a fight'' to convince Rodriguez to
take a rare off day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing will change, despite what the career
offensive numbers show. And particularly not this weekend, with the
Yankees in town and Pudge also showing sudden signs of swinging a
better bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, however, picture Pudge as a third baseman,'' added
Oates. ``The quick hands and feet, the arm ... think about that and
think about what he'd hit without the burden of catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Only then apparently could Rodriguez's July and August follow
his April-May-and-June pattern.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of U.S. cruise missiles struck targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan on Thursday in what President Clinton
described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist
plots and of retribution for the bombings of U.S. embassies in East
Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were launched from ships in the Arabian and Red Seas
at dusk. It was not immediately clear whether the raids were a
military success. Pentagon officials said that no Americans died
but that they had no immediate estimate of other casualties or
damage.
</P>
<P>
   With about 75 missiles timed to explode simultaneously in
unsuspecting countries on two continents, the operation was the
most formidable U.S. military assault ever against a private
sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were identified by Pentagon officials as an
extensive terrorism training complex in Afghanistan, 94 miles south
of Kabul, and a factory for the building blocks of chemical weapons
near Khartoum, the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security team linked both sites to
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire tied by U.S.
intelligence to the twin bombings on Aug. 7 in Kenya and Tanzania.
The bombings killed 12 Americans and nearly 300 Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who is in Afghanistan, apparently survived the
attack, which officials insisted was not aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear,''
Clinton said in an address from the Oval Office. ``There are no
expendable American targets. There will be no sanctuary for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for ordering the strikes without
permission from Afghanistan or the Sudan, saying, ``Countries that
persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stone-faced appearance marked his emergence from two
days of shelter from a howling political storm. He returned to the
White House on Thursday afternoon from vacation on Martha's
Vineyard, where he was trying to repair family ties damaged by his
admission Monday of an intimate relationship with a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president reappeared to describe an operation he had been
planning secretly for more than a week, even as he was meeting with
his lawyers to prepare a legal and political defense of himself and
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, President Omar el-Bashir called on his people to
protest the attack, saying on television, ``Sudanese people will
defend themselves.'' Earlier, Information Minister Ghazi
Salah-Eddin said the attack on what the Sudanese call a
pharmaceutical plant was ``a criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan, Mullah
Mohammad Omar, condemned the bombings, saying they showed an
``enmity'' for the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the strikes were intended
to ``cause sufficient damage to disrupt them for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented several reasons for the decision to act
swiftly and forcefully, rather than to punish bin Laden through the
means of diplomacy and law. Repeatedly he said bin Laden presented
an imminent threat, quoting his pledge this week to wage a war in
which Americans were ``all targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that ``key terrorist leaders'' were believed to be
gathering on Thursday at the compound in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ``convincing'' intelligence that bin Laden's
terrorist network was behind the embassy bombings. And he accused
groups tied to bin Laden of a host of murderous attacks and foiled
plots like killing international peacekeepers in Somalia and
planning to assassinate the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Republican leadership rallied to support the
raids, some members of Congress reacted suspiciously, noting that
the action followed by three days Clinton's acknowledgment to the
public and a grand jury of his relationship with former intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials scorned talk of a connection.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's motorcade abruptly left the borrowed estate where
he was secluded with his wife and daughter, reporters and
photographers who were idling at the entrance assumed that he was
going to play golf. Instead Clinton made a brief dramatic
appearance to announce the strikes. Clinton flew to Washington for
his Oval Office address as Ms. Lewinsky was testifying for a second
time before the grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the planning for the mission began
nine days ago, shortly after the bombings. Clinton was first
informed of the planning in the White House situation room Aug. 12,
and on Aug. 14 gave tentative approval for a mission.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the final go-ahead in a telephone conversation at 3 a.m.
Thursday morning with National Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials denied any plan to assassinate bin Laden,
saying they intended only to damage his network.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether bin Laden was a legitimate military target, Cohen
said, ``To the extent that he or his organization have declared war
upon the United States or our interests, then he certainly is
engaged in an act of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The missiles were timed to hit at 1:30 Thursday afternoon
Eastern daylight time, or 7:30 in the evening in the Sudan and 10
at night in Afghanistan. The twin attacks provided a certain
symmetry to the bombings in East Africa. Though seas apart, the
targets share a connection to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who moved to Afghanistan two years ago from the
Sudan, has continued to support the Sudanese military-industrial
complex, which operates the Al-Shifa factory that was bombed
Thursday. That factory, which has been said to manufacture
pharmaceuticals, in fact makes the components for VX gas and other
chemical weapons, the Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said bin Laden's network had ``been actively seeking to acquire
weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons for use
against U.S. citizens and our interests around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The target in Afghanistan was described as a vast compound
composed of a base camp, a support complex and four training camps
for teaching terrorists to plan attacks and use weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the site had been used to train ``literally
thousands of terrorists from around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States obtained the permission of Pakistan to send
missiles over its territory into Afghanistan, but evidently alerted
none of its major allies except the British. The president made a
round of telephone calls to foreign leaders after his
seven-and-a-half-minute speech at 5:30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The links between bin Laden and the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania were established by intelligence networks rather than by
the inquiry at the bombing sites led by the FBI, according to
law-enforcement officials. The officials said the intelligence
included statements that implicated bin Laden by one suspect,
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was apprehended in Pakistan and is now
being held in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh told Pakistani authorities after his arrest Aug. 7, the day
of the bombing, that he was a disciple of bin Laden. He also said
he was an engineer who had helped build the Nairobi bomb, U.S.
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders were briefed about the planned raid
Wednesday night and Thursday morning. For the most part, Republican
leaders praised Clinton's decision and urged more aggressive action
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed firm support, and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, said, ``Our response appears to be
appropriate and just.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more critical. Accusing Clinton of ``lies and deceit
and manipulations and deceptions,'' Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said
the president's record ``raises into doubt everything he does and
everything he says, and maybe even everything he doesn't do and
doesn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials dismissed such skepticism. Cohen said:
``The only motivation driving this action Thursday was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities. That is the sole motivation. No other consideration has
been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   After the strikes Cohen ordered all military bases to increase
their states of alert. The United States on Thursday issued a new
worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel ``to
exercise much greater caution than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton warned Americans that the strike would by
no means put an end to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a long, ongoing struggle,'' he said. ``America is
and will remain a target of terrorists.''

NETS PRESIDENT HINTS AGAIN AT LEAVING MEADOWLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Watching John Calipari and his coaching staff
conduct a basketball clinic at the Newark Boys and Girls Club on
Thursday, New Jersey Nets president Michael Rowe intimated that his
team might soon be doing business again in this city _ for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation to the Meadowlands Arena is tough, and the
arena itself has some hospitality and luxury seating problems,''
said Rowe, speaking softly beneath the sounds of screeching
sneakers. ``It was state of the art when it was built, but it's not
now.''
</P>
<P>
   With new ownership nearly in place and the Nets seeking to
expand their fan base in northern New Jersey with a more
commuter-friendly home, team officials are contemplating a move out
of the Meadowlands Sports Complex to a proposed site in Newark. The
Nets have played in the Meadowlands since the 1981-82 season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets' lease at Continental Arena expires in 2030,
there are windows to escape in 2000 and 2004, and Thursday, Rowe
sounded like a man talking from the exit ramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the New Jersey Nets, we've assumed that somehow,
mysteriously, we were going to reach all 567 communities in the
State of New Jersey,'' Rowe said, ``and that they would
overwhelmingly support us, but we've spread ourselves too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Mass transit is critical, we believe, to our future
growth. The Meadowlands does not have mass transit capabilities at
this particular point. The frequency of bus trips to the complex is
not great, and the rail is not great. Our existing ownership and
our prospective ownership believe that any new arena has to have
mass transit as a vital link to it _ and we think it's easier to
build an arena where there is mass transit than to encourage trains
to come to an empty parking lot right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, who said Thursday that he and his coaching staff were
planning for the start of a full season despite the current
National Basketball Association lockout, will follow the bouncing
ball wherever it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on board wherever they want to play,'' Calipari said. ``I
want to coach this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said that the NBA could announce the Nets' newly formed
ownership team by Sept. 30 and that ``the clock was already
ticking'' on a ``12-month window'' in which the Nets would decide
whether to leave the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were the Paterson Nets or the Hackensack Nets or the
Newark Nets,'' Rowe said, ``it would be a lot easier for us to get
a lot more attention and to do a lot more good in a particular
community.'' &QL;

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Enduring the jab of a syringe was a small
sacrifice for Jeff Linden, considering he was about to become the
first Californian to receive a new HIV vaccine that could halt the
AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   So despite his dread of needles, Linden was inoculated Thursday
with the first preventive vaccine to reach the final stage of
testing before the Food and Drug Administration will consider
approving it for widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can do a little to help, that's important for me,'' said
Linden, a 33-year-old West Hollywood man. ``I'm hoping it will find
a cure and put an end to this epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, AIDSVAX, is being tested on uninfected volunteers
across North America in a three-year clinical study that began in
June. Developed by South San Francisco-based VaxGen Inc., the
vaccine is the first of its kind to reach Phase III human clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a monumental trial, we're very, very excited to be
part of it,'' said Dr. Stephen J. Brown, director of clinical
research at AIDS ReSEARCH Alliance in West Hollywood where Linden
was inoculated.
</P>
<P>
   AIDSVAX is not a treatment for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, which
causes AIDS. The vaccine is a genetically engineered version of a
protein on the surface of the virus, not a live, weakened virus, so
it is not possible to contract HIV or AIDS, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Like other vaccines, AIDSVAX is designed to train the human
body's immune system by creating antibodies to protect itself
against viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   AIDSVAX already has been given to more than 1,200 people in
earlier-stage trials.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists remain hopeful that the vaccine will work. But
some, including Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, are skeptical about the vaccine's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may learn something in administering an HIV trial and some
peripheral (information), but I think the study is very unlikely
going to result in a successful vaccine,'' said Weinstein, whose
Los Angeles organization is the largest HIV medical services
provider in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein believes that studies have shown a vaccine made from a
live, weakened virus will be more effective. However, that type of
vaccine always carries with it the risk of infecting the person it
is supposed to be protecting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In studies of AIDSVAX, preliminary evidence using chimpanzees
has shown that the vaccine protected them against large doses of
HIV that should have infected them, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the protection seen in chimpanzees will translate
into human protection,'' said Brown, whose nonprofit alliance is
dedicated to finding and developing treatment for HIV and AIDS, and
a vaccine to prevent new infections.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are hoping to find at least 150 uninfected
volunteers in Los Angeles, primarily gay men and women with
HIV-positive partners. Those people are at risk of contracting the
virus, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are expecting an overwhelming number of volunteers and
will not turn anyone away for reasons other than ineligibility,
such as not meeting the criteria of being at-risk for HIV, said
Nicole Lynch, a spokeswoman for the AIDS ReSEARCH Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 5,000 volunteers will take part from as many as 50
sites across North America, including Philadelphia, St. Louis,
Washington, D.C., Denver and others that have not been selected
yet.
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to volunteer for the study, call the
AIDS ReSEARCH Alliance at (310) 358-2430.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will give the vaccine to two-thirds of the volunteers,
while the remaining third will receive a placebo, an injection that
doesn't contain the vaccine. Neither the doctors nor the volunteers
will know which injection they receive, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of three years, the volunteers will receive seven
injections of the vaccine along with counseling on how to avoid HIV
infection and risky behavior. However, researchers expect a portion
of the volunteers will become infected with HIV in the hopes the
vaccine will protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``By comparing the rate of infection of those with the vaccine
to the rate of infection of those with the placebo, we can tell to
what extent the vaccine reduced the risk of getting infected,''
said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects include a slight fever, sore arms, fatigue and
muscle aches. For Linden, the side effects were his biggest worry,
but still it didn't deter him from volunteering, especially after
he watched his friends suffer as they dealt with the physical toll
of AIDS and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about giving back to people,'' said Linden, who works in
advertising for a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that his actions might one day be historic hadn't
crossed Linden's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming to think about,'' said Linden. ``It's being
so close to so many people who have the disease and seeing what
they go through. ... I just can do what I can do right now. And
that's all.'' &QL;

RANGERS PUT THE PINCH ON INDIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates removed center
fielder Tom Goodwin for a pinch hitter during the bottom of the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove forced the move by summoning
left-hander Tom Martin from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Oates countered with reserve outfielder Roberto Kelly from the
bench, and the right-handed batter deposited Martin's 3-2 pitch
into Greene's Hill for a game-clinching, three-run homer during the
Rangers' 8-2 victory last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a little bit of breathing time for the first time
since Saturday,'' Oates said of the 407-foot blast that gave the
Rangers a 6-1 advantage. ``That was a good pass at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph gave the Rangers a sweep of their two-game series
with the Central Division's best and ensured that the American
League West-leading Angels will enter tonight's games with no more
than 11/2-game advantage in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre (3-1) earned the victory despite
his failure to complete the sixth inning for the third time in four
starts with the Rangers, but left-hander Eric Gunderson and
right-hander Danny Patterson gave the Rangers 32/3 scoreless
innings to preserve the triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing good baseball,'' said Patterson, who
recorded four strikeouts during 22/3 scoreless innings. ``I don't
know if we haven't been getting any breaks, but we've been playing
against some tough teams. To come home and take two from Cleveland
picks us up and gives us a little momentum going into our series
with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin vs. Kelly _ a mismatch on paper _ played true to form.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly stepped into the batter's box hitting .349 with six home
runs and 17 runs batted in during 106 previous at-bats this season
against left-handers. Martin allowed right-handed hitters a .343
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove summoned Martin after an infield single by shortstop
Royce Clayton advanced designated hitter Mike Simms to second with
one out. Oates removed the left-handed hitting Goodwin for a
right-handed batter, and Kelly responded with his first home run of
his career as a pinch hitter. His 12 home runs rank second only to
Simms' 14 among major-league players with 200 or fewer at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good hitter,'' said right fielder Juan Gonzalez, whose
second-inning, solo home run off right-hander Dave Burba (10-9)
gave the Rangers the early lead. ``This is one of the best benches
in the league. The guys there have great numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre departed with a 3-1 lead, but Gunderson inherited a
bases-loaded jam with only one out. The left-hander kept the damage
to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Indians designated hitter David Justice scored on the ground
ball off the bat of center fielder Kenny Lofton, but shortstop
Royce Clayton retired Omar Vizquel on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I come in, it's crucial _ especially 3-1 with the
bases loaded,'' Gunderson said. ``I was just looking to get a
ground ball hit into the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson then retired second baseman Torey Lovullo on strikes
with a 3-2 changeup to terminate the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of nerves to throw a changeup there, and
Lovullo didn't have a chance against it,'' Oates said. ``That's a
nice pitch to have in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson retired left fielder Brian Giles for the first out of
the seventh inning before giving way to Patterson, who recorded his
second save.

THOMAS-ROBERT AMES, 68, EXPERT ON DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Thomas-Robert Ames, a New York educator and
nationally known authority on the rehabilitation of the mentally
retarded and disabled, died Aug. 17 at Cabrini Medical Center in
Manhattan. He was 68 and lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said the YAI/National Institute
for People with Disabilities. At his death, Ames was vice chairman
of the board of the Manhattan-based rehabilitation agency.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit YAI/National Institute, an outgrowth of the Young
Adult Institute, operates 200 programs in New York City and state
on an annual budget of $100 million. Its staff of more than 2,000
serves more than 12,000 individuals and their families. The agency
provides day programs, group residences, counseling, help with
employment, crisis intervention and a help line, among other
services. Ames was credited with creating many of its innovative,
nationally noted approaches, particularly its sexuality training
and AIDS education programs, subjects that had previously received
little attention.
</P>
<P>
   He was a past president of the Coalition on Sexuality and
Disability, and had retired recently from the Department of Social
Services at CUNY's Manhattan Community College after 28 years on
the faculty. He was in private practice as a consultant,
psychotherapist and sexuality educator and therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Ames joined the Young Adult Institute in 1966, was its executive
director from 1967 to 1971, and was a board member for more than 20
years. He served Mayor John Lindsay as a member of the Committee on
Mental Retardation, helping to write guidelines for dealing with
the needs of people with developmental problems after the closing
of Willowbrook State Hospital in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning when sexuality was not talked about,
understood, and restricted among the mentally retarded and other
developmentally disabled individuals, Bob broke the barrier to say
that these people have sexual needs and sexual rights,'' Harold
Michal-Smith, past president of the American Association of Mental
Retardation, said this week.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Daytona Beach, Fla., Thomas-Robert Ames graduated
from the University of Florida with a degree in social sciences,
studied theology at General Theological Seminary in New York City,
and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in rehabilitation
counseling at New York University's School of Education. He also
trained in psychotherapy and sex therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Ames is survived by his mother, Helen-Margarett Reed Ames of
Daytona Beach, Fla., and a brother, Dr. Richard K. Ames of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.

PLAN FOR TRACK FROM STATEN ISLAND TO N.J. IS IMPERILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A half-finished freight rail link between Staten
Island and New Jersey was dealt a setback Thursday when an official
in Union County, N.J., moved to pull out of the joint project,
saying that changes in the plan meant that New York City now stood
to reap nearly all the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The move outraged the Giuliani administration, which with the
help of federal money has rebuilt tracks and a bridge across the
Arthur Kill that would give New York City freight direct access to
the world west of the Hudson for the first time in nearly a decade.
The New Jersey section of the project, a five-mile link to
Conrail's main north-south tracks, is still being designed. One New
York official said the project was now a ``bridge to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Union County Manager Michael Lapolla recommended Thursday that
the county's Board of Freeholders withdraw from the project at the
next board meeting. He said that the project originally called for
the operator to provide local freight rail service for businesses
in New Jersey towns. Now, he said, Norfolk Southern/CSX, the
freight giant recently appointed to operate the rail link, planned
to use the New Jersey part of the track solely as a means to take
freight from Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island to
Conrail's Lehigh Valley line, on larger trains than were originally
contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is
coordinating the project, and environmental groups that have
supported it criticized Lapolla, saying he was overlooking an
important benefit of the project: It would get thousands of trucks
off Union County's congested roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the tremendous regional benefits for both New York
and New Jersey, it would be shortsighted if this project did not
move forward,'' said Christopher Ward, the Port Authority's chief
of planning and external affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state of New Jersey owns the track on the New
Jersey side and could complete the link without Union County's
approval, state transportation officials said they would not
interfere.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, New Jersey, the federal government and the Port
Authority have provided $30 million for the link.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic
Development Corp., the agency in charge of New York's part of the
project, said he hoped the Board of Freeholders would defy Lapolla
at its meeting on Aug. 27. But the nine freeholders tend to go
along with the county government, and Lapolla said he consulted
them before making his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed project began in 1994. On the Staten Island side,
New York City has bought and rebuilt 15 miles of track on the north
shore of Staten Island and refurbished the 39-year-old Arthur Kill
Lift Bridge, which has a 500-foot-long span that can be raised 100
feet to let ships pass through. The bridge has not been used since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rail access, Ward said, is crucial to the future of the Howland
Hook Terminal, near the base of the bridge, which was reopened in
1996. Howland Hook handles about 65,000 freight containers a year,
less than 5 percent of the total volume of the Port of New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey section of the project runs west though
Elizabeth, Linden, Roselle and Cranford before linking up with the
Conrail's Lehigh Valley line, one of the main freight lines in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   As originally conceived, Lapolla said _ and state and Port
Authority officials agree _ the operator of the line would have
been a small freight carrier that would offer freight service to
industries along the line and along another stretch of track west
of the Lehigh Valley line. This, Lapolla said, would have allowed
the county to market and redevelop several vacant industrial
parcels and ``brownfields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of us being involved in this was to redevelop
abandoned, underutilized properties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Norfolk Southern and CSX reached an agreement to take
over Conrail's operations earlier this year, the conglomerate,
which is the largest freight carrier east of the Mississippi,
expressed an interest in operating the line itself.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the agencies involved in the project _ including Union
County _ appointed Norfolk Southern/CSX to run the line. But at a
meeting last month, Lapolla said, Norfolk Southern/CSX officials
told him they did not intend to offer local service immediately and
instead planned to upgrade the track to run bigger, heavier trains
from Howland Hook on Staten Island. Norfolk Southern/CSX officials
would not comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lapolla blamed the Port Authority for failing to insure that the
county got the rail access it was offered. He called the situation
``another example of the county getting the short end of the
stick'' from the authority, which owns more than 2,000 acres there,
mostly at Port Elizabeth and Newark International Airport. For
years, Union County and Elizabeth have been trying to get the Port
Authority to increase the $1.7 million a year it pays in lieu of
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possibilities for moving freight off Staten
Island by rail. The Port Authority has proposed building a
connection from the New Jersey side of the Arthur Kill Lift Bridge
to existing freight tracks on the Chemical Coast line, which runs
through a stretch of refineries along Union County's waterfront.
But that link is opposed by the Elizabeth Mayor J. Christian
Bollwage. And even if it is approved, it is about a year behind the
other link, Ward of the Port Authority said.

ONLY THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES CAN STOP GIANTS AND JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A few days ago, New York Giants
defensive lineman Keith Hamilton, one of the key players on the
best young defense in pro football, did a dual no-no. First, he
missed a scheduled appointment with team trainers for treatment on
a leg injury. That amounted to a fine of more than $1,000. Then he
was late for a meeting. The coaches were not happy, so after
scolding Hamilton, he was fined again.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he paid thousands of dollars in fines within hours.
</P>
<P>
   This early in the season, nothing should be blown out of
proportion, especially with Hamilton, usually a solid football
citizen. Besides, it's not as if he cut a teammate with scissors
(oops, wrong team). But for a Giants team that played so well last
season but faces a much tougher challenge _ going from division
champion to advancing deep in the playoffs _ Hamilton's episode is
still a small danger sign.
</P>
<P>
   It leads to this question: Do the Giants players, especially key
ones like Hamilton, realize the sacrifices it will take to win the
division again, and then make a run at the conference title?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the New York Jets. Last week against the
Baltimore Ravens, they looked like a team on the bottom, not a team
some have picked to win the American Conference East. After the
game, many players had cleared out and were on their way home
before the vocal cords of coach Bill Parcells stopped vibrating in
the locker room. One of the first players to leave was wide
receiver Wayne Chrebet, who looked terrible against Baltimore.
Parcells knew it, which is why this week during an intense practice
he chewed out Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' coach seemed to be asking Chrebet and his teammates
the same question that hopefully Giants players have asked
themselves: Do you realize the high price it will take to build on
last year's solid season?
</P>
<P>
   Many expect either the Giants or the Jets to take a step back
from last season's success because each team will play a tougher
schedule. But that doesn't have to happen. The Giants and the Jets
have assembled enough talent to make the playoffs. The only thing
that will stop them is the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the San Francisco 49ers are successful every
year is because players such as Jerry Rice and Steve Young seldom
miss meetings or treatment sessions. The Denver quarterback John
Elway studies year round. Wide receiver Cris Carter takes part in
the Minnesota Vikings' off-season program every year _ and then
does his own intense workouts. His work ethic and professionalism
set the tone for the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   More than the usual episodes of sloppy play or arrogance can
lead to disaster and can prevent a team from making that gigantic
step from good to great, from division winner to conference
champion. Giants coach Jim Fassel is one of the best young coaches
in the game _ he may be the best _ and has already stressed to the
team a number of times that the players must almost be perfect to
better last season's 10-5-1 record. Parcells has done the same with
his team, which went from 1-15 in 1996 to 9-7 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is only so much a coach can do. He can prepare the
players, warn them, scream at them, fine them, whatever it takes to
get their attention. But in the end, much of what happens is on the
shoulders of the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are some Giants who a coach can simply turn on and watch
them go. Linebacker Jessie Armstead, defensive lineman Michael
Strahan and fullback Charles Way are true pros. On the Jets,
offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott and linebacker Pepper Johnson are
two of the harder working players in the league.
</P>
<P>
   What both teams have to worry about is the players whose
attitudes act like an anchor, weighing the team down. Luckily for
the Giants, they have many more men on their roster like Sam
Garnes, a talented and hard working safety, than they do in Tito
Wooten. Wooten has been able to fool some who have bought into his
St. Tito act, but there is no question he is still the same old
cocky Wooten. He missed much of the off-season workout program. In
training camp, he has been mouthing off to some of the Giants
coaches, once in full view of a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wooten has a history of violence against women, he was
told by the team to see a therapist, according to several of his
teammates. But he has missed some of those sessions, the players
said. These are the kinds of things that great players don't do.
And please don't blame Wooten's recent actions on management or the
coaches or anyone else; it is all on Wooten.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten is a game breaker, but talent alone doesn't win
championships. Mental discipline and work ethic do. Great teams
know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win,'' Armstead said. ``But how much we win depends on
the players and how hard we work.''

FERRARO TURNS TESTY WITH TV INTERVIEWER OVER REPEATED REQUESTS TO
DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A routine television interview with Geraldine Ferraro
turned into an on- and off-air scrap Thursday as her host
repeatedly pressed Ferraro about why she was declining invitations
to debate in the Senate Democratic primary race.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, flustered and angry, attacked her questioner, Marcia
Kramer of WCBS-TV, as unprofessional and sarcastically suggested
that she was on the payroll of one of Ferraro's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   With a control room full of technicians, producers and reporters
watching, Ferraro turned increasingly tense as Ms. Kramer pressed
the candidate on why she had declined several invitations to debate
her two major Democratic rivals, Mark Green and Charles Schumer.
The candidates have appeared in two public forums and are not
scheduled to do so again until the Sunday before the Sept. 15
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've debated the other two people,'' Ferraro said as the
taping of ``Sunday Edition'' began with Ms. Kramer explaining to
viewers that Ferraro had declined to appear unless it was apart
from Green and Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The two women continued to talk over one another, with Ms.
Kramer challenging Ferraro to agree to a debate right on the spot.
The candidate finally turned to her host and said, ``Do you think
you're doing a disservice to your viewers by focusing on the
politics of debates, rather than where I stand on issues?''
</P>
<P>
   When the segment ended for an advertisement, Ferraro turned up
the tenor of her complaints to Ms. Kramer. ``What attack issue are
you taking next?'' she inquired archly, her off-air remarks blaring
over the speakers in the control room. ``I was curious which
campaign you are working for.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Kramer defended her question as legitimate, Ferraro shook
her head in disagreement. ``Unprofessional,'' she said.
``Unprofessional. Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the appearance, Ferraro's aides said that she had been
ambushed because she had been brought in on the pretense that it
would be a regular interview. Ferraro said that Ms. Kramer had done
the ``Green spin on this,'' adding, ``Marcia's annoyed because we
didn't agree to do a debate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro considers herself the front-runner in the race and, as
such, she is following a standard course in trying to minimize
debates. The candidates have appeared together twice, and neither
debate was televised.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro has said that debates are time-consuming for her
campaign and more likely to produce damaging attacks among the
candidates than insights on what they stand for. Ferraro was
largely ignored by the other candidates in their last debate.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's encounter was unusual in that Ferraro, who has tried
to avoid making the kind of attacks on Green and Schumer that might
bring attention to their campaigns, exhibited no such restraint
when it came to WCBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, the voters see through tabloid journalism and are
drawn to candidates who talk about the issues that appeal to them:
education, health care, the economy and the environment,'' said
Ferraro's spokesman, Stephen Gaskill.

CORINNE G. LEVIN, 68, ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corinne Greenberg Levin, an advocate for children and the
director of the independent Teacher Center in New Haven since its
founding 27 years ago, died July 27 at Connecticut Hospice in
Branford, Conn. A New Haven resident, she was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed in September 1996, her
family said.
</P>
<P>
   A former teacher, Ms. Levin organized the center in 1971 to be
governed entirely by teachers, beyond the sway of unions or
district administrators. It offers evening workshops bringing
together teachers, parents and others interested in the subject at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin focused on honing the performance of teachers in the
classroom, improving curriculums and other matters important to the
profession as well as the pupils in public, private and parochial
schools. Her center attracted participants from southern
Connecticut and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   She was active in the teacher center movement nationally, and
her center in New Haven served as a model for others. In the last
few years, she also helped establish 13 similar teacher centers in
Eastern Europe under the aegis of the Soros Foundation and the
U.S.Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin was born in New York City. She was a 1951 sociology
graduate of Syracuse University, earned a master's degree in
social-studies education at Harvard University and completed a
program in school administration at New York University in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   She taught in public schools in Maine, Pennsylvania and
Connecticut before opening the Teacher Center. She was active in
civic affairs, the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin is survived by her husband, Dr. Lowell Levin; three
daughters, Brooke Levin of Oakland, Calif., Jill Levin of
Albuquerque, N.M., and Lori Levin Albert of New Haven; her mother,
Estelle Greenberg of Warwick, R.I.; and five grandchildren.

DOMBROWSKI, LASORDA SET TO TALK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Wayne Huizenga, outgoing owner of the Florida Marlins,
granted the Los Angeles Dodgers permission Thursday to interview
Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers interim general manager Tom Lasorda is expected to speak
today with Dombrowski, who is in the final season of a multi-year
contract that is paying him $750,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also received permission Thursday from Cincinnati
chief executive John Allen to speak with Reds G.M. Jim Bowden. But
the focus now is on Dombrowski, a favorite of the new owners at
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a lot I can say,'' Lasorda said. ``I am
waiting to hear from (Dodgers president) Bob Graziano. But I do
expect to start the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski 40, refused to discuss the Dodgers opening, saying it
was inappropriate to discuss the future in the middle of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hoping to have a new general manager in place by
the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dombrowski received an endorsement for the Dodgers'
job from an unlikely source.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, who often battled with Dombrowski after joining
the Marlins in 1993, said he'd be a perfect choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those early years I was disappointed that the Marlins
weren't winning. It really got to me and I let him and everyone
know it,'' Sheffield said. ``I was young and immature. But then I
realized he wanted to win as much as I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be very honest and open to suggestions. I think
it would be great if he was the next G.M. of the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes returning: With right-hander Ismael Valdes scheduled to
return from the disabled list (strained left side) next Thursday,
someone was headed to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But strong performances by Brian Bohanon on Wednesday and Dave
Mlicki on Thursday have changed the Dodgers' plan. The Dodgers will
go with a six-man rotation for at least the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was going to happen but I tried to stay
focused on what I had to do,'' said Mlicki, who walked five Marlins
Thursday but limited them to three hits and one run in seven
innings. ``I haven't felt pressure. I figured if you pitch well
things will take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering: Former Marlins on their return to Miami for the
first time since the May 15 Mike Piazza trade:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we all had a lot of fun here,'' Bobby Bonilla said.
``But I think we're all moving on. Winning that series was great
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charles Johnson: ``I finally got to sleep in my own bed
last night. For the first month out there I lived in a hotel in
downtown Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich, who walked with the bases loaded in
the 10th inning Thursday to give the Dodgers a 2-1 victory:
``Mentally I'm doing OK. Physically I'm doing OK. Baseball-wise,
I'm doing terribly.''

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Less than a week ago, the question was not
whether the New York Liberty was going to make the playoffs, but
how far the team would go.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had won 10 of its last 11 games and had scored a
70-54 victory over the Houston Comets, the defending Women's
National Basketball Association champion, before a sellout crowd at
Madison Square Garden. Last Saturday's triumph over the Comets was
easily the high point of a season filled with ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, with a chance to finish first in the Eastern
Conference, the Liberty lost to the Cleveland Rockers, whose 70-64
victory at the garden clinched the top spot for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's 82-68 road loss to the Detroit Shock on Wednesday
night, after New York blew a 14-point first-half lead, concluded a
turn of events that ended New York's season: no first place and not
even a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   A victory against the Shock, an expansion team the Liberty had
beaten twice this season, would have locked up a playoff berth. But
the stunning defeat, which left many Liberty players teary-eyed and
shaking their heads in disbelief, put their post-season destiny in
the hands of two underdog teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty needed to have either Charlotte or Phoenix lose
Wednesday. But it never got the help it required. As expected,
Washington, a team that had won just three games all season, was
beaten by Charlotte, and Sacramento was defeated by Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs begin Saturday with Charlotte playing host to
Houston and Phoenix at home against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been ours,'' Rebecca Lobo, who scored 12
points, said after the Liberty's defeat on Wednesday. ``But we just
handed it over to Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Hampton said of the Liberty's 18-12 season: ``It was kind of
a roller coaster. It was very emotional because we worked so hard
to get things going after our rough start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was 8-9 before a victory at Phoenix on July 18 that
started a stretch in which they won 10 of 11 games before losing
their final two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked so hard to make the playoffs,'' said Sophia
Witherspoon, who scored a game-high 26 points on Wednesday. ``But
unfortunately, we did not fulfill our destiny.''

SEHORN SIDELINED FOR YEAR, SO GIANTS LOSE TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also FBN-JETS-FOLEY)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Jets rallied to defeat the
New York Giants, 27-23, Thursday night in their annual preseason
game at Giants Stadium. But for the Giants and their fans, the game
will not be remembered for how it ended but how it began: Jason
Sehorn sustaining a season-ending knee injury returning the opening
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, whose role as a return man was considered risky because
it jeopardized one of the team's most valuable players, tore his
anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments at the end of a
33-yard runback when he fumbled the football and went down in a
tangle of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn was tackled by the Jets' Chris Hayes and Ray Mickens with
Sehorn's right leg bending at an awkward angle beneath his body. He
will have reconstructive surgery in the next seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first kickoff that Sehorn, one of the fleetest
Giants, had returned for the team. The team had decided to use
Sehorn to return kickoffs because he asked to do so and because
their kickoff return average last season was the worst in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   After limping to the sideline, Sehorn was briefly examined on
the bench by team doctors and then taken off the field on a cart so
his knee could be X-rayed. While being examined on the sideline,
Sehorn momentarily buried his head in a towel as several players
came over to console him. Giants coach Jim Fassel also stopped by
to talk to Sehorn.
</P>
<P>
   The winning score for the Jets came on an 81-yard touchdown pass
from the reserve quarterback Vinny Testaverde to wide receiver
Dedric Ward midway through the third quarter. The touchdown pass
came one play after Giants running back Tiki Barber spoiled what
had been a fruitful drive with a fumble at the Jets' 19-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's pass to Ward was precisely thrown, arching just
over the Giants defender, the rookie safety Shaun Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' final possession in the last minutes of the fourth
quarter stalled at the Jets' 43-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the starting quarterbacks for the Jets and Giants
performed well. The Jets' Glenn Foley completed 14 of 22 passes for
192 yards with one touchdown and one interception. The Giants'
Danny Kanell completed 16 of 25 passes for 156 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the first half that the teams looked sharpest, with
the first-string offenses trading scores and moving up and down the
field in what was the best display of offense for either team
during the 1998 preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets scored first, taking advantage of Sehorn's fumble.
Foley completed three passes in what was a six-play drive. The last
of the completions was a 3-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Chrebet.
Place-kicker John Hall missed the extra point attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, looking crisp and efficient, answered with
a 10-play touchdown drive. Kanell completed all four of his passes
and Gary Brown made an impressive debut as the starting halfback,
running for 11 yards and a first down on his first rushing attempt
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The drive concluded with a 1-yard touchdown run by Barber. With
Brad Daluiso's extra point, the Giants led, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added to that lead 48 seconds into the second quarter
when Daluiso kicked a 33-yard field goal. The kick was set up by
three Kanell passes _ two to Ike Hilliard and one to David Patten.
Showing surprising command of a variety of passes, Kanell seemed
especially in sync with Hilliard, who missed two practices this
week because of back stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets responded to the Giants' field goal with a Curtis
Martin score _ a 14-yard touchdown dash off left tackle. The
pivotal play in the drive was a 23-yard pass play from Foley _ who
would complete his first eight passes _ to Chrebet, who was wide
open over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing the Jets 13-10, the Giants regained the lead with
another convincing possession. Giants safety Percy Ellsworth
intercepted a Foley pass in the early moments of the third quarter,
returning it 42 yards for a touchdown to give the Giants a 23-13
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly three minutes later, Jets punt returner Leon
Johnson caught a 39-yard punt by the Giants' reserve punter, Will
Brice, and returned it 65 yards for a touchdown.

NO. 1 DRAFT PICK: CARDS  
 ARIZONA DELIGHTED TO BE MURRELL'S CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running back Adrian Murrell knew it was time to go on the
offensive. His motto was: Force the issue, be aggressive, flex his
muscles, get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he couldn't stop New York Jets Coach Bill Parcells from
trading him last spring. But if Parcells wanted to shop him around,
Murrell figured he could at least have a say in where he wound up.
</P>
<P>
   So Murrell and his agent, Stephen Hayes, sent out feelers, and
Murrell decided he wanted to play for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the first time in NFL history a 1,000-yard rusher
told a team to come and get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shopped this area right here,'' Murrell said of the Valley.
``I told Steve, `This is the place I want to be.' We looked at what
(backs) were here. I knew (the Cardinals) were looking to get a
back in the draft, so I wanted the deal done before the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't finished lobbying. He asked Cardinals wide receiver
Rob Moore and backup running back Ron Moore, both former Jets
teammates, if they could put in a good word for him after the
Cardinals lost out in the Ricky Watters sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, a sixth-year pro who has rushed for 3,447 career yards
and 15 touchdowns, got his wish April 7, when the Cardinals traded
a 1998 third-round pick to the Jets for Murrell and a '98
seventh-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the trade was made, the Cardinals said they expect
Murrell to be their featured back.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to convince Cardinals running-backs Coach Johnny
Roland, who was a Jets assistant when Murrell was a fifth-round
pick out of West Virginia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got him the first time, he was a young pup,'' Roland
said. ``He was very raw. But I knew he had great athletic ability
as far as quickness, speed and change of direction. When there's a
(hole), he'll take it and do whatever he has to when he passes the
line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell thought he was headed for a long, productive career with
the Jets when Parcells was hired after the 1996 off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The previous year, the coach watched Murrell rush for 128 yards
and two touchdowns in a game against Parcells' New England
Patriots. After the game, Parcells informed Murrell he was voting
for him for the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Parcells left the Patriots to take the Jets' job, he
gushed about Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not trying to make this guy Jim Brown, OK?''
Parcells said then. ``But the kid has everything. The kid can see
it; he's got good vision. (Jets assistant Ron) Erhardt told me,
`Hey, Bill, you're going to love this guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells did love Murrell early last season. In the opener, he
gained 131 yards. He had 110 yards in Week 3 at New England. He
showed his durability with 40 carries for 156 yards against
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But Murrell and the Jets struggled late in the year. He gained
only 150 yards on 52 carries the final four weeks, when the team
went 1-3 and missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a tough town,'' said Murrell, 5 foot 11, 214
pounds. ``I took about half of the blame. But it's hard when you're
rushing 12 times a game. That's all we were running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murrell thought he would remain with the Jets until
Parcells signed New England running back Curtis Martin to an offer
sheet worth $4 million a year. The Patriots didn't match.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells ``told me after the deal that he didn't have any
intentions of getting a back in the off-season, that we had no need
for a back,'' Murrell said. ``He started talking about (using) two
backs. He could have done that. But it wouldn't have been good for
Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they'd shop me around. If they didn't get what they
wanted, I still would have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals weren't a tough sell. In 1996, the Jets won their
only game when Murrell rushed for a career high 199 yards against
them, including a 78-yarder late in the game to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just that one game,'' Cardinals defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``I had played against him when I
was with the Bears, and I always thought he was a very good back.
He's a sneaky back. He's a guy who can catch, run, make you miss.
He runs faster than you think. He's a guy you hoped didn't get the
ball much, because the more he was used, the better he got.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell left New York on good terms. Many of the fans who used
to yell at him, ``Yo, Adrian'' gave him a warm goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   They appreciated his back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. He also
did a lot of charity work.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tanya, is a sickle cell anemia carrier. His 2-year-old
son, Tylan, also has the trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was a carrier when we got married,'' he said. ``I
didn't think anything of it, because I was sure I didn't have it.
The big thing for me is that my son is a carrier, and we have a
little girl on the way. It doesn't affect his life. But when he's
older, I'm sure his mother and I will warn him (not to marry)
somebody who is a carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell plans to get involved in sickle cell charity work in the
Valley. But first he wants to establish himself on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He knows some don't expect him to do much playing behind a
much-maligned offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe anything stinks until I smell it,'' he said.
``I haven't seen it or smelled it.'' &QL;

PITCHER HILL GETS CHILLY RECEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pitcher Ken Hill said it was the cold weather
in Stockton on Tuesday night that caused discomfort in his
surgically repaired elbow and consequently forced him to take
himself out of his rehab start for Single-A Lake Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins, however, wasn't taking it so lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take yourself out if it's not serious,'' Collins
said. ``Therefore, it's serious to me. It may not be serious to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels thought Hill would be able to start Sunday
against Toronto, but because of the setback, he's looking at
another rehab start either Sunday or Monday, provided his sideline
workout today goes without problems.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, though, said he hasn't decided where Hill will make
that rehab start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If cold weather was part of the problem the other day, I'll
send him where it's hot,'' Collins said. ``I'll send him to the
equator if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels believe Hill's elbow pain was caused by a developing
arthritic condition or tendinitis _ or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do my sideline (work today) and see how it goes,'' Hill
said. ``We'll go day by day, but I feel I can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell sore, but OK: The Angels would love Hill to come back
the way Jack McDowell did. After being out for 2{ months with a bad
elbow, McDowell, a Notre Dame High graduate, threw seven scoreless
innings Wednesday against the Tigers in a 2-0 Angels win.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, McDowell's arm was sore but otherwise fine. He is
tentatively slated to start the series-opener Monday in New York
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, though, said he has learned he can't count on having
the same five in the starting rotation for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through way too much to think for the next 38 games
I can write down five names, he said. ``You want it to happen, but
it's not going to.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is already planning ahead to the five-game series
against the Yankees, trying to set his rotation. McDowell will go
Monday, Omar Olivares on Tuesday, Jeff Juden in the first game of
the doubleheader Wednesday and Chuck Finley on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins hasn't decided about the second game of the doubleheader
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got options, Collins said. ``We could go with (Steve)
Sparks on three days rest, we've got (Jason) Dickson, (Jarrod)
Washburn, (Allen) Watson and (Shigetoshi) Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely the Angels will go with a left-hander, either
Washburn or Watson.

GILLOM VS. COOPER? IT'S A TOSSUP 
</HEADLINE>
 MVP-GILLOM-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper or Jennifer Gillom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to who is the WNBA's Most Valuable Player comes
Monday. If the timing of the announcement is any indication, then
it favors a repeat for Cooper because the Houston Comets return
home that day for the second game of a playoff series with
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect for a hometown splash, perhaps in a combination press
conference with the Comets' Van Chancellor for going 2 for 2 as
Coach of the Year, the other award to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury plays its only semifinal home game Saturday and will
be in Cleveland when the MVP winner is revealed. Not the best of
signs for Gillom, who in informal discussions with media voters
will be No. 1 or 2 on most ballots.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 points given for a first-place vote and seven for second
(on down through fifth), the 34-year-old Mercury center needs to
top at least 23 of 45 ballots and finish no lower than second on
the rest to win the award. Or to have Lisa Leslie siphon some
first- or second-place votes from Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   What seems certain is that Cooper, the 35-year-old shooting
guard whose 22.7 points-per-game average led her to a second
straight scoring title, will not approach her 254-point MVP margin
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year there was not a lot of conversation (about MVP),''
said Clay Kallam, publisher of ``Full'' ``Court Press,'' a women's
basketball journal. ``Overall, it's a good thing for the league and
a lot of fun. And it's great for Jennifer Gillom, who is starting
to get some publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sort of the goal of the league, to give (veteran)
American players a chance to show how they were. Three years ago,
if you'd have said Cynthia Cooper and Jennifer Gillom to a casual
fan, they'd have said `who?' In that way, regardless of who wins,
it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The affable Gillom agrees to a point but has been public all
season about the MVP being her goal and shrugs when asked what more
she could do to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   A close second ``would be disappointing,'' she said, ``because
everybody wants me to win it, and I want to win for them and of
course for myself, too. I think it would be great for Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillom does not play for the defending champions. Or do high
visibility commercials for General Motors, Nike, Champion and the
league. (``Hey, you play like girls,'' Cooper says in one
commercial to some guys, who upon recognizing her respond with a
thanks.)
</P>
<P>
   Gillom has a catchy nickname, Grandmama, but not much more going
for her nationally, something that even a strong runner-up finish
could help to correct, particularly because her contract with the
league must be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help me to realize that people are starting to
recognize me and recognize my play,'' said Gillom, who plans to
play a lucrative second season in Turkey during the WNBA
off-season. She makes a six-figure salary overseas, compared with
the WNBA-maximum $62,500.
</P>
<P>
   Playing year-round is one factor in her favor over Cooper, who
did not return overseas, Gillom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you I've been fighting those (sore) knees all summer
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the post area, you do get double-teamed and
triple-teamed a lot, and it's a lot easier in the open court. Plus
she's (Cooper) surrounded by three awesome players (Sheryl Swoopes,
Tina Thompson, Kim Perrot). It's a lot easier that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallam said Cooper is the best player on the best women's team
in the world, but she's been criticized for friction in the locker
room. That opinion is shared by others familiar with the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks the ``relentlessly positive'' WNBA paints a better
picture of Mercury guards Michele Timms and Bridget Pettis than
their play this season warrants, detracting from an understanding
of the load Gillom has carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to how you define MVP,'' Kallam said.
``Is it who's the best player, or who is the most valuable player
to that team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooper has more skills, she can do more things. Especially
early in the year, when Houston was still interested, Cooper has
the ability to take over the game. It's a little easier to take
Jennifer out of the game by focusing on not letting her get the
ball. It comes down to what you like better, ice cream or steak?
There's not much to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, who led the United States to a gold medal at the World
Championships just before the season began, has statistics that
equal Cooper and Gillom but could not lift the Los Angeles Sparks
into the playoffs or even to a .500 record.
</P>
<P>
   What eliminates Leslie from the running is the Sparks' 12-18
record, compared with the Comets' 27-3 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I would do is wait and see what happens in the
playoffs,'' Kallam said.
</P>
<P>
   Or in the case of Cleveland Coach Linda Hill-MacDonald, whose
team has been raked for 93 points by Gillom this season, including
a WNBA season high 36 on Aug. 10, not choose at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to be the one to have to make a choice between
Jennifer and Cynthia,'' she said. ``Both have made tremendous
contributions to their team, that's evident in the sheer numbers
they've been putting up and defensively what they're capable of
doing. I'm glad I'm not in on the voting on that one.'' &QL;

   James Carter, 99, International Banker
</P>
<P>
   James Prescott Carter, an international banker and economic
consultant who also bred Aberdeen Angus cattle, died Aug. 10 at his
home in Keene, Va. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Carter worked for more than three decades as an executive of the
predecessor of Citibank in Spain, Belgium and Latin America and
spent another eight years as a consultant in Latin America and
Africa before retiring in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   As the bank's manager in Cuba he became concerned about the rise
of the revolutionary forces of Fidel Castro long before Castro
seized power in 1959 and began nationalizing foreign businesses.
His advice to begin reducing investments in Cuba was credited with
sharply limiting the bank's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had bought a 450-acre cattle farm in Virginia in the
1940s and when he stopped consulting in 1963 he began spending much
of his time there breeding prize-winning Aberdeen Angus. Among his
customers were several state agriculture departments. He sold the
farm in 1983 and had been living in Keene since.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering
at the Virginia Military Institute and a master's degree in
economics at the University of Wisconsin, started his career in
Madrid in 1921 with what was then known as the National City Bank,
with headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is survived by five daughters, Katherine Parker of
Madison, Tenn.; Susan Miller of Richmond; Rachel Brown of York,
Pa.; Enriqueta Bond of Pittsboro, N.C., and Adelaide Ruffner of
Charlottesville, Va.; 11 grandchildren, and five
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Harriette Mortley Bovard, died in 1983.

   Phil Leeds, a durable funnyman who began his pursuit of laughs
as a stand-up comic in the 1930s and went on to work in theater,
films and television, died Aug. 16 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
in Los Angeles. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds' rumpled face _ ``I'm not pretty, but I'm warm and
feisty,'' he told an interviewer _ was a familiar one to television
viewers. Indeed, in May he appeared in the final episodes of four
television series on the same night: ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Ellen,''
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ``Murphy Brown.'' Over the years he
made guest appearances on dozens of shows, including ``All in the
Family,'' ``Maude,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' ``Barney Miller,''
``Roseanne'' and ``The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Leeds was a member of the Army Special
Service Unit during World War II and entertained troops in the
Pacific. After the war he returned to New York and performed at the
Village Vanguard, the Blue Angel and other clubs. He eventually won
parts in several Broadway shows, including ``Make a Wish,''
``Can-Can,'' ``Romanoff and Juliet'' and ``Nobody Loves an
Albatross.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s he appeared with Jose Ferrer in a successful
production of Neil Simon's comedy ``The Sunshine Boys'' in San
Francisco. He also performed in the musical ``Two Gentlemen of
Verona'' at the Los Angeles Music Center in 1973. His film credits
included ``Rosemary's Baby,'' ``Beaches,'' ``Enemies, A Love
Story'' and ``Soapdish.''

AIR FOLEY TAKES OFF AND FLIGHT IS SMOOTH

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After a summer of inconsistency, Glenn
Foley on Thursday night finally produced the quick-strike effort
that coach Bill Parcells expected in naming him the New York Jets'
starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it without much of a running game. Although it was
only an exhibition game against the Giants, won by the Jets 27-23,
it was also merely the seventh start of Foley's rocky National
Football League career.
</P>
<P>
   He had completed only 11 of 28 passes in the first two
exhibition games, he had averaged under 4 yards an attempt, he had
been intercepted twice. But Thursday night Foley drilled his first
nine passes complete and was 13 for 18 in the opening half, good
for 162 yards. His 3-yard pass to Wayne Chrebet opened the scoring
in the 27-23 victory over the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Foley suffered a lapse to open the second half when his first
pass was intercepted by Percy Ellsworth and returned for a 42-yard
touchdown. Still, by the time Foley was replaced in the third
quarter by Vinny Testaverde, he had completed 14 of 22 passes for
192 yards. He suffered the one interception, threw the one
touchdown and was sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Foley's favorite target was Keyshawn Johnson,
with whom he hopes to collaborate on big plays for many years to
come. He threw the ball in Johnson's direction seven times in the
opening half. Johnson snared five for 69 yards. For the game, Foley
and Johnson collaborated on six receptions for 99 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need the work,'' Foley, who has started only five
regular-season games, repeats daily after practice. ``I need as
much work as I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday night, Parcells may not have been sure what he
had. A year ago in the exhibition season, Foley was coming off the
bench for Neil O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jets-Giants game last summer, Foley was the club's golden
boy. He came in to relieve O'Donnell and tossed a touchdown to
rookie Dedric Ward as the Jets won. A week later, against Tampa
Bay, he again replaced O'Donnell, brought the Jets into overtime,
and tossed a 48-yarder to Chrebet to position the Jets' winning
score.
</P>
<P>
   That capped a preseason in which he was 13 for 19 for 208 yards.
But he was also coming off the bench, and as far as Parcells is
concerned, that is not the same as having the pressure of starting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Foley's spectacular summer last year even created some
speculation that he might start the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil O'Donnell is my quarterback,'' said Parcells when asked
Foley's chances to start.
</P>
<P>
   But now Foley is the starter, even though in Game 2 of the
preseason, against the Ravens, Testaverde got the nod.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the opening touchdown, Foley led the Jets on a
smart 69-yard scoring drive by completing three straight passes
that got the Jets to the Giants' 14. From there, Curtis Martin
swept left for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only Jet to carry the ball in the opening half.
His eight carries produced 30 yards, although for the second
consecutive game he was stopped on a run needing a yard for the
first down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a game plan apparently designed to get the Jets'
passing attack moving. The Jets had not even averaged 5 yards an
attempt in splitting the first two preseason games. Parcells
believes that Martin will be ganged up on by opposition defenses if
they sense the Jets are reluctant to throw.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Jets established Thursday night is that they are
willing to wing it, and do it behind Foley.

FEUD BETWEEN TWO FOOT DOCTORS LED TO ARSON, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 15 years they worked side by side in their Queens
podiatry practice. But in the past year, Dr. Irwin Sater, 65,
decided to put his three-and-a-half decades in podiatry behind him,
so he sold the practice to his junior partner and moved to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the feud began. As the junior partner, Dr. Steven
Mehl, 44, took over the practice, law enforcement officials said,
he discovered what he believed were financial irregularities, so he
made a series of angry phone calls to Florida threatening to stop
payments on the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The fight became so intense that on July 31, the authorities
said, Sater flew to New York from Florida and set fire to Mehl's
office. Thursday morning, Sater surrendered to fire marshals in
Queens. He was being held Thursday night while awaiting arraignment
on charges of arson in the fourth degree and burglary, said Maureen
Moore, a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set the blaze in the basement, where the financial records
used to be kept, but they had been moved,'' one law enforcement
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Sater's arrest came after an intensive investigation by the fire
marshals, who deemed the July 31 fire suspicious from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Sater's lawyer, Samuel Gregory, denied the charges. ``Dr. Sater
is a wonderful man,'' Gregory said. ``He's probably done more good
than 99 percent of the population. As soon as he was notified that
he was a suspect in some wrongdoing he contacted me and came up
from Florida.''

EDITORIAL: ACCESS FEES AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial on Fri., Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court decision this week should benefit
Internet users and the fast-growing electronic information industry
by holding down connection costs. The decision upheld the authority
of the Federal Communications Commission to exempt Internet service
providers from interstate access charges paid to local phone
companies. The issue was raised in a lawsuit by telecommunications
companies challenging federal regulations intended to deregulate
the industry. The lengthy decision by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals allows the agency to get on with that task without
dampening growth in the electronic information sector.
</P>
<P>
   The local phone companies have argued that Internet services
should have to pay the same access fees that long-distance carriers
pay for using the local phone lines. But the FCC contends that
Internet services are not equivalent to long-distance carriers and
do not use local systems in the same way. Imposing access fees
would very likely have caused online services to raise their rates,
and perhaps abandon the flat-fee structure that has attracted
millions of customers to online services.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC policy was created in 1983, recognizing that the nascent
electronic information industry needed breathing room to develop.
Last year the FCC decided that keeping the access fee exemption for
online services was still appropriate to avoid disrupting the
still-evolving industry. The agency also is not convinced that
Internet services impose uncompensated costs on the local phone
companies or that congestion on local phone lines warrants the
imposition of new charges. That judgment may change in the future _
but it is one for the agency to make without judicial interference.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   For a moment there it appeared that baseball's most hallowed
record _ Roger Maris' 61 home runs in a single season, set in 1961
_ might be safe for yet another year. Nobody was throwing hittable
pitches to Maris' two main threats, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs
and Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals, and both men seemed to
be tiring as the season entered its final months. Sosa hit 20 home
runs in June, only nine in July. By his own account, McGwire has
been little more than an ``ornament'' in the last seven weeks, with
45 strikeouts and only 10 homers since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Then the two teams collided in Chicago on Wednesday, and
baseball's most intriguing two-man show was back in business. Sosa
seized the home run lead with his 48th homer in the fifth inning,
only to see McGwire take it back with his 48th and 49th. Still
rolling, McGwire hit his 50th and 51st against the New York Mets on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting aspects of this assault on Maris' record
is what it says about the importance of power to baseball.
Spectacular fielding plays are fun to watch, and a no-hitter is a
rare thrill, but nothing quite captures the imagination like a home
run. In a recent tribute to Babe Ruth's magnificent 1927 season,
when he hit 60 home runs, Sports Illustrated suggested that Ruth
had singlehandedly changed the face of the game, elevating the home
run from ``its relatively modest role into baseball's most dramatic
event and a significant force in determining the outcome of a
game.'' The sluggers are also good for baseball's balance sheet.
The Cardinals are drawing capacity crowds despite a disappointing
season, and wherever they go, Sosa and McGwire attract thousands of
people who would otherwise have stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have picked a better year. Only one of major
league baseball's six regional divisions has produced a compelling
race. The only race of any national interest is the race between
Sosa and McGwire, who are chasing not only each other but the ghost
of Roger Maris.

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST MAN ACCUSED IN FIREFIGHTERS' CAFE BRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecutors dropped assault and related charges
Thursday against a restaurant bouncer who was the only person
charged in a June brawl involving dozens of firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to drop the charges against the bouncer, Ethan
Kemp, means that no one has been held criminally liable in the
case, although several firefighters were disciplined by the Fire
Department. In dropping the charges against Kemp, prosecutors
concluded that he was trying to separate battling firefighters when
he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp's lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., said Thursday that the
30-year-old bouncer would be filing a multi-million dollar lawsuit
against the city accusing the police of wrongful arrest, malicious
prosecution and violating Kemp's civil rights during the June 3
fracas at the Bryant Park Grill in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who is black, said he believed race played a role in his
arrest. The majority of the firefighters involved in the fighting,
none of whom were arrested, are white. Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman
for the Police Department, had no comment on Kemp's charge.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement investigators who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Thursday that they were still determining whether to
file criminal charges against firefighters. But their
investigation, they said, has been hindered because firefighters
have refused to offer much information about the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official also said witnesses have described
more serious misconduct than outlined in a Fire Department
investigation released last month. On July 2, Fire Commissioner
Thomas Von Essen punished 11 firefighters by reducing their pay and
declared the department's investigation closed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, department investigators said that accounts of an
evening of chaos at the restaurant _ involving fistfights, patrons
being harassed and firefighters urinating in bushes _ were
exaggerated. The firefighters had gone to the restaurant after
taking part in Medal Day ceremonies in which heroic firefighters
were honored at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department spokesman Michael Regan said the department,
while not excusing the firefighters' behavior, concluded its
investigation last month. ``The department disciplined 11
firefighters for their role at the Bryant Park Grill,'' he said.
``This ends a sad chapter in the department's history.''

 HARTMANN WINS MET OPEN FOR 4th TITLE OF YEAR  
(mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCUST VALLEY, N.Y. _ Rick Hartmann, who arrived in the
metropolitan area six years ago after playing for 10 years on the
European tour, is starting to spread fear among golfers in the
area, the way Bruce Zabriski and Darrell Kestner have done for the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann captured the $100,000 Met Open by a shot Thursday with
a sizzling seven-under-par 63 on the difficult Creek Club course
here after starting the day five shots behind the leaders. His
bogeyless round included seven birdies and he finished the 54-hole
event with a total of 203 for his fourth victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now the premier player in the area,'' Kestner, who shot
69 and finished second at 204, said about Hartmann, the head pro at
Atlantic Golf Club, who also won the Long Island Open, the Long
Island PGA and the head pro championship this season. ``This is his
time; he's the best player in the section,'' Kestner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big tournament to win on a great golf course like
this,'' said Hartmann, who earned $20,000 by winning the most
prestigious tournament in the area. ``It's particularly satisfying
because I beat Kestner and because I let it get away last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann and Kestner, the head pro at nearby Deepdale, who
earned $10,000, are inseparable friends. Hartmann stayed at
Kestner's house for the tournament. Hartmann said jokingly that he
was angry at Kestner Thursday morning because his host failed to
make coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name deserves to be on the trophy,'' said Kestner, who was
seeking his fourth title in the tournament. ``Shooting 63 here is
taking it to the limit. It's a remarkable round.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann started the day five shots behind Kestner and Greg
Rohlf of Wykagyl, who shot 71 and finished at 206, which tied him
for fourth with Jean-Paul Hebert (70) of Garden City Country Club.
Rohlf was the low amateur here and the winner of the Ike, the
stroke-play championship of the Metropolitan Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   Rohlf had the lead after three consecutive birdies, but he
bogeyed three of the last eight holes, while Kestner's round
included two birdies and a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gilmore, the head pro at nearby Wheatley Hills Golf Club,
shot his second round of 69 and finished alone in third at 205.
Mike Burke Jr. of Mountain Ridge, last year's winner, shot 68
Thursday after two rounds of 72 and finished at 212, while
Zabriski, the teaching pro at Westchester and the winner two years
ago and also in 1993, shot 70 and finished at 213.

NO EXCUSE FOR PLAYERS TO FAIL CLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Katzenmoyer, the All-Everything linebacker for No. 1-ranked
Ohio State, may be ruled academically ineligible if he doesn't
bring up his grades in summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeyes fans are wringing hands and gnashing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   As Andy burns the midnight oil, a campus newspaper headline sums
up the impact of this crisis: ``Eligibility May Affect Football
Rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   Grades will come out soon. The suspense is awful.
</P>
<P>
   Can Andy pass Music?
</P>
<P>
   Will he flunk AIDS Awareness?
</P>
<P>
   If he aces both courses, and fails Golf, is the season over?
</P>
<P>
   These are actual credit courses Katzenmoyer is taking. If the
NCAA scholar-athlete fails to bring up his average and isn't in
uniform for the Sept. 5 opener against West Virginia, well, it's
difficult to imagine the depth of disappointment and hurt those who
believe in him, trust him, and support him will feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a human being,'' Katzenmoyer said. ``I make mistakes. I
have flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy sounds almost presidential.
</P>
<P>
   The intent here isn't to call into question Ohio State's
curriculum. Every school offers a Heinz variety of electives.
</P>
<P>
   When he coached at Oklahoma City, Abe Lemons said he instructed
five of his basketball players to enroll in basket-weaving. Unknown
to the coach, one of the players was part Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kid broke the curve,'' Abe said. ``The other four flunked.''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Charles Barkley what he majored in at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music Appreciation,'' Barkley lied, flashing a grin. ``It was
great. I went to this class and they played music. After class I
told the teacher, `I ``appreciate'' that!' I got an A.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the worst occur, Katzenmoyer has no one to blame but
himself. Ohio State has a fleet of academic counselors. The school
provides support services for all its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But Ohio State can't attend class for a player. It can't take
notes for him. It can't take his exam. NCAA athletes must make some
effort to expand their minds and show progress toward a degree
based on a five-year timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he holds his breath each summer while awaiting grade
reports, Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder said, ``I think 112 (NCAA
Division I) head coaches do, collectively. Most of us have some
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU safety Mitchell Freedman attended Mesa Community College in
the spring and ASU during the summer and regained eligibility for
his senior season. Fright Night is with the team in camp. Three
others are conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder doesn't know whether tailback Marlon Farlow, wide
receiver Ricky Boyer and linebacker Larry Johnson have met
classroom requirements this summer that will allow them to play.
All are seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Farlow earned the team's Most Improved award last season and is
penciled in as J.R. Redmond's backup. Boyer has game-breaking
speed. A starter last year, Johnson is one player the Sun Devils
don't want to lose. But they may be without all three. Snyder
doesn't sound optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the support available, if they don't succeed
academically, it's their choice,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player needs a tutor, he's got a tutor. Some people are
more gifted than others. Not everybody is a Rhodes scholar.''
</P>
<P>
   But . . . ``If he's unsuccessful'' _ meaning he doesn't maintain
his eligibility _ ``he chose to sleep in.''
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is, some don't value education or begin to
understand the importance of a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   When Snyder, a full scholarship in hand, visits a recruit and
his parents in their home, more times than not, he finds himself
competing with a blaring TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important to your son,'' Snyder says. Without
asking, he turns the set off. ``Please, just give me 30 minutes of
your time.'' &QL;

3 GUILTY OF GIVING DRUGS TO EAST GERMAN ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Two doctors and a swimming trainer from the former East
Germany were convicted and fined here Thursday on charges of
systematically feeding growth-enhancing steroids to young athletes,
the first conviction in what is expected to be a long line of
trials over drugging athletes under the old Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Coming nearly nine years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the
conviction gives new impetus to investigations of senior political
officials in East Germany who are suspected of having orchestrated
a national program to beef up promising athletes, many of them in
their early teens at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came after all three former sports officials
admitted this week that they regularly gave steroids and other
hormones to female swimmers. Each of the three publicly apologized.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not alone. Numerous women have filed lawsuits
charging that their former coaches gave them male hormones without
telling them, and some argue that they still suffer from side
effects that include deeper voices, skin problems and infertility.
More than 90 formal criminal investigations are under way,
prosecutors here say, and another drug trial of six doctors and
trainers could reach a conclusion in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All the activity stems in part from a treasure trove of recently
uncovered information from the former East German secret service,
the Stasi. As a result, a growing number of coaches and doctors are
breaking their silence and admitting their activities, though they
blame their superiors. The first public admission by a former East
German sports doctor came last month and was followed by Thursday's
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The three people convicted Thursday oversaw a Berlin swimming
club that groomed athletes for East Germany's national teams. They
were Ulrich Sunder, the club's head doctor; Dorit Rosler, a second
team doctor; and Peter Mattonet, the team's trainer. Because the
three confessed and expressed regret for giving out the hormones,
the judge limited their punishments to fines ranging from about
$3,900 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two other trainers in the club admitted to handing out steroid
pills, but the charges were dropped after they agreed to pay
smaller fines.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the former swimmers was in court, because the trial
did not rely on testimony from any of the former athletes. The one
athlete present was Karen Konig, who had filed her own complaint
alongside the prosecutors' indictments. Konig, a rising star during
the 1980s, has complained that her trainers never told her about
the nature of the hormones they were providing and ignored side
effects like her deepened voice and intensified acne problems.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the trial, Rosler walked over to Konig with an
outstretched hand. ``I look forward to being able to look at each
other in the eye again,'' Rosler said. Konig hesitated before
awkwardly shaking Rosler's hand, but made it clear she did not want
to let the matter drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this decision means we can move on to the next
level, those who had political responsibility,'' she said outside
the courtroom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Christian Paschen, a lawyer representing Konig and three other
former athletes in another case, said the decision marked an
important advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that sports officials have been
convicted of injuring athletes by systematically giving them
hormones, and it is important to note that all of the swimmers in
this case were minors,'' Paschen said. ``They knew what they were
doing, they knew about the possible side effects and they ignored
them when they became apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunder, the team's chief doctor, denied knowing much about the
side effects and said during the trial that his superiors had told
him that any damage would be temporary. But he too expressed regret
for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have to live with my blame for the athletes,'' he told
DPA, the German press agency.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the verdicts, Judge Jurgen Warnatsch said the three
officials were part of a broader system. ``The doctors and trainers
were bound up in a state-run criminality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's chief prosecutor, Christoph Schaefgen, told news
agencies that the conviction would help intensify investigations
into more senior government officials who organized the drug
program on a national basis. At the top of the list, Paschen said,
is the former head of East Germany's entire sports program, Manfred
Ewald.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent targets are several high-ranking doctors who are
alleged to have conceptualized the entire hormone program by
defining the dosages, procedures and chemical combinations that
team doctors and trainers would put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   But there are potential difficulties. Under a law adopted after
German reunification, former East Germans cannot be prosecuted for
crimes under the old regime after Oct. 31, 2000. A second
difficulty is that prosecutors must convict people under the laws
that governed East Germany. Giving hormones to athletes was illegal
under the Communist regime, but the legal hurdles could prove more
difficult as prosecutors move up the chain of command.

FATE LEAVES UA'S SPROTTE DETERMINED 
</HEADLINE>

 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A number along a road south of Globe, Ariz., is a milestone
etched in the memory of Arizona linebacker Scooter Sprotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marker 162.2,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, early in the morning on July 11, that Sprotte lost
his best friend, Justin Flores, when the truck they were riding in
slipped off the pavement and flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was driving. Sprotte was a passenger. Fate sat between
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sprotte scrambled out of a hole that a Department of Public
Safety officer described as the size of a clipboard, according to
his father, Dr. Bill Sprotte.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Sprotte was left with scars along the front of his
legs and in the back of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered: `Why him and not me?' '' Sprotte said. ``I lost a
lot of sleep. There's the guilt aspect. You blame yourself. You
think: `Maybe if I had been driving it wouldn't have happened.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up a lot of nights thinking that I was seeing stuff.
But slowly, I'm getting back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Football intervened with the camaraderie, daily rigors and
mind-numbing regimen of repeated drills at Camp Cochise near
Douglas, where the Wildcats stage eight days of preseason
maneuvers. Exhaustion can be a pretty good antidote for emotional
demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been by myself, I would have had some trouble,'' said
Sprotte, a psychology major whose older brother, Jimmy, is a
Tennessee Oilers rookie after starting at linebacker for UA last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight is a scrimmage (7:30) under game-like conditions at
Arizona Stadium. In two weeks, there's the opener at Hawaii. A
season and all its hopes are on the horizon. Career milestones
probably await the 5-foot-11, 219-pound Sprotte, a promising
redshirt junior and possible starter at inside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever he achieves, that marker on Arizona 77 near El
Capitan pass will always be a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was Sprotte's boyhood friend, greatest fan, confidant,
teammate and classmate at Blue Ridge High School in Lakeside.
Flores had driven to Tucson from the Valley, where he had been
working since high school. He picked up Sprotte, and they planned
to drive the back roads through Globe and up to Lakeside for a
wedding. From there, they planned a trip to Lake Powell.
</P>
<P>
   But one life ended and another changed forever when Flores
apparently fell asleep and failed to negotiate a sweeping turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit this rock wall and just missed a guard rail, which
would have kept them on the road,'' said Sprotte's father, a
Lakeside dentist. ``Then, they went between the wall and the guard
rail and shot off the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprotte's father and mother, Barbara, grew concerned when their
son told them about his inability to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about counseling, but then it was time for camp,''
his father said. ``As it turns out, football has been a good thing
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the just-completed camp that Sprotte talked as if
the mental scars had healed enough to become a potential source of
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Flores) knew me, my family and older brother,'' said
Sprotte, who played running back as a freshman and sophomore before
redshirting last season because of a move to defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking that he'll never have the chances I've got.
That's making me work harder than I ever have. It makes me want to
be even more of a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has made me realize nothing can be taken for
granted. It's been one of life's curve balls.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, Sprotte pointed at the scars that crisscross his
shins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few,'' he said. ``They only make my legs uglier than
they were already. The mental scars . . . well, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something else. It makes you grow up, but I also would
hope it's something nobody else ever has to see. I remember every
bit of it, and I guess I always will.'' &QL;

IN LAND OF THE GIANTS, LINEBACKER STANDS TALL  
 ASU'S ARCHULETA FOLLOWS IN TILLMAN'S FOOTSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>

 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA _ Play linebacker at Arizona State? Adam
Archuleta wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   That's when former assistant Lyle Setencich took the Chandler
High School senior into his office and popped in a videotape of Pat
Tillman at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can do this?'' Setencich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah,'' Archuleta said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how it started for a standout defensive back at
Chandler High School that nobody wanted. Not a single letter from a
college. He only talked to the Sun Devils after calling ``them.''
OK, they said, but you have to walk on.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at him. Two years later, he is slated to start at
weakside linebacker. That could change if senior Larry Johnson
regains his academic eligibility, but for now, the sophomore will
start when ASU faces Washington on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to compare him to (former standout) Pat Tillman,
because Pat's Pat and Archie's Archie,'' defensive coordinator Phil
Snow said. ``Archie brings some things Pat didn't and vice versa.
But he can run, he's aggressive and he's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tillman, Archuleta's 6-foot, 209-pound frame is often
questioned. By comparison, two of the top linebackers in the
country _ Ohio State's Andy Katzenmoyer and Florida's Jevon Kearse
_ are 6-4, 260 and 6-5, 255, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also worth noting that Texas A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen,
considered by many the nation's second-best inside linebacker
behind Katzenmoyer, is 6-0, 216.
</P>
<P>
   Is Snyder worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Snyder said. ``His speed makes up for all of
that. He's a tough nut and boy he can run.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Archuleta laughs at the improbability of his position.
He always played defensive back and reported to ASU weighing 185.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, after Sun Devils coaches finally agreed to meet with
the high school senior, he found it hard to believe they wanted him
to play linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sold on the idea. The prospect of playing safety at a
junior college was equally appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 50-50 and (Setencich) had to convince me,'' Archuleta
said. ``Finally, I said, `OK, but only if I get invited to camp.'
If you walk-on and don't get invited, all you ever do is work out
with the scout team and I didn't want that. So they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta redshirted his first season,, but payed close
attention to Tillman. Even last year, when he played sparingly, he
took notes.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, now with the Cardinals, was always available to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would always ask him questions to try and get better,''
Archuleta said. ``And he would often come up to me and tell me how
to play things during a game, even though he knew I wouldn't be
getting in. `Hey, this is what's going on and here's how we're
going to handle it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him be successful and that gives you a lot of
motivation. If he was a little guy and didn't play that well, that
would be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment to linebacker was a bit rough at first.
</P>
<P>
   Pass coverage came easily because of his experience at defensive
back. But run coverage, as well as those ``meetings'' with
offensive linemen, well, that was another story.
</P>
<P>
   He's always enjoyed the contact, although at linebacker it's a
little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, if I was playing safety and had some high-speed
collisions like Mitch (Freedman), that's fun,'' he said. ``But when
I have to mess with people like Grey (Ruegamer), it's a tugging
match. I don't like messing with linemen. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about strategy. I come to a line, I've got to juke, I've
got to do everything I can. If I don't do well. . . . Yesterday,
Victor (Leyva) got his hands on me and just tossed me. That's not
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU coaches often praise Archuleta, and Snyder has singled out
his play, even when he first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But will that translate into a starting job? That could depend
on Johnson's return. Stephen Trejo has been starting at the
strongside and Joe Cesta and Archuleta at the middle and weakside,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson returns, he could displace either Trejo or Archuleta.
Trejo could also move to the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my mind, I think if Larry comes in, they'd put
him in my spot,'' Archuleta said. ``It's not something that's
really discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I figure, if I play good, that'll take care of it.''

TOBACCO INDUSTRY GAVE $140,000 TO ROWLAND, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Gov. John G. Rowland, who this year opposed a
bill to increase the state tax on cigarettes, has accepted nearly
$140,000 in contributions from tobacco interests since he was
elected in 1994, according to a report released Thursday by a
public-interest group.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Citizen Action Group, which has been a frequent
critic of Rowland, said the governor's acceptance of tobacco money
also drew into question his other positions on tobacco, including
his refusal to ask Connecticut's Treasurer to divest the state of
tobacco stocks even as it pursues a lawsuit against tobacco
companies to recover the costs of treating tobacco-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, Governor Rowland has put his support behind the money,
and not on the side of public health or children's health,'' Susan
Haviland, a spokeswoman for the group, said at a news conference
held Thursday in the governor's empty parking space at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Rowland has so far accepted $47,425
from tobacco industry executives, employees and political action
committees for his re-election campaign. He has also accepted
$27,099 from lobbyists hired to work for tobacco companies, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   After his election in 1994, tobacco companies contributed
$65,000 to support Rowland _ $5,000 from U.S. Tobacco Corp. for his
inaugural dinner, $10,000 from U.S. Tobacco and Philip Morris Cos.
to aid his transition into office, and $50,000 from Philip Morris
to renovate the governor's mansion after Rowland took office.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, Rowland's campaign spokesman, said that the
governor did not support any new taxes _ whether on tobacco,
gasoline or income _ and that he had in no way been influenced by
donations from tobacco interests. He said the treasurer, not the
governor, should decide how best to invest the state's money.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani noted that the donations for the inaugural dinner, the
transition costs and the mansion renovation were made to
committees, not to the governor himself.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign leaders for Rowland's Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep.
Barbara Kennelly, were quick Thursday to criticize the amount
Rowland has accepted from tobacco interests. Mrs. Kennelly has
vowed not to accept tobacco industry money in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The governor pointed out that Mrs. Kennelly had accepted tobacco
money before. As a congresswoman, Mrs. Kennelly accepted about
$30,000 in donations from political action committees for the
tobacco industry from 1987 to 1997, according to a report released
in March by Common Cause. The report did not track individual
contributions by tobacco executives or employees, but the Center
for Responsive Politics in Washington said that none were made to
Mrs. Kennelly's campaigns between 1991 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to laugh a little bit,'' Rowland said Thursday at a
news conference in Old Lyme, where he was speaking about joint
efforts by New York and Connecticut to reduce nitrogen levels in
Long Island Sound. ``She's received more tobacco support than the
rest of the Connecticut delegation and the rest of the New England
delegation combined. So, thou protest too much.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Common Cause report, Mrs. Kennelly has been the
top recipient of tobacco industry money among House members in New
England, but U.S. Sens. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Robert
Smith of New Hampshire had accepted more donations from tobacco
interests than Mrs. Kennelly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly said Thursday that she had decided not to accept
money from tobacco companies or executives because of what she had
learned about the companies' practices, the addictiveness of
tobacco and the impact of smoking on children. ``I'm like a lot of
people _ I got religion on the issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pelto, Mrs. Kennelly's campaign spokesman, said Rowland
had accepted more money from tobacco in about 2 years than Mrs.
Kennelly had in 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just funding his campaign,'' Pelto said. ``They're
working hard to make his life more enjoyable.''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the 1980s, Mexico was a lonely country for bankers like Ralph
Heid and Claude ``Hank'' Miller. They searched the far corners of
Mexico, going outside the familiar financial hubs of Mexico City
and Monterrey, to find business for their Comerica bank bosses back
in Detroit. Along the trail, the pair seldom bumped into any other
U.S. bankers, let alone bankers from Europe or Asia.
 &HT;    ``Most banks concentrated on Mexico City and Monterrey, but we
felt there were some excellent companies in the regional
capitals,'' says Heid, who is a vice president for Latin America in
the bank's International Finance Department. ``We researched them,
stopping by a major city each time we came to Mexico.''
 &HT;    U.S.-based Comerica has since prospered, weathering many a
Mexican financial storm. Mexican clients top the bank's
international borrowing list, with US$414 million in loans
outstanding at year-end 1997. Overall, the bank had $2 billion in
outstanding loans to non-U.S.-based customers, which represents
little more than 7 percent of its $28 billion portfolio.
 &HT;    ``We have traditionally worked with the export sector in Latin
America and with subsidiaries of U.S. companies,'' says Heid. ``Our
experience relative to other banks was not painful. The companies
we served were mainly export-focused, and they continued to
generate dollars to service their debt.''
 &HT;    With clients in 14 Mexican cities and with offices in leading
U.S. exporting states, Comerica has taken advantage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement to become a bank without borders.
``We follow the natural trade flows between our market areas in the
United States and Latin America,'' says Heid, who has a staff of 25
lending officers who travel frequently to Latin America.
 &HT;    The bank's success in Mexico is a product of its strategy to
find promising companies outside the larger cities, in places like
Guadalajara, Aguascalientes, Puebla and Chihuahua. One clear
winning partnership was Internacional de Ceramica S.A. de C.V., a
leading ceramic tile manufacturer in Chihuahua.
 &HT;    The relationship began in 1989, blossoming with Comerica's
granting credit lines to the company. By 1992, Comerica was the
lead bank for working capital loans for the firm. At the same time,
the company began expanding sales on both sides of the border,
especially in Texas. Comerica then led the way as fast-growing
Interceramic sought funds to expand its main plant in Chihuahua and
built a plant outside Dallas, Texas. In 1993, the World Bank's
International Finance Corp. gave Interceramic a $38.5 million for
the Chihuahua project. The IFC sold part of the $17.5 million loan
portfolio to private banks, with Comerica being the largest
participant.
 &HT;    The following year, Comerica loaned Interceramic $8 million to
purchase machinery and equipment for its Texas plant. Despite the
damage caused by Mexico's peso crisis in 1994-95, Interceramic had
no difficulty making its loan payments.
 &HT;    Victor Almeida, Interceramic's chief executive officer, says
other U.S. banks might have deserted his company. He says Comerica
was very different from most U.S. banks that deal with Mexican
companies because it was willing to make money available to his
company by reviewing its export invoices.
 &HT;    ``Comerica is willing to listen and understand, and they have a
feel for (Mexico's ups and downs),'' he says.
 &HT;    These days, the ups seem to outnumber the downs for
Interceramic. Last year, the company earned $200 million in
revenues, with 56 percent coming from U.S. sales. The publicly
traded company employs 2,500 people in Mexico; 700 at its U.S.
subsidiary. It was founded in 1978 by Oscar Almeida, Victor's
father, who is the company chairman.
 &HT;    Heid and Miller say Interceramic is the kind of company a bank
can find in Mexico if it's willing to do some homework and look
beyond the country's bigger, more traditional markets.
 &HT;    To arrange loans to Mexican clients, Comerica uses offices in
the United States, its subsidiary in Mexico City and its
representative office in Monterrey. Miller is now managing director
of the Mexico City office. In Mexico, Comerica lends in dollars and
in pesos and performs cash management and other treasury services.
 &HT;    Lending to companies in other parts of Latin America is done
through U.S. headquarters in Droit, Michigan. A possible office is
being considered in Brazil, says Heid, who continues to keep up a
heavy travel schedule to Latin America. ``I go every two or three
weeks,'' he says.

POLICE SHOOT MAN, 65 AND LEGALLY BLIND, THEY SAY HAD MACHETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A legally blind 65-year-old man who police said was
wielding a machete was shot early Thursday by officers searching
for guns and explosives at his son's Staten Island apartment,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department and the victim's family gave different
accounts Thursday night about the shooting of the father, Watson
Chin Young, who was shot once in the chest and was in serious but
stable condition at Staten Island University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   According to Deputy Inspector Michael Collins, a police
department spokesman, officers had obtained a search warrant for
the upstairs apartment at 1865 Forest Ave., a two-story home that
has a barbershop owned by Chin Young, a downstairs apartment where
he lives and an upstairs apartment that is the residence of his
26-year-old son, Leighton Chin Young. The police, Inspector Collins
said, had got a tip that Watson Chin Young's son was storing guns
and explosives there.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the elder Chin Young opened his door, holding a
machete, after detectives and emergency service officers entered
the home's common foyer on the ground floor. He was shot, they
said, after refusing to drop the machete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary investigation indicates that Watson Chin
brandished a 24-inch machete,'' Collins said. ``A fully uniformed
emergency service unit officer ordered him to drop the weapon
several times. When he did not, the officer fired one time,
striking him in the chest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chin Young's daughter, Pauline Brown, said that her father
thought the police were burglars when they entered the foyer
shortly after 1 a.m. Mrs. Brown said she was on the phone with her
father when police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a loud bang and he said somebody was tearing off the
door,'' she said. ``He said, `One second,' and then I heard him
say, `Who's there?' Afterwards, there was another loud sound, then
the phone went dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Police later found an AK-47 rifle with 136 rounds of ammunition
and a .357-magnum handgun with 20 rounds in Leighton Chin Young's
apartment, although the bombs he was said to have been making never
materialized, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson Chin Young has been charged with attempted assault,
menacing and criminal possession of a weapon, police said. If it is
proven that he tried to assault a police officer, he could face up
to 15 years in prison. His son was arrested and charged with
criminal possession of a weapon when he arrived at the home after
the raid. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that the police raided the apartment after an informant ``who had
very good information in the past'' claimed that Leighton Chin
Young had been offering to sell homemade explosives on the street.
But neither Leighton Chin Young nor his father has a criminal
record, the investigator added.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Watson Chin Young had been skittish since he
was robbed in the building's foyer about three years ago by masked
men who also tried to enter his apartment. They disputed the police
account of the shooting, saying that the police had been trying to
ram down his door when he confronted them.

 Por JIM FREER 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    En los anos '80 Mexico era un pais solitario para banqueros como
Ralph Heid y Claude ``Hank'' Miller. Eran banqueros que se
dedicaban a recorrer las areas fuera de los centros tradicionales
de banca en el Distrito Federal y Monterrey, en busca de negocios
para sus superiores de Comerica en Detroit. Y en sus largos
recorridos rara vez se tropezaban con otros banqueros
norteamericanos, y mucho menos de Europa o Asia.
 &HT;    ``La mayoria de los bancos se concentraban en el DF y Monterrey,
pero nosotros opinabamos que habia companias excelentes en las
capitales regionales,'' afirma Heid, vicepresidente del
departamento de finanzas internacionales para America Latina de
Comerica. ``Estudiamos esas empresas y parabamos en una ciudad
importante cada vez que veniamos a Mexico.''
 &HT;    Comerica ha prosperado desde entonces. Los mexicanos ocupan los
primeros lugares de su lista de clientes internacionales, con
US$414 millones en prestamos pendientes a finales de 1997. En
general, el banco tenia US$2.200 millones en prestamos pendientes a
clientes fuera de EU, un poco mas del 7 por ciento de su portafolio
de US$28.000 millones. ``Tradicionalmente hemos trabajado con el
sector exportador en America Latina y con filiales de empresas
estadounidenses,'' dice Heid. ``Nuestra experiencia en relacion con
otros bancos no fue dolorosa. Las empresas a las que prestamos
servicios se centraban en la exportacion y continuaron generando
dolares para pagar sus prestamos.'' Con clientes en 14 ciudades
mexicanas y oficinas en los principales estados exportadores de EU,
Comerica ha aprovechado el TLC para convertirse en un banco sin
fronteras. ``Nosotros seguimos el curso natural del comercio entre
nuestros mercados en EU y America Latina,'' explica Heid, que tiene
un personal de 25 expertos que viajan con frecuencia a la region.
 &HT;    El exito del banco en Mexico se debe a su estrategia de
encontrar firmas prometedoras en lugares como Guadalajara,
Aguascalientes, Puebla y Chihuahua. Una asociacion claramente
ganadora fue con Internacional de Ceramica S.A. de C.V.
(Interceramic), uno de los principales fabricantes de ceramica de
Mexico. La relacion comenzo en 1989 y florecio cuando Comerica le
concedio varias lineas de prestamo a la empresa. En 1992, Comerica
era el principal suministrador de prestamos para capital de trabajo
de la firma. Al mismo tiempo, la empresa comenzo a expandir sus
ventas en Mexico y en EU, especialmente en Texas.
 &HT;    Comerica entonces lidero el camino cuando Interceramic buscaba
fondos para ampliar su planta principal en Chihuahua y construir
otra en las afueras de Dallas. En 1993, la Corporacion
Internacional de Finanzas del Banco Mundial entrego a Interceramic
US$38,5 millones para el proyecto de Chihuahua.
 &HT;    El ano siguiente Comerica emitio a Interceramic un prestamo de
US$8 millones para comprar maquinaria y equipamiento para su planta
de Texas. A pesar de los danos causados por la crisis del peso
mexicano en 1994 y 1995, Interceramic no tuvo dificultades en pagar
su deuda. Victor Almeida Garcia, vicepresidente del Consejo de
Administracion de Interceramic, dice que Comerica fue muy diferente
a los demas bancos de EU que tienen negocios con empresas mexicanas
porque estaba dispuesto a prestarle dinero sobre la base de revisar
sus facturas de exportacion.
 &HT;    En estos dias parece que a Interceramic le va viento en popa. El
ano pasado, la empresa tuvo ingresos de US$200 millones, un 56 por
ciento de esta cifra proveniente de sus ventas en EU. Interceramic,
que se cotiza en bolsa, tiene 2.500 empleados en Mexico y 700 en su
filial estadounidense. Fue fundada en 1978 por Oscar Almeida
Chabre, el padre de Victor, quien es ahora presidente de Consejo de
Administracion.
 &HT;    Heid y Miller dicen que Interceramic es la clase de compania que
un banco puede encontrar en Mexico si esta dispuesto a investigar y
a mirar mas alla de los mercados tradicionales y de mas
envergadura. Para emitir prestamos para sus clientes mexicanos,
Comerica usa oficinas en Estados Unidos, su filial en Mexico DF y
su representante en Monterrey. Miller es ahora director gerente de
la oficina en Mexico D.F. En Mexico, Comerica emite prestamos en
dolares y pesos mexicanos, y presta servicios de control de
efectivo y otros servicios de tesoreria.
 &HT;    Los prestamos a companias en otros paises de America Latina se
hacen a traves de la sede de Comerica en Detroit, Michigan. En
estos momentos se estudia la posibilidad de establecer una oficina
en Brasil, dice Heid, quien todavia tiene una apretada agenda de
viajes a Latinoamerica. ``Estoy alli cada dos o tres semanas,''
dice.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    En los anos '80 Mexico era un pais solitario para banqueros como
Ralph Heid y Claude ``Hank'' Miller. Eran banqueros que se
dedicaban a recorrer las areas fuera de los centros tradicionales
de banca en el Distrito Federal y Monterrey, en busca de negocios
para sus superiores de Comerica en Detroit. Y en sus largos
recorridos rara vez se tropezaban con otros banqueros
norteamericanos, y mucho menos de Europa o Asia.
 &HT;    ``La mayoria de los bancos se concentraban en el DF y Monterrey,
pero nosotros opinabamos que habia companias excelentes en las
capitales regionales,'' afirma Heid, vicepresidente del
departamento de finanzas internacionales para America Latina de
Comerica. ``Estudiamos esas empresas y parabamos en una ciudad
importante cada vez que veniamos a Mexico.''
 &HT;    Comerica ha prosperado desde entonces. Los mexicanos ocupan los
primeros lugares de su lista de clientes internacionales, con
US$414 millones en prestamos pendientes a finales de 1997. En
general, el banco tenia US$2.200 millones en prestamos pendientes a
clientes fuera de EU, un poco mas del 7 por ciento de su portafolio
de US$28.000 millones. ``Tradicionalmente hemos trabajado con el
sector exportador en America Latina y con filiales de empresas
estadounidenses,'' dice Heid. ``Nuestra experiencia en relacion con
otros bancos no fue dolorosa. Las empresas a las que prestamos
servicios se centraban en la exportacion y continuaron generando
dolares para pagar sus prestamos.'' Con clientes en 14 ciudades
mexicanas y oficinas en los principales estados exportadores de EU,
Comerica ha aprovechado el TLC para convertirse en un banco sin
fronteras. ``Nosotros seguimos el curso natural del comercio entre
nuestros mercados en EU y America Latina,'' explica Heid, que tiene
un personal de 25 expertos que viajan con frecuencia a la region.
 &HT;    El exito del banco en Mexico se debe a su estrategia de
encontrar firmas prometedoras en lugares como Guadalajara,
Aguascalientes, Puebla y Chihuahua. Una asociacion claramente
ganadora fue con Internacional de Ceramica S.A. de C.V.
(Interceramic), uno de los principales fabricantes de ceramica de
Mexico. La relacion comenzo en 1989 y florecio cuando Comerica le
concedio varias lineas de prestamo a la empresa. En 1992, Comerica
era el principal suministrador de prestamos para capital de trabajo
de la firma. Al mismo tiempo, la empresa comenzo a expandir sus
ventas en Mexico y en EU, especialmente en Texas.
 &HT;    Comerica entonces lidero el camino cuando Interceramic buscaba
fondos para ampliar su planta principal en Chihuahua y construir
otra en las afueras de Dallas. En 1993, la Corporacion
Internacional de Finanzas del Banco Mundial entrego a Interceramic
US$38,5 millones para el proyecto de Chihuahua.
 &HT;    El ano siguiente Comerica emitio a Interceramic un prestamo de

SHEFFIELD HELPS DODGERS BEAT MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Pro Player Stadium always seemed like a mercenary
territory for Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Big hits, no smiles, one ring, and like so many times before, a
ticket out of town.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sheffield returned here Thursday night for the first
time since the May 15th trade made him a Dodger, he stepped to the
plate with a flood of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over at my old manager (Jim Leyland) and it really
hit me,'' said Sheffield, who homered in the second and walked in
the 10th in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Florida
Marlins. ``I saw some faces in the crowd that I knew. I never
wanted to leave here. My dream was to win the World Series but I
never got to finish the dream, which also was enjoying the next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other players involved in the trade for Mike Piazza,
who had stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charles Johnson was born nearby and never left Florida
until he was sent to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, who took the night off with a sore left wrist
said he felt a lot of nostalgia. And Jim Eisenreich, nearing the
end of his career, walked with the bases loaded in the 10th to give
the Dodgers just their fifth victory in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield was the story. The crowd of 27,664 still had a
special place for him. After his first-inning home run, they booed
him out of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland showed him even more respect by walking him
intentionally with runners at first and second to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the night meant so much to Sheff,'' Dodgers
manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``He's a quiet guy who has been
misunderstood in the past. With the Marlins last year he finally
got his due, a World Series ring. Tonight was a homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield and his new teammates are about as far from a World
Series as the Marlins were when he joined them in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the victory the Dodgers are 7{ games behind the New
York Mets in the wild-card race with 35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's home run tied the game at 1-1 and was a big lift for
struggling starter Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mlicki walked five, he got the Dodgers to the late
innings. Scott Radinsky (6-5) replaced Mlicki to start the eighth
and pitched two scoreless innings to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marlins Justin Speier (0-2) did not allow a hit in
three innings, he walked three in the 10th to force home the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed this win,'' Mlicki said. ``We need to start
something, anything. This team is too good to play like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they won, the Dodgers continued to struggle against
unknown pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday it was right-hander Rafael Medina, who was making his
first start since being sidelined with shoulder trouble in April.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed four hits and one run in 62/3 innings with five walks
and four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers stranded 11 baserunners and now have 22 hits and 24
strikeouts in the first three games of this seven-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sheffield has picked it up at the plate after his first
true slump as a Dodger (1 for 18), the club is still not clicking.
That won't help when they get to Atlanta this weekend and face
Denny Neagle, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were the team Florida beat last year as a wild card
to go to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That was Sheffield's greatest career highlight but it wasn't
easy, before or since.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who reached the big leagues at 19, had a lot of
growing pains along the way. He and Marlins general manager Dave
Dombrowski _ the top candidate for the Dodgers GM position _ often
battled.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield signed a six-year, 61-million dollar contract
extension that upset fans.
</P>
<P>
   After the Marlins dismantled their team after the series
Sheffield did not win back the crowd when he made comments like
``Pay me and like it.'' Or ``I'd rather play here and rot,'' after
refusing to waive his no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that seems like a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best time of my life but it's over know,''
Sheffield said. ``Now it's time to bring a championship to Los
Angeles.''

ANGELS RIP TIGERS

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels have had to scratch and
claw for everything they've gotten this season, but Thursday night
they skated.
</P>
<P>
   A six-run third inning and five more in the fifth propelled the
Angels to a 13-2 rout of the Detroit Tigers before 27,548 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win the Angels maintained their 1{-game lead over Texas
in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels played nearly flawless baseball in all facets of the
game, with solid pitching, defense and offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 16 hits in all, but none left the ballpark. They
had 10 singles and six doubles as every starter but Orlando
Palmeiro had at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus and Gary DiSarcina had three hits
apiece, Garret Anderson had two doubles and Randy Velarde reached
base four times (two singles, two walks).
</P>
<P>
   It made for an easy night for Angels starter Omar Olivares, who
gave up two runs and seven hits in eight innings to get the win.
Olivares (7-8) struck out seven, walked one and is 2-0 with a 2.38
ERA in his past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, though, Angels manager Terry Collins raved
about his defense, which ranks fourth in the league in fielding
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not clobbering the ball, scoring six runs per
game, defense wins games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got Collins his six runs off Tigers starter Brian
Powell (2-4) in the third inning alone. It all started innocently
enough when Palmeiro led off with a strikeout. But the next six
Angels batters reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde singled, went to third on a double by Erstad and scored
on a wild pitch. Jim Edmonds singled in a run, Anderson doubled
home another and Glaus doubled in two more.
</P>
<P>
   One batter later, DiSarcina singled home the sixth run of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels batted around again in the fifth inning, DiSarcina
coming up with the big hit, a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Olivares started out the game by striking out the
side in the first and taking it from there. Tony Clark homered in
the fourth inning and Damion Easley's infield single in the eighth
drove home the Tigers' only other run.

ANGELS ROUT TIGERS 13-2

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels have had to scratch and
claw for everything they've gotten this season, but Thursday night
they skated.
</P>
<P>
   A six-run third inning and five more in the fifth propeled the
Angels to a 13-2 rout of the Detroit Tigers before 27,548 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win the Angels maintained their 1{-game lead over Texas
in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got a solid outing from starter Omar Olivares and had
enough offense _ 16 hits _ to beat the Lions on some nights, let
alone the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   But what impressed Angels manager Terry Collins more than
anything was the defense. Besides making all the routine plays,
they made the tough ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever been involved in a game where there
was a better defensive display in the infield. At every position,''
Collins said. ``We scored a lot of runs but every time (the Tigers)
started to put something together, we'd make a play.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Troy Glaus made four good plays, shortstop Gary
DiSarcina started a double play by fielding a chopper in the hole
and second baseman Randy Velarde made two outstanding plays. On one
of them, he ranged to his left in shallow right field to stop a
grounder by Gabe Alvarez and made a throw across his body for the
out. On the other, he barehanded a chopper and threw out Luis
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaus played as good a game at third base as you can play,''
Collins said. ``Gary played his normal game and Randy Velarde, on
that play to his left, it showed his (surgically repaired) arm is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Angels' 16 hits, none left the ballpark. They had 10
singles and six doubles as every starter but Orlando Palmeiro had
at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, Glaus and DiSarcina had three hits apiece, Garret
Anderson had two doubles and Velarde reached base four times (two
singles, two walks).
</P>
<P>
   It made for an easy night for Olivares, who gave up two runs and
seven hits in eight innings to get the win. Olivares (7-8) struck
out seven, walked one and is 2-0 with a 2.38 ERA in his past three
starts.
</P>
<P>
   While grateful for the offensive support, he also talked about
the defense after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes you a better pitcher,'' Olivares said.
``When you have good defense, when they're catching the ball and
making the plays, you're going to be more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about Glaus' offense. He hit 35 homers
between Double-A Midland and Triple-A Vancouver this year. But just
as impressive has been his adjustment to third base from shortstop,
where he played at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played 140 games there this year, so I'm more
comfortable,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of reading the ball
off the bat and getting the hops you want.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored six runs off Tigers starter Brian Powell (2-4)
in the third inning alone. It all started innocently enough when
Palmeiro led off with a strikeout. But the next six Angels batters
reached base.
</P>
<P>
   The first run scored on a wild pitch, then Jim Edmonds singled
home one run, Anderson doubled home another and Glaus doubled in
two more. One out later, DiSarcina singled home the sixth run of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels batted around again in the fifth inning, DiSarcina
coming up with the big hit, a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels have a huge road trip starting next week (10
games against the Yankees, Red Sox and Indians), Collins said it's
just as important the Angels take advantage of playing teams like
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you take teams for granted, he said. ``But you can't
do that this time of year.

BRONX MAN CHARGED IN FATAL STABBING IN GREENWICH VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A computer programmer who went to a Greenwich Village
hospital for treatment of gashes shortly after a man was stabbed to
death has been arrested in the Tuesday morning killing, police said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, Eric Carolina, 21, was picked up by detectives
at his home at 115 West 197th St. in the Kingsbridge section of the
Bronx on Wednesday night after investigators learned that he had
gone to St. Vincent's Hospital for treatment in the hours after the
victim, Fitzroy Green, 36, was killed in his Greenwich Village
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Carolina was arrested after discrepancies developed
in his account of meeting Green, whose body was found in his
apartment Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina has been charged with second-degree murder and criminal
possession of a weapon, police said. If convicted of the murder, he
could face up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Mr. Green had met Mr. Carolina in the early evening
and had invited him back to his apartment, where the murder took
place,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. Noting that police
had recovered the knife believed to have been used in the slaying,
he said: ``It appears the suspect caused his own wounds during the
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   An investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the
killing appeared to have occurred after Carolina discovered that
Green, who sometimes dressed as a woman, was a man.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator said Carolina claimed he met Green on a
Greenwich Village street and, after going with Green to his
apartment at 714 Greenwich St., became enraged when he discovered
Green's true sex.  &QL;

BRONX WOMAN SHOT TO DEATH IN FRONT OF SONS, 4 AND 6  
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx woman was killed in front of her two young
children Thursday after two gunmen forced their way into the
family's apartment demanding money and jewelry, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Almodovar, 31, was shot in the head at 443 E. 184th St.
in the Fordham section of the Bronx as her sons, ages 4 and 6,
watched, said Lt. Harry Scott of the 48th Precinct detective squad.
</P>
<P>
   The boys spent much of the evening in the precinct house, typing
and eating pizza and Tootsie Rolls until detectives located their
father, who does not live with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to be too shaken up,'' Scott said of the
children. ``It will probably sink in tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys told police that two men pushed in the door around 1
p.m. , and forced Mrs. Ms. Almodovar into the back bedroom, then
shot her as the boys looked on, police said. The gunmen fled. As of
Thursday night, police had made no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The motive may have been robbery, police said, but the apartment
had not been ransacked. Another possible motive may have been
revenge, police said. Ms. Almodovar's boyfriend, Julio Medina, is
awaiting trial on charges of murder in the death of Elvis Salcero
in May, in an argument over drugs, the authorities said. Ms.
Almodovar may have been killed in retaliation, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always with those kids,'' said a neighbor, Jeanette
Mojica. ``It's sad. She never let those boys out of her sight. She
never let anyone else take care of them. Now I don't know what's
going to happen to them.''

EVERYONE HAS OWN IDEAS ON U.S. STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday's U.S. missile attack on suspected terrorist targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan was a violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait, it was a righteous retaliation against murderers who
bombed U.S. Embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Or a political diversion tactic stolen from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word on Valley streets, anyway, where the lone
certainty seems to be that there is no consensus among metropolitan
Phoenix folks about what happened, or why.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Navarro, 22, of Chandler, is a hawk when it comes to
dealing with terrorists: ``We just need to kick their butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be able to get away with killing innocent
people. The president needs to show them that the United States is
not going to put up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Navarro's view prevailed, there were plenty of dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the United States has sunk to the terrorists'
level,'' said DeUndre Zackery, 26, of Phoenix. ``I felt it was
unwarranted to retaliate against two nations for attacks by
individuals. . . . The people in that chemical factory didn't have
anything to do with the bombings that killed U.S. citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Zackery argued that American justice requires proof of guilt
before punishment, yet the missile attacks amounted to a death
sentence without due process or a trial. And some of the victims
may have been innocent, he added, especially if the factory in
Sudan had stores of lethal chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Block, a 66-year-old Phoenix retiree, said there's a
difference between domestic crime and international terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acts of terrorism are tantamount to acts of war, and at some
point down the line it's got to require retaliation,'' he said.
``We're declaring war, big stuff. Apparently, the U.S. feels a
major attack deserves retaliation or major attacks will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath each argument, a secondary theme ran equally hot: Did
President Clinton manipulate the terrorism issue to divert public
attention from Monica Lewinsky, sex and perjury?
</P>
<P>
   As one woman put it, ``This is an opportunity for him to show
he's doing something besides sleeping with interns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that,'' Navarro responded. ``The president is
doing his job. He's doing what he has to do. Everybody should mind
their own business about President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Daggett, 39, Phoenix, said his first thought was about
``Wag the Dog,'' the movie about a scandal-ridden president whose
advisers fabricate a war to distract voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynics will think that, but I certainly don't. . . . The
Africa bombings are still fresh in people's minds, and he (Clinton)
didn't make those up,'' Daggett said. ``I think it's a legitimate
political maneuver. . . . I'm assuming that the Pentagon knew what
they were doing and the retaliation was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Smith, an Arizona State University professor who worked
at the White House during Watergate, said it's impossible to know
whether Clinton wagged the dog or acted on legitimate intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recalled that President Nixon suddenly issued a military
alert at the height of Watergate, based on a supposed escalation of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unprecedented, I would say, for national security
matters to be intruded'' by political concerns, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people interviewed Thursday discounted that
possibility, Valley Islamic leaders insisted it is the only
reasonable explanation for America's spasm of overseas violence.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference at the Islamic Community Center of
Phoenix, spokesman David Hadley said the crisis was contrived by a
desperate president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Operation Distraction,'' Hadley added. ``Anybody who
can't see it is in absolute denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadley and other Muslims condemned the embassy bombings in
Africa but said that America has fomented terrorism with a foreign
policy that discriminates against Arab and Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thursday's missile salvos, Hadley added, ``If anyone
believes this has done anything to send a message against
terrorism, they're dreaming. Clearly, it's a violation of
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ihsan Saadeddin, president of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination League, said he does not believe Clinton,
adding that the United States has offered no proof to justify a
military attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to take his word for it,'' Saadeddin
added. ``Show it to us. You cannot just claim something like this.
If you do, you've created more hatred, more enemies, over something
you have not proved.''
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Ahmad, a Palestinian immigrant and publisher of ``Arizona
Muslim'' ``Voice,'' predicted the Islamic world will almost
universally decry America's military action. He said the United
States' foreign policy smacks of hypocrisy when international law
is broken and of bullyism when a feeble country such as Sudan is
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the base country was China, would those missiles have been
launched?'' Ahmad asked.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the message of Thursday's missiles was directed
not just at fanatical bombers but at the nations that protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole terrorism thing is ridiculous,'' said Tim Pender,
38, a Chandler salesman. ``Maybe if we did this more often, you
wouldn't have these little countries giving refuge to
terrorists.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, straight after his testimony to the grand jury in
the matter of Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton took a gamble. It may
turn out to be the biggest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled that being found to have told lies about a sexual
fling does not merit a real apology.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that Americans believe his private behavior is his
own business and nobody else's. And he presumed that the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has nothing more substantial to
pin on him.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for watching, and good night.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of this gamble may not be clear even to the president
himself. It was presumably based, like everything else in this
media-struck presidency, on a close study of the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that most Americans have long considered him an
undeserving victim of Starr's investigation, Clinton spoke against
a backdrop that was understated, even funereal, and without any of
the flags and drapes that usually proclaim the authority of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   This was a man who is put-upon, not powerful. And since most
Americans have also said that the president's affair with Lewinsky
is a private matter, Clinton spent his fiercest moments defending
his right to a private life and lambasting Starr for his ``prying''
and ``personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no Richard Nixon, hunched and grey, trying to hold back
the almost palpable hatred of the public; it was a vigorous and
defiant performance. But what Clinton said was not good enough, and
it will not be the end of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   As the president well knows, sex was not the issue. Starr is
looking into obstruction of justice and suborning to perjury, and
here the polls have always shown considerable public unease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may well have perjured himself by denying the affair in
his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones case; and perjury is
perjury, even in a civil suit, and even in a case that has since
been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   His ``legally accurate'' denials, and his hairline distinctions
about perjury, made in his broadcast, did him no favors; they
suggest a man who will not hesitate to wriggle out of charges on
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now exposed the president's habit of lying. Clinton
had denied his affair on television: emphatically, pointing his
finger, and looking his countrymen in the eye. Having done that, he
allowed _ nay, encouraged _ his wife, his aides and even his
cabinet to repeat the lie.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, he assured Americans categorically that ``at no
time did I ask anyone to lie.'' That too may be ``legally
accurate.'' Politically, it could prove a ticking time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his ``false impression.'' he explained on Monday, to
shield himself from embarrassment and to protect his family. The
implication is that any ordinary American male would have done the
same. It is his private business.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. Presidents deserve their privacy, but this
does not mean, as it used to, that reckless immorality should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Modern presidents know full well that the popular trust depends
on their private, as well as their public, behavior. Clinton should
know it better than most; he salvaged his own presidential campaign
in 1992 by confessing to troubles in his marriage and suggesting
that he would amend them.
</P>
<P>
   And is presidential lying, which stalls not only a judicial
inquiry but also the day-to-day running of the country and even its
effectiveness abroad, really a private matter?
</P>
<P>
   The impulses behind it may be human and ordinary, but the
effects are not. It was the lying that needed _ and did not get _ a
proper, heartfelt apology from Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that other presidents have been caught out in bigger
lies, and have been forgiven. Eisenhower refused to acknowledge _
until Khrushchev rubbed his nose in it _ that American spy planes
were flying over Russia; Ronald Reagan denied, against all the
evidence, that arms had been traded for hostages in Iran. Both
men's popularity barely suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with job-approval ratings as high as Reagan's and an
economy as buoyant as Eisenhower's, may well feel he has an equal
chance of absolution. Yet his pattern of philandering and lying
means that his stock of trust and respect is already dangerously
low.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that almost no one wants to impeach him. But nor can
they believe in his moral authority. Without that, it is hard to
see how a president can function. Without that, as this paper has
said before, it would be better if he would go, to make way for
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that is not Clinton's plan. His best hope must now be
that nothing more emerges.
</P>
<P>
   This gamble is not entirely foolish. Starr has been slow in
gathering his evidence, to the point where it will have to be
startling indeed to make Americans care, or to stimulate Congress
into launching impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But he may yet turn out to have much more than Clinton supposes.
The president's admission of his affair showed that Starr, contrary
to expectations, had quite enough evidence to prove the Lewinsky
relationship beyond a shadow of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If the same thoroughness colors his broader inquiry, into
patterns of corruption and obstruction of justice, Clinton will be
in much deeper trouble. As indeed he will be if he is shown to have
told further lies during his four-minute TV address or his
four-hour grand-jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The burden is squarely on Starr. Until Monday night's broadcast,
the tedious prolongation of the inquiry could be blamed on
Clinton's stonewalling. Now that blockage is removed, the
independent counsel must quickly produce what he has, or shut up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defiance should be a goad to him: there are now
new-minted denials to refute. The president himself has raised the
stakes, and has gambled on keeping public opinion behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are that he may indeed have retained it, but
that it is brittle and distrustful. The image that may well linger
in the public mind is not of contrition, but of braggadocio in the
face of a net that is inexorably closing in. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days of fever in Washington, it can be salutary to
travel into the middle of the other, quieter America: say, to
Hastings, Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In 1879 two new railways intersected on the prairie, and around
this random ``X'' the town of Hastings was born. Within a dozen
years, 32 passenger and 75 freight trains chugged into its stations
daily, and Hastings became quite a place.
</P>
<P>
   The flat ocean of land that stretches for miles in all
directions brought forth corn and wheat aplenty; prosperous
enterprises lined the streets with fine architecture; the town
fathers built a handsome liberal-arts college.
</P>
<P>
   And here, in 1927, a prairieman invented a bright drink called
Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor made his fortune. Now the people of modern Hastings
hope his story will restore their fortunes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, like all Nebraska, has an enviable problem.
Unemployment is so low that employers cannot find workers.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate, like that of Hastings, is a mere 1.7
percent of the work force, compared with 4.5 percent in the rest of
America; in Hastings, it has been 2 percent or less for over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   And so Nebraskans are trying to persuade other Americans to join
them on the prairies, despite the steamy summers and freezing
winters, despite the absence of dramatic mountains or coastlines,
and despite the disconcerting habit of serving coffee that tastes
like dishwater before the inevitable steak.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Nebraska will air television advertisements
featuring homely Midwestern images designed to warm the hearts of
potential migrants: ``Genuine. Nebraska,'' the slogan goes.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, for its part, performed its own ceremony of boosterism
by celebrating Kool-Aid Day on Aug. 15. Children dressed up in
Kool-Aid costumes and visited the world's largest Kool-Aid stand.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody dressed as the Kool-Aid Man, the rotund cartoon figure
from the drink's TV ads, presented a proclamation to the city of
Hastings from Nebraska's governor, Ben Nelson, making Kool-Aid
Nebraska's official soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Nebraska's slogan, Hastings hopes its
association with Kool-Aid will make it sound ``genuine'': a simple
place, familiar and uncomplicated, like the America of aproned
housewives and black-and-white TV.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Kool-Aid's creation is most definitely genuine. A
boy working in his father's grocery store sends off for a manual on
how to become a manufacturer, then goes on to invent a cheap
product that mothers adore.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in a house made of prairie mud bricks,
unprotected from dust and grasshopper invasions, the inventor dies
a millionaire. But he gives much of his fortune back to the
prairies, through a variety of philanthropic gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, today's Hastings feels as genuine as this story.
One of the inventor's nephews has an office in the town center
where you can still find typewriters and manual ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   The proudest Hastings company, Dutton-Lainson, is still owned
and run by one family. Its vest-wearing patriarch, Hal Lainson,
presides at the age of 85 from behind his splendid antique desk.
His employees work hard, but go home for lunch with their families.
</P>
<P>
   He exudes Main Street contempt for the Wall Streeters who
constantly offer to arrange the purchase of his company, and boasts
of his indifference to the stock market's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps Kool-Aid is an apter symbol for Hastings than its
boosters would like. For there is another side to this drink's
story, less about small-town Nebraska loyalties than about American
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Perkins, the inventor whom Hastings now proudly claims,
actually spent only 11 years there: in 1931, four years after
hitting on the formula to reduce juice concentrate to crystals, he
moved on to Chicago, the better to distribute his product
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 he sold his firm to General Foods, which later merged
with Kraft. And so now, after a long odyssey, the product that
stands for farm-town virtue is managed from Rye Brook, near New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Kool-Aid's image has changed as much as its
headquarters. Time has marked the brand indelibly: Tom Wolfe's
``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' describes how the drink changes
when you put LSD in it; hundreds of cult members in Guyana
demonstrated the consequences of lacing it with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kool-Aid's marketers have done their best to stay
abreast of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s Kool-Aid sponsored a youth movement called Scouts
of the Stars and Stripes; from the 1970s, thrifty patriotism gave
way to flashing TV images set to disco rhythms, and later to
mountain bikes and snowboards and rap music.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, likewise, is more mobile and already more mixed than
its boosters say it is. The mayor comes from North Carolina; the
city administrator comes from Georgia; Latinos and Vietnamese have
made their homes there.
</P>
<P>
   A new delicatessen downtown now serves latte coffee; the
traditional stores, with names like Alan's Ace Hardware and Bert's
Drugs, compete with Walmart.
</P>
<P>
   Even the local farms have changed their character. Most of the
corn no longer goes to farm kitchens but to ethanol plants as
monumental as the federal subsidies they burn.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not surprising. America is always shifting,
and a town created by railways is part of this theme. At the same
time, America is always trying to manage the consequences of
mobility: it muffles rootlessness by talking about ``community'';
it clings to traditions, even imagined ones.
</P>
<P>
   And, just possibly, the imagined connection between Genuine
Nebraska and Genuine Kool-Aid will help bring Hastings new people.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Kool-Aid has quite a following. Enough sachets are
sold each year to reach from Hastings to Chicago 100 times over;
and there is a lively trade in discontinued flavors on the
Internet. Already a nursing association has chosen Hastings for its
convention because it is the birthplace of Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, sugary nostalgia may revive small towns across the
country. Not long ago, LeRoy, N.Y., celebrated the 100th
anniversary of Jell-O with a fine ceremony at its Jell-O museum. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In these days of fever in Washington, it can be salutary to
travel into the middle of the other, quieter America: say, to
Hastings, Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In 1879 two new railways intersected on the prairie, and around
this random ``X'' the town of Hastings was born. Within a dozen
years, 32 passenger and 75 freight trains chugged into its stations
daily, and Hastings became quite a place.
</P>
<P>
   The flat ocean of land that stretches for miles in all
directions brought forth corn and wheat aplenty; prosperous
enterprises lined the streets with fine architecture; the town
fathers built a handsome liberal-arts college.
</P>
<P>
   And here, in 1927, a prairieman invented a bright drink called
Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor made his fortune. Now the people of modern Hastings
hope his story will restore their fortunes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, like all Nebraska, has an enviable problem.
Unemployment is so low that employers cannot find workers.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate, like that of Hastings, is a mere 1.7
percent of the work force, compared with 4.5 percent in the rest of
America; in Hastings, it has been 2 percent or less for over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   And so Nebraskans are trying to persuade other Americans to join
them on the prairies, despite the steamy summers and freezing
winters, despite the absence of dramatic mountains or coastlines,
and despite the disconcerting habit of serving coffee that tastes
like dishwater before the inevitable steak.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Nebraska will air television advertisements
featuring homely Midwestern images designed to warm the hearts of
potential migrants: ``Genuine. Nebraska,'' the slogan goes.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, for its part, performed its own ceremony of boosterism
by celebrating Kool-Aid Day on Aug. 15. Children dressed up in
Kool-Aid costumes and visited the world's largest Kool-Aid stand.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody dressed as the Kool-Aid Man, the rotund cartoon figure
from the drink's TV ads, presented a proclamation to the city of
Hastings from Nebraska's governor, Ben Nelson, making Kool-Aid
Nebraska's official soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Nebraska's slogan, Hastings hopes its
association with Kool-Aid will make it sound ``genuine'': a simple
place, familiar and uncomplicated, like the America of aproned
housewives and black-and-white TV.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Kool-Aid's creation is most definitely genuine. A
boy working in his father's grocery store sends off for a manual on
how to become a manufacturer, then goes on to invent a cheap
product that mothers adore.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in a house made of prairie mud bricks,
unprotected from dust and grasshopper invasions, the inventor dies
a millionaire. But he gives much of his fortune back to the
prairies, through a variety of philanthropic gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, today's Hastings feels as genuine as this story.
One of the inventor's nephews has an office in the town center
where you can still find typewriters and manual ledgers.
</P>
<P>

   CHICAGO _ It was a typical story of urban woe. In 1983, Sears,
Roebuck closed the doors of its State Street store in Chicago after
51 years in business. Two neighboring retailers had gone bankrupt;
pedestrians had all but abandoned the street.
</P>
<P>
   End of the story? No. Sears is coming back. The retailer has
announced plans to open a five-story, 237,000-square-foot store on
State Street by the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a revival matched by the downtown areas of many other
American cities, Chicago's State Street is once again a place for
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   All Chicagoans can hum ``State Street, that great street.''
Alas, they have not always meant it. State Street was the heart of
Chicago's retail world in the early 1900s. The second half of the
century was not so kind.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers flocked to new suburban malls. Some Chicago retailers
went bust; others migrated to trendier Michigan Avenue. Then, in
1979, the city made bad worse by converting State Street into a
``transit mall.'' It was closed to all vehicles except public
transport; the pavements were widened to make it feel like a
suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   Far from attracting more shoppers, this repelled them. As the
planners have since learned, some spaces can be too open. The wide,
grey pavements were empty and uninviting. The increased bus
traffic, belching exhaust, made things still bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   By the time State Street hit bottom, seven department stores
with a total of 2.5 million square feet of retail space had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later, the city has taken another crack at
redeveloping State Street, and this time it has done a better job.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the transit mall was scrapped and traffic was
reintroduced in 1996. The pavements were narrowed from 36 feet to
26 feet, providing ``a pleasant sense of bustle.''
</P>
<P>
   The street got a $25 million facelift designed to recall its
greatness in the early 1900s: old-fashioned subway entrances,
landscaped flower beds, decorative newspaper kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The designers even found the company that made the first street
lamps in 1926, and ordered replicas. All this not only drew
sightseers, it won the American Institute of Architects' honor
award for urban design.
</P>
<P>
   And business followed the award. The total available retail
space in the State Street area increased by 8 percent between 1990
and 1997, and vacancy rates fell from 6.4 percent to 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmer House Hilton, a smart hotel just off State Street, is
enjoying its highest occupancy rate since it opened in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   The south end of the street has evolved into an ``education
corridor''; on one count, more than a dozen local universities and
colleges have come to show off here, bringing 40,000 students with
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time for downtowns in many parts of America. The
demand for office space is growing; consumers are spending freely.
</P>
<P>
   And a more subtle and potentially longer-lasting force is at
work: demographics. Young professionals are having children later
and are therefore staying in cities longer. (Many would not leave
at all, if the schools were better.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples whose children have
left home, are moving back to the city because it is more practical
than a big, empty house in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups have a taste for sports, culture and entertainment,
all of which can be found in town centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since the suburbs are now saturated with malls,
retailers are rediscovering downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's central business district has the second-largest
concentration of office space in North America. More than 15,000
workers walk by some downtown blocks every day. Many of them, with
more money than time, do their shopping there.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has a large new store on State Street; that is
where your correspondent buys baby diapers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a strong economy that has revived State
Street. The redevelopment program has made aggressive use of a
public-finance tool called tax increment financing (TIF), which
allows the city to finance economic development by tapping into the
future tax revenues it is expected to generate.
</P>
<P>
   The city identifies a specific area that is economically
stagnant and then issues bonds to pay for projects to give it a
boost _ anything from renovating historic buildings to subsidizing
private developers.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are later paid off by using the new tax revenues
generated by rising property values in the TIF district.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's mayor, Richard Daley, loves this device. The city has
created 44 of its 54 TIF districts since he was elected in 1989.
All told, they have earned $270 million in incremental property
taxes. The city boasts that each dollar of tax increment financing
generates $6 of private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that TIF often puts money in developers' pockets
for doing things they would have done anyway. They add that success
stories like State Street draw tenants away from other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The program also puts the government in the position of
parcelling out subsidies (Sears is asking for an undisclosed amount
of TIF money to help its move back to State Street).
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a way to raise money for economic development at
a time when Chicago's ration of federal money for such projects has
fallen by 56 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem is that the success of central business
districts has not spread to the poorer parts of America's cities.
Most cities will probably finish the decade more segregated by race
and class than they started it. Most are still losing middle-class
residents. The bulk of America's job growth is still in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to hold a parade to celebrate the rebirth of
America's cities. Still, you can take a very pleasant stroll down
State Street. &QL;

taxes. The city boasts that each dollar of tax increment financing
generates $6 of private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that TIF often puts money in developers' pockets
for doing things they would have done anyway. They add that success
stories like State Street draw tenants away from other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The program also puts the government in the position of
parcelling out subsidies (Sears is asking for an undisclosed amount
of TIF money to help its move back to State Street).
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a way to raise money for economic development at
a time when Chicago's ration of federal money for such projects has
fallen by 56 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem is that the success of central business
districts has not spread to the poorer parts of America's cities.
Most cities will probably finish the decade more segregated by race
and class than they started it. Most are still losing middle-class
residents. The bulk of America's job growth is still in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to hold a parade to celebrate the rebirth of
America's cities. Still, you can take a very pleasant stroll down
State Street. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Dozens of U.S. cruise missiles struck targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan on Thursday in what President Clinton
described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist
plots and of retribution for the bombings of U.S. embassies in East
Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were launched from ships in the Arabian and Red Seas
at dusk. It was not immediately clear whether the raids were a
military success. Pentagon officials said that no Americans died
but that they had no immediate estimate of other casualties or
damage. Early Friday, an Islamic press agency reported 15 deaths
from the bombings in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   With about 75 missiles timed to explode simultaneously in
unsuspecting countries on two continents, the operation was the
most formidable U.S. military assault ever against a private
sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were identified by Pentagon officials as an
extensive terrorism training complex in Afghanistan, 94 miles south
of Kabul, and a factory for the building blocks of chemical weapons
near Khartoum, the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his national security team linked both sites to
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire tied by U.S.
intelligence to the twin bombings on Aug. 7 in Kenya and Tanzania.
The bombings killed 12 Americans and nearly 300 Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who is in Afghanistan, apparently survived the
attack, which officials insisted was not aimed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear,''
Clinton said in an address from the Oval Office. ``There are no
expendable American targets. There will be no sanctuary for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for ordering the strikes without
permission from Afghanistan or the Sudan, saying, ``Countries that
persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stone-faced appearance marked his emergence from two
days of shelter from a howling political storm. He returned to the
White House on Thursday afternoon from vacation on Martha's
Vineyard, where he was trying to repair family ties damaged by his
admission Monday of an intimate relationship with a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president reappeared to describe an operation he had been
planning secretly for more than a week, even as he was meeting with
his lawyers to prepare a legal and political defense of himself and
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, President Omar el-Bashir called on his people to
protest the attack, saying on television, ``Sudanese people will
defend themselves.'' Earlier, Information Minister Ghazi
Salah-Eddin said the attack on what the Sudanese call a
pharmaceutical plant was ``a criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan, Mullah
Mohammad Omar, condemned the bombings, saying they showed an
``enmity'' for the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the strikes were intended
to ``cause sufficient damage to disrupt them for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented several reasons for the decision to act
swiftly and forcefully, rather than to punish bin Laden through the
means of diplomacy and law. Repeatedly he said bin Laden presented
an imminent threat, quoting his pledge this week to wage a war in
which Americans were ``all targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that ``key terrorist leaders'' were believed to be
gathering on Thursday at the compound in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ``convincing'' intelligence that bin Laden's
terrorist network was behind the embassy bombings. And he accused
groups tied to bin Laden of a host of murderous attacks and foiled
plots like killing international peacekeepers in Somalia and
planning to assassinate the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Republican leadership rallied to support the
raids, some members of Congress reacted suspiciously, noting that
the action followed by three days Clinton's acknowledgment to the
public and a grand jury of his relationship with former intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials scorned talk of a connection.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's motorcade abruptly left the borrowed estate where
he was secluded with his wife and daughter, reporters and
photographers who were idling at the entrance assumed that he was
going to play golf. Instead Clinton made a brief dramatic
appearance to announce the strikes. Clinton flew to Washington for
his Oval Office address as Ms. Lewinsky was testifying for a second
time before the grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the planning for the mission began
nine days ago, shortly after the bombings. Clinton was first
informed of the planning in the White House situation room Aug. 12,
and on Aug. 14 gave tentative approval for a mission.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the final go-ahead in a telephone conversation at 3 a.m.
Thursday morning with National Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials denied any plan to assassinate bin Laden,
saying they intended only to damage his network.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether bin Laden was a legitimate military target, Cohen
said, ``To the extent that he or his organization have declared war
upon the United States or our interests, then he certainly is
engaged in an act of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The missiles were timed to hit at 1:30 Thursday afternoon
Eastern daylight time, or 7:30 in the evening in the Sudan and 10
at night in Afghanistan. The twin attacks provided a certain
symmetry to the bombings in East Africa. Though seas apart, the
targets share a connection to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who moved to Afghanistan two years ago from the
Sudan, has continued to support the Sudanese military-industrial
complex, which operates the Al-Shifa factory that was bombed
Thursday. That factory, which has been said to manufacture
pharmaceuticals, in fact makes the components for VX gas and other
chemical weapons, the Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said bin Laden's network had ``been actively seeking to acquire
weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons for use
against U.S. citizens and our interests around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The target in Afghanistan was described as a vast compound
composed of a base camp, a support complex and four training camps
for teaching terrorists to plan attacks and use weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the site had been used to train ``literally
thousands of terrorists from around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States obtained the permission of Pakistan to send
missiles over its territory into Afghanistan, but evidently alerted
none of its major allies except the British. The president made a
round of telephone calls to foreign leaders after his
seven-and-a-half-minute speech at 5:30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The links between bin Laden and the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania were established by intelligence networks rather than by
the inquiry at the bombing sites led by the FBI, according to
law-enforcement officials. The officials said the intelligence
included statements that implicated bin Laden by one suspect,
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was apprehended in Pakistan and is now
being held in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh told Pakistani authorities after his arrest Aug. 7, the day
of the bombing, that he was a disciple of bin Laden. He also said
he was an engineer who had helped build the Nairobi bomb, U.S.
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders were briefed about the planned raid
Wednesday night and Thursday morning. For the most part, Republican
leaders praised Clinton's decision and urged more aggressive action
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed firm support, and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, said, ``Our response appears to be
appropriate and just.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more critical. Accusing Clinton of ``lies and deceit
and manipulations and deceptions,'' Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said
the president's record ``raises into doubt everything he does and
everything he says, and maybe even everything he doesn't do and
doesn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials dismissed such skepticism. Cohen said:
``The only motivation driving this action Thursday was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activities. That is the sole motivation. No other consideration has
been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   After the strikes Cohen ordered all military bases to increase
their states of alert. The United States on Thursday issued a new
worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel ``to
exercise much greater caution than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Clinton warned Americans that the strike would by
no means put an end to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a long, ongoing struggle,'' he said. ``America is
and will remain a target of terrorists.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the first family flew in for its annual summer
break in Martha's Vineyard, all seemed as normal: the warm embraces
for celebrity friends, the practiced small-talk for the waiting
crowd. But how can it be politics or, indeed, family life, as
usual?
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the day before the family vacation, the president
sat in the White House Map Room and spent more than four hours
testifying by closed-circuit television before a grand jury and its
grand inquisitor, independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The same evening, in a four-minute televised address watched by
68 million Americans, he told the people what he had told Starr:
that he had lied to them for seven months about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president then appealed to the nation to turn away from
Starr's inquiry, and to move on.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed a tall order. For Clinton was not merely confessing
to lying on Jan. 26, when he angrily denied on television any
sexual relationship with ``that woman''; he was also confessing
that he had lied on Jan. 17, when in a sworn deposition to lawyers
acting for Paula Jones _ who claims sexual harassment by Clinton in
1991 _ he said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so any ordinary viewer might conclude. But Clinton is not
known as ``Slick Willy'' for nothing. He is a lawyer, too, ever
ready _ indeed over-ready _ to play with words.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the careful crafting of his television address this week:
``As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions
about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were
legally accurate, I did not volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite so. By the Republicans' count of the publicly available
portions of Clinton's Jan. 17 testimony, the president's memory
failed him some 267 times. But since the Paula Jones case has now
been dismissed, many lawyers will argue that perjury in that case
would never be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be true of the allegations of suborning perjury
that stem from the same case: the allegation, for example, that
witnesses were pressured to amend their evidence of other
presidential gropings in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in the end, none of this will stick to Clinton;
perhaps, too, as he must hope, Starr will not manage to come up
with anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he is wrong? What if Starr presents Clinton's
misdeeds as part of a pattern of deceit that would justify the
punishment of Congress? This is what he is aiming at, and Clinton
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, in an implicit challenge to Starr, the direct-eyed
declaration: ``I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to
lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful
action.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim is a bold one, and it goes to the heart of what Starr
has been investigating. The Clinton past is littered with questions
for which answers are either absent or are not quite convincing.
</P>
<P>
   What were the Clintons, husband and wife, exactly doing in the
Whitewater property venture that failed in the 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   Why were seven employees in the White House travel office
dismissed in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Why did Vince Foster, the White House deputy counsel, apparently
commit suicide in 1993, shortly after filing three years'-worth of
delinquent Whitewater tax returns?
</P>
<P>
   Did Mrs. Clinton hide billing records connected with Whitewater?
</P>
<P>
   Did the Clinton administration improperly use FBI files on the
Reagan and Bush administrations?
</P>
<P>
   Was Webster Hubbell, a former associate attorney-general and a
partner with Mrs. Clinton in the Rose Law Firm, paid to keep silent
during 18 months in jail for fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Seeking that pattern has led Starr _ a man of absolutist
principles and, under the independent counsel statute, almost
limitless powers of inquiry _ to issue dozens of subpoenas, with
high and humble alike incurring legal costs that they, not the
government, will have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   To know Clinton, it seems, is to be a suspect for Starr; so no
wonder Clinton on Aug. 17 appeared not so much contrite as angry,
devoting _ apparently at the urging of Hillary _ half of his
address to an attack on his tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   But was it wise to mix attack with apology? Instant and
not-so-instant polls after the president's speech show his
job-approval ratings remain comfortably above 60 percent and, even
though half the population disapproves of Clinton ``as a person,''
more than two-thirds think he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Go beyond the incestuous political world within the Washington
Beltway, and the public does indeed express a wish to consign both
Whitewater and the Lewinsky saga to history. Clinton can look at
the first polls and take comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort, however, may be an illusion. Dick Morris, a
one-time adviser to Clinton (official links were severed after news
broke of an affair between Morris and a prostitute), accurately
noted that the president had appeared ``more angry than abject'';
he wished there had been ``more contrition in his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18 Morris took his turn before the grand jury, telling
it of conversations with the president back in January over the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he advised a forthright apology to the public; the
president looked at the polling data and decided it would not work.
The eventual apology, being so incomplete, may not work either.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, devil-may-care as it seems, is not immune from
the world of the pundits and politicians; and their verdict is
hardly encouraging for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   True, Al Gore, safely lodged in Hawaii, announced that Clinton
was a ``great'' and ``honest'' president; but as the man being
groomed by Clinton to succeed him, what else could Gore say?
</P>
<P>
   A more convincing reaction came from Dianne Feinstein, a
Democratic senator from California and a longtime ally of Clinton,
who said his address had left her trust in him ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dick Gephardt, the minority leader in the House of
Representatives, and Tom Daschle, his counterpart in the Senate,
said they were ``disappointed'' in the president.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the first family flew in for its annual summer
break in Martha's Vineyard, all seemed as normal: the warm embraces
for celebrity friends, the practiced small-talk for the waiting
crowd. But how can it be politics or, indeed, family life, as
usual?
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, the day before the family vacation, the president
sat in the White House Map Room and spent more than four hours
testifying by closed-circuit television before a grand jury and its
grand inquisitor, independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The same evening, in a four-minute televised address watched by
68 million Americans, he told the people what he had told Starr:
that he had lied to them for seven months about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president then appealed to the nation to turn away from
Starr's inquiry, and to move on.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed a tall order. For Clinton was not merely confessing
to lying on Jan. 26, when he angrily denied on television any
sexual relationship with ``that woman''; he was also confessing
that he had lied on Jan. 17, when in a sworn deposition to lawyers
acting for Paula Jones _ who claims sexual harassment by Clinton in
1991 _ he said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so any ordinary viewer might conclude. But Clinton is not
known as ``Slick Willy'' for nothing. He is a lawyer, too, ever
ready _ indeed over-ready _ to play with words.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the careful crafting of his television address this week:
``As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions
about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were
legally accurate, I did not volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite so. By the Republicans' count of the publicly available
portions of Clinton's Jan. 17 testimony, the president's memory
failed him some 267 times. But since the Paula Jones case has now
been dismissed, many lawyers will argue that perjury in that case
would never be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be true of the allegations of suborning perjury
that stem from the same case: the allegation, for example, that
witnesses were pressured to amend their evidence of other
presidential gropings in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in the end, none of this will stick to Clinton;
perhaps, too, as he must hope, Starr will not manage to come up
with anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he is wrong? What if Starr presents Clinton's
misdeeds as part of a pattern of deceit that would justify the
punishment of Congress? This is what he is aiming at, and Clinton
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, in an implicit challenge to Starr, the direct-eyed
declaration: ``I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to
lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful
action.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim is a bold one, and it goes to the heart of what Starr
has been investigating. The Clinton past is littered with questions
for which answers are either absent or are not quite convincing.
</P>
<P>
   What were the Clintons, husband and wife, exactly doing in the
Whitewater property venture that failed in the 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   Why were seven employees in the White House travel office
dismissed in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Why did Vince Foster, the White House deputy counsel, apparently
commit suicide in 1993, shortly after filing three years'-worth of
delinquent Whitewater tax returns?
</P>
<P>
   Did Mrs. Clinton hide billing records connected with Whitewater?
</P>
<P>
   Did the Clinton administration improperly use FBI files on the
Reagan and Bush administrations?
</P>
<P>
   Was Webster Hubbell, a former associate attorney-general and a
partner with Mrs. Clinton in the Rose Law Firm, paid to keep silent
during 18 months in jail for fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Seeking that pattern has led Starr _ a man of absolutist
principles and, under the independent counsel statute, almost
limitless powers of inquiry _ to issue dozens of subpoenas, with
high and humble alike incurring legal costs that they, not the
government, will have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   To know Clinton, it seems, is to be a suspect for Starr; so no
wonder Clinton on Aug. 17 appeared not so much contrite as angry,
devoting _ apparently at the urging of Hillary _ half of his
address to an attack on his tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   But was it wise to mix attack with apology? Instant and
not-so-instant polls after the president's speech show his
job-approval ratings remain comfortably above 60 percent and, even
though half the population disapproves of Clinton ``as a person,''
more than two-thirds think he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Go beyond the incestuous political world within the Washington
Beltway, and the public does indeed express a wish to consign both
Whitewater and the Lewinsky saga to history. Clinton can look at
the first polls and take comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort, however, may be an illusion. Dick Morris, a
one-time adviser to Clinton (official links were severed after news
broke of an affair between Morris and a prostitute), accurately
noted that the president had appeared ``more angry than abject'';
he wished there had been ``more contrition in his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18 Morris took his turn before the grand jury, telling
it of conversations with the president back in January over the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he advised a forthright apology to the public; the
president looked at the polling data and decided it would not work.
The eventual apology, being so incomplete, may not work either.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, devil-may-care as it seems, is not immune from
the world of the pundits and politicians; and their verdict is
hardly encouraging for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   True, Al Gore, safely lodged in Hawaii, announced that Clinton
was a ``great'' and ``honest'' president; but as the man being
groomed by Clinton to succeed him, what else could Gore say?
</P>
<P>
   A more convincing reaction came from Dianne Feinstein, a
Democratic senator from California and a longtime ally of Clinton,
who said his address had left her trust in him ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dick Gephardt, the minority leader in the House of
Representatives, and Tom Daschle, his counterpart in the Senate,
said they were ``disappointed'' in the president.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is a hard profession, and November's midterm
congressional and gubernatorial elections are fast approaching. No
leading Democrat is going to express more than ``disappointment'';
better to soldier on and hope the voters turn out.
</P>
<P>
   As Jennifer Laszlo, a Democrat loyalist, puts it, the economy is
good, the budget is balanced and the president ``is woven of the
same flawed fabric as we are.'' &QL;

CLEMENS HANDCUFFS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Roger Clemens needed minimal offensive support
Thursday night against a Mariner team skidding toward its first
meaningless September in four years. But the Toronto Blue Jays
provided their Rocket Man with a swift and decisive blastoff.
</P>
<P>
   A four-run first inning featuring Jose Cruz Jr.'s second home
run in as many games gave the Blue Jays and Clemens more than
enough of a head start to send the Mariners to a 7-0 loss before
26,642 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, which beat up Seattle pitching at SkyDome last week,
continued the onslaught at the Kingdome, adding 14 hits in Thursday
night's series finale to the 21 they amassed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As September gets closer, the M's are falling farther back in
the American League West. They have lost seven of their past nine
games and trail the division-leading Anaheim Angels by 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mariners insist they'll keep battling until the
season ends, the prospect of playing out the final month without
competing for a playoff spot holds little appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember what it's like because I did it for many years,''
designated hitter Edgar Martinez said. ``It's not fun. When you are
doing well the last month and fighting for a pennant, you can't
wait to get to the stadium. The days go by fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have anything to look forward to, it's not the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Septembers in 1995, '96 and '97 were fun.
</P>
<P>
   This one looms without much hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels and Rangers haven't been playing well,'' Martinez
said, ``so if we can just hang in until we get hot...''
</P>
<P>
   The only hot hands Thursday night belonged to Clemens and the
Blue Jays' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They jumped on us quick and Roger was on top of his game,''
Mariner manager Lou Piniella said. ``When you fall behind, it's
tough to come back against a good pitcher like Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran right-hander, who has one foot in the Hall of Fame
door, took a no-hitter into the fifth inning, losing the no-no bid
when David Segui chopped a grounder over Clemens' head and beat it
out for an infield single. Rob Ducey grounded a single to center in
the sixth and Joey Cora followed with another hit, giving Seattle
its only scoring threat of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens brushed the threat aside by retiring Alex Rodriguez
and Ken Griffey Jr., and retired 11 of the final 12 batters he
faced to win his 10th straight decision. It was his first shutout
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays apparently had a restful night after their 21-hit
assault in the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Their rising team batting average started escalating immediately
when five hits produced four runs in the first inning against Bill
Swift, attempting to become the Mariners' first 11-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   After Carlos Delgado blooped a two-run single into shallow
right-center field, scoring Shannon Stewart and Jose Canseco, Cruz
extended his career-best hitting streak to 14 games with a home run
into the right-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a fly ball,'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's seventh homer of the season was Toronto's eighth in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jays hit seven in Wednesday night's 16-2 victory, the most
homers Mariner pitchers ever had allowed in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Four runs would have been plenty for Clemens Thursday night, but
the Blue Jays kept tacking on runs, scoring again in the second
inning on Shawn Green's RBI single and twice more in the fourth on
RBI doubles by Green and Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hitting everything we threw at them,'' Swift said.
``I made some good pitches that were hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In their past four games against Mariner pitching, Blue Jay
hitters have accumulated 59 hits and scored 41 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Swift lost for the first time in 11 starts this season with four
days' rest. He had been 7-0 with a 4.14 earned run average. The 12
hits allowed Thursday night were the most for the right-hander in
24 starts.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been extenuating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a bad case of the hives two days ago,'' Piniella said.
``I don't know if that affected him, but it might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift (10-7) said he has been on anti-hive medication for the
past three days but didn't blame his performance on the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had nothing to do with it,'' he said. ``Roger threw a
great game and it didn't matter if it was one or seven runs.
Whenever you give him a four-run lead like that, it's going to be
tough to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, the only Blue Jay starter without a hit in Wednesday
night's carnage, doubled twice, singled, stole a base and scored a
run in his first four at-bats Thursday night. He has 28 stolen
bases and 23 doubles.

FORMER STARTER BURTON ON THE BUBBLE WITH SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ James Burton isn't exactly in, but he's
definitely not out, either.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran cornerback is sitting on the bubble as NFL teams
approach their final preseason games and first roster cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, like the 29 other teams in the league, must trim
their roster to 60 players by Tuesday and then make the final cuts
to 53 on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Burton appears to safe for now. But whether he is still around
after that final cut will be determined by how well he and a couple
of other defensive backs play in Friday night's game against the
Arizona Cardinals in Tempe, and in next week's preseason finale
against the San Francisco 49ers at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be here,'' Burton said. ``I'm playing nickel
back, cornerback, special teams. If they ask me to do it, and it
will help me make this team, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 27, is unlike most of the players who are facing the
wrong side of the cutdowns. He has played in the league, even
started games.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-round draft choice by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1994,
the former all-conference cornerback at Fresno State was released
on the final cut. But he was signed by the Chicago Bears and
started seven games the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His last season in Chicago almost became his last season,
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to quit football,'' he said. ``I was really
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton suffered a broken right leg in practice before the fifth
game of the season. He tried to return in November, but finished
the season on injured reserve. Not the type of season a player
wants to have when he is due to become an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a four-week injury that ended up being a four-month
injury because the Bears didn't handle it right,'' Burton said. ``A
lot of teams thought I was more hurt than I was. I didn't get any
calls at first. I didn't know what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton fired his agent because of it. Once he got a new agent,
he also got some interest. He selected the Seahawks over the
Buffalo Bills, because he wanted to stay on the West Coast, and the
49ers, because the situation was better in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If Burton is to stick with the Seahawks, he must beat out Reggie
Rusk for the fourth cornerback spot, or do enough on special teams
to convince the coaches he is worth keeping over rookie cornerback
Joey Eloms and safety Kerry Joseph as the ninth defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Reggie is No. 4. But those guys will be moving
around. We're not sure about them,'' defensive backs coach Dave
Brown said. ``At this point, James is showing he still has the
ability to play in this league. But we probably won't know what
we'll do with him until the last cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Long odds? Not for someone who longs to remain in the league as
badly as Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having started in this league before, I know that feeling,''
he said. ``But I also know if you're second string, you're going to
stick by playing special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Erickson will make next week's cuts in two groups
because he likes to meet with each player who is released. The
coaches will watch video of the game against the Cardinals on
Sunday, discuss the cuts later in the day and then meet again early
Monday to make the final decisions on who must stay and who should
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't depend on one game, it's the whole camp,'' Erickson
said. ``But there are some close battles there, so this game could
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: QB Warren Moon on Thursday signed the two-year
contract he agreed to last week. ... DE Phillip Daniels is doing a
pretty good impersonation of the Bionic Man. He returned to
practice Thursday after suffering a hyperextended right ankle
Wednesday. Daniels bruised his right kneecap in Saturday's game in
Vancouver against the 49ers, but practiced Monday. ... Erickson was
not happy when the No. 1 offense broke the huddle and went to the
line only to have a defensive coach point out that there was no
tight end on the field. ``Why the hell is that happening? Pay
attention,'' Erickson yelled. ... Play du jour: WR Robert Wilson's
reaching grab of a John Friesz pass as he was falling. ... The
Seahawks' EndZone Store will release the team's 1998 merchandise
catalog Monday. To obtain one, call 206-682-2900.

<P>
   Central Africa is on the brink. The rebellion in Congo has drawn
in its neighbors. The result, unless all sides draw back, could be
a conflagration involving half a dozen countries in the heart of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Congolese rebels, strongly backed by Rwanda and
to an extent by Uganda too, closed in on the capital, Kinshasa. As
they did so, Zimbabwe and Angola said they would be sending arms
and troops to help President Laurent Kabila fight them.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia is also believed to be sending him military aid. But
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, fearing a large-scale
regional conflict, has condemned the military rescue mission, and
appealed for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20 the rebels, recognizing that Zimbabwe's intervention
might swing the war against them, said that they were ready to
negotiate a cease-fire with the government. But military aid for
Kabila is said to be already arriving in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwean aircraft are reported to be flying equipment to
Kinshasa and to Lubumbashi, the capital of the southern province of
Katanga. Some 70-100 Zimbabwean soldiers are said to be already in
the country as ``advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Namibian newspapers say that 21 tons of military equipment have
been flown to Congo from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Angolan aircraft are reportedly ferrying Kabila's troops to the
front line though, as yet, there is no sign of Angola's fighter
planes _ which, if they come, could definitively turn the war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are a complex mixture, including Rwandan troops,
Tutsis from eastern Congo, remnants of the old army of Mobutu Sese
Seko, the man deposed by Kabila last year, and ex-supporters of
Kabila, both military and civilian.
</P>
<P>
   They are advancing west from Congo's eastern border but have
also flown contingents across the country to the west coast where
they hold the main port at Matadi, plus the nearby Inga Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Water and electricity supplies to Kinshasa have been
intermittently turned off during the past week. Western countries
have urged their nationals to leave Congo, and closed or reduced
their embassies in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Kabila's call to arms to repel a ``foreign
invasion,'' volunteers are being armed and rushed to the front.
``The operation for restoring territorial integrity has begun,''
said Congo's information minister. Yet, for a time last week, the
president made himself scarce, retiring to Lubumbashi in his home
area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, he travelled to Angola's capital, Luanda,
and on Monday sent Joseph, his son and deputy army commander, to a
meeting in Zimbabwe called by President Robert Mugabe. It was after
this meeting that Zimbabwe and the others announced their military
commitment to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   What next? It is hard to see a quick end. If Angola commits its
relatively well-equipped air force to Congo, it could close the
air-bridge the rebels are using to ferry troops from the east to
their western front. The rebels in the west would then be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In the east, however, neither rebels nor Rwandans are likely to
give up, despite their talk of a cease-fire. Under threat from Hutu
extremists, they believe they must have military control to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rebels were eventually to take Kinshasa, it would
not necessarily be the finish of Kabila. He would probably flee to
Lubumbashi and continue the fight from there. If the Katangans
backed him, the province could become virtually independent and
hard for the rebels to take.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Katanga tried to go it alone, in the early 1960s,
it was forced back into Congo with the assistance of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and the other African leaders backing Kabila see him as
the only alternative to the breakup of Congo. They believe Rwanda
and Uganda want to carve out eastern Congo for themselves. But
their intervention has opened up differences between the region's
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Africa, Mandela's fierce opposition to Mugabe's
military support for Kabila could tear apart the 14-member Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC), which was supposed _ with
American help _ to become the peacekeeping and security
organization for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and Mugabe were already at odds over who should lead
SADC; now they are deeply split on what it should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, Rwanda and Uganda both back the rebels but
disagree on strategy. Uganda wants eastern Congo to be under the
control of an authority that does not allow its rebels to use it as
a springboard for cross-border attacks; it does not think it
necessary to change the government in Kinshasa to achieve this.
Rwanda, on the other hand, does.
</P>
<P>
   The only sensible result would be if the South Africans
succeeded in making Kabila and the rebel leaders negotiate peace
with one another. If this does not happen, the prospect of a larger
war, and the breakup of Congo, draw ever closer. &QL;

POPULISM HAS SECOND CHANCE WITH SEAHAWKS STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Before construction of the new baseball park commences
in Pittsburgh this winter, some fans there wanted a say in the name
of the park, something to reflect a little more on the team's
heritage and a little less on the tax write-off virtues for some
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   One idea that gained popularity invoked the name of the greatest
Pirate of them all, Roberto Clemente. As in, Humongoid Corporation
Park at Clemente Field.
</P>
<P>
   For a franchise with as much history and tradition as the
Pirates, the idea sounded halfway decent.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the name of the park?
</P>
<P>
   PNC Park. Period.
</P>
<P>
   A local bank two weeks ago bought the naming rights, for $30
million over 20 years. No Clemente. No Bill Mazeroski. Not even
Smoky Burgess Burger Barn.
</P>
<P>
   If there were ever a majestic sports figure worthy of
stadium-naming immortality it was Clemente, the four-time batting
champion and 18-year Pirate hero who died at age 38 flying in a
rescue mission to his earthquake-devastated homeland of Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, power, nobility _ Clemente was the best thing this side
of the New Testament. And since he died at the height of his
luminousness as a Pirate, there was no danger of a backfire.
(Imagine: On the day that Griffey Park is announced in Seattle,
Junior demands a trade to a contender.)
</P>
<P>
   As a sop to those wanting to honor the man, the council of
viziers in Pittsburgh changed the name of a bridge nearest the
ballpark to Clemente Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Coming next: the Dick Groat Goatfield.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, populist sentiment has no more sway in Pittsburgh
than in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that concept was in the spotlight in Seattle in
June, when Bob Wallace, a board member of the Public Facilities
District overseeing the half-billion-dollar monument to
millionaires, went ballistic over those who would challenge the
park's new name of Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely outrageous,'' Wallace fumed. ``The Mariners will be
apoplectic. ... To screw up $40 million in naming rights is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had his way, and Safeco Field stuck. But not before
stirring some fans incensed at the arrogance displayed by the
Bellevue developer.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was, of course, futile, because the state granted
the Mariners stadium naming rights in its enabling legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It would have taken a visionary legislator or governor to have
included a provision for a symbolic naming touch that would have
fooled at least some into thinking that their $370 million in tax
money was buying them something.
</P>
<P>
   But a visionary politician in this state is harder to find than
consecutive outs from the Mariner bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   So the fact that some were surprised over the name game is
attributable to negligent citizenship. Nor is the dismay any fault
of the local insurance shop.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco spokesman Gordon Hamilton, who said the stadium-naming
issue hasn't returned to his attention in more than a month, said
nothing has changed since his fanciful turn of phrase when he
politely told protesters to drop dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a newspaper clip in which I was quoted as saying, `If
it's anything different, it's not the same,''' he said, chuckling.
``Some put that just below Yogi Berra, but I think it's quite
profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Profound or profane, Safeco's position about a compromise is
unyielding: They paid $40 million over 20 years for exclusivity in
the name. If something else were required in the name, they would
have bid less.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The more clever you get (with additional words), the more
people will use it,'' Hamilton said. ``It's not what we paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   My choice for an appellation appendage was not person-related.
In fact, the only Mariner name that had any validity was Dave
Niehaus. But the Nie-House nickname, however deserved, doesn't
exactly reflect nobly on the baseball heritage when the best thing
to be said about a franchise is that it had a good announcer (Cubs
excepted).
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion came from a recent tour of the unfinished yard,
and the nose hit enjoyed at a stop on the southwest-corner
promenade with views of the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Saltair Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's sensory rather than intellectual (just like baseball's
appeal), apt for the Mariner name, neither exclusionary nor
discriminatory, costs nothing to provide and is unique to Seattle.
Even ``Saltair at Safeco'' has just a bit of rhythm to it.
</P>
<P>
   But unless someone offers $10 million or so to Safeco to back
down and share the marquee, it isn't gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a second chance in town. As you may have
read, another ballpark is going up right next to Safeco Field. For
unfathomable reasons, it, too, will be open to the elements. In
fact, the salt air most of the time will be coming in hard, quickly
and horizontally aboard raindrops. It will be an even more vivid
sensory experience.
</P>
<P>
   So, populists, you are four years out from the opening of the
new football yard. Can't say you weren't alerted.
</P>
<P>
   Unless of course, Paul Allen says he needs the money from naming
rights.

   Central Africa is on the brink. The rebellion in Congo has drawn
in its neighbors. The result, unless all sides draw back, could be
a conflagration involving half a dozen countries in the heart of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Congolese rebels, strongly backed by Rwanda and
to an extent by Uganda too, closed in on the capital, Kinshasa. As
they did so, Zimbabwe and Angola said they would be sending arms
and troops to help President Laurent Kabila fight them.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia is also believed to be sending him military aid. But
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, fearing a large-scale
regional conflict, has condemned the military rescue mission, and
appealed for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20 the rebels, recognizing that Zimbabwe's intervention
might swing the war against them, said that they were ready to
negotiate a cease-fire with the government. But military aid for
Kabila is said to be already arriving in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwean aircraft are reported to be flying equipment to
Kinshasa and to Lubumbashi, the capital of the southern province of
Katanga. Some 70-100 Zimbabwean soldiers are said to be already in
the country as ``advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Namibian newspapers say that 21 tons of military equipment have
been flown to Congo from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Angolan aircraft are reportedly ferrying Kabila's troops to the
front line though, as yet, there is no sign of Angola's fighter
planes _ which, if they come, could definitively turn the war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are a complex mixture, including Rwandan troops,
Tutsis from eastern Congo, remnants of the old army of Mobutu Sese
Seko, the man deposed by Kabila last year, and ex-supporters of
Kabila, both military and civilian.
</P>
<P>
   They are advancing west from Congo's eastern border but have
also flown contingents across the country to the west coast where
they hold the main port at Matadi, plus the nearby Inga Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Water and electricity supplies to Kinshasa have been
intermittently turned off during the past week. Western countries
have urged their nationals to leave Congo, and closed or reduced
their embassies in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Kabila's call to arms to repel a ``foreign
invasion,'' volunteers are being armed and rushed to the front.
``The operation for restoring territorial integrity has begun,''
said Congo's information minister. Yet, for a time last week, the
president made himself scarce, retiring to Lubumbashi in his home
area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, he travelled to Angola's capital, Luanda,
and on Monday sent Joseph, his son and deputy army commander, to a
meeting in Zimbabwe called by President Robert Mugabe. It was after
this meeting that Zimbabwe and the others announced their military
commitment to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   What next? It is hard to see a quick end. If Angola commits its
relatively well-equipped air force to Congo, it could close the
air-bridge the rebels are using to ferry troops from the east to
their western front. The rebels in the west would then be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In the east, however, neither rebels nor Rwandans are likely to
give up, despite their talk of a cease-fire. Under threat from Hutu
extremists, they believe they must have military control to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rebels were eventually to take Kinshasa, it would
not necessarily be the finish of Kabila. He would probably flee to
Lubumbashi and continue the fight from there. If the Katangans
backed him, the province could become virtually independent and
hard for the rebels to take.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Katanga tried to go it alone, in the early 1960s,
it was forced back into Congo with the assistance of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and the other African leaders backing Kabila see him as
the only alternative to the breakup of Congo. They believe Rwanda
and Uganda want to carve out eastern Congo for themselves. But
their intervention has opened up differences between the region's
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Africa, Mandela's fierce opposition to Mugabe's
military support for Kabila could tear apart the 14-member Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC), which was supposed _ with
American help _ to become the peacekeeping and security
organization for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and Mugabe were already at odds over who should lead
SADC; now they are deeply split on what it should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, Rwanda and Uganda both back the rebels but
disagree on strategy. Uganda wants eastern Congo to be under the
control of an authority that does not allow its rebels to use it as
a springboard for cross-border attacks; it does not think it
necessary to change the government in Kinshasa to achieve this.
Rwanda, on the other hand, does.
</P>
<P>
   The only sensible result would be if the South Africans
succeeded in making Kabila and the rebel leaders negotiate peace
with one another. If this does not happen, the prospect of a larger
war, and the breakup of Congo, draw ever closer. &QL;

<P>
   Central Africa is on the brink. The rebellion in Congo has drawn
in its neighbors. The result, unless all sides draw back, could be
a conflagration involving half a dozen countries in the heart of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Congolese rebels, strongly backed by Rwanda and
to an extent by Uganda too, closed in on the capital, Kinshasa. As
they did so, Zimbabwe and Angola said they would be sending arms
and troops to help President Laurent Kabila fight them.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia is also believed to be sending him military aid. But
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, fearing a large-scale
regional conflict, has condemned the military rescue mission, and
appealed for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20 the rebels, recognizing that Zimbabwe's intervention
might swing the war against them, said that they were ready to
negotiate a cease-fire with the government. But military aid for
Kabila is said to be already arriving in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwean aircraft are reported to be flying equipment to
Kinshasa and to Lubumbashi, the capital of the southern province of
Katanga. Some 70-100 Zimbabwean soldiers are said to be already in
the country as ``advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Namibian newspapers say that 21 tons of military equipment have
been flown to Congo from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Angolan aircraft are reportedly ferrying Kabila's troops to the
front line though, as yet, there is no sign of Angola's fighter
planes _ which, if they come, could definitively turn the war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are a complex mixture, including Rwandan troops,
Tutsis from eastern Congo, remnants of the old army of Mobutu Sese
Seko, the man deposed by Kabila last year, and ex-supporters of
Kabila, both military and civilian.
</P>
<P>
   They are advancing west from Congo's eastern border but have
also flown contingents across the country to the west coast where
they hold the main port at Matadi, plus the nearby Inga Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Water and electricity supplies to Kinshasa have been
intermittently turned off during the past week. Western countries
have urged their nationals to leave Congo, and closed or reduced
their embassies in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Kabila's call to arms to repel a ``foreign
invasion,'' volunteers are being armed and rushed to the front.
``The operation for restoring territorial integrity has begun,''
said Congo's information minister. Yet, for a time last week, the
president made himself scarce, retiring to Lubumbashi in his home
area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, he travelled to Angola's capital, Luanda,
and on Monday sent Joseph, his son and deputy army commander, to a
meeting in Zimbabwe called by President Robert Mugabe. It was after
this meeting that Zimbabwe and the others announced their military
commitment to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   What next? It is hard to see a quick end. If Angola commits its
relatively well-equipped air force to Congo, it could close the
air-bridge the rebels are using to ferry troops from the east to
their western front. The rebels in the west would then be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In the east, however, neither rebels nor Rwandans are likely to
give up, despite their talk of a cease-fire. Under threat from Hutu
extremists, they believe they must have military control to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rebels were eventually to take Kinshasa, it would
not necessarily be the finish of Kabila. He would probably flee to
Lubumbashi and continue the fight from there. If the Katangans
backed him, the province could become virtually independent and
hard for the rebels to take.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Katanga tried to go it alone, in the early 1960s,
it was forced back into Congo with the assistance of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and the other African leaders backing Kabila see him as
the only alternative to the breakup of Congo. They believe Rwanda
and Uganda want to carve out eastern Congo for themselves. But
their intervention has opened up differences between the region's
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Africa, Mandela's fierce opposition to Mugabe's
military support for Kabila could tear apart the 14-member Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC), which was supposed _ with
American help _ to become the peacekeeping and security
organization for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and Mugabe were already at odds over who should lead
SADC; now they are deeply split on what it should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, Rwanda and Uganda both back the rebels but
disagree on strategy. Uganda wants eastern Congo to be under the
control of an authority that does not allow its rebels to use it as
a springboard for cross-border attacks; it does not think it
necessary to change the government in Kinshasa to achieve this.
Rwanda, on the other hand, does.
</P>
<P>
   The only sensible result would be if the South Africans
succeeded in making Kabila and the rebel leaders negotiate peace
with one another. If this does not happen, the prospect of a larger
war, and the breakup of Congo, draw ever closer. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating America this week has been like watching a
gigantic edition of The Jerry Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the usual procession of dysfunctional
representatives of the U.S. underclass, falling over their own
blubber and ponytails in an attempt to knock five kinds of
theatrical crap out of each other, we have _ up on stage (a big
hand folks!) _ Bill, Monica, Ken Starr, Hillary, Linda Tripp and as
many others as can be conceivably subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the audience made up of the usual mischievous voyeurs,
who enjoy nothing better than to yell ``whoarrr!'' in mock horror
whenever a fight looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   No, this special show is being conducted entirely in front of a
handpicked audience of sober-suited media commentators, columnists,
political journalists, presenters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   The strapline at the bottom of the screen reads, ``They Had Sex.
Or Did They?'' This event is (unlike the alleged sex itself) both
salacious and exhausting. And clearly, for those in the audience,
it is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   For what is truly remarkable about the Monica Lewinsky affair is
how the American people themselves say ``it isn't that important,''
and how most journalists seem to come up with ever more ingenious
arguments for why it is, in fact, the biggest show in town. And why
it should never, ever, end.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there seems to be a wide agreement among pundits that
Bill Clinton's rather pathetic address to the nation on Monday
night could not represent the final stage of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been frank enough. Nor had the president, apparently,
answered all of Ken Starr's detailed questions earlier about
exactly what he and Lewinsky had done.
</P>
<P>
   This, you see, was important when establishing whether Clinton
had grounds for saying that what happened did not constitute a
sexual relationship. He should, said the broadsheet press (both
here and over there), have answered these questions candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Reading the gossipy Drudge Report on the Internet this
morning, I came across this line: ``The DRUDGE REPORT has learned
that Monica Lewinsky, when asked by prosecutors if the president
performed `cunnilingus' on her, responded by saying she did not
know what the word `cunnilingus' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ken Starr asked Clinton the same question. Or perhaps
the independent counsel asked the president, in detail, about the
suggestion that Bill had allowed Monica to fellate him for a while,
and had then procured his own climax while the chubby intern danced
a little Salome number on the Oval Office carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that their conversation turned to the propulsive
qualities of the presidential semen, and its capacity for landing
far away. Anyway, Clinton refused to answer such queries, labelling
them as ``intrusive,'' whereas the conventional wisdom is that he
should have replied candidly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget why all this semen and cunnilingus stuff is
supposed to matter. In 1991, before he was elected, Clinton
probably (though he denies it) showed his willy to a woman called
Paula Jones in a hotel bedroom. She did not want to see it, told
him so, and he put it away again.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later she filed a case against him for sexual
harassment, and subpoenaed everyone that might have had any carnal
knowledge of him.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Linda Tripp bearing tapes, enter Monica Lewinsky, enter
Clinton's evasion (or lie) to the Paula Jones grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's case _ a civil one _ was dismissed, not because of
Clinton's testimony, but because the allegation did not amount to
harassment. But by now Ken Starr was on the case. If Clinton had
fibbed then, he was a perjurer. If he had attempted to get Monica
to fib, then he was suborner.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the fact that the original case had come to nothing,
despite the fact that the Monica relationship was (according to
her) consensual, if Ken could show that there had been knobbing,
then he had his man by the short and curlies.
</P>
<P>
   A Martian, landing on earth at this point, might wonder at the
sanity of the whole business. Indeed, an American landing in
Washington might wonder the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to go into the question of whether lying in court
about your consensual sexual relationships constitutes perjury or
not. If it does, then it's a perjury that many decent people would
commit, and feel themselves entitled to commit. Most Americans know
this, even if the press doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that several good American presidents have
strayed, some far more egregiously than Bill. And they no more
expect to judge presidents by their lower body polkas, than they
query the world-renowned surgeon who ogles the anesthetist, or the
skilled pilot with a girl in every airport. But, according to the
press, they haven't truly understood.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's Washington Post, for instance, the comment was
universally unfavorable to Clinton. Columnist David Broder
encapsulated the argument when he disputed Clinton's claim that it
was nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that it were so,'' intoned Broder, piously. ``But he
made it our business _ the nation's burden _ first by showing utter
disrespect for the high office he holds, and second by refusing all
this time to do what he alone could do: clear up the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Broder even invoked a previous crisis. ``He (Clinton) not only
lied to Paula Jones's lawyers, he lied to the public and to his
closest political associates, and implicated the leaders of his
party and his government in the deception. In all those respects,
Clinton's behavior is truly Nixonian.''
</P>
<P>
   This is such staggering rubbish, that it makes one despair.
Nixon engaged in a criminal conspiracy to burgle opponents, and to
cover up the results.
</P>
<P>
   He and Kissinger also connived at the secret destruction of
Cambodia, the overthrow of the democratically elected government of
Chile, and the unnecessary bombing of North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents waged secret war against Cuba, organized the
military removal of the progressive and elected government of
Guatemala (with the consequence of the deaths of many thousands of
innocent people), fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and _
latterly _ permitted Contragate.
</P>
<P>
   And this litany of presidential sins is supposed to be less
serious than fibbing about muff-diving? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   At least one serious article in a major British broadsheet
newspaper this week seemed to suggest that Clinton has showed
himself to be unfit for the presidency, by reason of having sex
with Monica Lewinsky yet ``not reciprocating any affection or
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the excuse of the trivializer everywhere, the alibi of
the TV executive who cuts the current affairs program, and brings
in yet another ``people show.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tortuous tergiversations have a parallel in those of
the press, who have been happily complicit in this heroic
trivialization of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the difficult, intractable problems, the ones where lives
hang in the balance. Forget the Congo. Forget the environment. As
the planet heats up, there's only one kind of emission control that
they're interested in.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, we're now told (having passed through fraud, perjury
and cover-up), is ``character.'' And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Soviet Union was dubbed ``Upper Volta with missiles.''
Today the U.S. is Oprah with nukes. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.

   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

   Remember rock'n'roll? Remember feminism? Those were the warm-up
acts. They were cultural revolutions of power and moment, but the
main attraction, the baby boomers' ultimate coup and 21st century's
first Big Idea, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   What? you say. Bigger than the invention of the teenager? Bigger
than civil rights? Bigger than the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ because the last, best thing the baby boomers are
going to do in this world they've created in their own image is to
grow very old.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit us yet, but soon old people will be the happening
demographic _ between the years 2010 and 2030, the over-65
population in the U.S. will increase by 75 percent, to more than 69
million souls.
</P>
<P>
   To put their consumer spending power in perspective, consider
that the Census Bureau estimates there are now just under 20
million 15- to 19-year-old ne'er-do-wells afoot. And just look at
how much marketing hype they get, given that most of them don't
have jobs, let alone estates.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a brave new world in which baby boomers redefine what it
means to be old.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly we know in 1998, our parents and grandparents,
contracted with the government (via the Social Security Act of
1935) and private industry (pension plans had become widespread by
the 1930s) to work with Protestant doggedness for 20 years or more
and then to STOP completely and play golf or else sit in a chair
and watch the neighbors come and go from the front window.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current rate of increase in both life expectancy and
quality of life, that scenario doesn't look so viable anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be-elderly baby boomers haven't worked in
anticipation of a gold watch and a fare-thee-well at 65. Unlike
their parents, they haven't worked for one company, they've
accumulated their own irritatingly-complex-tax-situation estates,
and they will no longer be put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible that by 2030, the golf-and-bridge model of
senior citizenship will be a thing of the past. For one thing,
older Americans will want to work. In some cases they'll stay with
their jobs longer. In other cases they'll work part-time, perhaps
as interns, often as volunteers, in entirely new fields, or they'll
undertake the advanced study of fascinating but unremunerative
things (comparative lit, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   The concept of senior leisure will evolve, too, away from
passive, pleasant time fillers toward more dynamic activities: a
sail around the world, say, instead of an Alaskan cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Work, pleasure, or a combination _ it all depends on your
priorities, and the way things are headed, you'll have time for
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to say `elderly' or `senior.' We prefer the term
`Third Age,''' says a spokesman for Third Age Media, which operates
a Web site (www.thirdage.com) for the 50-plus American.
</P>
<P>
   The division of ages into quarters of a hundred is bold and apt:
Recapture the under-65 set (the 50-plussers) and you reinvigorate
the concept of aging entirely. (Also ignore the fact that 0 to 25
isn't exactly a lifestyle category, though no less so than 25 to
50).
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of such thinking will be your 60-year-old college
students and consumers of retail goods. Pretty soon the middle
years will be the necessary evil, and retirement will come to seem
the be-all in addition to the end-all.
</P>
<P>
   There's no innate reason why it shouldn't. Among the Dagara of
West Africa, old age and childhood are held to be the important
times in life, the times when one does great work.
</P>
<P>
   Children and the ``elders,'' being chronologically closer to the
spirit world, hang out together and discuss the meaning of life,
while those in their middle years are seen as more or less taking
up space, providing little more than manual labor to feed the wise
children and elders.
</P>
<P>
   This might not be such a bad model for 21st-century America,
after all: Live like hell in the First Age, pay for it in the
Second, and do it right this time in the Third.
</P>
<P>

yourself an elder and go for broke _ the statistics are in your
favor. &QL;

<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one way millions of American have to get rich _ or at
least richer _ quick. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one way millions of American have to get rich _ or at
least richer _ quick. &QL;

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Who can forget Crocodile Dundee?
 &HT;    More than a decade ago the backwoods Australian arrived in
America in the form of the wry, irrepressible Paul Hogan and took
the box office by storm in two Dundee adventures.
 &HT;    He hosted the Oscars, adding a much needed touch of Aussie
irreverence to the whole overhyped proceedings and became the
definite flavor of the year.
 &HT;    While Dundee disappeared into the bush somewhere Down Under,
Hogan stuck around. He made a handful of movies _ none of which
came close to duplicating his Dundee popularity.
 &HT;    Today Hogan lives in Santa Barbara with his Dundee costar, now
his wife, Linda Kozlowski. She gave birth on Aug. 10 to their first
son, Chance. (Hogan, 58, has five children and eight grandchildren
from an earlier marriage.)
 &HT;    He also has an offbeat new movie in which he is virtually
unrecognizable from the weatherbeaten, wisecracking wild man of Oz.
``Floating Away,'' (airing Aug. 30 on Showtime) is a picaresque
comedy drama with Rosanna Arquette as a boozy mother trying to
regain custody of her baby. Along the way she meets Shane (Hogan),
a womanizing, reformed alcoholic, and a paraplegic.
 &HT;    If Hogan was trying to shatter his swaggering Dundee image, this
role would seem a good place to start. Yet Shane shareS two
important traits with Dundee, Hogan said: ``Shane has a crusty
humor and he's the biggest liar in the world.''
 &HT;    Indeed the movie's running gag is that every woman hears a
different story of how Shane happens to be in a wheelchair. He's an
ex-stuntman, he brags to one lass, and while working on a film with
Raquel Welch, she insisted he make love to her on horseback. He
tumbled and ... hence the wheelchair.
 &HT;    ``He's a first class b.s. artist,'' Hogan says proudly of his
character. ``Shane exploits his situation _ if he can get sympathy
or money from it, that's fine with him.''
 &HT;    Of course there's a serious reason for Shane's paralysis and the
part comes complete with an all-stops-out death scene, one any
actor would relish. But it's not exactly what one expects from one
of Australia's favorite import. ``People who expect me to do comedy
all the time or play some triumphant figure might be in for a
surprise with this one,'' Hogan said.
 &HT;    After Dundee hit pay dirt, Hollywood offered the craggy faced
Hogan the earth. He starred in ``Almost an Angel'' (1990) and a
western, ``Lightning Jack'' (1994) _ both box office
disappointments. In 1996 he popped up in the movie ``Flipper''
(based on the TV series) and that too sank at the box office.
 &HT;    ``That wasn't my film, '' he explains, ``I was an actor for hire
in that one. But I did rewrite my lines a little.''
 &HT;    But he regrets nothing about it. ``Linda and I and the dog went
to the Bahamas for 10 weeks and I was nicely paid and got to swim
with the dolphins. But it was incredibly boring just being an actor
and I decided I didn't want to do that for a living.''
 &HT;    He admits he never expected to be an A-list movie star. Dundee
was a shot in the dark that just happened to hit box office gold.
``You can't top that,'' Hogan said, ``so you don't try. I don't
expect to suddenly come up with a grand idea tomorrow and write the
script and produce a movie that's going to be more successful than
that.''
 &HT;    And since he didn't expect the success in the first place, he
hasn't been devastated by the fact that he hasn't managed to
duplicate it.
 &HT;    ``Look I realize they don't sit around in Hollywood saying,
'Now, let's see: 'Should we hire Harrison Ford or Paul Hogan for
this movie?''' he shrugs. ``And Linda doesn't get scripts because
they can't decide whether to hire her or Meryl Streep. I never
wanted to be a film star or an actor. These days what I get offered
is B-grade action scripts that none of the big stars will do. So I
don't do them either. I also get sent all the stuff that has the
word Australian in it _ whether it's a head nurse or a nun, they
send it up to me.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Hogan, who alone and unaided revitalized the Aussie
tourist industry with his ``shrimp on the barbie'' commercials for
his native land, says he's been making good money again as a
pitchman _ selling Suburu cars on TV in North America _ and he no
longer has to work as hard as he once did.
 &HT;    ``They pay me well, as well they might, because I've got
credibility,'' he says.
 &HT;    Though mainstream Hollywood is not exactly beating a path to his
door, he says he's perfectly content. Even more since the arrival
of Baby Hogan. ``Right now I've got nothing on my agenda _ just to
practice being a Dad again. It's been a long time _ and I've
forgotten a lot.''

   1. THE MANY FACES OF TERRORISM In recent years terrorist
operations have changed. Airline hijackings have become rare
because hijacked planes cannot stay in the air forever and few
countries today are willing to let them land, thereby incurring the
stigma of openly supporting terrorism. The belief has gained ground
that terrorist missions by volunteers bent on committing suicide
constitute a radical new departure, dangerous because they are
impossible to prevent. But that is a myth, like the many others in
which terrorism has always been shrouded. The bomber willing and
indeed eager to blow himself up has appeared in all eras and
cultural traditions. By Walter Laqueur. From Foreign Affairs
magazine.
____________________________________________________________ 2. THE
NEW WORLD OF MASS DESTRUCTION What do normal people feel is the
main relief provided by the end of the Cold War? It is that the
danger of nuclear war is off their backs. Yet today, ``weapons of
mass destruction'' present more and different things to worry about
than during the Cold War. By Richard K. Betts. From Foreign Affairs
magazine. 3. THE MYSTIQUE OF U.S. AIR POWER Reliance on air power
has set the American way of war apart from all others for well over
half a century. Air warfare remains distinctively American -
high-tech, cheap in lives and, at least in theory, quick. To
America's enemies - past, current and potential - it is the
destinctively American form of military intimidation. Air warfare
plays to the machine-mindedness of American civilization. By Eliot
A. Cohen. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 4. WHAT IF THERE IS AN
URBAN NIGHTMARE? If a terrorist were to strike a U.S. city with a
chemical or biological agent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
would be responsible for coordinating the response to the attack.
By John G. Roos. From Armed Forces Journal International Inc.

WHAT CHELSEA MUST TEACH HER OWN FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Chelsea: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question you face is what to do now that your famous father
has failed you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At age 18, you almost certainly have learned a good deal more
about life's squalid corners than I had at your age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, before the last week or two, you hadn't already discovered
that parents can betray your trust and behave in destructive,
repugnant ways, you know that now. I'm sorry for any child who
learns such stark lessons, but to some extent it happens to
everyone. And there is, in the end, no way to protect children from
it. All parents fail _ some much more spectacularly than others,
but no parents make it through life without embarrassing and
disappointing the very children they love. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your case, of course, is special because not just you and your
mother but the whole country _ indeed, the whole world _ has been
treated to the awful spectacle of imagining your reckless father
committing tawdry acts of lust in or near the Oval Office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you, like most children, can barely imagine their
parents doing anything sexual within the boundaries of marriage.
Most kids find it disgusting to think of their parents in that way.
But to learn that one of your parents engaged in such acts outside
marriage surely vaporizes any illusions you may have had about what
some supposedly rational grownups do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You strike me as a bright young woman, capable of surviving a
great deal. So I tell you what you may know already: You have
choices about what to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can disown your father. Indeed, this would be an
understandable reaction, given the way he has heaped embarrassment
and shame on his family. But, in the end, it would be
self-destructive. There certainly are times and circumstances in
which the most helpful thing is distance between parent and child.
But it's no long-term solution because it leaves a relationship
asunder that is clearly meant to exist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another choice is for you to ignore what your father has done
and how it has made you feel. I cannot, of course, know your
feelings. Although I have met your father in the past, I know you
only from your limited public appearances and from infrequent media
stories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I do know that ignoring feelings, avoiding conflict and
pretending things are all right is no solution. I have used that
approach too often in my own family and can testify that it finally
does more harm than good. I don't mean to suggest that you confront
your parents about every little grievance or that you see a
professional therapist to work out anger over trivial matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, if you try to paper over real pain, it will come back
and wound you in possibly permanent ways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is left, then, is the only alternative that makes sense.
You first must name your pain. This requires you to be honest with
yourself about the ways you feel violated by what has happened and
then to express that clearly within the confines of your family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may feel that your job is the same as that of your father's
political supporters _ to rally around him and help save his
presidency. No. Your job is to be sure that you and your parents
understand what you are feeling and that you grasp your own vital
role in helping to heal the needless wounds your father has
inflicted on you, your mother and himself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Confronting this pain may be the hardest thing you've ever done.
I will never forget the bruising agony I felt several years ago
when I had to inform my own children that their mother and I, after
almost 27 years together, had failed to hold our marriage together.
But, in the end, there was nothing to do but acknowledge the
failure. They survived as whole and healthy young women who love
both their parents, and so can you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But you and your family can be healed only by walking
intentionally through the white hotness of the pain. Your father
seems remarkably adept at avoiding that. But you aren't responsible
for his behavior, only for yours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if he won't name this evil plainly to you, you will have to
name it to him. Your father is forever talking about doing the
right things for our children. And he's right. But if he doesn't
understand that such truths begin with his own child you will be
forced to teach him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know of no sane adult in the country who wishes you ill. And I
know of no one who wouldn't offer whatever help you ask for. But we
cannot go through this for you. We can simply wish for you the
best. And we do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &UR; From Family Circle magazine &QL;
</P>

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers
through exposure to the arts. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often
find themselves faced with a difficult decision _ whether to let
the child be one of the youngest in the kindergarten class, or wait
until the following year. Bulion tells the stories of three
families confronted with this dilemma and how they reached their
decisions. (slugged:

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than
defeat youngsters, says Orr, a software reviewer for Children's
Software Revue. She gives a rundown of some of the best educational
programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

 &UR; (1,500 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANE HARRIS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From Working Mother magazine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c.1996 Family Circle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.
</P>

   It's late at night and you suddenly feel chest pains. Do you
call an ambulance or figure that it can wait until the morning?
Lenane offers tips on how to determine whether various ailments _
skipped heartbeat, chest pain, cramps, night sweats, dizziness _
are likely to be serious enough for a 3 a.m. run to the emergency

   As people age, they tend to suffer memory loss. Glicksman
discusses the three types of memory _ long-term, intermediate and
short-term _ and how each is affected by the aging process. She
also offers strategies on how to keep one's memory sharp. ``Much
like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning,'' she writes. (slugged:

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

 By FLORENCE FELDMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement
communities without leaving your house? How about chat with others
or find out what events and classes are scheduled in your area? You

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

   The Austrians are always celebrating somebody's anniversary,
most often that of a musician or composer. But this year, instead
of Mozart or Schubert, it is Empress Elizabeth, fondly known as
Sissi, who was assassinated 100 years ago at age 61 in Geneva after
a disastrous marriage and tormented life.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the slim, handsome young princess with cascades of
brown hair flowing down her back and a demure smile are all over
Vienna. Elizabeth was 16 when she married her cousin, Emperor Franz
Joseph, in 1854. A Bavarian, she quickly came to dislike the
strictures of court life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and she
escaped by writing poetry, riding horses and having a villa built
on Corfu.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the salute to the imperial past, Vienna has become a
livelier, more international city in the last few years. The
effects of the opening up of the former Communist bloc can be
subtly felt in the languages spoken in the cafes and on the trams,
and in glimpses of newly affluent Russians who park money here.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, its neutrality maintained since 1955 after the
withdrawal of the four occupying powers, has decided for the moment
against joining NATO. But for the second half of 1998, Austria has
assumed the presidency of the European Union and is flaunting its
adhesion to Western Europe by showing off its revitalized
industries and exports, including its high-quality wine. Vienna has
become a gateway to Eastern Europe with daily flights by Austrian
Airlines to even some of the most out-of-the way cities that nine
years ago were behind the Iron Curtain.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immortal Sissy is at the heart of a three-part exhibit,
``Elizabeth _ Eternal Beauty,'' that is taking place in three
different parts of the city. At Schonbrunn Palace, her summer
residence, the early period of her marriage comes to life in the
fabulous apartments where she wrote and entertained.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits, paintings, the diamond star she wore in her hair,
clothing and photographs are on display. Admission is about $7.80

covering the last 600 years. The works include icons, 19th-century
folk art and paintings by Chagall and Kandinsky. Revolutionary
propaganda posters will also be among the 120 works. Hours: 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m., daily, Wednesday to 9 p.m. Admission: $8; (43-1)
711-915-5737.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, a temporary stage on a leafy space on the Danube
Canal adjacent to Rossauer Laende Street, about five minutes from
the city center, is home to Summer Stage. Chamber music and jazz
alternate over several weekends for evening concerts. Traditional
cuisine is served at self-serve outdoor restaurants close to the

   You can almost hear a zither playing during Vienna in the
Footsteps of the Third Man, a tour by subway and on foot to
shooting locations of the movie based on Graham Greene's novel. A
highlight is a walk through the underground canal system. The tour
meets every Friday at 4 p.m. at the main exit of Stadtpark subway
station on the U4 line. Fee: $15.50.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Gallery Belvedere, a Baroque castle at 27 Prince
Eugenstrasse, is where the Austrian constitution was signed in
1955. But the real attraction is the 19th- and 20th-century art,
with paintings by Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka and
Richard Gerstl. Admission: $5; (43-1) 795-570.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 40 comfortable rooms, Pension Domizil, 14 Schulerstrasse,
(43-1) 513-3199, fax (43-1) 512-3484, is one of the best values in
what can be a very expensive city. It is in the heart of the city,
two blocks from St. Stephen's Cathedral. The rooms are furnished in
a traditional, spare style. With breakfast, a double is $130.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Furst Metternich, 33 Esterhazygasse, (43-1) 588-700, fax
(43-1) 587-5268, is in a 19th-century building tucked away on a
side street in the Sixth District, near the popular shopping area
of the Mariahilferstrasse. The hotel has 55 rooms with contemporary
furnishings for $145, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Pension Stadtpark, 7 Landstrasser Hauptstrasse, (43-1)
713-3123, fax (43-1) 713-3123, has 21 doubles at $82, including
breakfast. This traditional, family-run establishment with bright
rooms and high ceilings is near the Stadtpark.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The service is discreet and the copious wood paneling
shines like a mirror at the Hotel Sacher Vienna, 4
Philharmonikastrasse, (43-1) 51-456, fax (43-1) 51-456-810. Many of
the 108 rooms and suites are decorated in luxurious fabrics with

<P>
   Radisson SAS, 16 Parkring, (43-1) 515-170, fax (43-1) 512-2216,

 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zum Schwarzen Kameel (The Black Camel), 5 Bognergasse, (43-1)
533-8125, which serves typical Viennese cuisine amid wood, tile and
brass from the early 1900s, opened in 1618 (Beethoven is said to
have been a customer). There is a 10-table restaurant and a
separate roomy bar and buffet area with delicious open-faced
sandwiches (spinach and red caviar), casseroles and cheeses, wines,
beer and coffee. Closing time is 7 p.m. so the main meal is lunch,
when the signature dish is boiled beef with creamed string beans
and two sauces: chive and apple horseradish. A meal for two is
about $120, including an Austrian wine.
</P>
<P>
   Locals have taken to Do &AMP; Co (pronounced Doe and Coe, after the
name of the owner, Dogotan Attila) in the Haas House, 12
Stephansplatz, (43-1) 535-3969. It is decorated with crisp white
table cloths and upholstered chairs, and has an outdoor terrace
facing St. Stephen's. The menu is international _ a Thai-inspired
crispy pork salad, for example, and there is a sushi bar. Main
courses center on fish (like a tower of roasted Atlantic tuna that
is a specialty), wienerschnitzel and beef. A meal for two, with an
Austrian cabernet sauvignon costs about $130.
</P>
<P>
   Collio Restaurant, in the Hotel Triest at 12 Wiedner
Hauptstrasse, (43-1) 589-18-133, takes some of its culinary
inspiration from Trieste, which used to serve the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. Designed by Terence Conran, the long room with blue chairs
and metal tabletops extends into the garden, where dinner is also
served until the fall. Lamb tenderloin with olive crust and thyme
sauce is one of the chef's specialties. A meal for two with wine
costs about $95.
</P>
<P>
   A wine bar and wine store are part of Zum Finsteren Stern (To
the Dark Star), which is on a small cobbled street at 3-5
Sterngasse, in the old Jewish quarter. Lunch, informal but
delicious, is prepared on a hot plate, and there is only one dish a
day, from whatever is fresh at the market. A mushroom risotto with
fresh parmesan or a pasta with basil cost $8.50. A plate of
cheeses, olives and sun-dried tomatoes was $6; wines by the glass
are $3.45; (43-1) 535-8152. Hours: 1 to 8 p.m.

shooting locations of the movie based on Graham Greene's novel. A
highlight is a walk through the underground canal system. The tour
meets every Friday at 4 p.m. at the main exit of Stadtpark subway
station on the U4 line. Fee: $15.50.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was the pointed, down-turned nose, the sleek profile and the
sheer speed of the Concorde that impressed everyone 21 years ago.
They still do. So British Airways is marking the 21st birthday of
the aircraft that brought supersonic flight to the well-heeled
masses by declaring 1998 ``The Year of the Concorde.''
 &HT;    ``She is a 21st-century airplane,'' says Capt. Mike Bannister,
flight manager for British Airways' Concorde fleet. ``She looks
like she is a very fast and sophisticated airplane. And as they
say, if it looks right, it probably flies right.''
 &HT;    British Airways currently has seven Concordes, and Air France
has five. In honor of the anniversary, British Airways has mounted
a traveling exhibition called ``Ride the Rocket,'' using the
insider's nickname for the plane. The exhibition will visit all 22
cities served by British Airways this summer and fall, including
Denver, Houston, Dallas, Miami and Los Angeles. Naturally, it
includes a genuine Concorde nose.
 &HT;    A ``Ride the Rocket'' contest in conjunction with the exhibition
offers trips to London on the Concorde as prizes. In addition,
anyone purchasing a ticket on British Airways before Aug. 31 and
completing travel by the end of September is eligible to win one of
the 100 grand prizes of a trip for two on the Concorde and three
nights at a London hotel.
 &HT;    For details, contact British Airways Holidays, 7520 Astoria
Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-AIRWAYS.
 &HT;    Why all the fuss about a 21-year-old plane? Because nothing has
ever been built that surpasses it. A typical crossing takes about
three hours and 10 minutes, at an average speed of more than 1,000
mph. The plane's current speed record was set by British Airways in
February 1996, covering the distance from New York to London in two
hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds.
 &HT;    ``Concorde can go at twice the speed of sound for over three
hours with 100 passengers, 10 crew and the best wines and cuisine
in the sky,'' Bannister says. ``You're traveling 23 miles a minute,
yet a coin can be set on edge on the flight deck and won't waver.''
 &HT;    Inside, the Concorde has two-by-two leather bucket seats that
would not be out of place in a sports car, and windows that are
noticeably smaller than those on subsonic aircraft.
 &HT;    Ten to 12 minutes after taking off, the Concorde reaches Mach 1
at about 30,000 feet. Ten minutes later it hits Mach 2, at which
point it is typically above 50,000 feet, eventually reaching a
cruising altitude of about 58,000 feet. It is the closest most
passengers will ever get to seeing what an astronaut sees.
 &HT;    During the flight, the famous Concorde nose heats up to about
250 degrees Fahrenheit. The pilot's view from the cockpit
encompasses a 270-degree arc, which means that Bannister, his
co-pilot and his flight engineer are looking out at a quarter of a
million miles of the Earth's surface.
 &HT;    ``It's a very beautiful aircraft to fly, very responsive and
very powerful,'' Bannister reports. ``It's an agile performer, a
thoroughbred rather than a cart horse, a sports car rather than a
truck. Pilots adore flying it.''
 &HT;    Flying at close to 60,000 feet, the Concorde encounters fewer
problems with weather than a conventional jumbo jet does at 35,000
feet. Bannister explains that ``the weather finishes at around
42,000 feet,'' which means that the Concorde is flying above storms
and turbulence.
 &HT;    Passengers report feeling refreshed when they step off the
plane. It's not just three hours in the air vs. the more
conventional six or seven hours on a trans-Atlantic flight. It's
because Concorde's cabin is pressurized to simulate a more
comfortable altitude of 4,900 to 5,900 feet vs. 7,250 feet on
subsonic long-distance flights.
 &HT;    About 80 percent of the Concorde's passengers are business
travelers _ and about 80 percent of them are repeat travelers.
Speaking of business, Bannister claims that Concorde's numbers
anticipate world business cycles.
 &HT;    ``We have the same shaped curve over the last 10 years as
London's FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) has,'' he says,
``but we go up or down just ahead of it. It's because the folks
we're carrying are the people making major economic decisions.''
 &HT;    They're making money too. The one-way fare on the Concorde is
$5,456, while a round-trip ticket is $9,165. But British Airways
Concorde Vacations offers less-expensive air-hotel packages.
 &HT;    The plane can also be booked in conjunction with a
trans-Atlantic crossing on the Queen Elizabeth II. For passengers
in either Queens Grill or Princess Grill class, an upgrade to
return on the Concorde is $495. For passengers traveling in the
Caronia Grill, it's $795. And for those in the Mauritania Grill,
the upgrade runs $1,295.
 &HT;    For more information, contact Cunard, 6100 Blue Lagoon Drive,
Miami, Fla., 33126; (800) 221-4770.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Getting your shots when preparing for an overseas trip is no
one's idea of fun _ but it's a necessity. Now travelers have a
streamlined way to find out what shots they need, thanks to a
computerized information service that reduces the usual time, cost
and hassle.
 &HT;    That service is Travax, which derives its information from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and other
data bases, refining it and updating it weekly for public use.
 &HT;    About 1,000 outlets subscribe to Travax, including companies
that underwrite major travel, travel clinics, student health
offices, health maintenance organizations and city, county and
state public health offices.
 &HT;    Dr. Bradley Connor, a gastroenterologist who is affiliated with
the International Society of Travel Medicine in New York and on the
board of Travax, became interested in travel medicine about a
decade ago when he noticed more and more travelers returning home
with diseases that could have been prevented.
 &HT;    It was a major quandary in those days, Connor explained, for
travelers to find reliable and noncontradictory health information
about their travel destinations. Travax now digests existing
information and distills it so that it's easy to understand and
use.
 &HT;    We made use of Travax through our county health department,
which subscribes to the service. We visited it in preparation for
travel to Greece and Thailand. Like many county health departments
across America, ours offers an immunization clinic for travelers
headed overseas.
 &HT;    We started out by listing the countries we would visit and
approximate dates. We were quoted a consultation fee of $25 for
two. Any necessary shots would cost extra.
 &HT;    A registered nurse supplied us with information for each
destination, ranging from general health precautions to
drug-violation penalties. For both countries we were provided with
information on risk and prevention for diseases such as hepatitis,
polio, rabies, typhoid, cholera, encephalitis and malaria.
 IMMUNIZATIONS WEAR OFF  
 &HT;    Since our hepatitis B immunizations were current, we
concentrated on hepatitis A, typhoid, malaria and polio. We were
surprised to learn that we, like many other mature travelers, had
neglected to get booster shots for polio, a disease that was so
rampant during our childhood years. As a result, some seniors
contract polio during their travels because their immunizations
have worn off.
 &HT;    Protection against malaria was a bit more complicated in terms
of the types of medicines, areas of the countries we would be
visiting and whether mosquitoes in those areas had built up
resistance to the medicines _ information we would not have been
able to sort out by ourselves. The nurse recommended that we see
our own doctor about the anti-malaria choices, since we were taking
other medications.
 &HT;    Less than half an hour later, we were on our way, our arms
stinging from the shots, and carrying handy yellow cards that fit
into our passports listing our vaccinations.
 &HT;    Our county office averages some 2,000 clients a year, according
to Steve Kutz, supervisor of our county's travel vaccinations
program.
 &HT;    In the wake of Connor's initial concern about travel diseases a
decade ago, there are now more than 1,500 members of the
International Society of Travel Medicine, including 500 clinics,
300 in the United States alone, specializing in travel medicine.
 &HT;    Some Travax subscribers cover large areas. For example, one
subscriber is the South Carolina Health Department, so the
information is available at any of South Carolina's 46 county
offices.
 LOCATING INFORMATION  
 &HT;    To help you or your doctor locate a reliable travel information
source near you, write the International Society of Travel Medicine
for a free list of travel medicine clinics. The address is P.O. Box
871089, Stone Mountain, Ga., 30087-0028.
 &HT;    Travax offers an Internet Web site at www.tripprep.com/, as does
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov/. The
centers can also be called at their international travelers

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Getting your shots when preparing for an overseas trip is no
one's idea of fun _ but it's a necessity. Now travelers have a
streamlined way to find out what shots they need, thanks to a
computerized information service that reduces the usual time, cost
and hassle.
 &HT;    That service is Travax, which derives its information from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and other
data bases, refining it and updating it weekly for public use.
 &HT;    About 1,000 outlets subscribe to Travax, including companies
that underwrite major travel, travel clinics, student health
offices, health maintenance organizations and city, county and
state public health offices.
 &HT;    Dr. Bradley Connor, a gastroenterologist who is affiliated with
the International Society of Travel Medicine in New York and on the
board of Travax, became interested in travel medicine about a
decade ago when he noticed more and more travelers returning home
with diseases that could have been prevented.
 &HT;    It was a major quandary in those days, Connor explained, for
travelers to find reliable and noncontradictory health information
about their travel destinations. Travax now digests existing
information and distills it so that it's easy to understand and
use.
 &HT;    We made use of Travax through our county health department,
which subscribes to the service. We visited it in preparation for
travel to Greece and Thailand. Like many county health departments
across America, ours offers an immunization clinic for travelers
headed overseas.
 &HT;    We started out by listing the countries we would visit and
approximate dates. We were quoted a consultation fee of $25 for
two. Any necessary shots would cost extra.
 &HT;    A registered nurse supplied us with information for each
destination, ranging from general health precautions to
drug-violation penalties. For both countries we were provided with
information on risk and prevention for diseases such as hepatitis,
polio, rabies, typhoid, cholera, encephalitis and malaria.
 IMMUNIZATIONS WEAR OFF  
 &HT;    Since our hepatitis B immunizations were current, we
concentrated on hepatitis A, typhoid, malaria and polio. We were
surprised to learn that we, like many other mature travelers, had
neglected to get booster shots for polio, a disease that was so
rampant during our childhood years. As a result, some seniors
contract polio during their travels because their immunizations
have worn off.
 &HT;    Protection against malaria was a bit more complicated in terms
of the types of medicines, areas of the countries we would be
visiting and whether mosquitoes in those areas had built up
resistance to the medicines _ information we would not have been
able to sort out by ourselves. The nurse recommended that we see
our own doctor about the anti-malaria choices, since we were taking
other medications.
 &HT;    Less than half an hour later, we were on our way, our arms
stinging from the shots, and carrying handy yellow cards that fit
into our passports listing our vaccinations.
 &HT;    Our county office averages some 2,000 clients a year, according
to Steve Kutz, supervisor of our county's travel vaccinations
program.
 &HT;    In the wake of Connor's initial concern about travel diseases a
decade ago, there are now more than 1,500 members of the
International Society of Travel Medicine, including 500 clinics,
300 in the United States alone, specializing in travel medicine.
 &HT;    Some Travax subscribers cover large areas. For example, one
subscriber is the South Carolina Health Department, so the
information is available at any of South Carolina's 46 county
offices.
 LOCATING INFORMATION  
 &HT;    To help you or your doctor locate a reliable travel information
source near you, write the International Society of Travel Medicine
for a free list of travel medicine clinics. The address is P.O. Box

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia is running out of options as it seeks to claw
its way out of an ever-widening financial swamp.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid bankruptcy, the government devalued the national
currency last Monday(Aug.17), allowing the ruble to decline against
the dollar by as much as 34 percent. It also announced a 90-day
moratorium on Russian commercial firms and banks repaying their
debts to banks abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky gamble intended to give President Boris Yeltsin's
government the cash and the time to tackle a gloomy array of
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's sapped financial markets virtually have ceased to
exist, its banking system is near collapse, its public debt on
borrowing from foreign banks is out of control and unpaid wages to
millions of workers is growing.
</P>
<P>
   To find a lasting fix, analysts said, Yeltsin's government, led
by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, must fundamentally transform
the economy from the unpredictable hybrid of Soviet-era
centralization and profiteering capitalism it has become.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is mired in a ``serious financial crisis'' which is only
likely to worsen,'' Kiriyenko told parliament in an emergency
session on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is not to do anything or to continue
discussing the direction in which we should move,'' Kiriyenko said,
adding that ``no simple and pleasant solutions are available.''
</P>
<P>
   It means a radical overhaul to improve tax collections, reduce
government spending and somehow win back the confidence of foreign
investors. At stake is the future of Russia and Yeltsin's now
time-worn promise when the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago
that his people would enjoy the fruits of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the critical list. There is no more waiting,'' said
Sergei Kolmakov, a Russian political and economic analyst. ``Russia
cannot cut itself off from the world markets, but it has
demonstrated that (under the current system) it cannot keep up with
them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Kremlin has bounded in pinball fashion from
crisis to crisis, unable or unwilling to focus on the basic
reforms, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a $22.6 billion bailout package forged by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) was intended to see that Russia
enacted long-overdue reforms to improve tax collections and lower
its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials also intended it to avert a devaluation,
allowing them to maintain virtually the only economic boast Yeltsin
could claim: a stable ruble and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the first IMF installment, $4.8 billion in July, didn't go
far. Russia had to keep spending from its hard-currency reserves to
make its debt payments, and could have soon gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   After a rebuff last weekend from the IMF, the United States and
other Western governments for more aid, Russian officials chose to
seek a measured devaluation, allowing the currency to float on the
market from its previous high of 6.2 rubles to the dollar to as
high as 9.5 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the deficit is vital, analysts said. The huge
government shortfalls that force Russia to borrow from foreign
banks at high interest rates produce an accumulated debt that
demands $1 billion a week in payments.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit also has meant Russia is unable to pay full wages
and pensions to millions of its citizens, triggering strikes by
miners and other laborers throughout the nation this summer. Unpaid
wages grew to $11 billion at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in taxes go uncollected every year. And as
part of the strings attached to the IMF loans, Yeltsin's government
agreed to pursue an austerity program designed to produce another
$16 billion in revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
   But tackling Russia's deeper problems has been troublesome given
the political opposition of the Communist-dominated parliament, and
the economic interests of a small group of powerful Russian
business magnates who oppose more state control over big business.
</P>
<P>
   In emergency session in July, the Duma, parliament's lower
house, rejected 11 of 25 government-sponsored bills aimed at
raising more tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, which convened again Friday(Aug. 21) in emergency
session, expressed concern over the new troubles, but showed little
inclination to go along with Yeltsin's plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax problem is not merely a matter of raising rates or
of finding the cheats. It requires a basic change in the way most
Russians conduct their daily business.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the tax authority estimated that up to 58
percent of retail transactions occur in cash and barter, a shadow
economy almost impossible for tax collectors to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $1 billion a year alone in uncollected tax revenues
is lost in the illegal sale of alcohol, primarily vodka smuggled
from abroad or produced by homemade distillers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more troubling long-term problems, according to Anders
Aslund, a former adviser to the Russian government who now works
for the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, is a weak banking system
and punishing tax rate that fails to promote small businesses and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the country's wealth in the hands of a relatively
few powerful men, Russia has been unable to diversify its economy.
</P>
<P>
   It depends heavily on oil and natural gas exports, which have
been hit by flat prices on the world market, hovering at
10-year-lows. The government said the value of oil exports in the
first half of 1998 decreased 46 percent from 1997, compounding the
country's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation could give the Yeltsin government the time and the
momentum it needs to pursue its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative result of devaluation could be chaos, a
Indonesian-style free-fall that results in social unrest and
political pressure on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this year, as financial markets in Russia fell, the
problems were confined to the government and the elite world of
banking and finance. Now all Russians have a stake in recovery with
the devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of relative stability and low inflation,
Russians are nervously watching their rubles slide in value as
prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government plan will most likely solve the short-term
fiscal problem, but will open the country to the risk of
self-perpetuating inflation with all its social and political
consequences,'' said Radoslav Petkov of the Institute for East/West
Studies, a think thank.
</P>
<P>
   If devaluation doesn't work, Russia has nowhere else to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rush to buy dollars. If you and me and everyone rushes
to swap national currency for foreign we really will destroy the
ruble,'' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda urged its readers the
day after devaluation was announced. ``There will be no one but us
to blame.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ He swoons over the Spice Girls. He mouths
off to his mother. He signs his name by drawing a smiley face --
flanked by dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this seemingly typical 13-year-old boy -- Makonnen David
Blake Hannah -- holds a lot of sway on this sunny Caribbean island
of 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's new technology consultant, the fidgety
teenager has the ears of Jamaica's most-influential politicos, with
a direct line to the Ministry of Commerce and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to keep me abreast of new technology,'' said
Phillip Paulwell, Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology.
``It is the young people who know about computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulwell, 36, began using computers three years ago. Hannah's
been honing his skills for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appointed Paulwell only last
January to head what was a newly created ministry on a
tourist-dependent island that's still, for the most part, a
technological wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, some 60 percent of all new jobs will require
technology-based skills by century's end, which doesn't bode well
for Jamaica, where only 35,000 to 40,000 people have logged on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hannah, who relishes karate and fast Japanese cars, the
focus of his ever-changing site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He's been charged with advising the government on computer
hardware and software and visiting schools to talk to young people
about the advantages of using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it makes him Jamaica's youngest-ever government
advisor, the one-year appointment doesn't seem to faze the worldly
youngster, who's visited several U.S. cities. His favorite? New
York and Orlando, by far. The best part may be the honorarium that
comes with it: a few dollars a week he'll use to go watch movies.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, self-assured adolescent who collects National
Geographic magazines and reads science textbooks for fun taught
himself how to program computers and clean up viruses. He's also an
accomplished Web page designer. Yet he speaks of these skills with
the nonchalance of someone who's just mastered inline skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can program a little bit, and I'm good at system design,
advanced Windows, DOS usage, stuff like that,'' said Hannah, with
saucer-like eyes and an easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was raised in the nice, solidly middle-class neighborhood
of Mona Heights, where streets have sidewalks, and neighbors might
include journalists and low-level politicians.
</P>
<P>
   An intermittent child actor, Hannah appeared on Nickelodeon a
few years ago in a segment that featured children from around the
world. For his part, Hannah showed viewers how much mildew had
accumulated on a coconut he'd left under his bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah parlayed a handful of acting gigs into an invitation to
attend the Chicago Children's Film Festival in 1995, which is where
he met Paulwell, who came away duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just extremely intelligent and full of energy,'' Paulwell
said. ``He knows more about computers than perhaps anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike another homegrown celebrity, Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, who
won the National Spelling Bee last May, Hannah is not a product of
Jamaica's public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's mother, novelist Barbara Blake, pulled her son out of
school at age five after a teacher scolded him with a smack on the
hand for questioning whether Jesus was really white.
</P>
<P>
   He's been home-schooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taught him what's relevant, and computers are all we have
to save us from a very poor education system,'' said Blake, who was
introduced to computers by an American friend. ``We live in a
global community and the computer is the best way for children to
be able to connect to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is a doting mother with strong opinions. She credits her
son's intelligence to six years of breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother, Hannah comes from a long line of
eccentric -- yet cerebral -- ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Evon Blake, was a famous journalist who decades
ago launched a Newsweek-like magazine in the Caribbean called
Spotlight. He had a penchant for pipes and white, shark-skin suits,
and is credited with breaking the color barrier here in the 1940s
by jumping into a whites-only swimming pool at a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had Life and Ebony magazines around the house, and
my father used a pen as his weapon,'' Barbara Blake said. ``My
father always encouraged me to think, which is what I've always
tried to pass on to my child.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has.
</P>
<P>
   Her son's as preoccupied with computers as other teenage boys
might be with girls.
</P>
<P>
   But he hardly looks the part of government advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A talented soccer player, he wears an Adidas jogging suit and
dreadlocks that stretch the length of his arms -- his matted
tendrils have never been cut.
</P>
<P>
   The rope-like locks draw double-takes, but are actually a tenet
of his family's faith in the Rastafarian religion.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Christianity, Rastafarianism stresses the
back-to-Africa teachings of Jamaican pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey
while advocating black unity. To believers, Ethiopia is like Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Rastafarian was reggae music star Bob Marley,
with whom Hannah shares a birthday on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unconventional appearance, Hannah says he mixes
easily with government types.
</P>
<P>
   He e-mails Paulwell almost every day and meets with him once a
week face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know what is on the Internet,'' Hannah said.
``He's real cool so he's easy to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in the daily newspaper here showed Paulwell
and Hannah in front of a computer playing Pac Man and sucking on
lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Paulwell, Hannah's job is nothing to snicker
at.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has yet to gain a toe-hold in Jamaica, some 550 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The island's future, Paulwell contends, rides on the knowledge
of the young. And that knowledge must be more technology-based.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious prodigy has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, like other less-developed islands, has been locked for
years out of the technology market because of high costs. A
computer with a 200 megahertz Intel Pentium processor that sells
for $520 in the United States would cost at least $1,200 in
Jamaica. With a per-capita income of about $1,500 a year, most
people here can't afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's in the midst of an economic recession that's left one
in three people living in poverty and nearly half of all young men
aged 16 to 25 unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's goal to put a computer in all of Jamaica's 997
public schools by the year 2000 is deceptively simple: many have
yet to install a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our teachers have never even used computers before,''
said Jean Beaumont, who provides computer training to teachers.
``Some find them complicated, and others are just very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, government officials warned that
date-recognition software -- a problem known as the ``millennium
bug'' -- won't be corrected before Jan. 1, 2000, and probably not
until the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But while his country struggles to gain some ground
technologically, working for Microsoft Inc. someday is what's
mostly on the mind of Hannah, who seems hungry for the trappings of
American mogulism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream would be to meet Bill Gates,'' Hannah said, turning
suddenly serious. ``The man has revolutionized the world.''

<P>
   SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ A special place in the hills
here has been yielding light gray clay for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of San Bartolo Coyotepec, a village in Mexico's
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) state, still harvest it and shape it into bowls
and figurines -- much the same as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1953, the Zapotec Indians here have given their
pottery a different spin. That's when a tiny, wizened local potter
named Dona Rosa discovered that she could give the subdued black
color of her oven-baked pots a lustrous shine -- simply by rubbing
unfinished pieces with a quartz stone before their final firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved it. And today, thanks to Dona Rosa, people can
live from their art,'' says the now famous potter's son, Valente
Nieto Real, 70, whose family is among the top producers of Mexico's
popular ``black pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of black pottery is San Bartolo Coyotepec, and it is
seven miles south of the colonial city of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a well-known tourist destination, but it has
managed to retain its small-town character. The families who make
black pottery welcome visitors into their shops to browse and buy;
at Dona Rosa's workshop, her family also offers demonstrations
showing how they make their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of black pottery are often sold in Mexican art
galleries in the United States. But a visit to San Bartolo
Coyotepec, which is an easy drive down Oaxaca's Highway 175, offers
tourists from all over the world a chance to see and purchase
pieces hard to find abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents showed us where the clay is, and their parents
showed them,'' said Nieto Real, as he eagerly demonstrated how he
shapes clay into large round pots, pitchers, candlesticks and other
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pieces of black pottery are orbs with fluted edges,
and they range from a few inches to nearly two feet tall. Many of
them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

   MOSCOW _ Some facts and figures about Russia's problem-plagued
economy:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE SHRINKING RUBLE ....
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the week, a Russian ruble was worth about 16
U.S. cents (trading at 6.2 to the dollar). The de facto devaluation
means its worth can slide on currency markets to about 11 cents
(9.5 to the dollar), or 34 percent. Consumer prices have started to
rise to reflect the weakened ruble.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A SMALL ECONOMY GETTING SMALLER ....
</P>
<P>
   Still a nuclear superpower, Russia is far from being an economic
giant. In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), the country's
total output of goods and services, Russia does not make the list
of the world's top 20 economies. Oil is the leading export, but
flat world prices mean less-than-expected revenues. Projections for
1998 show Russia's gross domestic product at just 5.5 percent of
the U.S. GDP, according to Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WILL THE LAST INVESTOR IN RUSSIA PLEASE TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
...?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Russia had one of the most robust emerging stock
markets in the world, with gains of 200 percent and more in some
issues. This year, it is the world's worst. Total capital invested
in the Russian market has fallen to below $18 billion this month,
compared with $128 billion at the end of last year. In the past few
weeks, only about a half-dozen stocks listed on the exchange have
seen any significant trading, out of 87 companies on the board,
according to the Russian Trading System.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SAVINGS WIPEOUT FOR RUSSIANS ...?
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 of an estimated 1,500 banks in Russia will survive
currency devaluation, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov has
predicted. But the impact may not be great on average Russians for
two reasons: Most Russians have no savings. And most of those who
do keep their money in U.S. dollars under the mattress, not in a
bank.
</P>
<P>
   According to government estimates, 77 percent of Russian
households have zero potential for savings. Of the rest, those with
savings of $10,000 or less keep only about 7 percent of their money
in the form of rubles. And the richest, those with savings of more
than $10,000, keep virtually none of their money in the national
currency.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  AMERICA AT RISK ...?
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes are huge should Russia's fiscal woes force
President Boris Yeltsin from office or derail the country's
attempts at economic and democratic reforms. But economically,
Russia simply does not matter much to American producers. U.S.
exports to Russia in 1997 amounted to $3.4 billion, only about 0.5
percent of total U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BOUND FOR BANKRUPTCY ...?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russia announced a 90-day moratorium on its debt
payments. Russian officials insist the country and its major banks
will not default on loans. If it were to, here's who would lose
....

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S STOCK MARKET: A SMALL BEAR WITH A BIG BITE
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-RUBLE-$ADV23.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories for use Sunday, Aug. 23 and thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES AND JULIA SHARGORODSKA 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``The potential is certainly enormous,'' Institutional
Investor magazine, the bible of international finance, wrote last
summer of Russia's young and vigorous stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the publication was referring to the potential for
profits, not the catastrophic declines the market would suffer in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian stock market is minuscule by Western standards and
has little impact in the lives of most ordinary Russians. Yet it is
an important barometer of foreign investors' confidence -- in
recent months, a badly withered faith -- in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In two bullish years, the Russian Trading System (RTS), the
country's main stock market, rose 110 percent both in 1996, and
again in 1997. This year, the market has slumped 78 percent. The
21st largest market in the world at the end of 1997, it now ranks
in the bottom, similar in size to such minor stock exchanges as
Egypt, Columbia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the majority
of Russians simply lack the money -- the average monthly salary in
Russia is only about $200 -- and the familiarity with free markets
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The major players are Russian banks, investment companies
representing the wealthy minority in Russia and foreigners, who
must participate through Russian-registered brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis has driven foreign investors out of
emerging markets in Russia and elsewhere. The declining world price
of oil, Russia's biggest export earner, has contributed to the
problems, as oil and energy related stocks dominate the Moscow
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The world's worst performing market this year, its declines and
Russia's ballooning foreign debt contributed to the International
Monetary Fund's decision to assemble a $22.6 billion bailout
package for Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
   That loan package was intended to restore confidence in Russia.
It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, the market lost nearly $3 billion and trading
virtually ceased to exist. As of August 18, the market's
capitalization was $18 billion, compared with $128 billion at the
end of 1997. (By comparison, capital in the U.S. market, the
world's largest, at the end of 1997 was $11.3 trillion).
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Trading System (RTS), which handles more than half
of all issues on Russia's stock market, began operating in the fall
of 1995 and currently trades in 87 companies. Russia's other major
stock markets, the Moscow Stock Exchange and the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange (MICEX) began trading shares in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The most actively traded stocks are Russia's electricity
monopoly Unified Energy System (UES), Russia's largest oil company,
Lukoil, and the main long-distance telecommunications provider,
Rostelecom.
</P>
<P>
   With prices low, will the market rebound soon?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe a substantial upswing to profit levels seen in
1996 and 1997 will not come until after the scheduled Russian
presidential elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market isn't growing now because the situation is not
stable,'' said Nikolai Gusev, a trader at Regent European
Securities. ``Nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S STOCK MARKET: A SMALL BEAR WITH A BIG BITE
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-RUBLE-$ADV23.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``The potential is certainly enormous,'' Institutional
Investor magazine, the bible of international finance, wrote last
summer of Russia's young and vigorous stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the publication was referring to the potential for
profits, not the catastrophic declines the market would suffer in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian stock market is minuscule by Western standards and
has little impact in the lives of most ordinary Russians. Yet it is
an important barometer of foreign investors' confidence -- in
recent months, a badly withered faith -- in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In two bullish years, the Russian Trading System (RTS), the
country's main stock market, rose 110 percent both in 1996, and
again in 1997. This year, the market has slumped 78 percent. The
21st largest market in the world at the end of 1997, it now ranks
in the bottom, similar in size to such minor stock exchanges as
Egypt, Columbia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the majority
of Russians simply lack the money -- the average monthly salary in
Russia is only about $200 -- and the familiarity with free markets
to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The major players are Russian banks, investment companies
representing the wealthy minority in Russia and foreigners, who
must participate through Russian-registered brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis has driven foreign investors out of
emerging markets in Russia and elsewhere. The declining world price
of oil, Russia's biggest export earner, has contributed to the
problems, as oil and energy related stocks dominate the Moscow
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The world's worst performing market this year, its declines and
Russia's ballooning foreign debt contributed to the International
Monetary Fund's decision to assemble a $22.6 billion bailout
package for Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
   That loan package was intended to restore confidence in Russia.
It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, the market lost nearly $3 billion and trading
virtually ceased to exist. As of August 18, the market's
capitalization was $18 billion, compared with $128 billion at the
end of 1997. (By comparison, capital in the U.S. market, the
world's largest, at the end of 1997 was $11.3 trillion).
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Trading System (RTS), which handles more than half
of all issues on Russia's stock market, began operating in the fall
of 1995 and currently trades in 87 companies. Russia's other major
stock markets, the Moscow Stock Exchange and the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange (MICEX) began trading shares in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The most actively traded stocks are Russia's electricity
monopoly Unified Energy System (UES), Russia's largest oil company,
Lukoil, and the main long-distance telecommunications provider,
Rostelecom.
</P>
<P>
   With prices low, will the market rebound soon?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe a substantial upswing to profit levels seen in
1996 and 1997 will not come until after the scheduled Russian
presidential elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market isn't growing now because the situation is not
stable,'' said Nikolai Gusev, a trader at Regent European
Securities. ``Nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow.''

   ARRAZOLA, Mexico _ He's the father of slithering serpents, giant
crabs, a ram with curled horns and sensual, almost human muscles.
</P>
<P>
   All his animals, says Claudio Ojeda, spring from the corners of
his mind and the chunks of wood his hands whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spontaneous,'' the Mexican wood carver and Zapotec Indian
insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Ojeda also admits he finds inspiration in the hallucinogenic
mushrooms some Indians in this southern Mexican state consume for
spiritual and curative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, friendly man who is proud of his craft and his
heritage, Ojeda is one of this village's most prosperous and
talented wood carvers.
</P>
<P>
   The village is Arrazola, and the state is Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka),
where Zapotec and other Mexican Indians still reign when it comes
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Arrazola
is home to a beloved Mexican craft: the production of
``animalitos,'' figures carved from the local copal tree and
painted in riotous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carving is a centuries' old tradition, but in recent years the
artisans of Arrazola have elevated the art to a globally-desired
commodity. Their figures are sought by buyers from Europe, Asia and
all over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most are small enough to fit on a shelf, but wild enough to
attract instant attention. Horses sprout wings, as if ready to take
flight. Dogs with florid coats throw back their heads and howl.
Rabbits play congas or blow trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The animals carved by Ojeda and painted by his wife, Teresa, are
noted for their large size -- some are two feet tall or wide -- and
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   When he began carving in earnest 10 years ago, Ojeda
experimented by fashioning one large animal instead of many small
ones. The piece sold quickly and fetched a high price. Now Ojeda
can show off a thick wad of business cards from international
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father carved, too,'' Ojeda said. ``But he couldn't even
eat from what he sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda has sold pieces to Disney World in Orlando, galleries in
Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, and diplomatic offices in
Texas. He's been asked to exhibit in Hong Kong and his pieces
decorate homes from New York to Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still raise some corn and beans. But we pretty much
dedicate ourselves to artisan work now,'' said Teresa Ojeda. As she
spoke, she was painstakingly decorating a large tortoise with three
frogs poised on its shell.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach Arrazola, you pass carts driven by oxen and
farmers carrying machetes. You begin to see signs in English and
Spanish inviting you into homes where the animals figures are
carved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a cluster of boys greets you at the edge of town,
offering to accompany you to a favorite carver's house for a few
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Arrazola's prosperity is striking. The roads are paved, the
houses sturdy, satellite dishes are perched on roofs to pick up
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Ojeda drives a pick-up and his home is equipped with a
shower and modern bathroom, startling amenities in an Indian
community.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ojedas' workshop remains a traditional family affair. In
a studio behind sliding glass doors, the couple invite customers in
to browse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smaller animals, which run under $10, the Ojedas' animals
don't come cheap. Most are the equivalent of $40 and up, sometimes
pushing into the hundreds. But that's a fraction of a U.S. gallery
price, and, by visiting, you get to see the full range of the
couple's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, a dragon sports a tail that has metamorphosed
into a snake. A crab with bulging eyes seems to scuttle across the
floor, unaware of the reptile perched on its back. Hippopotamuses,
lobsters, and all sorts of other creatures find their way out of
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Ojeda is from a village where the pre-Hispanic tradition
of hallucinogenic mushrooms is still revered. She and her husband
both say mushrooms have given them visions of animals and colors
leaping and fusing. Neither takes this tradition lightly, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a strong mind,'' Claudio said. ``But it's
something mystical. Scientists can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO VISIT: In Oaxaca city, hire a taxi, take a city bus or a
tour many hotels offer to Arrazola, where you can browse at the
Ojedas' on Emiliano Zapata Street, or, for smaller animals, at
other families' workshops.

 &HT;    EDs: San Bartolo Coyotepec is one of three villages profiled in

<P>
   SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ A special place in the hills
here has been yielding light gray clay for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of San Bartolo Coyotepec, a village in Mexico's
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) state, still harvest it and shape it into bowls
and figurines -- much the same as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1953, the Zapotec Indians here have given their
pottery a different spin. That's when a tiny, wizened local potter
named Dona Rosa discovered that she could give the subdued black
color of her oven-baked pots a lustrous shine -- simply by rubbing
unfinished pieces with a quartz stone before their final firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved it. And today, thanks to Dona Rosa, people can
live from their art,'' says the now famous potter's son, Valente
Nieto Real, 70, whose family is among the top producers of Mexico's
popular ``black pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of black pottery is San Bartolo Coyotepec, and it is
seven miles south of the colonial city of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a well-known tourist destination, but it has
managed to retain its small-town character. The families who make
black pottery welcome visitors into their shops to browse and buy;
at Dona Rosa's workshop, her family also offers demonstrations
showing how they make their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of black pottery are often sold in Mexican art
galleries in the United States. But a visit to San Bartolo
Coyotepec, which is an easy drive down Oaxaca's Highway 175, offers
tourists from all over the world a chance to see and purchase
pieces hard to find abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents showed us where the clay is, and their parents
showed them,'' said Nieto Real, as he eagerly demonstrated how he
shapes clay into large round pots, pitchers, candlesticks and other
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pieces of black pottery are orbs with fluted edges,
and they range from a few inches to nearly two feet tall. Many of
them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

FAVORITE TRIP
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ANIMALS-$ADV22, MEXICO-POTTERY-$ADV22; photos placed
in the International and Travel folders on the Cox Server.

Oaxaca state.

<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Escaping Russia in my sock feet
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IVANGOROD, Russia _ Better they should call this place Ivan Go
Rob.
</P>
<P>
   You pass through here by train from St. Petersburg on the way to
Estonia. It's the border stop. A hundred yards or so farther down
the track and you're free and clear.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Before, I'd always exited the country at the Moscow
international airport. It takes awhile, and the customs and
passport officials are surly and sullen toward you, but what can
you expect? You're getting to leave and they're having to stay.
</P>
<P>
   This time, by train, I arrived at the border at 3:30 a.m. I was
sleeping in my compartment at the time, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   I awoke to a pounding at the door and angry shouts from the
corridor. The border guards were at the door.
</P>
<P>
   What they dearly love is to burst into your compartment using
their own set of keys, flip on the lights and roust you out before
you're even halfway awake.
</P>
<P>
   I'd ruined their fun by having jammed the lock from the inside,
using a Swiss Army knife.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal against border guards. But there's a lot of
robbery on Russia trains. My friend and interpreter, Pavlik, who
was traveling with me, had been robbed of $1,200 on a similar trip
a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves were able to enter his compartment and go through his
bags without him ever waking up. He thinks they used sleeping gas.
Russians think that way.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I got the door open as quickly as I could, fumbling with
the lock and dropping my pocket knife in the process. I made a
mental note to retrieve it later.
</P>
<P>
   No less than four guards tried to push their way in. Everyone,
Pavlik included, was shouting in Russian. For all I knew they might
be reciting the Lord's Prayer or cursing each other's mother. It
all sounds the same to me.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize there was a problem until Pavlik told me they
wanted to see how much money I was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me the money!'' as it were.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled my stash of good ol' American dollars from the bag I
kept under the bed and started counting out hundreds. Meanwhile,
the border guards were counting their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Before even bothering to examine my customs papers, they told me
my papers weren't in order. Never mind that I had listed all the
currency, and even the travelers checks I brought into the country.
There was no official stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I thought about it, I remembered the airport customs
official, who was busy talking to a young woman, waving me through.
Now I could wave my money goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   All but $500, they said. That's the maximum you're allowed to
take with you when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik intervened, claiming that he should be allowed $500 as
well. The border guard doing all the talking knew a fair split when
he heard it:
</P>
<P>
   I'd get $500, Pavlik would get $500 and they'd take the rest _
exactly $670.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't interested in the travelers checks or the
approximately $100 worth of French francs I had on me.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbacks were what these old Reds wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I protested loudly, and even tried to take their picture taking
my money. I was informed I could either put down the camera or
they'd put me in jail.
</P>
<P>
   My only other option, they said, was to leave the train and
appeal their decision in the proper court when it opened Monday
morning. This was early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a seasoned world traveler. I've been to Mexico. I know how
to handle these situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much will it take to make this problem go away?'' I asked
the border guard. I stopped short of winking and nudging him
good-naturedly in the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you trying to bribe a government officer?'' he responded,
his eyes narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people you just can't deal with.
</P>
<P>
   I paid up. They even gave me a receipt. All was on the up and
up, leastways as far as the cash.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later, when I started looking for it, that I
realized one of them had stolen my Swiss Army knife as well.
</P>
<P>
   This was my seventh trip to Russia. Lucky seven.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, I'm never coming back.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'' -- EXCERPTS FROM CRISTINA
SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  North American English-language print rights. 
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the
world--Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to
the top of the publishing world, then switched to television to
create the ``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual, Cristina became well-known to English-speakers when
she began broadcasting her show for CBS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, told in three 1200-word parts, will inspire anyone to
do more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina
lost it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's
revolution. She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will
to work and to believe in her own dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission in this book is to show her readers how to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   THE SERIES IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN SPANISH, slugged
BC-CRISTINA-SPANISH-BOOK-EXCERPT-NYTSF) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. She
lays down rules of disciplined goal-setting and shows her readers
how to follow them to success.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila
of Miami Sound Machine, of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior, and
finally of how he led her to become more successful than even she
had dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the longs and
grueling pace, the seductions of fame and influence. She also
counters her critics who say the show is too sexy, and tells for
the first time why she chose not to renew her English-language deal
with CBS.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'': PART 1
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Spanish translation available) 
 North American English-language print rights 
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't easy to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
</P>
<P>
   I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
</P>
<P>
   My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
</P>
<P>
   One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
</P>
<P>
   She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
</P>
<P>
   I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
</P>
<P>
   That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things I've learned:
</P>
<P>
   _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I divide my goals into categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Begin right now.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'': PART 2

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time--one of life's little coincidences--another
friend, a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he
was organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and
he wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin
music.
</P>
<P>
   I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
</P>
<P>
   One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
</P>
<P>
   It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos; I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
</P>
<P>
   But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered, and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
</P>
<P>
   One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight--with razor blades--over
a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
</P>
<P>
   That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
</P>
<P>
   We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
</P>
<P>
   One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
</P>
<P>
   I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
</P>
<P>
   That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth painting my toenails.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
</P>
<P>
   All I could do was laugh!
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
</P>
<P>
   Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair--my entire
appearance--along with everything I had grown used to during the
past 20 years of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat and low sugar, and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
</P>
<P>
   Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blond and blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
blonde) to represent Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
</P>
<P>
   Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no--ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races--Asian, African American or Hispanic--underwent to
alter their features to make them look ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathan Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
</P>
<P>
   But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
</P>
<P>
   So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
</P>
<P>
   What I never understood, though, and what I never will
understand, is how it was reported in the trade publications again
and again that our show had failed and that we were canceled
because of poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my Iife? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
</P>
<P>
   I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
</P>
<P>
   I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
</P>
<P>
   I did all these things! I completed those cycles.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

<P>
   Es dificil ser rico.
</P>
<P>
   Todo el mundo quiere que las personas que lleguen arriba hayan
empezado desde abajo. Yo no empece desde abajo, debo admitirlo.
</P>
<P>
   Mi abuelo era millonario. En Cuba le llamaban ``el zar del
papel'', porque era copropietario de las revistas Bohemia, Carteles
y Vanidades, que fueron las mas importantes de la isla, ademas de
tener el monopolio absoluto de la venta de todo el papel para
publicaciones en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Naci en Miramar, un suburbio idilico y ricachon de
</P>
<P>
   La Habana. Alli creci hasta que nos vimos obligados a emigrar a
Miami (Estados Unidos), en 1960, poco despues de haber triunfado la
revolucion de Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Pero yo no provengo directamente de los tropicos ni de la islita
paradisiaca de las palmeras, del tabaco y del ron; mi familla es
solamente una segunda generacion de cubanos. En verdad somos vascos
por los cuatro costados, y aunque yo me aferro a mi cubania, no hay
duda que herede los genes y el caracter de mi casta.
</P>
<P>
   Ser vasco es, de por si, controvertido, complicado,
singular...Es una sociedad a la inversa, donde los hombres cocinan
platos gourmet en sociedades gastronomicas, las mujeres son tercas
y duras como las piedras, y donde todo el mundo--hasta las vacas y
las ovejas--sobrevive a base de obstinacion y pura tenacidad. Con
esa herencia vasca naci en el Caribe y vine a radicar en la
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   El impacto mas grande que experimente fue escuchar la palabra
``spic'' aplicada a los hispanos como termino peyorativo. No
entendia por que me llamaban spic, hasta que alguien me explico que
la pa- labra era derivada de la forma en que el hispano pronuncia
el verbo ``to speak,'' acortando el sonido de la vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Especificamente, no entendia por que me decian, ``Spic, por que
no regresas al pais de donde viniste?'', cuando ninguno de los
antepasados de aquellos ``nativos'' eran de aqui tampoco.
</P>
<P>
   Me matricule en la Universidad de Miami, estudiando
comunicaciones. Durante el ultimo ano de estudios, la universidad
requeria un internado en alguna publicacion: yo quise hacerlo en
Vanidades, porque mis lazos sentimentales eran muy pro- fundos con
la revista, naturalmente. Mi familia se la acababa de vender en
aquellos momentos a Miguel Angel Capriles y a su socio, Armando de
Armas, quienes habian sido sus distribudores en Venezuela durante
la epoca de mi abuelo, en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a redactar todo tipo de articulos, desde temas de
belleza y modas, hasta noticias internacionales. Considero que mi
mayor logro durante esa etapa fue la adquisicion de un vocabulario
panamericano, que fue lo que mas me sirvio para conseguir el
trabajo que ahora desempeno en la television.
</P>
<P>
   (En 1973) Frank Calderon, quien era el director de Buenhogar,
obtuvo la posicion de director de Cosmopolitan en Espanol, y lo
primero que hizo fue llevarse a Mati Saralegui de Vanidades como su
primera redactora.
</P>
<P>
   Como buena Chica Cosmo, decidi mudarme de mi casa en Key
Biscayne a los veintiseis anos para instalarme en un pequeno
apartamento, con mi hermana menor, Maria Eugenia. El hecho de que
se le fueran dos de sus hijas de la casa--sin casarse, como
``aventureras''--le causo un gran trauma a mi padre.
</P>
<P>
   En aquellos momentos estaba arruinado, despues de una aventura
financiera en Arabia Saudita, y trataba de vender la mansion de Key
Biscayne para recortar el presupuesto. Pero antes de que eso
sucediera, para independizarme y no convertirme en una carga para
ellos, me mude.
</P>
<P>
   Empece a darme cuenta de que mi vida era muy vacia. Fue,
sencillaniente, que me tope con el vacio. Me di cuenta de que tenia
que controlar el aspecto personal de mi vida para dedicarle toda
esa energia que desbordaba a mi trabajo, y seguir adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de los muchachos con quienes estaba saliendo se llamaba Tony
Menendez. ``Necesito tranquilizarme y tener un hijo. Este es un
buen hombre y se que sera un buen padre.'' Y, friamente, lo
calcule.
</P>
<P>
   Me case con el, y un ano despues tuve mi primera hija, Cristina
Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, a los veintintieve anos de edad.
</P>
<P>
   Estaba locamente enamorada de mi bebita, Titi, pero no de mi
esposo. Era un hombre bueno y yo lo queria, pero no estaba
enamorada de el. A medida que pasaba el tiempo, y mientras que
transcurria mi ano de domesticidad, me daba cuenta de que mi
marido, aunque trabaja todos los dias del ano (y que conste que
todos los dias encasquetaba su saco y su cuello y corbata y
trabajaba) sencillamente no vendia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvinios que mudarnos para el apartamiento de tres cuartos de mi
padre. Un dia mi esposo me dijo, ``Tienes que trabajar y
ayudarme.'' Yo le mire a los ojos y le respondi: ``Yo deje mi
carrera para empezar una familia contigo. Si tu me pides que
regrese al trabajo, tienes que entender el lio en que te vas a
meter.''
</P>
<P>
   Me dirigi a Cosmopolitan y regrese a la oficin de mi ex jefe,
Frank Calderon. ``Lo siento'', me respodio.
</P>
<P>
   Saliendo del edificio, y tratando de pensar que iba a hacer en
mi desesperacion, di media vuelta y me dirigi hacia la oficina de
Elvira Mendoza, a quien habia dejado plantada en Vanidades para
irme a Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Fui sincera con ella y le confese que necesitaba trabajo. Su
respuesta fue inmediata: ``Si, como no, yo se lo doy''.
</P>
<P>
   Y asi regrese, circulo completo, al punto donde habia comenza-
do, porque me pagaba casi el mismo sueldo que ganaba al princi-
pio, el salario mas infimo que me podia asignar.
</P>
<P>
   Trabajaba a todas horas, en lo que me mandaran. Y hacia lo que
fuera necesarlo con tal de ganarme mi dinerito.
</P>
<P>
   Fue entonces que el dueno de la empresa me propuso, como trabajo
adicional, ser coordinadora editorial para una revista de formato:
Intimidades. Basicamente era una revista de educacion sexual, y
como en Vanidades ganaba tan poquito dinero, lo acepte.
</P>
<P>
   Pasaba el dia entero trabajando en Vanidades, redactando.
Entonces, a las cinco de la tarde, me montaba en mi carro, me comia
un sandwich por el camino, iba a recoger a mi bebita, la metia en
una canasta, y la llevaba a casa de mi suegra Marieta, una santa
que trabajaba en una fabrica de manufacturar ropa de baile.
</P>
<P>
   Yo corria nuevamente para mi oficina y abriamos Intimidades.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidades resulto un exito a nivel internacional, y la segui
dirigiendo. Hasta que un dia, Frank Calderon, por razones que aun
desconozco, que dio un tanganazo con su miquina de escribir contra
un buro, y se marcho repentinamente. La gerencia me ofrecio su
posicion como directora de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora permitanme hacer un aparte, como recapitulacion de toda
esta experiencia. Muchas veces las mujeres profesionales me piden
consejo sobre como coordinar el trabajo y los hijos. Pero tambien
me dicen: ``Ja! Para ti es facil, porque tu tienes sirvientas,
servicio en la casa, tu no tienes que cocinar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pero eso es ahora. Que poquito se acuerde nadie de los tiempos
dificiles. A nadie se le ocurre pensar que para llegar a la
posicion que hoy ocupo, he tenido que atravesar una serie de
etapas. Nadie se aparecio, en mi camino, con una varita magica para
decirme: ``Puff! De ahora en lo adelante tu seras Cristina, la de
la television''.
</P>
<P>
   El triunfo tiene muy poco que ver con la suerte.

<P>
   Como el mundo editorial en que me desenvolvia estaba tan rela-
cionado con las companias disqueras, en una ocasion me llamo un
representante de la CBS para pedirme un favor con estas palabras
profeticas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Acabamos de firmar a un conjunto local, que se llama el Miami
Sound Machine. Los vamos a llevar a la discoteca Regine's en Nueva
York para lanzarlos como nuevos artistas de la compania, y
necesitamos que tu nos apoyes editorialmente con ellos''.
</P>
<P>
   Al mismo tiempo--casualidades de la vida!--me habia llamado otro
amigo periodista de Puerto Rico, que estaba organizando un festival
de musica caribena en Cancun, Mexico, para pedirme que le
recomendara a un grupo que representara la musica latina que mas
estaba sonando en los Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   Sin pensarlo dos veces, le recomende al Miami Sound Machine. Y
fue en el avion que nos llevo hacia el festival, donde por primera
vez conoci a Emilio y Gloria Estefan, y (casualmente!) a Marcos
Avila, el bajista de la banda.
</P>
<P>
   Durante ese viaje Emilio y Gloria fueron muy agradables, y
rapidamente entablamos amistad, tan espontanea y sincera que poco
despues Tony (mi esposo) y yo comenzamos a salir con ellos como
parejas.
</P>
<P>
   Viendolos a ellos, percibiendo la felicidad en su matrimonio, me
di cuenta de lo infeliz que yo era. Empece a darme cuenta que tenia
que cambiar las circunstancias en que me hallaba con el ejemplo de
ellos: trabajar juntos, echar para adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Un dia Emilio me dijo: ``Me voy a Peru con Gloria y con la
banda. Ya te estas divorciando. Ya tus problemas no tienen arreglo.
Por que no me dejas invitarte y te pasas diez dias alla, con
nosotros?''.
</P>
<P>
   Era mi destino encontrarme con mi destino.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, que es muy bromista, empezo a venderme a Marcos, no se
ni por que. Me repetia: ``Marcos Avila es mi mano derecha. Es un
muchacho muy serio... por que no se empatan?''.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos hoy me cuenta que durante todas sus experiencias con
Emilio, este siempre ha tenido este tipo de vision, presentimientos
que han llegado a convertirse en realidad. Ahora pienso que tal vez
Emilio presintio la reaccion quimica entre Marcos y yo antes de que
transcurriera todo lo que voy a contarles.
</P>
<P>
   Pero en aquel momento yo escuchaba sus palabras, y pensaba:
``Marcos es bajito, es gordito, tiene malas pulgas, es callado. Y
es casado! A mi me encantan los hombres altos, los guapos, los
lindos. Tambien tengo malas pulgas. Seria una combi- nacion
espantosa!''.
</P>
<P>
   Una noche fuimos todos a una discoteca. Yo estaba en la mesa de
Gloria y Emilio, y fui al bano. De repente veo que una mujer negra
y una mujer blanca comienzan a fajarse, con una navaja, por un
musico.
</P>
<P>
   Y el musico era Marcos! Me paralice. Hice lo que tenia que hacer
en piloto automatico, sin siquiera echarle un vistazo a las
rivales. Sali despavorida de aquel bano. Y al salir, Marcos se me
acerco para decirme: ``Quieres bailar?''
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``Ni loca!''. Y me regrese a la mesa para ver como
se desarrollaba el resto de aquella situacion.
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche Marcos me explico que estaba atravesando esa etapa
caotica de inestabilidad total que precede a un divorcio. A veces
dejaba su hogar para refugiarse en casa de su abuela, donde se
escondia por un par de semanas antes de regresar a su propia casa y
visitar a su bebita.
</P>
<P>
   Por mi parte, mi ex marido y yo estabamos separados, con pape-
les y todo.
</P>
<P>
   Con Marcos fue todo como el caso clasico de ``un clavo saca a
otro clavo''. Nos apoyamos el uno al otro, o la gordura se apoyo en
la hinchazon. Fuimos dos almas desgraciadas que se encontraron,
como dos desamparados bajo el puente.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de uno de los conciertos nos reunimos todos en una suite
y formamos tremenda fiesta. Al terminar la diversion, el se ofrecio
a acompanarme de regreso a mi habitacion. Entro conmi- go, se sento
en mi cama, me empezo a dar masajes en la espalda, y me dijo: ``Si
tu y yo hacemos el amor...''.
</P>
<P>
   De repente se corrigio:''No. Cuando tu y yo hagamos el amor, tu
vas a ver lo que es un hombre de verdad''.
</P>
<P>
   Yo me hice la que no lo habia oido; le dije good-bye bien
rapidito, le di un besito tonto, y se fue. Pero me quede pensando,
y con aquella promesa por dentro. Al dia siguiente me levante a las
seis de la manana, y me arregle hasta las unas de los pies!
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche volvio, y todas sus promesas se quedaron cortas.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de aquella experiencia, nunca mas nos separamos. Fue
como hacer el amor con alguien para quien te habian predisenado con
ese unico proposito y fin. Despues de tantos anos de infelicidad
conyugal, encontrarme con alguien hecho a la medida de mi cuerpo y
alma fue como un bofeton de proporciones karmicas.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos tiene once anos menos que yo. En aquel momento tenia una
cola de caballo como Miguel Bose, hasta la mitad de la espal- da;
en el frente, estaba rapado. Ademas, llevaba una argolla en una
oreja. En fin, el era un musico.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres estaban completamente opuestos a la relacion. Aparte
de que Titi, mi nina, era tremenda! Recuerdo que el primer dia que
Marcos llego a casa, Titi tenia unas esposas de policia plasticas
de juguete, y lo amarro a la escalera de metal de la casa, lo dejo
ahi, y boto la llave... para que el no pudiera estar conmigo.
Tuvimos que romper las esposas.
</P>
<P>
   Ante aquella situacion, le adverti a el: ``Tienes que primera
mente conquistarla a ella, porque yo no me voy a casar si ella no
quiere que me case.
</P>
<P>
   Al cabo de nuestro primer ano juntos, la nina habia llegado a
tenerle tanto carino a Marcos que un dia me dijo: ``Mami, el nos
quiere. El es bueno. Por que no nos casamos con el?''.
</P>
<P>
   No pude menos que reirme!
</P>
<P>
   Para la boda me puse un vestido blanco de algodon que habia
comprado en Mexico, y Titi llevaba uno exacto; compre unas
florecitas blancas para el pelo, y otras a ella. Entonces ella se
paro a mi lado, con su vestidito exacto al mio, y las dos nos
casamos con Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Mas tarde, a pesar de su exito y del dinero que estaba ganando,
y despues de doce anos consecutivos con el Miami Sound machine,
decidio irse del grupo. ``Ya tuve las fans, y las limosinas y ``The
Johnny Carson Show,'' fueron sus palabars exactas. ``Ahora quiero
tener una familia.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos abrio una compania de relaciones publicas: MagikCity
Media, la cual aun mantiene. Y una vez que el comprobo que a el le
estaba yendo bien, empezo a lavarme el cerebro para que yo me fuera
de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Mi reaction: ``Tu estas loco?''
</P>
<P>
   No obstante, Marcos me convencio de que lo que yo estaba
haciendo en aquella empresa era vender mi tiempo en vez de mi
talento.
</P>
<P>
   Y recuerden bien todos los que esten leyendo este libro ese
consejo tan importante, a cualquier nivel de vida en que se
encuentren en estos momentos.

<P>
   Para nadar en el mundo de la television, nada fue facil.
Empezando porque tuve que despojarme, como una serpiente, del
cuerpo, la cara, el pelo y mi apariencia completa... y de todo a lo
que estaba acostumbrada durante los ultimos 20 anos de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Habia sido escritora y directora de revistas, trabajaba en un
buro como una esclava, y cuando me tomaba un receso, me daba por
devorar todo lo que habia en las maquinas de alimentos, lo cual me
hacia engordar.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando hoy miro los videos del primer ano del ``Show de
Cristina,'' me horrorizo. Me veo fea, ridicula, gritona y como un
caballito en rifa, llena de gangarrias, cadenas, pulseras, aretes
de tres pisos, con todo colgando y haciendo ruido con el microfono.
</P>
<P>
   El cambio fue paulatino. Poco a poco fuimos puliendo mi imagen,
y prestando atencion a la reaccion del publico. Me costo mucho
trabajo encontrar mi estilo. Ahora conservo el cabello liso,
cortado en una sola capa, y me gusta el maquillaje tenue y la ropa
sencilla.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a comer sin grasa y sin azucar, y pequenas cantidades de
proteina cada tres horas, para mantener mi energia estable y poder
funcionar mejor durante todo el dia. El resultado fue que por
primera vez me veia regia en la television, y por primera vez en mi
vida entendi lo que era ser una mujer atrac- tiva porque cuando
llegaba a cualquier lugar, la gente se volteaba a mirarme aunque no
supieran quien era. Eso jamas me habia pasado... y tenia 41 anos!
</P>
<P>
   Otro factor en mi apariencia era ser tan blanca, tan rubia y con
los ojos claros. Cuando el show fue lanzado al aire, llovian las
cartas de mis hermanos hispanos en todos los Estados Unidos, en las
cuales mencionaban que yo era ``demaslado blanca'' y ``guera''
(rubia para los mexicanos) para representar a las hispanas, cuando
brown era beautiful ...y yo no era brown.
</P>
<P>
   Hasta que comprendieron que lo que me estaban haciendo a mi era
tan racista como lo que les estaban haciendo los anglos a ellos...
y las criticas cesaron. Pero el proceso torno seis meses de cartas
del publico en las que me decian que me pusiera mis ruborizador.
</P>
<P>
   Una vez se me acerco una senora de edad avanzada y me reprocho:
``Ay, usted nada mas que habla de sexo, Cristina''.
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``No senora, yo hablo de todo! Desde platillos
voladores hasta el cancer del seno. Usted solamente recuerda los
programas de sexo.''
</P>
<P>
   Presento temas de sexo porque aparte de la enorme necesidad que
hay de informar sobre la materia, cada vez que incluyo algo de
sexo, en el programa los ratings se van por las nubes, y los
numeros desplazan la hipocresia.
</P>
<P>
   Por que en vez de criticar un programa llamado a una emisora de
radio o escribiendo cartas airadas no apagan los televisores cuando
hay algo de sexo? Pero...Noo! Al reves. Se prenden mas y mas
televisores.
</P>
<P>
   Es evidente que muchas personas no tienen la menor idea de lo
que es la sexualidad humana, y alguien les tiene que explicar la
verdad. Obviamiente sus padres no han asumido la responsabilidad de
hacerlo, porque la responsabilidad de educar sexualmente a nuestros
hijos, igual que moralmente, es de nosotros los padres.
</P>
<P>
   Mi primer viaje con ``El Show de Cristina'' a Mexico fue muy
importante en el desarrollo del programa. Tuvimos una fastuosa
conferencia de prensa, seguida de un almuerzo, durante el cual me
presentaron a la prensa mexicana para que les explicara el concepto
del programa. Fue una experiencia agradable y alentadora.
</P>
<P>
   La debacle que se avecinaba se comenzo a fraguar cuando
``Cristina'' comenzo a trasmitirse en el horario de las cuatro de
la tarde (igual que en los Estados Unidos) y reemplazando la pro-
gramacion infantil que existia previamente a esa hora.
</P>
<P>
   Es decir, que en un pais tan tradicional como Mexico, eligieron
para un programa polemico y controversial como el mio, un horario
en que quienes veian la television eran principalmente los ninos.
</P>
<P>
   A partir de ese momento comenzaron las quejas de algunas
asociaciones de padres de familia, y del publico en general, contra
el programa y, especialmente, contra el horario del programa.
</P>
<P>
   Un poco despues cambiron el programa al horario de las once de
la noche, y yo, inocentemente ajena a esta caceria de brujas que se
estaba produciendo, viaje a Mexico con mi equipo para grabar por
primera vez.
</P>
<P>
   Al llegar al estudio, todo fue de maravilla. El foro tenia
capacidad para 500 espectaclores y estaba siempre abarrotado de
personas que esperaban el dia entero para poder entrar.
</P>
<P>
   Pero una vez que todas estas asociaciones, que mientras tanto me
estaban atacando, se enteraron que yo estaba grabando en la Ciudad
de Mexico, enviaron un sequito de periodistas para entre- vistarme.
Excepto que no me hacian las preguntas normales, como los
periodistas en otras partes. Aquello era un ataque frontal, verbal
y luego escrito. Yo me preguntaba: Dios mio, pero por que este
rencor? No entendia lo que estaba sucediendo!
</P>
<P>
   ``Bodas Homosexuales,'' el programa el mas controversial hasta
la fecha, me hizo cuestionar hasta que punto se puede correr el
riesgo de poner en peligro la estabilidad de la familla, y de seres
quendos a un nivel personal, por cuestiones de principlos.
</P>
<P>
   El programa fue lanzado al aire el 4 de enero de 1996, y aunque
fue conducido con decoro y respeto, se suscito una campana de odio
muy intensa en Miami que desato una desagradable corriente de
intolerancia.
</P>
<P>
   Todo esto culmino en una manifestacion frente a los estudios de
Univision en Miami, donde aproximadamente 1,500 personas acudieron
con pancartas que decian: ``ABAJO CRISTINA!'', ``N0 A `EL SHOW DE
CRISTNA,' SI A CRISTO!''.
</P>
<P>
   Mi papa va a misa todos los dias. A raiz de este incidente,
estaba en la iglesia, y como hacia frio, llevaba puesto una
chaqueta del programal que dice ``Cristina'' en la parte de atras.
</P>
<P>
   El sacerdote estaba diciendo tantos horrores de nosotros en el
pulpito que mi papa, para no causar otro incidente, se quito la
chaqueta y la doblo, para que no se viera el nombre de su hija.
</P>
<P>
   Mi hijo que entonces tenia 10 anos aparentemente se entero de
los ataques en su colegio parroquial, ya que un dia llego a la casa
y me pregunto muy consternado: ``Mami, estamos teniendo
problemas?''.
</P>
<P>
   Estos incidentes desafortunados me hicieron suffir las criticas
en carne propia.
</P>
<P>
   Surgio la consabida pregunta: no me parecia mal que los ninos
vieran una boda de homosexuales en la television, a las cuatro de
la tarde? Si me hubiera parecido mal, no lo habria presentado.
</P>
<P>
   Me parecen aun mas alarmantes las cifras de ninas prostitutas,
de abuso sexual infantil, de drogadiccion y alcoholismo entre los
adolescentes.
</P>
<P>
   Pero aunque me alarme y me aterre--dada la profesion que escogi,
y la suerte que Dios me ha dado de tener un programa como
este--tengo el deber y el compromiso de informar, y el compromiso
de reflejar la realidad que existe en el mundo en que vivimos.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres emigraron de Cuba para que yo creciera en una
sociedad donde no hubiera censura. Y si los ataques personales eran
el precio que yo tenia que pagar--no solo el precio personal, sino
el de mi familla--estaba mas que nunca dispuesta a pagarlo por el
resto de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Gracias a Dios, ellos piensan igual que yo, especialmente mis
tres hijos.

 &HT;    New president-CEO hopes to lift spirits, stock at Able Telcom
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Able Telcom Holding Corp. has named its
fourth chief executive in as many years in an effort to stabilize
the company and jump-start its flagging stock.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dupuis, a wireless telecommunications executive who lives
in Boca Raton, was picked as Able's top executive after a
five-month search by Korn/Ferry International, a Los Angeles-based
executive headhunting firm. He will start August 25 as Able
Telcom's president, director and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Able Telcom's previous CEO, Gerry Hall, stepped down from his
$200,000-a-year job in March to run the company's Traffic
Management Group, a division that installs computerized highway
toll systems. The previous two chief executives were fired. Neither
Dupuis nor Able Telcom would reveal Dupuis' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Dupuis, 44, said he was contacted by Korn/Ferry several months
ago. In January he had just finished a two-year stint as president
and CEO at the Boca Raton office of Radio Movil Digital Americas, a
wireless phone company with business in Argentina, Brazil and
Venezuela. RMD Americas was sold in January to International
Wireless Corp., a San Mateo, Calif. firm, and its 20-employee Boca
Raton office was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   For six years before that, Dupuis ran the international
operations for Bethesda, Md.-based Comsat Corp., a wireless phone
and satellite signal company.
</P>
<P>
   Dupuis said he was drawn to Able because he thought the company
had good prospects and he did not want to leave South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has its challenges but it also has great
opportunities,'' he said from his home. ``There's been a lot of
negative publicity lately about the company, most of which is
untrue. The company needs to get over that and needs to demonstrate
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Able stock (Nasdaq: ABTE) closed at $7.50 Thursday, up 31 cents
on the day but down from a high of $20.31 two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Able Telcom has 2,650 employees, mostly in this country,
including 12 at its West Palm Beach headquarters. The 11-year-old
company primarily lays fiber-optic cable and designs turnpike toll
systems in the southeastern United States and installs phone lines
in Brazil and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been bedeviled since June by Wall Street analyst
Manuel Asensio, a short-seller who bets that stock prices will
fall. The part-time Miami resident has been issuing ``sell''
recommendations on Able's stock and issuing reports saying that
Able is having problems paying for a telecommunications subsidiary
it bought from WorldCom in April. Able has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Though not part of the job description when Able began its
search, part of the new CEO's task will be to thwart Asensio and
repair the damage he has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stockholder appreciation _ that's the name of the game,'' said
Able's Frazier Gaines, who had served as interim president and CEO
and will resume as CEO of Able's International Division. ``(Dupuis)
has a history of moving into adverse situations and turning them
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Able named John Mario, former chief financial
officer of 1st United Bancorp in Palm Beach, as executive vice
president and Curtis Dale, GTE's senior manager of operations in
Caracas, Venezuela, as chief operating officer.

 &HT;    Commentary: Take time to splurge
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I missed it. Once again, I'm a day late and a dollar short.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know there is a National Splurge Day? Neither did I,
until it was past. It's a day promoting self-indulgence and the
abdicating of responsibilities. I always miss the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In prepartion for National Splurge Day, the Women's Network, a
websiite on the Internet, polled women and asked, ``If you could do
one thing to indulge yourself, what would it be?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers are worth noting for all of us who missed the big
day but have serious plans to catch up with individual observances:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Eat Ben &AMP; Jerry's Ice Cream straight from the
container.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Read a good book from cover to cover in flannel
pajamas.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Spend the day shopping till you drop.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Order sexy lingerie from Victoria's Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``See more than one movie that YOU choose in the same
day.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Take a bubble bath while listening to music and drinking
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Eat as much chocolate as you would like _ preferably
Godiva.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Spend the day at a spa pampering yourself completely.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``Take a day off from work for no reason at all and spend
time alone.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was an entry from a mother of young children: ``Lock
the bathroom door and stay there alone for more than five
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I could like these women. I want to spend time with them. If I
could, I'd share some of my own favorite indulgences:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Go to an art museum and spend as much time as I like
pondering the brush strokes of Monet.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Get a massage while listening to taped rain forest sounds.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Eat as many friend potatoes and onions as I like, followed
by a heaping bowl of bread pudding _ preferably all made by my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Play with kittens and puppies.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Rock babies at the hospital nursery.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Pretend I am redecorating my house and go to furniture
stores and pick out all new furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Sit on a beach and watch the water.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Invite my best friends to a long, leisurely dinner at a
fine restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Go to a greenhouse and buy all the plants I like and then
spend the afternoon planting them.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Sing at the top of my lungs while taking a 20-minute
shower.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Swing gently in a hammock beneath a flowering mimosa tree.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Learn to play the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Sit in a Texas pasture in the springtime and do a
watercolor of wildflowers ... and be good at it.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Take a ballroom dancing class.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do? What ``gift of the present'' would you
present to yourself? Take 10 minutes and make a list. Put down the
outrageous things about which you only dream. Put down the things
that make you laugh just to think of them. Put down the secret
things you'd never share with another soul.
</P>
<P>
   Now choose one of them. Find some way to do this for yourself
this week.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the long list of things we must do each day: work,
cook meals, run errands, chauffeur the kids to their activities,
and on and on. There's one more thing, though, we must do for
ourselves daily: splurge.
</P>
<P>
   These splurges have different names, of course. Ann Bender, in
her book (IT)Everyday Sacred(RO), refers to the pauses she takes in
her day as ``little Sabbaths.'' She recalls advice from a friend
who told her, ``We all need a certain amount of fallow time ...
watching the grass grow, sitting on the hillside, staring out the
window daydreaming. When we don't have it, there is a deeper
intelligence that won't come forth.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't need to set aside a special day to be kind to
ourselves. We need to find time each day. It's not irresponsible.
It's absolutely vital.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: When bullets fly, support Clinton
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When I was halfway through writing a column
condemning President Clinton's treatment of his closest supporters,
my editor called an editorial board meeting to discuss the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bombings?'' I asked. ``Have they bombed us again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Clinton ordered air strikes against
terrorists bases in Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awwright!'' I said. ``I'll vote for that.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take us long to agree that we would rally behind
Clinton's decision as long as there was credible evidence that we
were bombing the facilities of the people responsible for killing
257 people and injuring more than 5,500 in the Aug. 7 bomb attacks
at the U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to my office and discovered that I no longer wanted
to write a column condemning Clinton right after the man made a
critical national security decision that I strongly supported.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, I would have reached over the top of my
Smith-Corona typewriter and pulled the copy paper with the two
carbons out of carriage with a satisfying ``rrrrrrrttt.''
</P>
<P>
   With practiced precision I then would have grabbed up new copy
and carbon paper and snapped the new original with two carbons back
into the typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Now I close the text file with the unfinished column and
instruct the computer to open a new text file. Some of the flair
has been lost over the years.
</P>
<P>
   After the cowardly terrorist attacks on our embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, I wrote a column
attempting to explore why the United States is the target of deadly
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, supports democracy, individual freedoms and
religious tolerance and has never taken over one square-inch of
land from another nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point'' I concluded, ``understanding anti-Americanism
becomes unnecessary. When reasonable methods fail, the United
States should be prepared to meet force with superior force.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton appears to have done exactly what I had hoped he
would do, the timing of a column critical of him, albeit on another
subject, seemed inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   I supported the decision by President Reagan when he sent
ground-based F-111s and carrier aircraft into Libya to bomb the
headquarters of Col. Moammar Gadhafi and some of his
terrorist-support operations.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's decision was based on credible evidence that Gadhafi
ordered the April 5, 1986, bombing of a West Berlin discotheque
that killed a U.S. serviceman and two others.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi barely escaped with his life. Since then, the Libyan
dictator has adopted a more reasonable attitude about doing
anything to anger the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports are that Osama bin Laden also escaped unharmed
from Thursday's bombing against terrorists targets in Afghanistan
and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is a virulently anti-American Saudi millionaire who is
believed to be a major sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence also links him and his organization to the attacks on
America's embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gadhafi, bin Laden may get the message and find a new way
to spend his millions. If not, I still believe the United States
should remain prepared to meet force with superior force.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I had not agreed with Clinton's decision to order
military strikes against terrorist facilities inside two sovereign
nations, I believe in supporting the commander in chief once U.S.
troops are ordered into harm's way, if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   When the bullets stop flying, however, I will finish that column
condemning Clinton's treatment of his supporters.

LAYERS OF LIARS 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Starr was appointed to investigate Whitewater.
He began to focus on whether Clinton and his friends had
orchestrated a cover-up of Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Then he acquired an additional scandal, Filegate, and began to
investigate whether Clinton had covered that up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then he received Linda Tripp's tapes and zeroed in on whether
Clinton and Vernon Jordan had covered up an affair between Clinton
and Lewinsky in order to protect Clinton's cover-up of the Paula
Jones incident.
</P>
<P>
   Then Starr subpoenaed Jordan and Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie, evidently to determine, among other things, whether Clinton
had conspired with them to cover up his conspiracy with Jordan to
cover up the Lewinsky affair in order to shield Clinton's cover-up
of the Jones incident.
</P>
<P>
   Then Starr subpoenaed Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal to
determine whether Blumenthal was orchestrating a smear campaign
against Starr in order to silence the investigation and thereby
cover up all the preceding cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This week's interrogations of Thomason and the White House
lawyers indicate Starr is now focusing on events subsequent to--and
designed to thwart--the Lewinsky investigation he launched in
mid-January. In other words, he is investigating a possible
cover-up of a possible cover-up of a possible cover-up of a
possible cover-up seemingly unrelated to the possible cover-ups
Starr had been investigating for four years.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the Washington Post reports, Starr now plans to issue a
report that omits all the material he was initially appointed to
investigate, the farce is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. According to Associated Press sources, Thomason
``was warned early on by lawyers not to learn too much about the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky because he might have to
testify about it.'' Were the lawyers keeping Thomason in the dark
in order to cover up the cover-ups of the cover-ups?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that by summoning Thomason
before the grand jury just as he was preparing to coach Clinton for
the latter's Aug. 17 testimony, ``prosecutors might have been
trying to send Thomason an ominous message--that they might summon
him to the courthouse again, to describe any new advice he
dispenses to the president.'' By this reasoning, whatever Clinton
does to defend himself against the charges of cover-up becomes part
of the cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Starr can prove these endless epicycles of conspiracy. But
he is paying a political price. It is becoming more and more
difficult to understand the offenses under investigation and why
the public should care about them. And if members of Congress can't
explain the report to their constituents, they won't impeach
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm defending the president. I don't want a subpoena.

TEMPERANCE KILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN RAUCH

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, to prevent any misunderstanding, the warning: Alcohol,
when abused, is vicious, dangerous stuff. Each year about 100,000
Americans die alcohol-related deaths. No one should drink and drive
or drink to excess. Some people--teen-agers, people on
contraindicated medications, pregnant women, and those who have
trouble controlling their consumption--should avoid alcohol,
period. And all that you know already.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what you may not know--or may know only fuzzily. For
most people of middle age and beyond, one drink a day helps prevent
heart disease and makes you less likely to die prematurely. After
one or (for men) two drinks, bad effects swamp the good--dosage is
everything! But on average the positive cardiovascular effect of
moderate drinking is not small, and it is not in dispute.
Epidemiologists figure that if all Americans became teetotalers
tomorrow, about 80,000 more people might die each year of heart
disease. So there are lives on both sides of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lives might, just as an example, belong to my
father. He is 69, has mild hypertension (controlled with
medication) and, but for the rare social occasion, doesn't drink.
He has read some news reports suggesting moderate alcohol use may
yield benefits, but his doctor has never mentioned such benefits,
and my father has never given a thought to changing his drinking
habits. And, in the standard view of public health officialdom,
that is as it should be: People should not be encouraged to drink,
even in moderation, and alcohol should not be linked with better
health.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that moderate drinking is linked with better
health. We don't know exactly why; some evidence suggests
alcohol--of whatever sort, by the way, not just red
wine--stimulates ``good'' (HDL, for high density lipoprotein)
cholesterol and may help prevent blood clotting. But we do know the
effects: On average, if you're over about 40, a drink a day will
reduce your chances of heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the association between smoking and lung cancer, I
think this is the most consistent association I've seen in the
literature,'' says Eric Rimm, a Harvard epidemiologist. Research
has shown heart benefits consistently since the 1970s with, Rimm
guesses, 70 or 80 studies of 30 to 35 countries by now. Not
surprisingly, he has a drink on most days.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol also causes harm, of course. It can increase chances of
breast cancer, cirrhosis, accidents, and so on. Heart disease,
however, is an enormous cause of death; improve those odds, and the
net effect is significantly to the good. Last December, the New
England Journal of Medicine reported the results of the biggest and
probably best mortality study yet conducted, one that followed
almost half a million people over nine years. It found that, after
netting out all causes of death, moderate drinkers over 30 were 20
percent less likely than nondrinkers to die prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot of people like my father out there:
uninformed or vaguely informed or not thinking about it. In 1995, a
free market advocacy group called the Competitive Enterprise
Institute commissioned a survey asking people whether they believed
``that scientific evidence exists showing that moderate consumption
of alcohol, approximately one or two drinks per day, may reduce the
risk of heart disease for many people.'' Only 42 percent of those
who responded said they did, and a majority of those believed,
wrongly, that the potential benefits come only from wine.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence on alcohol and health is now more than 20 years
old--so why the confusion? Two groups have a stake in getting the
word out, but one of them, the alcohol industry, is effectively
forbidden to do so. Every bottle of alcohol carries a government
warning label, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has
never permitted ads or labels to carry any health claims, even mild
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the government restricts health claims even for
innocuous foods such as orange juice and eggs, it's reasonable to
decide that booze merchants are the wrong people to entrust with
public education about drinking. That leaves only one other
constituency for getting the word out: the public health community.
Its approach, however, might charitably be called cautious--or,
less charitably, embarrassed mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the authors of the aforementioned New England
Journal study characterized their finding of a 20 percent mortality
reduction as ``slight.'' The accompanying editorial called it
``small.''
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Michael J. Thun, one of the study's authors and an
epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society, and asked him
whether a 20 percent mortality reduction is indeed small in the
world of epidemiology. ``It's a sizable benefit in terms of
prolonged survival,'' he said. Why not say so? ``Messages about
alcohol don't come out the way you say them when they're
broadcast,'' he replied. ``There's been a very long history in
society of problems with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The British health authorities, in their 1995 guidelines
(``Sensible Drinking''), say that people who drink very little or
not at all and are in an age group at high risk for heart disease
should ``consider the possibility that light drinking might benefit
their health.'' But American authorities balk even at such a modest
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   And so the U.S. official nutritional guidelines say just this
about potential benefits: ``Current evidence suggests that moderate
drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease
in some individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   They then go on to recite a litany of risks. Similarly, the
American Heart Association's official recommendation advises, ``If
you drink, do so in moderation.'' It goes on to say heart disease
is lower in moderate drinkers but then warns of other dangers and
cautions against ``guidelines to the general public'' that
encourage drinking. See for yourself, but I think the message most
people would get from both sources is ``Drinking isn't all bad, but
eschew it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ronald Krauss--a doctor who, as the immediate past
chairman of the American Heart Association's nutrition committee,
helped write that statement--whether it was aggressive enough. ``We
don't have much leeway around that 'one or two drinks a day,''' he
said, and what isn't known is whether encouraging moderate drinking
will also encourage excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The public health people understandably dread creating more
drunks, more broken marriages, more crime, more car wrecks. ``When
somebody calls you up saying, 'You're putting out a message to
people to drink, and my daughter just got killed last night because
of some drunk,' that's the other side of the equation,'' Thun says.
``There are substantial numbers of people out there who are looking
for justification to drink more than they should.''
</P>
<P>
   A real worry. But there are lives, again, on both sides of the
equation. The question, then, is what would happen if the public
health folks ran a campaign saying, for example, ``Just One Drink''
or ``Drink a Little--Not a Lot.'' Would people's drinking habits
improve, or would we create a nation of drunks--or what? The answer
is: Nobody knows. What is surprising, given the public health
community's usual eagerness to save lives, is that no one is trying
to find out. It is simply assumed that too many people will do the
wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a very hard time with complicated messages,'' says
Thun. No doubt some people do. But is it really so hard to
understand that a glass a day may help save your life if you're of
middle age or beyond, but that more than that is dangerous?
Presumably an avoidable heart attack is equally tragic whether the
cause is too much alcohol or too little. To continue today's policy
of muttering and changing the subject verges perilously on saying
not just that too much alcohol is bad for you but that ignorance is
good for you.

BABY-SITTING THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago I read a story that changed my life. I think
about that story often; it helps me to stay calm in the face of
crisis, to remain hopeful in times of depression, and to resist the
pull of fatalism and pessimism. At this gloomy moment, when Asia's
woes seem to threaten the world economy as a whole, the lessons of
that inspirational tale are more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in an article titled ``Monetary Theory and the
Great Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op Crisis.'' Joan and Richard
Sweeney published it in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking
in 1978. I've used their story in two of my books, Peddling
Prosperity and The Accidental Theorist, but it bears retelling,
this time with an Asian twist.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweeneys tell the story of--you guessed it--a baby-sitting
co-op, one to which they belonged in the early 1970s. Such co-ops
are quite common: A group of people (in this case about 150 young
couples with congressional connections) agrees to baby-sit for one
another, obviating the need for cash payments to adolescents. It's
a mutually beneficial arrangement: A couple that already has
children around may find that watching another couple's kids for an
evening is not that much of an additional burden, certainly
compared with the benefit of receiving the same service some other
evening. But there must be a system for making sure each couple
does its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill co-op adopted one fairly natural solution. It
issued scrip--pieces of paper equivalent to one hour of
baby-sitting time. Baby sitters would receive the appropriate
number of coupons directly from the baby sittees. This made the
system self-enforcing: Over time, each couple would automatically
do as much baby-sitting as it received in return. As long as the
people were reliable--and these young professionals certainly
were--what could go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it turned out that there was a small technical problem.
Think about the coupon holdings of a typical couple. During periods
when it had few occasions to go out, a couple would probably try to
build up a reserve--then run that reserve down when the occasions
arose. There would be an averaging out of these demands. One couple
would be going out when another was staying at home. But since many
couples would be holding reserves of coupons at any given time, the
co-op needed to have a fairly large amount of scrip in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now what happened in the Sweeneys' co-op was that, for
complicated reasons involving the collection and use of dues (paid
in scrip), the number of coupons in circulation became quite low.
As a result, most couples were anxious to add to their reserves by
baby-sitting, reluctant to run them down by going out. But one
couple's decision to go out was another's chance to baby-sit; so it
became difficult to earn coupons. Knowing this, couples became even
more reluctant to use their reserves except on special occasions,
reducing baby-sitting opportunities still further.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the co-op had fallen into a recession. Since most of
the co-op's members were lawyers, it was difficult to convince them
the problem was monetary. They tried to legislate recovery--passing
a rule requiring each couple to go out at least twice a month. But
eventually the economists prevailed. More coupons were issued,
couples became more willing to go out, opportunities to baby-sit
multiplied, and everyone was happy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, of course, the co-op issued too much scrip, leading
to different problems.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this is a silly story, a waste of your time, shame
on you. What the Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op experienced was a
real recession. Its story tells you more about what economic slumps
are and why they happen than you will get from reading 500 pages of
William Greider and a year's worth of Wall Street Journal
editorials.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are willing to really wrap your mind around the
co-op's story, to play with it and draw out its implications, it
will change the way you think about the world.

 (NO DATELINE: about the world.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   For example, suppose that the U.S. stock market was to crash,
threatening to undermine consumer confidence. Would this inevitably
mean a disastrous recession? Think of it this way: When consumer
confidence declines, it is as if, for some reason, the typical
member of the co-op had become less willing to go out, more anxious
to accumulate coupons for a rainy day. This could indeed lead to a
slump--but need not if the management were alert and responded by
simply issuing more coupons. That is exactly what our head
coupon-issuer Alan Greenspan did in 1987--and what I believe he
would do again. So as I said at the beginning, the story of the
baby-sitting co-op helps me to remain calm in the face of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose Greenspan did not respond quickly enough and that the
economy did indeed fall into a slump. Don't panic. Even if the
head-coupon issuer has fallen temporarily behind the curve, he can
still ordinarily turn the situation around by issuing more
coupons--that is, with a vigorous monetary expansion like the ones
that ended the recessions of 1981-82 and 1990-91. So as I said, the
story of the baby-sitting co-op helps me remain hopeful in times of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the story of the co-op tells you that economic slumps
are not punishments for our sins, pains that we are fated to
suffer. The Capitol Hill co-op did not get into trouble because its
members were bad, inefficient baby sitters; its troubles did not
reveal the fundamental flaws of ``Capitol Hill values'' or ``crony
baby-sittingism.'' It had a technical problem--too many people
chasing too little scrip--which could be, and was, solved with a
little clear thinking. And so, as I said, the co-op's story helps
me to resist the pull of fatalism and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's all so easy, how can a large part of the world be in
the mess it's in? How, for example, can Japan be stuck in a
seemingly intractable slump--one that it does not seem able to get
out of simply by printing coupons?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if we extend the co-op's story a little bit, it is not
hard to generate something that looks a lot like Japan's
problems--and to see the outline of a solution.
</P>
<P>
   First, we have to imagine a co-op the members of which realized
there was an unnecessary inconvenience in their system. There would
be occasions when a couple found itself needing to go out several
times in a row, which would cause it to run out of coupons--and
therefore be unable to get its babies sat--even though it was
entirely willing to do lots of compensatory baby-sitting at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve this problem, the co-op allowed members to borrow
extra coupons from the management in times of need--repaying with
the coupons received from subsequent baby-sitting. To prevent
members from abusing this privilege, however, the management would
probably need to impose some penalty--requiring borrowers to repay
more coupons than they borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Under this new system, couples would hold smaller reserves of
coupons than before, knowing they could borrow more if necessary.
The co-op's officers would, however, have acquired a new tool of
management. If members of the co-op reported it was easy to find
baby sitters and hard to find opportunities to baby-sit, the terms
under which members could borrow coupons could be made more
favorable, encouraging more people to go out. If baby sitters were
scarce, those terms could be worsened, encouraging people to go out
less.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this more sophisticated co-op would have a
central bank that could stimulate a depressed economy by reducing
the interest rate and cool off an overheated one by raising it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Japan--where the economy slumps despite interest
rates having fallen almost to zero? Has the baby-sitting metaphor
finally found a situation it cannot handle?
</P>
<P>
   Well, imagine there is a seasonality in the demand and supply
for baby-sitting. During the winter, when it's cold and dark,
couples don't want to go out much but are quite willing to stay
home and look after other people's children--thereby accumulating
points they can use on balmy summer evenings. If this seasonality
isn't too pronounced, the co-op could still keep the supply and
demand for baby-sitting in balance by charging low interest rates
in the winter months, higher rates in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that the seasonality is very strong indeed. Then in
the winter, even at a zero interest rate, there will be more
couples seeking opportunities to baby-sit than there are couples
going out, which will mean that baby-sitting opportunities will be
hard to find, which means that couples seeking to build up reserves
for summer fun will be even less willing to use those points in the
winter, meaning even fewer opportunities to baby-sit ... and the
co-op will slide into a recession even at a zero interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the winter of Japan's discontent. Perhaps because of
its aging population, perhaps also because of a general nervousness
about the future, the Japanese public does not appear willing to
spend enough to use the economy's capacity, even at a zero interest
rate. Japan, say the economists, has fallen into the dread
``liquidity trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what you have just read is an infantile explanation of
what a liquidity trap is and how it can happen. And once you
understand that this is what has gone wrong, the answer to Japan's
problems is, of course, quite obvious.
</P>
<P>
   So the story of the baby-sitting co-op is not a mere amusement.
If people would only take it seriously--if they could only
understand that when great economic issues are at stake, whimsical
parables are not a waste of time but the key to enlightenment--it
is a story that could save the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Antonioli says he wasn't just happy when, in the early
1970s, he was asked to become a guinea pig in the Framingham Heart
Study. He was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, like, an honor to be asked,'' says the boyish high
school math teacher. He's sitting in the living room of the home he
shares with his ``significant other,'' Leah Heffron, in Framingham,
Mass., a town of 65,000 southwest of Boston. ``My parents were two
of the original participants in the study and I hope someday that
my three sons will be able to participate, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonioli's wish that his kids be poked and prodded, X-rayed and
ultrasounded once every four years says a lot about the
groundbreaking health study.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Heart Study, a part of the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute, is the longest ongoing epidemiological study
in medical history, and perhaps the single most important. It's
certainly the most famous. Indeed, there's a good chance that even
someone who doesn't know his, er, aorta from his elbow may have
heard of it. Framingham, for example, was among the first studies
to confirm that high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking
all cause heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because this granddaddy of all epidemiological trials is
celebrating its 50th anniversary in September, we decided to visit
Framingham to see if the study that has taught us so much about
hardening of the arteries, hasn't, after half a century, developed
a bit of atherosclerosis itself.
</P>
<P>
   Antonioli was especially excited on the day we met. That's
because he was scheduled to undergo his quadrennial medical exam in
the Framingham clinic the following day. You see, Antonioli
recently turned 50. It was a sobering milestone for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was only 53 when he had his first stroke,'' Antonioli
explains. ``So I said to myself, 'Hey, I'd better do something.''
And so, for the first time in his life, he's eschewing hamburgers
and Twinkies for turkey sandwiches and apples. ``I'm almost to the
point where broccoli isn't so bad,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Framingham has prompted such drastic
lifestyle changes. Prior to the study, many medical experts
believed that atherosclerosis was simply an inevitable side effect
of aging. ``The concept that you could modify your behavior to
avoid or even reverse this hardening certainly wasn't widely
accepted, and in some quarters was actually disparaged,'' says Dr.
William Kannel, former director of the study and professor of
medicine and public health at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Framingham dispelled these and other myths. And while it's still
called the Framingham Heart Study, investigators today also study
the causes of such illnesses as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis,
arthritis, eye disorders, kidney disease, even hearing defects.
</P>
<P>
   The study developed out of the fact that, following World War
II, cardiovascular disease was the nation's No. 1 killer,
accounting for half of all deaths. While small studies and
anecdotal evidence had suggested that some people _ cigarette
smokers, for example _ were more prone to developing the disease,
the U.S. Public Health Service decided to launch a large-scale
study to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   The initial participants (or ``cohort'') included 5,209 healthy
residents between 30 and 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure compliance, both husbands and wives were
enrolled. ``We figured the wives would nag their husbands to come
in to be tested,'' laughs Kannel, who joined the study in 1949.
That bit of New England pragmatism made Framingham one of the first
studies to include data on both men and women, and led to the
discovery that women tend to lag about 20 years behind men in
developing heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1971, the study enrolled Antonioli and 5,123 other
children of the original cohort (and their spouses) in a second
study. This ``offspring study'' gives Framingham two generations of
data _ an almost unprecedented achievement.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, a half dozen or so of the cohort and offspring
are in the study's first-floor clinic, wearing hospital gowns and
shuttling from room to room filling out questionnaires and
undergoing medical tests. Offspring visits last about four hours,
twice as long as the original exams. Many of the original cohort
are too frail for the tests introduced in recent years, such as a
lung-function test that requires blowing hard into a thin tube for
10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the investigators go to great lengths to accommodate
their elderly charges. ``If they can't make it in, we'll go to
their homes, or to those living in nursing homes,'' says clinic
director Dr. Joanne Murabito.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these and other outreach efforts, about 85 percent
make it in for their regular appointments. And those who miss one
are likely to show up the next time around. Most drug-company
studies figure on the same dropout rate after only two years.
</P>
<P>
   For both cohort and offspring, the benefits of participation are
obvious. Although they're not paid, every two to four years they
receive a medical checkup that consists of a complete blood workup,
bone scan, eye exam and other high-tech tests. It's all free and,
as part of the study's contract with the town, results are
forwarded to the participants' family doctors with their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been on the cutting edge,'' says Edward F.
Clinton, 46, an architect and, along with eight other siblings (two
of whom have since died in accidents), is a member of the offspring
study. ``The first time I ever heard the term 'ultrasound' was at
Framingham.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps the study's most curious finding is the lack of
effect that being in the study has had on the health of the
individual participants _if you look at statistics, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than two-thirds of the original cohort, who
spent much of their lives as research subjects in a trial looking
at the causes of cardiovascular disease, have since died. The most
common cause of death? Cardiovascular disease, still the No. 1
cause of death overall in the entire U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And while the second generation of participants, like their
peers, have lower cholesterol rates, lower blood pressure and are
less likely to smoke, they're also fatter, on average, than their
parents _ just like their peers. In other words, having the study
here hasn't made Framingham a hotbed of healthy living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unrealistic to expect people to swim upstream
against their culture,'' Kannel says. ``Not only are people eating
more, we've also engineered physical activity out of our daily
lives. Today, people have to join a health club to get the kind of
exercise their grandparents used to get working on farms or doing
some other form of manual labor.''
</P>
<P>
   So is there another 50 years in Framingham's future? Study
director Dr. Daniel Levy, doesn't look quite that far down the
road. He does, however, have a 30-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent our first 50 years looking at environmental factors
such as diet and smoking and their effects on disease,'' he says.
``Now we're using molecular genetics to explore how genes are
responsible for high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol,
Alzheimer's, and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy is also spearheading the Omni Study, in which 500 members
of Framingham's minority communities have been enrolled. It is
designed to see if established risk factors affect minorities
differently than the original cohort and offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But the most far-reaching of Levy's plans is recruitment of a
third generation of participants _ the grandchildren of the
original cohort. This study _ the one Antonioli hopes his three
sons will be asked to join _ would put Framingham in the unique
position among studies of having three generations of data to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As for Joe Antonioli, we phoned him after his checkup. His
numbers weren't perfect, but things are headed in the right
direction. And a scan of his neck revealed a suspicious speck,
perhaps the first sign of some narrowing of the carotid artery.
While troubling, it was spotted early so his doctor can keep a
close eye on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm on the right track,'' Antonioli says. ``Today was
the last day of school. Last year I'd have celebrated with a big
steak, or maybe some hamburgers. This year, we're having chicken
stir-fry.''
</P>

<P>
   Here are snapshots of some other important, large-scale clinical
trials:
</P>
<P>
   Nurses' Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1976
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 121,700 female registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Examine the link in women between hormones, diet,
exercise, and other life-style factors and a wide range of chronic
illnesses, including breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Postmenopausal hormone replacement
appears to decrease the risk of heart disease and all-cause
mortality, but may increase breast-cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Physicians' Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 22,071 male physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Study the effects of low-dose aspirin on heart attack
and of beta carotene supplements on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Low-dose aspirin reduces risk of heart
attack; beta carotene supplements neither reduce nor increase risks
of cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 5,888 men and women 65 years of age and older.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Investigate the similarities and differences in risk
factors for cardiovascular disease between older individuals and

   Ask someone for a frank assessment of his fitness and you're
likely to hear something like: ``I may not look like I did in high
school but I'm certainly not as fat as Joe Dorf down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you're diligent about exercise, working out
regularly with great gusto, you may not be as fit as you think.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I sat in the office of Dr. Larry Golding while he
explained science's concept of fitness. An exercise physiologist,
the 72-year-old Golding is one of the most respected names in the
fitness field, holder of just about every honorarium imaginable,
including a distinguished professorship at the University of Nevada
Las Vegas where he teaches and does research.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that there are really three different
kinds of fitness _ flexibility, aerobic conditioning and
strength,'' said Golding. ``A lot of people lift weights and they
say, `Well I'm fit'. They're not fit. They're very fit in a limited
way. So you play tennis? Well that's better than not doing
anything. But there are studies that show that sports don't give
you much fitness and sometimes no fitness at all. Which is why
there isn't a serious athlete in the world that plays his sport to
get fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding paused for his conclusion: ``There are plenty of people
out there who think they are pretty fit. But I do think there is
some delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Voy was more blunt. Voy now has a family and sports
medicine practice just down the road from Golding's office. But for
years he has been involved with some the world's greatest athletes,
including a stint as chief medical officer for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, which is how he came to oversee world class athletes in
40 sports.
</P>
<P>
   The white-smocked Voy folded his hands on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes in various sports think they're in great shape. It's
interesting to note that they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   How fit are you really? At first glance the question might seem
strictly an exercise in vanity. It's not. Certainly your health,
genes and good fortune factor into how long and how well you will
live; no amount of pushups will stave off certain cancers or an
onrushing Peterbilt. But fitness is critical to your daily well
being and longevity too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the surgeon general issued a report that, possibly
because of its complexity and size (275 pages), was largely ignored
by the public. But the report's conclusions _ based on proven
research by the country's most respected fitness minds _ were
understandable enough. Inactivity, concluded the report, kills
about 250,000 American each year.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're reading this, this statistic obviously doesn't
include you. And since you are still conscious, your brain is
already unrolling a worn carpet of thought. I'm alive and kicking.
Why, I may even be young. Fitness testing is for middle-aged lardos
like Joe Dorf.
</P>
<P>
   Golding, of course, has heard this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had a professor who would say in lectures that we start
to dodder at about 26,'' he said. ``People would sit up and say,
`I'm 30. You mean I'm middle-aged?' Well, yes. Physiologically you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should you test your fitness? Well it just might provide a
wake up call.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I came to Las Vegas. I had received a call from
someone at Fashn Inc. The company, she claimed, had developed a
fitness test that was clear and simple. It would be packaged as a
CD Rom. You popped the disk into your home computer, performed a
few fitness tests, then punched in the results of your tests. The
program mulled them over, and, presto, in a matter of seconds you
received your true fitness age. The CD Rom was dubbed FitnessAge,
and the company would soon be selling it to the public for $70.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I was skeptical. Fitness has its legitimate
practitioners, but it also is home to more quacks than a duck
flyway. But the idea of a simple, objective fitness measure was
appealing. Better still, Golding and Voy had lent their names and
their expertise to the product, nit picking the fitness details to
make sure the FAShN folks got it right. (Both consulted on the
CD-Rom, receiving only expenses).
</P>
<P>
   And so I sat in FAShN's tidy offices listening to Steve Brazell,
the company's creative and marketing director, explain what
FitnessAge would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program tells you simply how old you are,'' explained
Steve Brazell, Fashn's creative and marketing director. ``Your
chronological age doesn't matter. It's how old your body is.''
</P>
<P>
   The software behind these calculations was complex, said
Brazell. But what the user ended up with was brutally clear. You
might be 38 by the calendar, but your fitness age might allow you
to collect social security.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in front of a computer, Brazell marched me through a
sample, a 57-year-old man who had performed the 3-minute step test,
pushups, sit-ups and waist and hip measurements the program
required to calculate one's age. Along with the ability to crunch
these facts, FitnessAge also contained some other innovative aids,
among them a library that explained fitness terms, outlined the
risk factors of inactivity (``Not exercising is worse for your
health than smoking'') and offered exercise prescriptions to
implement a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Brazell clicked the mouse and the anonymous guinea pig's results
flashed up on the screen. At 57, he had the cardiovascular fitness
of a 79-year-old, the strength of a 49-year-old, the flexibility of
a 35-year-old and the body composition of a 56-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   We may have been looking at one of Golding's delusional souls;
someone who went to the gym three days a week to lift weights and
stretch, and so considered himself in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' said Brazell, eyeballing the gent's heart and lung
tally. ``This guy's in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   I might have made light of his failings, but I was up next.
Brazell punched in my particulars, height, weight, resting heart
rate and age. Then while Brazell and some coworkers watched, I
marched through the FitnessAge tests. The procedure took 30
minutes, and it might have taken less time, had the three of them
not had such a jolly good time mocking my weaknesses, specifically
my flexibility which fell somewhere between stone and tungsten.
This made sense since, though I workout regularly, I never stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished Brazell entered the numbers and clicked the
mouse. At 38, my fitness age was 26, which will be a source of some
pride as soon as I can bend over to tie my shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Having an objective measure of your fitness, said Golding, is
certainly important as both a stick and a carrot. It can let you
know how far you've fallen and, assuming that lights a fire under
you, follow-up fitness tests at regular intervals can provide
wonderful incentive by showcasing your tremendous improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But owning up to delusion is just a step, said Golding, and it's
certainly not the most important one.
</P>
<P>
   Golding smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the desire to begin with.''

WHICH PARENT-KID BATTLES ARE WORTH FIGHTING?

 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids don't come into the world with good judgment, good manners
or even good sense. A large part of your job as a parent is finding
ways to get your kids to want to do what they should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   You could easily spend every waking moment engaged in a battle
to get your child to do the right thing. That's why it's so
important to learn to pick your battles.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you decide when an issue is worth fighting over? Or
when you need to take hold of something or not?
</P>
<P>
   To preserve good times, try to organize the behavioral traffic
in your family before you act. Is your child's behavior (digging in
the garden) acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   In this green-light area, no battle is needed. Or is your
child's behavior (running into the street) unacceptable? Then
you're in a red-light area, and it's important.
</P>
<P>
   But most parent-child problems occur in the yellow-light area,
where you're not sure whether the behavior (such as jumping on the
bed) is worth fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   What battles are you most likely to encounter? What
developmental issues are revealed by them? And how can you manage
the fights you choose? Let's examine each age by age:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 1/2 to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers seem willing to engage endlessly in struggles over the
smallest things (``I don't want a broken pretzel; I want a whole
one''). But your toddler is not just contrary. She's trying to
develop an independent sense, and one way she does this testing her
strength against yours.
</P>
<P>
   You're still the boss, and she's at your mercy; by challenging
your authority she builds her own (``Mommy gave me a different
pretzel!'').
</P>
<P>
   Also, your child's recent mastery of mobility can lead her to do
things that may be out-of-bounds, like floating her rubber duckie
in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This means that your no is constantly being challenged by her
wish to go. Because judgment has not caught up with her desire, her
behavior can be unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to communicate red-light areas clearly. If you
take things as they come, you'll battle all day long. Instead, take
every opportunity to help your child internalize rules by
verbalizing them as you go along (``We always hold hands when we
cross the street.'')
</P>
<P>
   The most worthwhile battles involve safety and security
(``Two-year-olds can't cut their apples with knives.'')
</P>
<P>
   Try to sidestep other issues, particularly on food or clothing.
These can provoke a toddler because they're ones in which you still
exercise much control.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick battles, you want to be able to resolve them, and
a stubborn toddler can defeat all your efforts (force-feeding is a
setup for disaster).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that your toddler's mischief is often motivated
by curiosity. You may feel she is impossible when you find your
pantyhose on the floor, but to her, it's just exploring.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3 to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your pre-schooler is gaining control over his own body. His
insistence on self-reliance can cause many battles, since a child
this age is often trying to push you away - yet still needs help
(``I can tie my shoes, Daddy'').
</P>
<P>
   As your pre-schooler goes into the world, he also becomes more
aware of vulnerability. This realization causes his behavior to
alternate between clinging and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Battles at this age are most likely to be over bedtime
(pre-schoolers hate exclusion from grownup activities) and bodily
care (when he was younger, his body was under your control; now
he's struggling to bring it under his).
</P>
<P>
   Because children this age alternate between progressive and
regressive, one moment your child may want to sleep outside in a
tent, and the next may want you to wipe his tushy!
</P>
<P>
   To help your child integrate his wishes with his growing skills,
be sure to praise his accomplishments and try to avoid battles that
deflate his pride (criticizing the mess he made in the kitchen
instead of the good job he did mixing cookie dough).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6 to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By this age, your child has a firm sense of an independent self
and has learned many skills that will help her take care of
herself. Now she must leave the purely ``play days'' of early
childhood and move into the world.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is reflected in battles over homework, TV, and
chores, all characteristic of grade-schoolers. Since these are
years when your child will be learning habits for a lifetime,
battles are worthwhile, but you'll need to find a way to help your
child cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to encourage your grade-schooler to create a
study and chore routine (working at her desk with a comfortable
chair before dinner, then set the table).
</P>
<P>
   Children this age may still need you to remind them that it's
time for homework, but this doesn't mean yelling about
irresponsibility (``I can't believe it's 8 o'clock and you haven't
even begun to study your spelling words!'').
</P>
<P>
   By age 9 or 10, if she forgets to study for a test she'll need
to suffer the consequences and learn from them. Engaging in battles
with a school-age child or rescuing her at the last minute
interferes with her ability to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, try to avoid battles about friends, interests, or TV
choices (unless unsuitable). Kids this age are beginning to define
their own tastes, and your criticism can interfere with their
burgeoning self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10 to 12 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your pre-teen may seem to be revisiting his toddler years,
provoking the same kind of encounters that you remember from when
he was 2! But pre-teens bring a new level of risk and danger to the
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   When a 2-year-old refuses to eat, his favorite strawberries can
tempt him, but when an 11-year-old does so, a possible eating
disorder looms.
</P>
<P>
   When a 3-year-old ``runs away'' after an argument, he may hide
under the bed, but with a 12-year-old, he could be out all night.
This means that, more than ever, it's important to pick battles
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are apt to be about your pre-teen's wish for more
freedom (``Why can't I ride my bike to Joe's house?''). You need to
engage in these battles because they offer a chance to emphasize
that with freedom comes responsibility (``It's five miles away. If
I let you ride alone, you'll have to call me when you get there'').
</P>
<P>
   While reasoned discussion is always better than arguing, when
reason doesn't work you'll need to stand firm. Pre-teens may ask
for a lot of liberties, but they still need restraints. Even if
they protest, limits help them feel cared for. Blaming you for
curfews lets them remain ``cool'' with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid picking battles over his friends (criticism increases his
loyalty), clothing, or music he listens to. Save energy for things
that really matter, like smoking and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   By picking battles carefully and matching them to your child's
developmental needs, you'll be able to keep your connection to him
as he grows.

   The sound
</P>
<P>
   of 200 poets,
</P>
<P>
   slamming
</P>
<P>
   By John Kelso
</P>

</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I was disappointed at the opening ceremonies of
the ninth annual National Poetry Slam Wednesday afternoon at the
Electric Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 poets are in town for this four-day event. And not
one of these clowns recited my favorite poem.
</P>
<P>
   The work tells the amazing story of Bill Blass, a part of whose
anatomy is made out of brass, which, when clanged together, plays
Stormy Weather, accompanied by a spectacular meteorological
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think at least one of the wordsmiths gathered in Austin
for this poetry competition would have read this petunia. Although
I'll admit some of their literary efforts were playing in the same
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The slam's opening gathering featured teams of poets from such
places as Los Angeles, Detroit and Boston performing one-minute
bits that were part poetry, part senior class skit.
</P>
<P>
   I was impressed by the group from Albuquerque, who did a sendup
of that obnoxiously chirpy reggae song, ``Don't Worry. Be Happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dig these lyrics, sung on stage by a guy in dreadlocks:
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone gives you too much sass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick up a bat and beat their a--.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry. Be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   These poetry slams involve teams of poets competing in the
shouted word, I mean spoken word. Previously, I had avoided these
affairs, fearing they'd be stuffy. Hah. This four-day event figures
to be like a Shriners' convention with 50-cent words.
</P>
<P>
   A long-haired, bombastic-voiced, blocky guy named Wammo got on
stage and gave the ``invocation.'' This began with Wammo, of
Austin, telling the visiting poets when the bars close _ critical
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we get started, last call in bars is at 2, the stores
stop selling beer at midnight, you can only buy liquor in liquor
stores, and liquor stores stop selling at 9,'' Wammo announced to
the poets. Then Wammo explained he was giving out this information
because he didn't want his fellow poets running out of whiskey and
bumming his.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the poets staying while they are here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea, but I'm sure there's a back yard filled
with somebody's tents,'' joked Tony Gallucci, a school teacher/poet
from Kerrville. Then again, maybe some of them are at the Daze Inn.
Seriously, these poets have taken over a motel _ ON SOUTH CONGRESS.
</P>
<P>
   Swell. That's all we need. A bunch of hooker haikus.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Electric Lounge, it looked like visiting day at the
county jail. There was the Rev. Bart, of the Church of the Divine
Annihilation in Houston, with APOCALYPSE tattooed festively across
his back. His introductory poem was: ``Napalm: Because immolation
is the sincerest form of flattery.'' Don't lend this guy your Bic.
</P>
<P>
   On a lighter note, Albuquerque poet Matthew John Conley carried
a plush toy pink bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our team mascot,'' explained Conley, dressed in garage
sale-quality Bermuda shorts. ``His name is Bunny Kravitz. He's a
gin-drinking, womanizing, bar-fighting, button-pushing, bad a-- who
keeps us in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   So it should be a fun week. Just check your back yard
occasionally for bedrolls.

 &HT;    Austin seeks developer to take plunge
 &HT;    on building mate to convention center
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now that the City of Austin is planning to
double the size of its convention center, officials want to make
sure there will be enough hotel rooms to accommodate the added
conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the City of Austin is launching an extensive _ and
typically difficult _ search for a developer to build a convention
center hotel and parking garage. By adding more hotel rooms and
parking, the city hopes to bring in larger conventions and
stimulate economic activity in the area around the center.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday, August 22, the city will run ads in The Wall
Street Journal, the Austin American-Statesman and on the Urban Land
Institute's Internet site seeking developers to build and operate
an 800-room convention center hotel and 1,000-car parking garage
near the convention center, at Cesar Chavez and Red River streets.
Developers have until Oct. 6 to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing business because we're not able to get a large
enough block of rooms to satisfy meeting planners,'' said Ric
Luber, executive director of the Austin Convention and Visitors
Bureau, which oversees the convention center. ``We're going to need
to get larger pieces of business to fill up the expanded convention
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the experiences of other cities, it will take more than
just a good advertisement or two to lure a convention hotel builder
to Austin. Cities such as Houston, Denver and Tampa, Fla., have
spent years trying to attract downtown convention center hotels and
often have had to offer myriad incentives to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Austin city officials nonetheless hope to get a convention hotel
built and open by the time the convention center expansion is
completed in 2001. Convention center hotels _ usually 600 rooms or
more _ generally can accommodate larger, multiple-convention
groups. They typically have restaurants, meeting space and
ballrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Convention centers that have been built in conjunction with a
hotel have done well, while those that haven't have languished,
said John Keeling, senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a hotel
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of large blocks of rooms is the most important
thing for a meeting planner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the city has lost out on 240,000 room nights because of
the lack of a convention center hotel or because the convention
center wasn't large enough, Luber said. Of conventions that
bypassed Austin since the center opened in 1992, 17 percent said a
lack of hotel rooms or the absence of a convention-size hotel
influenced their decision, according to a 1997 analysis done for
the city by C.H. Johnson Consulting of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most important factor in their decision _ more
important than the quality of the convention center itself,''
Keeling said.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio didn't have a competitive convention market until a
1,000-room Marriott hotel opened near convention sites there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size matters,'' Keeling said. ``A lot of smaller hotels are
not the same thing as one big one.''
</P>
<P>
   But convention center hotels are expensive and risky ventures,
and most cities have had to offer generous incentives to attract
them, Keeling said. For many hotel chains, it's better to build a
dozen small hotels around the country than one large hotel, which
can cost upward of $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make it worth their while,'' Keeling said. ``A
city has to remove some of the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeling said the developers of almost every convention center
hotel built _ except those in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, N.J., and
Orlando, Fla. _ have received some kind of economic incentive from
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Luber said the city is willing to look at possible incentives,
including fee waivers. But at this stage, it wants to find out what
hotel companies are interested and what they're willing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's largest hotel is the 478-room Renaissance Austin Hotel
in Northwest Austin. The Hyatt Regency Austin, which has 448 rooms,
is the largest hotel in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   The Radisson Hotel &AMP; Suites on Cesar Chavez is in the midst of
an expansion that will give it 413 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sites being discussed for a hotel include land to the east, west
and south of the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   City officials aren't the only ones trying to lure a convention
center hotel developer to town. One group of downtown property
owners has spent the past two years trying to interest hotel
developers in land they control on three corners of Cesar Chavez
and Red River streets _ land they believe would be ideal for a
large hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have land, and we are sitting there with our arms open,
waiting for somebody to embrace us,'' said Austin real estate
broker Robert Knight, one of the property owners.

   Austin's office boom could be peaking
</P>
<P>
   By R. Michelle Breyer
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In July 1993, the Prominent Pointe office building in
Northwest Austin sold for $10 million _ close to $67 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the 150,000-square-foot building changed hands
again, this time for $15 million, or $100 a foot. Last month, it
sold one more time, for $22 million, or a dizzying $150 a square
foot.
</P>
<P>
   While Prominent Pointe clearly carried a prominent pricetag, it
wasn't a record.
</P>
<P>
   That was set last December, when the Bridgepoint Square office
building sold for $78 million, or $177 per square foot _ a level
far surpassing any other real estate sale in the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for that record to last, say some real estate
brokers. Other office buildings on the market, including the
245,000-square-foot Arboretum Plaza, may sell for more than $180 a
foot, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the record price increases at the area's trophy office
buildings have been the city's strong economy, low interest rates
and an increasingly tight office market. Citywide, office occupancy
rates are about 95 percent, and rents have risen more than 50
percent over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   But are the sky-high skyscraper sales an indication that prices
may be reaching their peak?
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers _ pointing to factors such as new office
construction, fewer buyers and less investment money _ say maybe
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we're not at the top of the cycle, we're very close
to the top,'' said Jeff Pace, vice president and market officer of
CarrAmerica Realty, a Washington, D.C.-based real estate investment
trust, or REIT, that owns land and office buildings in the Austin
area.
</P>
<P>
   The high sales prices alone may be turning away some potential
investors who once viewed the Austin area as one of the nation's
best values.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's general concern about a number of markets,'' said Ron
Witten, president of M/PF Research Inc., a Dallas-based real estate
research firm. ``And Atlanta, Dallas and Austin are among the most
frequently mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with high prices, worrying some real estate companies is
the fact that more than a million square feet of office space is
under construction in Austin. More space typically means lower
occupancy rates and lower prices, according to basic economics.
</P>
<P>
   Less demand may also be on the horizon. REITs, which have poured
money into hot markets such as Austin and driven up prices, have
been battered by the stock market this year with rent and occupancy
growth slowing in most parts of the real estate market. This will
make it more difficult for them to raise cash to acquire new
properties. REITs invest in all types of real estate, including
shopping malls, office buildings, even prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there are fewer buyers out there,'' said Phil
Capron, president of Austin-based Synermark Commercial Real Estate.
``There are undoubtedly buyers who have gone to markets other than
Austin where they think they can get a better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   What buyers there are may be more selective, looking only at the
area's nicest buildings with the best locations, highest rents and
lowest vacancy rates. For many, the cost of building a
top-of-the-line property from scratch _ roughly $135 to $160 a
square foot _ may be preferable to buying an existing building.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the number of buyers in the market has declined,
don't expect a bust that will send prices down to levels last seen
in the real estate doldrums of a decade ago .
</P>
<P>
   That's because unlike the 1980s, when capital was available to
anyone who wanted it and many investors bought Austin properties
with the intention of gaining a tax write-off or selling them
quickly for a profit, more of today's investors are in the market
for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately a building is worth the cash flow it can
generate,'' Witten said. ``There is a market segment that wants to
pay and can pay those higher rents.''
</P>
<P>
   Capron concurs: ``There's always some investor taking a longer
view and willing to pay a premium to stake out a position in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Austin's top properties _ those along Lake Austin or in
other prime locations _ investors are more than willing to pay the
higher prices, said Volney Campbell, vice president of the Austin
office of CB Richard Ellis Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask what's driving the price,'' Campbell said.
``Were people just getting giddy, or is demand and rent in place to
support those prices?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as demand stays tight, we can sustain these prices,
especially for unique properties,'' he said.

 &HT;    Take a 'culinary cruise' of the best restaurants on the
intracoastal road
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want tips on finding a great waterfront restaurant, ask a
boater.
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise behind the just published ``Intracoastal
Waterway Restaurant Guide &AMP; Recipe Book'' by Susan and Charles
Eanes (Espichel Enterprises, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book, the authors say, is ``a culinary cruise'' along ``the
liquid Route 66.'' The Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway stretches
from Mile Marker 0 in Virginia to its end at the Gulf of Mexico in
the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   While cruising the route, the authors dined at hundreds of
restaurants on and near the waterway, analyzing the food, service
and menu variety.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting guide includes descriptions of 110 restaurants in
five states, along with recipes and profiles of the chefs and
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties have
significant roles in Florida's listing _ a dozen are profiled, from
the new (Spoto's Oyster Bar, West Palm Beach) to the old (Conchy
Joe's in Jensen Beach).
</P>
<P>
   Many are boat-accessible, and all can be reached by car. Diners
looking to sample good seafood with a water view will do well with
the book, since fish is a natural bestseller at these restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced cooks, too, will find it useful for its recipes, which
often omit measurements. Many are complicated, but most can be done
by a home cook with experience.
</P>
<P>
   The book is available at bookstores, restaurants included in the
book, marinas and by calling (800) 330-9542.

 &HT;    Unveiling a $12 million 'crown jewel'
 &HT;    By Michael Utley

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ The architectural firm Zeidler, Roberts &AMP;
Associates recently unveiled its design for a $12 million cruise
terminal that is expected to become the signature building for the
Port of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story complex _ which, fittingly enough, resembles a
ship _ is a key element in the port's three-year, $65 million
expansion. The 90,000-square-foot terminal also is widely expected
to be the cornerstone of a revitalization effort along the Riviera
Beach waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the crown jewel of the Port of Palm
Beach,'' Port Commissioner Bob Williams said at a news conference
Thursday. Construction of the terminal is scheduled to begin in
January and end by January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lead architect Ebcq Zeidler described the building _ which
includes a passenger terminal, an office complex and a top-floor
restaurant _ as a combination of the contemporary and modern styles
of architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to create a building that responds to the emotional
needs of the tourist,'' said Zeidler, whose Toronto-based firm also
designed the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're waiting to take a cruise, you don't want to sit in
a wooden box,'' he said. ``You want to get the feeling that this is
a special event. . . . So what we've done here is combine the
emotional and the rational.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a new venue for cruise passengers, the
building will house port offices and employees of the U.S. Customs
Service, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The port's two cruise lines will
have offices there, as well as any new lines.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials are aggressively courting more cruise ships to
sail out of the Riviera Beach facility, once the new terminal is
built.
</P>
<P>
   They are seeking small and mid-size luxury ships, such as those
run by Renaissance Cruise Lines and Silver Seas Cruise Lines, both
of Fort Lauderdale, that offer multi-day cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The ships now operating from the port mainly offer so-called
cruises to nowhere and casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The large cruise ships that sail out of the Port of Miami and
Port Everglades in Broward County are not being courted because
they would not fit into the smaller slips and shallow water at the
Port of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera Beach facility now handles about 200,000 passengers
a year. Port officials are hoping to double that by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   When the cruise terminal was first proposed about two years ago,
it caused some concern among local hotel operators who feared that
more cruise ships _ especially overnight operators _ would take
away from their business.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with port officials during the past few months,
many have changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never viewed it as much of a threat,'' said David Burke,
vice president for sales and marketing at the The Breakers hotelcq
in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it will probably add business'' by attracting
more tourists to the area, Burke said. ``I think it's terrific.''

 &HT;    Checks show felons, dead purged from voter rolls
 &HT;    By Ian Trontz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Secretary of State Sandra Mortham's
report that 18,000 registered Florida voters are dead may be
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, her assertion that 50,000 felons are illegally
registered to vote may also be inaccurate, according to elections
supervisors in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   Early checks have revealed that many of the dead voters cited by
Mortham on Tuesday had already been removed from voter rolls during
normal periodic purges, the supervisors said. And, they said, some
of the felons may have had their voting rights restored by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Mortham's election division said they knew the
numbers would probably not be accurate because the legislature,
reacting to voting fraud in Miami, gave them less than two months
to prepare them. They also had never before compiled such a list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have blown the list way out of proportion,'' said
Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore. ``Madame
Secretary should not be making comments in press conferences
knowing that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   LePore, a Democrat, accused Mortham, a Republican, of trying to
protect her own re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can say that she's given the information to us two weeks
before the election, and if there's a problem, it's because we
didn't take care of it,'' LePore said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mortham's campaign manager said Mortham was just doing her
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature passed a bill that told her to do it,'' Gene
McGee said. ``It's going to be news whether the number is 10, 3 or
even 1 voter.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mortham, the death roll included 2,813 voters in
Palm Beach, 421 in Martin and 411 in St. Lucie counties. Felons
numbered 3,106 in Palm Beach, 316 in Martin and 781 in St. Lucie
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Only Martin County has finished checking its death list. All the
names had already been purged, or had never been registered, county
Elections Supervisor Peggy Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   On their voter registration forms, some of the purported felons
said they had never been convicted, she said. Others claimed that
they had their civil rights restored.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach and St. Lucie counties have checked less than half of
their names, but supervisors in both counties said their early
results echoed Martin County's.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their deadline, state elections officials said they
could not verify all the names, but will try to do so on future
lists.
</P>
<P>
   The only confirmed case of a dead person ``voting'' involved a
Miami man who died in 1993 and whose name appeared on an absentee
ballot last year.
</P>
<P>
   That and other allegations of ballot fraud led a judge to
nullify Miami's 1997 mayoral election, and led to a law requiring
Mortham's office to cleanse the voter rolls.
</P>
<P>
   County Elections offices in each county normally purge voter
rolls by comparing them with local court and health department
records.
</P>
<P>
   But those don't include people who are convicted or die in
another county.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect July 1, required Mortham's office to
compare county voter rolls with statewide court and health records
by Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Many Floridians share identical names and birth dates, so if one
died or was convicted, the others could fall under suspicion, said
Sandy Brill, of the state elections office.
</P>
<P>
   On average, he said, criminals were found to carry four aliases.
</P>
<P>
   The one identification that would set everyone apart _ a Social
Security number _ isn't required on voter registration
applications.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also didn't have time to check which felons had
their rights restored by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   County Election supervisors say they won't erase anyone before
confirming they've lost their life or liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We phoned one person who was listed as dead,'' Robbins said.
``He answered the phone. We laughingly told him. Luckily, he was in
his 50s. It didn't bother him at all.''

 &HT;    Honda sales climb in US, despite flagging home market
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honda Motor Co., Japan's third-largest automaker, continued its
record earnings pace by reporting that first-quarter group profits
rose 25.7 percent as strong U.S. sales made up for sinking car
sales in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The company said group net income hit a record high $548 million
for the three-month period ended June 30, compared with last year's
first-quarter record of $427 million. Sales rose 12.4 percent to
$11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, which employs 13,000 workers at four Ohio plants, relies
on the U.S. market more than any other Japanese automaker, analysts
said. The U.S. accounts for almost half of Honda's revenue and more
than two-thirds of worldwide operating income, compared to half for
Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest carmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Honda vehicle sales in North America climbed 8.3 percent to
265,000 units. In Japan, Honda sold only 185,000 autos, down 11.9
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been surprised at double digits (for the
increase in net profit) but this rise is very impressive,'' said
Jeremy Tonkin, an auto analyst at Towa Securities Co. Americans
flocked to Honda's CR-V, a small sport-utility vehicle, and the
Civic compact and Accord mid-sized sedans, long known for their
reliability and high resale value. Honda's sales in the U.S. grew
more than 12 percent in April and May compared with the same months
last year, while sales in June rose 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Accord has been among the best-selling car in the United
States, along with the Toyota Motor Corp.'s Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Ohio plants include a Marysville factory that makes the
Acura and
</P>
<P>
   Honda Accord; an East Liberty plant, which makes the Honda
Civic, an engine plant in Anna and a Marysville motorcycle factory.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's car market, the world's second largest, has been
crippled by the country's worst recession since World War II, with
industry-wide sales falling for 16 straight months and production
decreasing for nine months.

 &HT;    Stealing Ding Dongs can be considered a 'federal' case
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I went looking for my missing box of Ding Dongs when I came
across my
</P>
<P>
   youngest son, holding a foil wrapper in his hand and looking
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you steal my Ding Dongs?'' I asked, narrowing my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to answer. I pressed my question with the threat of a
swat on
</P>
<P>
   the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely, positively did not steal that box of pastry --
Ding Dongs,''
</P>
<P>
   he said, jabbing his finger in the air. It was a pretty strong
statement and
</P>
<P>
   despite the physical evidence, I believed him.
</P>
<P>
   He was indignant that I would have asked the question, however:
``Now, it's
</P>
<P>
   time for me to get on with taking out the trash, the job you
sent me outside
</P>
<P>
   to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not being one to give up easily on an investigation, I pressed
on. It
</P>
<P>
   wasn't long before I found my youngest daughter with chocolate
stains on her
</P>
<P>
   dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha!'' I said, ``So it was you who stole my Ding Dongs!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, `` she answered, ``I'm just saving this dress from the one
time you
</P>
<P>
   actually gave me a Ding Dong instead of eating them all
yourself. Since it
</P>
<P>
   will probably never happen again, I've decided that this dress
will not be
</P>
<P>
   washed.''
</P>
<P>
   She went away in the same huffy mood as my son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm going to need a complete makeover,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I next ran into my oldest daughter who was holding a cassette
tape in her
</P>
<P>
   hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is,'' she said. ``Twenty-three hours of your two
youngest children
</P>
<P>
   recorded doing nothing but eating Ding Dongs.''
</P>
<P>
   I plugged in the tape to hear the loud sound of chewing and
giggling. It
</P>
<P>
   was disgusting, but apparently it was all the evidence I needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you get this tape?'' I asked my oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' she said, ``I just made my sister think I was her
friend. What
</P>
<P>
   difference does that make?''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to apprehend the two criminals, I ran into my oldest
son and
</P>
<P>
   began questioning him. Just at that time, my youngest son
reappeared from
</P>
<P>
   taking out the trash and began talking in a highly agitated
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait! You can't talk to him! He's my personal advisor,'' he
complained. ``I
</P>
<P>
   told him secrets never expecting them to be revealed. It isn't
fair. I want
</P>
<P>
   this matter taken directly to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be my wife.
</P>
<P>
   Though she frowns on my two-a-day Ding Dong diet she did, as
expected, rule in my favor. Unfortunately, after all of that, my
oldest son said he knew
</P>
<P>
   nothing. This left me to the still-unresolved question of
whether he had
</P>
<P>
   been given any Ding Dong payola in exchange for his silence.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled my youngest daughter for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the tape,'' I said, ``and I know you were involved, but
I'm after the
</P>
<P>
   big fish. He's been suspected in Ding Dong theft before, you
know. If you
</P>
<P>
   'fess up now I'll give you complete immunity. Heck, I may even
let you have
</P>
<P>
   a Ding Dong or two in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me meet with my advisor,'' she said, walking over to her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes she was back, ready to tell the whole story. It
was a
</P>
<P>
   twisted plot to deprive me of my Ding Dongs.
</P>
<P>
   I called my son and he reluctantly came forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said, ``I admit I had an improper relationship with
your Ding
</P>
<P>
   Dongs. In the legal sense I was truthful, I did not steal your
Ding Dongs, I
</P>
<P>
   merely borrowed them. I regret that I have misled many people,
including
</P>
<P>
   even my Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   I was about to feel better about the whole situation -- at least
he was
</P>
<P>
   finally coming clean -- but he had to continue talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I furthermore believe that no punishment is called for in this
case,'' he
</P>
<P>
   said. ``Too many innocent people have been hurt by this. It is
time to move
</P>
<P>
   on. I have homework to do. It never would have happened, anyway,
if there
</P>
<P>
   hadn't been an unprecedented investigation as to the whereabouts
of missing
</P>
<P>
   Ding Dongs. I demand to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now where in the world would he get the idea to say something
like that?

 &HT;    Reyes delivers excellent start for Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH, Pa._ Jack McKeon thumbed through a statistical sheet
before a recent game in Three Rivers Stadium and his finger stopped
on the line with the numbers for pitcher Dennis Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Reyes have a good September to vault him into
next year, give him a little confidence boost going into spring
training next year,'' the Cincinnati Reds manager said.
</P>
<P>
   September?
</P>
<P>
   How about August?
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, the 21-year-old Reyes cranked up his fourth
straight excellent August start for the Reds. And although neither
he nor the Reds gained anything in the win column, his performance
does earn this one-word comment: ``Terrific.'' And he has two more
starts this month.
</P>
<P>
   (In only six innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Reyes
struck out a career-high 12 _ most for a Cincinnati rookie since
Gary Nolan struck out 15 in 1964 _ but the Reds fell, 6-5, in front
of 13,137.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendal doubled off Danny Graves to open
the ninth inning, boldly stole third and trotted home with the
winning run when Manny Martinez lined the game-ender to the
left-center wall.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes pitched five scoreless innings before a leadoff walk in
the sixth and four straight hits buried him under three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took Reyes off the hook in the seventh with three runs,
but the Pirates scored two in the bottom of the seventh when
shortstop Barry Larkin double-clutched a throw home, then threw to
first as the go-ahead run crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates added another run in the inning on an infield hit by
Freddy Garcia, the sixth infield hit of the night (out of 11 hits)
for the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati got run-scoring singles from Dmitri Young and Jeffrey
Hammonds in the top of the ninth to tie, 5-5, but pinch-hitter
Eduardo Perez grounded out with two teammates on base.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes has pitched well enough in his four starts to be 4-0 since
the Reds traded closer Jeff Shaw for him and Paul Konerko, but he
is only 2-0 with a 2.13 earned run average, giving up six runs and
16 hits in 25 innings, while striking out 31 and walking 17.
</P>
<P>
   Using an assortment of breaking pitches that floated in at 79,
83 and 85 miles an hour with a few 91 mph fastballs, Reyes struck
out the side in the fourth, thus tying his career high with nine
strikeouts just four innings into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds were doing no better during the first six innings
against Jon Lieber, who held them to a first-inning two-out double
by Barry Larkin and a two-out double by Sean Casey in the third.
Neither runner advanced beyond second.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh broke through in the sixth, with an error by Reyes
helping. Kevin Young walked and Jose Guillen beat an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Pirates had four hits and only one reached
the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Martinez took care of that after Reyes tried to pick Young
off second base and threw into the outfield, moving the runners to
second and third. Martinez drilled a two-run ground-rule double on
one hop over the right field wall, then scored on Garcia's
solid-shot single up the middle to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied it with three in the seventh on a rally started by
Eddie Taubensee's double and Bret Boone's single. Lieber injured
his left side (muscle strain) and left with a 3-and-1 count on
Chris Stynes. Mike Williams took over and induced a fielder's
choice grounder out of Stynes.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Nieves batted for Reyes against left-hander Ricardo
Rincon and doubled to the left field corner, scoring Stynes. Reggie
Sanders reached on third baseman Garcia's error, putting two on
with one out. After Sean Casey lined to left, Rincon walked Larkin
and Young on eight pitches to force in the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   But Hammonds left the bases loaded by grounding into a force
play and the Pirates took care of business in the bottom of the
ninth

 &HT;    The Rat Pack's back, baby
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He got more press than Elvis. Wore the coolest tailor-made
suits. Bedded beautiful dames. Hung with mobsters and helped elect
a president.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Frank Sinatra could carry a tune, too.
</P>
<P>
   HBO brings Ol' Blue Eyes and his booze-swigging, chain-smoking
cronies, Dean Martin (Joe Mantegna) and Sammy Davis Jr. (Don
Cheadle), back to life Saturday in ``The Rat Pack'' (9 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Ray Liotta (``Goodfellas,'' ``Unlawful Entry,'' ``Operation
Dumbo Drop'') stars as The Chairman of the Board. The intense actor
revealed what it was like playing a larger-than-life guy who slept
with Ava Gardner, sailed with John F. Kennedy and had a gold-plated
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Question: How much did Sinatra seep into your life? Did you go
to Vegas? Call women ``broads?'' Start drinking a lot?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: I'd play around at home with my wife and sometimes say
things. For a couple of months, there was complete total immersion
into his life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you say?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd say, ``Come here, you little broad!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did she like that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, she knows me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Rate the Rat Pack. Who was the coolest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Depends on what your perspective of cool is. In a sense, Dean
Martin was the coolest, in terms of his temperament and demeanor.
It was much more even-keel. Frank was much more emotional and ready
to go off at the drop of a hat. Some people think of being edgy and
wound tight as cool. But Dean Martin was the coolest. I think Sammy
tried really hard at the coolness, but he was almost a caricature
with his lingo, ``Hey, babe'' and the hipness he tried to
personify.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your favorite Rat Pack lingo?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calling Kennedy ``Chickie, baby.'' Saying this is
``Endsville'' when you're finished with something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, you turned down CBS' offer to play Sinatra.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wasn't sure I wanted to get involved in a miniseries. It
was a four-hour deal that spanned his life, and I just didn't feel
I was ready to take on Sinatra. When this came along, this script
was much more concise and tighter, and I turned down that. I
thought Sinatra was a lot to bite off, but when I sat down and
talked to the director (Rob Cohen) and saw how he wanted to do it,
I decided not to worry about how it was going to be received and
just go out there and act, have fun and let it rip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the role as intimidating as you thought it would be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I wasn't sure how they were going to do the music and
then if we were going to mimic Sinatra as he was singing. Then how
do you mimic him as a human being? Once I knew they were going to
use a sound-alike, it took the pressure off. He's a really hard guy
to get down. I mean, I'm from Jersey, I can understand the
edginess, but I didn't know that much about him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you a Sinatra fan?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. You hear the negative things. The Mafia ties. The
tussles with reporters, but his was a generation before mine. It
was more like my parents' generation, and you don't really want to
listen to your parents' music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Once you got into his skin, what surprised you the most?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably his troubles with women. At one point, they say he
faked his suicide with Ava Gardner. One time they said he took
pills. Whether it was true or not, here was somebody who seemingly
had everything and lost it and got it back again, but he never, as
many of us do, worked it out with his women.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you sing?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I first started out in theater, the first year and a
half, all I did was musicals. I can carry a tune. I used to play
guitar. But when it comes to Sinatra, that's a whole other
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you try to look like Sinatra?
</P>
<P>
   A: To a degree. We caught him at a period where he was in his
40s, so he wasn't as skinny as he once was. We did fix my hair to
make it look like I was wearing a toupee. I shaved my hairline way
back because he had a very high forehead. We got the clothes and
used the people who made his suits, things were much tighter and
form-fitting, so it gave you a certain kind of posture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the deal with the fake horse's head you received
from Tina Sinatra?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't know where she was coming from with it. There are a
lot of projects that are going to be coming out about his life, and
I'm sure she just wants to be a part of them. She saw and heard
that we were being extremely diligent about what happened, this
wasn't a sensational look.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Operation Dumbo Drop.'' What were you thinking?
</P>
<P>
   A: I just finished ``Unlawful Entry,'' and there was another
edgy part that I played, so a lot of people were only seeing me as
this tough guy, so I said, ``I need a Disney movie.'' And then I
heard about this `Dumbo Drop' and said, `There you go, I need a
movie about me and an elephant.'
</P>
<P>
   When I first started acting, I did musicals, Shakespeare,
Tennessee Williams, you do a little bit of every-thing . . . that's
the same reason why I did ``No Escape.'' Whether they were the best
career moves, probably not. But why not do that? How many gangsters
can you play? How many rough, edgy guys can you play?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boo-boo I made was probably ``Turbulence.'' That was
a too-edgy guy. But I was sick of losing out to certain people I
felt weren't qualified to play the parts that they were playing.
For what it was, ``Dumbo Drop'' was a well-made movie that had
something to say that was heartwarming. I don't regret doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Sinatra were alive today, what would he say about your
performance?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hopefully, we got to the heart of his emotional core. He was
somebody that gave his all and wore his heart on his sleeve, and
I'd like to think we captured his essence.

 &HT;    Let's be frank: 'Pack' stars don't look the part
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine living like Tinsel-town-sized icons for three months.
Millions of fans adore you. Vegas and Hollywood are your
playgrounds. You drive expensive cars and have different babes
hanging on your arm every night.
</P>
<P>
   Then . . . like that, it's gone. Over. Endsville, baby!
</P>
<P>
   That kind of ring-a-ding life is hard to give up, says Joe
Mantegna, who plays Dean Martin in HBO's ``The Rat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrapped something like two in the morning and we all looked
at each other and I think we collectively said, `Gee, wouldn't it
be nice to go to Vegas and do a few more weeks of this and maybe
take this on the road for six months?' It was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said about the movie. While ``The Rat Pack''
gives us a fascinating _ and often absorbing _ peek beyond the
larger-than-life facades of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Martin,
Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, it can't overcome the fact that the
actors look and sound almost nothing like the characters they play.
</P>
<P>
   Only Mantegna bears some resemblance to his bubbly, yet distant,
Rat Pack character who was fond of calling Vegas his ``room.''
Despite giving a fine, almost ``Goodfellas''-like turn (especially
while beating up reporters and pushing around a wimpy Lawford), Ray
Liotta is woefully miscast as Sinatra. For starters, he lacks
Sinatra's charisma and looks as much like Ol' Blue Eyes as Pee Wee
Herman. We won't even mention that Liotta's almost whiny voice is
about five octaves higher than Sinatra's.
</P>
<P>
   As a tortured Sammy Davis Jr., it's Don Cheadle who actually
turns in the movie's best performance. But, once again, you never
believe you're watching the real Rat Packers.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the point, sort of. Instead of looking for
impersonators, the producers chose the best actors for the parts.
``This film is not about impersonation,'' says Kario Salem (``Don
King: Only in America''), the movie's screenwriter. ``It's not
about the mannerisms and the sort of cartoon version of who we
think these people are. It's about their insides-out. No one tried
to impersonate these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Cheadle was hesitant to admit that he nailed his character.
``I can't say that,'' he says. ``Sammy was a one-of-a-kind and we
probably won't see the likes of him again. He was a septuple
threat. Anything he grabbed, he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the often dark ``Rat Pack'' does is take us backstage,
showing us how these hip, cool cats lived when the music stopped.
It focuses mostly on Sinatra's friendship with the Kennedys and how
that friendship soured after John F. Kennedy became president and
abandoned the singer because of his alleged mob ties.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Rat Pack'' is basically Sinatra's story (his
legendary fights with Ava Gardner, how he almost got whacked by the
mob and his skirt-chasing ways), it's Davis' story that is most
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was often at odds with the black community, who viewed him
as an ``Uncle Tom'' and first-class sellout. He was despised by
white audiences after he married a white Swedish actress, May
Britt. He was often the brunt of mean-spirited and racist Rat Pack
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slid back and forth between caricature and character,
sometimes invisibly,'' says Cheadle. ``It was hard to tell where
that line was.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds director Rob Cohen: ``I think the expectation of this film
is going to be singing, dancing and (messing around) in the Sands
Hotel. There's a lot of that in the film, but, on the other hand,
it isn't a fluff ball either. There was a lot going on, politically
and socially.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the actors say they had no trouble researching their
roles since there are reams of information on the Rat Packers.
Cheadle had the toughest time, though, considering he had to learn
to tap dance (from Broadway whiz Savion Glover), twirl a Colt
six-shooter, play the trumpet and bang a drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost after every take, I would have to pull (director) Rob
aside and say, `Is this too far? Am I in the pocket?' '' he
recalls. ``Because every footage I've seen of Sammy, there was
always an awareness that he was on camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta says he read 14 books, went to Sinatra's Palm Springs,
Calif., retreat and watched more than 20 of his movies. But his
biggest insight into Sinatra came after watching a Walter Cronkite
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank was at Joey Bishop's with friends and the camera was on
them and there they were interacting without the whole
celebrity/icon kind of image,'' he says. ``And they were just goofy
and fun. That was the biggest thing for me, to play human beings
who happened to be icons.''
</P>
<P>
   But after learning more about Sinatra, Liotta admits he didn't
like him very much. ``If I ever met him, I'm not sure if he was
somebody I'd pal around with,'' he says. ``I don't like celebrities
who get too big for their britches.''

 &HT;    High construction bids for Ohio stadium mean more bids
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Construction bids for the proposed baseball
stadium in downtown Dayton came in high, forcing project planners
to consider more cost cutting and another round of bids.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have bid on the job said the stadium needs to be
shrunk or the $16 million estimated cost needs to go up.
</P>
<P>
   Only two companies submitted bids this time and the lowest was
about $1 million over estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The city asked for bids for the stadium, and for estimates of
savings if masonry was reduced, a proposed front plaza not built
and the number of seats reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan and Meyers Construction of Cincinnati bid $17.8 million
for the full project and $17.1 million with the reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Danis Building Construction bid $19.6 million for the full
stadium and $18.9 million for the scaled back project.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton wants to build a 10,000-seat stadium to be home for a
Class A minor league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the bid opening, city officials met with the
project architect and other staff to go through the bids and
discuss what to do now.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from both companies said they bid as low as they
could. Both also said they could meet the requirement that 10
percent of the work go to minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Tuss, Dayton's director of community development, said it's
possible the region's busy construction industry may have led to
the high bids. ``We're in a very hot construction market right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city cannot accept bids above the $16 million estimated cost
that's set in a city ordinance for the project, Tuss said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's options include redesigning the project and putting
it out for bid a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Five companies bid on the project in June, with the lowest
coming in $2.6 million over budget. At that time, the city had the
project on a very tight construction schedule, which contributed to
the high costs.
</P>
<P>
   The city extended the timetable for the second round, but Vince
Corrado, president of Shook Construction, said, ``Unless they go to
a complete overhaul of the design, they are going to have to raise
the estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company put bids together for both bid openings, but
did not submit them because they were above the project estimated
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kylander, principal estimator for Messer Construction in
Cincinnati, which bid in June, said the design changes made after
the first bids were not enough to bring the costs down several
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you have to take something out of the building,''
Kylander said. ``You need to reduce the size of the project.''

 &HT;    Worshiping God by quietly helping others
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   These Faces of Faith are modest and humble. But they touch lives
in extraordinary ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some work with the poor. Others teach their faith to new
members, visit the sick or care meticulously for their place of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   All of them go about their tasks with a smile, a willing heart
and little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   They are happiest when serving their neighbors and surprised to
discover those neighbors think they are special. They came to our
attention through readers who suggested them for The Post's Faces
of Faith feature.
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET GARR
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I participate is to give other people the
realization that they can do it, too,'' said Margaret Garr, a
great-grandmother whose day is seldom long enough to embrace all
the people she would serve.
</P>
<P>
   So, she has to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Garr stopped her volunteer work at St. Mary's Hospital after
nine years so she could teach inmates three days a week at the Palm
Beach County Jail in West Palm Beach. She helps them pass the high
school equivalency exam.
</P>
<P>
   The North Palm Beach resident still tutors kids one day a week
at Hope Rural School in Indiantown. She has done that for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The retired math teacher is also a Eucharistic minister who
serves communion during Mass at St. Paul of the Cross Roman
Catholic Church in North Palm Beach. And she takes the sacrament to
the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Garr reads Scripture at services, helps teach a course for the
Christian initiation of adults, takes a weekly turn in the church
gift shop and serves on her church's St. Vincent de Paul committee
that helps the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a woman who has been blessed with many talents,'' said
her pastor, the Rev. Arthur Venezia. ``More importantly, she has
been willing to share those with the church and the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Garr came to Florida from Kentucky when her husband died 13
years ago. She suggested three reasons for her active life in
service to others.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband were deeply moved by a verse in the Gospel
of Matthew (25:40) that reports Jesus saying, ``Whatsoever you did
unto the least of these, you did unto me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a happier woman if she is busy, she said, and God has
given her health and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell myself that if I use those things for his honor and
glory, I'll keep them a while,'' Garr said. ``So far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The will to serve must be in the genes. Garr has one son who is
a priest in Peru and another who works for World Hunger Year, a New
York agency concerned with world poverty. Her daughter is the
director of a social service agency in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The children bought her a computer so she could stay in touch
with them by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   She uses it to fire off epistles to Washington politicians. Garr
also is a member of Pax Christi, a national Roman Catholic
organization that works for peace and justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (the computer) helps a lot to zap letters to the
president and senators about some of our causes,'' Garr said.
</P>
<P>
   PHIL DAVIS
</P>
<P>
   Phil Davis manages computer systems to earn a living and serves
Christ to offer others a life.
</P>
<P>
   He is on the streets of Riviera Beach most Saturdays to proclaim
his faith. He greets people, gives them literature and invites
everyone he sees to join him in worshiping _ and serving _ God.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is really committed,'' said the Rev. Tony Drayton, pastor
of St. James Missionary Baptist Church in Riviera Beach. ``All the
outreach ministries of the church are coordinated through him. He
really believes in the great charge of evangelism.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man from West Palm Beach is a computer consultant who
has a hand in almost everything that happens at his church.
</P>
<P>
   As one of five church deacons, he is responsible for the
pastoral care of more than 40 church families.
</P>
<P>
   He stays in touch with them, works to include them in church
activities and carries their concerns and needs to the pastor. He
calls on them at home and, when needed, visits them in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a love for Christ,'' Davis said. ``It's not
an easy journey. You always have to address the needs of others
first. The self has to come out of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is married and helps his wife, Natasha, raise their two
children, Deon, 8, and Phylicia, 4. His family comes first, he
says, but that doesn't prevent him from serving the church.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, he teaches a Sunday school class, is part of
the church's AIDS ministry, is a member of the praise team and
teaches a computer class to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not do these things with an air of superfluity but
rather with a genuine, Godly motivation,'' wrote Rendell Brown when
he nominated Davis for recognition. Brown is a church member and a
West Palm Beach attorney. ``He is always ready with a smile, a hug
and an angelic presence. Deacon Davis is a daily delight for us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has a simple _ if difficult _ explanation for keeping his
life in balance while giving his time and energy to serve his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put others first, the self will take care of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   MEYER COHEN
</P>
<P>
   It's the little things that count. And Meyer Cohen spends most
of the hours of most days doing them.
</P>
<P>
   He opens his synagogue every morning. Closes it at night. He
arranges rooms for daily services and the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   When the rabbi is away, he organizes the prayers. He visits the
sick and takes people to the store. And he is one condo president
admired by people. His philosophy is simplicity itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody can't come, I bring them to shul or shopping,''
Cohen said. ``I think it's the right thing to do. My religion tells
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is an 81-year-old widower who lives in Century Village,
runs his condo, serves his synagogue and cares for all sorts and
conditions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who they are, he just wants to help people,''
said Norma Kuras of West Palm Beach. ``I really respect him as a
human being who doesn't look at whether you're Jewish or not. If
you need help and he can help, he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is the first vice president of Aitz Chaim Congregation, an
Orthodox synagogue in West Palm Beach. Much of his life revolves
around the building and its people.
</P>
<P>
   He arrives before 7 a.m. each day to open the building and set
up for morning prayers. He is there for evening prayer at 6. Except
for the Sabbath and holidays when the faithful cannot drive, Cohen
drives members to and from services and activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been affiliated with the synagogue since its inception,''
said Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer, who is a
member of the synagogue. ``He's very active. He never hesitates to
fill in. He's a wonderful man.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks after his neighbors in his condominium association so
well they gave him a plaque to recognize his kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Looking after his neighbors is Cohen's principal occupation.
Many Century Village residents have no family in the area, Kuras
said. Cohen has become their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to visit someone who is ill, Meyer is there, or just
left or is on his way over,'' Kuras said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen gives himself endlessly to his friends and neighbors, but
he doesn't take himself seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a human being, I think it's the right thing to do,'' Cohen
said, hinting that he is just collecting good deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always short of mitzvahs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FRED MCKOY
</P>
<P>
   Fred McKoy is equally at home in all churches.
</P>
<P>
   He serves meals to the poor at St. George's Episcopal Church in
Riviera Beach. He helps patients at Noreen Mckeen Roman Catholic
home in West Palm Beach. And he is an indispensable presence at his
own First Presbyterian Church in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one God,'' McKoy said. ``The name of the church
is secondary as long as you're willing to do God's work.''
</P>
<P>
   McKoy, 75, came to Florida 11 years ago after retiring from an
insurance company job in New Jersey. He got involved at the church
at once.
</P>
<P>
   Twice chosen to be a deacon, McKoy has also served a term on the
church's governing body. But it's the ``hands on'' service to
church groups and individuals that brings out the best in this
humble man.
</P>
<P>
   He began cleaning the church when the sexton was sick, and he's
still doing it. He prepares meals for women's groups, sets up for
flea markets and helps with the ministry to senior adults.
</P>
<P>
   When a church member who uses a wheelchair needs help, McKoy is
quick to respond, said Eileen Zern from West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is something different when Fred helps,'' wrote
Zern, who suggested McKoy be recognized for his ministry. ``There
is always a quiet smile. There is always an encouraging word.
There's always an aura of caring and concern in which Fred shows
his faith.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrives at St. George's soup kitchen by 10 a.m. for the noon
meal on Tuesdays. There's soup to cook, trays to prepare, people to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always cheerful,'' said Miriam Bigbee, helps out at the
soup kitchen. ``He's never out of sorts. He's willing to do
anything at any time.''

WITH `FRIENDS' LIKE THESE ...  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is often a funny movie. But it
is, as Pauline Kael said about ``A Clockwork Orange,'' appallingly
funny.
</P>
<P>
   There is a price to be paid for appalling. For having to spend
100 minutes with these people, the film will bite from you, if not
a pound of flesh, an ounce or two.
</P>
<P>
   It's the new film from Neil LaBute, who did ``In the Company of
Men,'' and it felt to me at times overrelated to it. It is very
much like it, as if this were an earlier draft of ``Company'' or a
catch basin for what wouldn't fit into the earlier film.
</P>
<P>
   To call the three men who are the center of this ``friends''
debases the word. Let's call these jerks workout buddies. LaBute
structures them to represent degrees of male sexual narcissism and
misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry (Ben Stiller) is a college drama professor who wows the
undergraduates with statements like ``Shakespeare (pause) is a
gift.'' His girlfriend Terri (Catherine Keener) has had her fill of
him and leaves _ among other things, he simply will not stop
talking during sex. Barry (Aaron Eckhart) and wife Mary (Amy
Brenneman) give him a consolation dinner, and Jerry has
propositioned Mary before the dishes are off the table.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhart, the chief predator in ``Company,'' is all but
unrecognizable here as he makes Barry a soft schnook who is often
impotent with Mary but never with himself. So it is more the
depressive Mary's esteem who responds to clammy Jerry than Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The piece of work is Cary (Jason Patric). During one scene, as
he's talking on the phone, he takes the fetus from the uterus of an
anatomical model and begins tossing it from hand to hand. After he
hangs up, he notices how the plaster fetus fits his hand like a
football. So he drops it and punts it. Cary's an M.D. When we first
meet him, he's rehearsing his during-sex manner with a tape
recorder and a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Nastassja Kinski plays art-gallery assistant Cheri, who will
encounter the other characters in turn, but more as a literary
device than a character.
</P>
<P>
   Patric co-produced the film and picked the best role for
himself. He is sensational, absolutely spine-chilling, in a
steam-room scene, LaBute's linchpin sequence, in which the men take
turns relating their best sexual encounters. Cary stops the show.
</P>
<P>
   The film is full of astonishingly casual guys-together cruelties
and cynicism; it drips with bile. ``Love,'' says Terri flat-out,
``is a disease.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's directorial style is to reproduce the mercilessly
unblinking, staring-camera of ``Company'' and to give the actors
all the time they need. This has an upside and downside. The
approach produces moments of exquisite awkwardness, and extends the
caustic bath. It also exacerbates the tendencies of LaBute's
dialogue to pass over into the stylized neighborhood of Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   Funny stuff, but you have to have a stomach for it.
</P>
<P>
   Heed, heed the R rating. &QL;

WHOLESOME-HEARTED `DANCE' HAS A SOUL FULL OF SALSA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are very few nice surprises in this movie-reviewing
business, which makes ``Dance with Me'' all the more unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gentle, good-tempered, wholesome-hearted movie. It's not
much more that a snow cone; but 15 minutes into it, by golly, you
might discover you want a snow cone. This one is cool and sweet.
That's as much as you can ask of a snow cone.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's draw comes from the actor in the
protagonist's role. He bills himself by the mono-name Chayanne.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never heard of Chayanne before now, but he's already a big
blip on radar screens I do not routinely monitor. He's a Puerto
Rican singer who's been working since he was 10 and is platinum in
Spanish-speaking markets from his music videos, concerts and
appearances in soaps.
</P>
<P>
   There apparently was a lot of pent-up demand for Chayanne to
take off his shirt, for the taking-off produced sounds of
appreciation in the higher frequencies from the screening audience.
</P>
<P>
   He's a rather good actor, but what Chayanne has principally
going for him is neither trainable nor obtainable by experience:
The camera simply loves him, the way it loves Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne plays Rafael, first seen in Santiago, preparing to
leave for the States, sad to be leaving Cuba. His visa sponsor is
John Burnett (Kris Kristofferson), who owns a rather tatty dance
studio in Houston and will provide Raffa a job as a handyman.
</P>
<P>
   Raffa's principal reason for coming is to meet John, who does
not know he is Raffa's father, the result of John's cruise-ship
affair with Raffa's mom, who has recently died.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Houston, Raffa becomes quickly smitten by Ruby
(Vanessa L. Williams), a dance instructor. She has come close to
winning the national Latin dance competition. She fears this year's
event in Las Vegas will be her last chance. But the partner with
whom she's working can't cut it; and she can't stand the partner
with whom she could win, who is also the father of her small son.
</P>
<P>
   Can Raffa dance? ``Of course I can dance, I am Cuban,'' he says.
Not dance in the ``and-one-two-three'' Bob Fosse choreography
sense. He doesn't much admire that. But put him on the floor in a
Latin club and the music will inform him what to do. Does Ruby
respond to that? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   You can pretty well take the narrative from there, can't you?
And that's one of the deposits in this film's growing bank account
of good will: You know just about everything that's going to happen
and when it's going to happen. But because that's what you want to
happen, it seems counterproductive to complain about it.
</P>
<P>
   Director Randa Haines, whose previous credits include ``Children
of a Lesser God'' and ``Wrestling Ernest Hemingway,'' very
skillfully, very slyly seduces us into liking this wisp of a movie,
mostly by not selling it to us. She's a less-is-more director, and
it pays off in gentle laughs and an unforced warmth that comes from
respect for the culture of music and dance.
</P>
<P>
   She is also careful not to overdirect the dancing sequences.
There are some silky camera moves, but they are silky because they
do not call attention to themselves. She wants to put you not on a
camera boom but on the floor with the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Matthews wrote the screenplay and shares the choreography
credit with Liz Curtis. OK, so the characters are a bit from stock.
But we like them.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography, though, is an unchallenged delight. Raffa and
Ruby go to a salsa club where movement becomes a pandemic. We
expect the chairs to start dancing. Something like a salsa line
dance breaks out, and eventually everybody is dancing with
everybody. Wall-to-wall charming.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got junior-high-school competitive salsarians who want
to check out the pros' moves, you can trust the PG rating. ``For
mild language and sensuality,'' says the MPAA. I suppose by
sensuality they mean the scene were Raffa and Ruby kiss (just
kiss).
</P>
<P>
   And the mild language is mild. At almost every branching where
the producers had the choice between X and Y, they chose the word
that one usually hears only in the versions prepared for showing on
airplanes. It's all rather sweet.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a reward due these producers for sweetness,
may it not be only in heaven.
</P>

LOTOLOGISTS HOPE TO WIN BIG WITH SCRATCH-OFF COLLECTIONS

(For release Sunday, Aug. 23) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Every time the state of Texas inaugurates a new
scratch-off lottery game, Dr. Alfred Ricks goes out and buys 200 or
300 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But he's never scratched the paint off one of them to see if
he's won a prize.
</P>
<P>
   Not one.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother tells me that I've probably passed up a
million-dollar winner on one of my tickets,'' said the 48-year-old
physician from West Columbia, a city of 5,100 about 45 miles south
of downtown Houston. ``But I'm still not tempted to scratch it off.
I tell everybody I know that every ticket I buy is a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricks is a lotologist, one of a growing number of people who
collect, study and admire lottery tickets _ not for the prizes they
promise, but for their art and value as collectors' items. Though
most of his tickets have yet to grow beyond their $1 face value,
his mint condition Lone Star Millions, from Texas' first lottery
ticket series, are valued at $225 each. He estimates his
collection's total value at $30,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the games proliferate worldwide, collectors' groups claim
membership in the hundreds. They host conventions where people buy
and swap tickets. And, of course, there are Internet sites devoted
to the hobby (www.lotology.com is one example).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ricks, lotologist Valerie Castrianni of Houston collects
only lottery tickets that have been scratched off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go to sleep at night not knowing if there was a big
prize on one of my lottery tickets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Castrianni, 27, deals in all sorts of collectibles, and admits
that tickets that have been scratched off are valued at a fraction
of the pristine ones. But their throwaway quality is part of the
attraction for her, she said. Unlike valuable sports cards or rare
stamps, most of her lottery tickets are free.
</P>
<P>
   A network of friends collects boxes of discarded tickets for her
from convenience stores and other lottery outlets. Not all of those
tickets are really losers, she has found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always go through them to check for any winning numbers,''
Castrianni said. ``Sometimes people don't know how to play the game
or just don't notice that they've really won.'' She's won up to $20
on discarded tickets that way.
</P>
<P>
   Castrianni saves the tickets that are in the nicest condition.
She often sends sets of Texas tickets to collectors in other states
to exchange for tickets from their states.
</P>
<P>
   She also specializes in selling the voided sample tickets sent
to dealers to be used for sales displays.
</P>
<P>
   Lotologist Vladimir Parungao, 55, also of Houston, is a forensic
pathologist by day. He has a technique that combines those of Ricks
and Castrianni. He buys at least two of every new kind of Texas
scratch-off lottery ticket. He scratches some to check for winners;
others he saves in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   Parungao's collection got started in 1992 when his son gave him
some tickets and a collector's album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the artwork on them,'' he said. He also enjoys the
challenge of collecting some of the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like collecting postage stamps, which are on sale
at post offices everywhere in the country,'' he said. ``Some of
these are issued in small states just for a very short time.'' In
Pennsylvania, he recalled, certain lottery tickets have been issued
only in a few select towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting things is a relaxing hobby that he has enjoyed since
his childhood in the Philippines, Parungao said. His first
collection, which he still treasures, was of different kinds of
cigarette papers. Then he collected Johnny Mathis records _
hundreds of them _ enough to listen to for two days without
repeating one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play golf and my kids are grown,'' he said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks, Castrianni and Parungao each boast complete sets, or
samples from each of the 130 or so different ticket series issued
in Texas. They have their favorites from other states as well.
</P>
<P>
   Castrianni said she likes many of Louisiana's colorful tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mardi Gras tickets are really colorful,'' she said. ``And
the wording on many of their tickets are really funny _ wonderful
puns.'' At Christmas they often feature a Cajun Santa bellowing,
``Heaux, heaux, heaux'' instead of ``Ho, ho ho.'' One ticket
featured a picture of a New Orleans streetcar with the title,
``Streetcar named Retire.'' A fine arts series included a
``Pica$o'' and a ``Money Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   Castrianni said she was amazed to find that so many other people
around the country are also collecting lottery tickets. One
national organization claims about 700 members, another about 150.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the millions that collect stamps or coins, lotology
``hasn't even scratched the surface yet,'' said collector Glen
Faulhaber of Clearwater, Fla., using a favorite lotology pun.
</P>
<P>
   Lotteries have long been used to raise money in the United
States, he said. Many of the country's earliest governmental
projects were funded by lotteries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The modern scratch-off lottery began in 1975-76 in states like
Michigan and Illinois, he said. Today, 32 states and the District
of Columbia issue tickets. One state, Alaska, issued tickets for a
couple of years and then stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Although his collection of 40,000 to 50,000 tickets features
8,000 different types, not even Faulhaber claims to have an example
of every kind of scratch-off ticket issued in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just been too many,'' he said. Although most tickets
originally retail for $1, some states have issued tickets costing
up to $25, making it hard for collectors to buy very many, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most collectors concentrate on collections of tickets issued by
their own state, as well as collections of tickets that have a
theme. Faulhaber said he is especially fond of a set of 20
different tickets issued by Maine that had antique autos. Alaska
issued sets that featured that state's birds and different kinds of
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a ticket theme is used by more than one state. Seven
states have issued tickets with ``Star Trek'' themes and five have
issued sets featuring Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Texas sells more than $2 billion in scratch-off lottery tickets
a year, said Texas Lottery Commission spokeswoman Gail Phillips. On
average, she said, two new series are introduced every month.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas for lottery tickets come from many sources, she said. The
San Antonio company that prints them suggests some themes; others
are based on tickets issued by other states. Texas has had contests
seeking designs submitted by private individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The individual games are usually kept open for about a year or
so before being retired and declared closed, Phillips said. After
that, no more prizes are given out for that ticket. Although many
minor prizes are never cashed in, Phillips said few big-ticket
prizes have ever gone unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Phillips said, collectors have been such a minority of
the millions who buy Texas tickets that the commission hasn't
really thought about them.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks said that when he started selling his collectible tickets
over the Internet, he got a call from the state lottery commission
warning him that it is illegal to sell lottery tickets unless he's
a licensed lottery dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell your lawyers to go to hell,'' he said he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the commission has since decided that it is not
illegal for collectors to sell tickets from games that have been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks offers a special deal for people who want to start their
Texas lotology collection in a big way _ a complete set of mint
examples of all 130 Texas tickets for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he hasn't sold a set, but Ricks said he has 100 such
sets squirreled away in safe-deposit boxes.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that some day those unscratched tickets will be big
winners.

WHO NEEDS `WAG THE DOG' WHEN THERE'S CLINTON LIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The guy will do anything to get out of the
house. That's the kind of cheap shot everyone was taking, along
with ``Wag the Dog'' comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the movie, and what the world saw Thursday wasn't a
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a ``message'' to terrorists and to us.
</P>
<P>
   These million-dollar bomb-o-grams look great in the old Pentagon
films we saw Thursday on CNN, and thus the American people got a
message of national and presidential strength.
</P>
<P>
   However, launching a cruise missile at a terrorist training camp
is like shooting a .45 at a swarm of bees. You may kill a few bees,
but the rest are going to get mad. Terrorists are not good at
learning from messages, and tend to respond with car bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Keep telling yourself, ``This isn't a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the beginning of the Vietnam War, American presidents
have been ``sending messages.'' Lyndon Johnson and Robert MacNamara
conceived of escalated bombing as a series of messages to bring the
North Vietnamese to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   However, the North Vietnamese thought of bombs as bombs, not as
telegrams, so escalation progressively hardened their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Since Vietnam, the rules of engagement have become even more
disengaged. Not only do we send messages to enemies, we must follow
the first rule of American intervention: No American should die or
be captured.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the cruise missile is the perfect weapon from a political
point of view. Even if the missile recipients don't get the
intended message, the American people do. They are led to believe
that the president is fighting international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this case, Ken Starr suffers collateral damage.
Monica Lewinsky disappears from the front page.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe the real targets of those missiles were the
polls and Ken Starr's office. There is a real world, after all, and
it's a dangerous place, as recent events in Kenya and Tanzania
demonstrate. There is a man named Osama bin Laden who has declared
war on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's him in those photographs, not an actor in fake beard and
camouflage fatigues. He may seem like a villain out of a Tom Clancy
novel, but even Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, assures us he's real,
noting that he first brought bin Laden to the attention of the
government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Besides congratulating himself, Hatch congratulated the
president on his military action, while sounding a lot like a
candidate to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would like to see terrorists in the cross-hairs
of a cruise missile's video camera for the second or two before
they're vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we're more likely to see the aftermath of bombs
delivered by old-fashioned motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean we shouldn't fight terrorists. It means we
shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking we can stop them with our
technology. Least of all, the president shouldn't fool himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be a slippery politician and an admitted liar, but
he's too smart to try to distract the people with a cooked-up war
the very month that ``Wag the Dog'' hit the video stores.
</P>
<P>
   I rented the movie, and it has a lot of laughs and fine
performances by Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. However, it's
inferior to the production we watched on CNN and MSNBC on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``Wag the Dog'' is a broad comedy, but how can anyone
believe that dozens of technicians can film a fake war without a
single leak to the press? How can anyone believe Americans have a
long enough attention span to let Albanian terrorists distract them
from a presidential sex scandal for 11 days?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-CNN-MSNBC team are masters compared to the makers of
``Wag the Dog.'' The cruise missile war was over in 45 minutes.
Military leaders and talking heads wrapped it up beautifully
between shots of the president's jet taking off from Martha's
Vineyard and landing at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   While the jet was taxiing, MSNBC's Brian Williams smoothly
described how its fuselage is polished daily with household spray
cleaner and paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   This was drama well above the level of ``Wag the Dog,'' almost
at the level of ``Dr. Strangelove'' _ without the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the afternoon, the news channels were back to
Monica, talking about ``unusual sexual practices.'' You know the
world has changed when military interventions last 45 minutes, and
sex lasts seven months.
</P>
<P>
   No, Clinton wasn't trying to distract us from his scandal. He
would have made the intervention last a lot longer, and stayed out
of that summer house for as long as possible. This is the real
world.

 &HT;    YELTSIN CONDEMNS U.S. STRIKES AS 'INDECENT'
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add after 575 words.
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-QUESTIONS-0822.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Eleven days before he is to meet with President Clinton
in Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sharply condemned U.S.
air strikes against suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan, calling the attacks ``indecent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin likened the cruise missile strikes to terrorism, casting
frosty rhetoric over an already strained U.S.-Russia relationship.
He also faulted the United States for unilateral military action
without first consulting other world powers.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Russian naval maneuvers off the northern port of
Murmansk Friday, Yeltsin said of the U.S. strikes: ``My attitude is
negative, just as to any act of terrorism. The reason for (armed)
intervention is impotence, better to solve this question through
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides were quick to stress that Yeltsin's stern criticism of
Clinton would not prompt cancellation of the scheduled summit
between the two leaders Sept. 1-3 in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government hopes Clinton's visit will help begin to
restore a sense of global confidence in the country's ability to
overcome its worsening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's forceful comments came as the opposition-led
parliament was calling for his resignation over the economy,
leading some analysts to conclude that Yeltsin's comments were
intended to win points at home. The government devalued the
national currency earlier this week, causing consumer prices to
rise and hitting the pocketbooks of average Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president's remarks could have been ``perhaps a
meager attempt to improve his extremely low popularity by standing
up to the Americans,'' said Viktor Kremenyhuk of the Institute of
U.S.A. and Canada, a Moscow-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin was chiefly upset that it was not informed in
advance of Thursday's missile strikes, particularly with its
lingering interest in Afghanistan following a long and bloody
Soviet war against Islamic rebels from 1979-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the summit will be jeopardized, but these
actions do not create the best atmosphere for it, especially where
the Russian public opinion is concerned,'' said Vladimir
Baranovski, of the Center for Geopolitical and Military Forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had strongly condemned the bombings against the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Baranovski said average Russians probably understand the
reasoning for the strikes in Afghanistan, considered a quagmire in
Russia similar to America's experience in Vietnam. But they likely
also view the lack of consultations before the strikes as another
example of America's failure to regard Russia as an ally. ``This
could be included in quite a long list of Russian concerns about
the Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reliant on the West for economic aid, Russia has used
diplomacy to assert its independence on the world stage, a tactic
which plays well among ordinary Russians, many of whom blame
Western profiteering for the poor economy. In recent years, Russia
has opposed U.S. military strikes against Iraq and has differed
with the U.S. and NATO over intervention in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In a effort to soften Yeltsin's remarks, his press secretary
Sergei Yastrzhembsky stressed that ``our joint work with the United
States in the struggle against terrorism, and the special services
of the two countries will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Two issues are expected to dominate the Clinton-Yeltsin summit:
Russia's deep economic problems and the international response to
Serbian aggression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kremenyhuk said Yeltsin could have been using his comments about
the missile strikes in advance of the summit as a ploy to undermine
Clinton's position on those two issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is expected to be put on the defensive at the summit.
Now he raises the issue of the U.S. bombings to place Clinton on
the defensive,'' Kremenyhuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials expect Clinton to privately admonish Yeltsin's
government for squandering billions of dollars in international aid
which was intended to prevent a deeper financial crisis in Russia.
The two leaders also disagree over the proper course in Kosovo.
NATO has considered military action to halt violence by Serbs, a
traditional Russian ally, against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador James Collins held talks at the Kremlin and the
foreign ministry Friday in an effort to explain the U.S. actions
and soothe Russian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign ministry warned that the U.S. strikes could
lead to an escalation of violence. ``While it does not address the
essence of the problem, such action can trigger a chain reaction
whose consequences cannot be predicted,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials across the political spectrum joined Yeltsin
in his condemnation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community must use every tool to fight
terrorism but not allow anybody to act as a judge and
executioner,'' Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said in
Moscow.

WHEN CITY SERVICES REALLY STINK

<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ In case you haven't noticed, we live in a world
where we're increasingly on our own in solving all but the most
monumental of problems. Take what happened to Debbie Zotto, for
example:
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, Debbie Zotto went into the garage behind her
house in a nice, tree-shaded neighborhood of 75-year-old homes,
right near Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in this old Hudson
River town of 60,000 or so. She was greeted by bright eyes, a ball
of black and white fur and a distinct odor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little skunk,'' Debbie Zotto told me, ``and it wasn't
at all afraid of me. And skunks are pretty much nocturnal. They're
not out during the day. And they're certainly not friendly. But,
this guy, he wasn't afraid of me ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, skunks walk with a waddle. But he was falling over and
listing and, you know, not right ... So, now the skunk is in the
back yard, and he won't leave. So, I called the county health
department. I said, `Do skunks get rabies?' And they said, `Yeah.
Stay away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That much Debbie Zotto had figured out for herself. But she has
two little kids. The neighborhood is jammed with other people's
kids, too. She wanted desperately for somebody to come and take
this animal away. When she called Troy's animal control officer,
though, all she got was a recording.
</P>
<P>
   I later asked Mark Pattison, Troy's mayor, why somebody with a
potentially rabid wild animal in her back yard couldn't get a live
human being when she called for help. Well, Pattison said, he has
only one guy on the city payroll doing this kind of work. Besides,
there's always 911. You can always call the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile,'' Debbie Zotto told me, ``the skunk was now in a
neighbor's yard, where my neighbor is getting for his 6-year-old's
birthday party, which he can't have because the back yard has been
taken over by Pepe LePew ... I called the police. They told me to
call animal control ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The policeman was so nasty to me. He said, `Hey, lady, what do
you want me to do?' I said, `I want you to come shoot it.' He said,
`We're not going to do that.' I said, `Can I have your gun? I'll
shoot it ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, they did send a patrol car ... The guy wouldn't even
get out of the car. I said, `Why don't you just shoot it and we'll
be done with it?' Well, he didn't want to shoot it because he
didn't want to get sprayed. So, I said, `Sir, what do you want us
to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of the neighbors said, `If you hypothetically had a
gun, you could shoot it, right?' And the officer said, `Well, you
can't shoot a gun in the City of Troy.' But he would look the other
way if we wanted to shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy's public safety commissioner, Mark Whitman, told me that
Debbie Zotto probably spoke with a civilian dispatcher, not a cop,
and that his department has no procedures on handling calls like
this, even though rabies has been a pretty grim problem in upstate
New York for a few years now. Every cop is on his or her own in
working it out what to do in a case like this. Finally, Debbie
Zotto and her neighbors decided they had no choice but to act on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it get shot,'' she told me, ``so I can't say who
did it ... I guess that maybe somebody had a bullet and maybe
somebody else had a .22, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, she put on gloves, shoved the little skunk's
corpse into a big coffee can and put it into her freezer overnight.
The next day, she took it to the New York state health department
lab in Albany, just across the river from Troy.
</P>
<P>
   No rabies. Distemper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew?'' Debbie Zotto said.
</P>
<P>
   And, more to the point, who cared?
</P>

SEVERAL WAYS TO GET UP TO SPEED ON JUST HOW FAST YOUR COMPUTER IS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How can you find out how fast your computer is running?
What's the megahertz? I've lost everything that might have the
original specifications on it.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several ways to do this.
</P>
<P>
   You might find the information you want in the system's BIOS
settings. How you enter the BIOS depends on the kind of computer
you have, but usually it involves hitting a specific key just
before your PC starts loading the operating system. For example, on
systems that use an American Megatrends BIOS, you'd hit the delete
key.
</P>
<P>
   On newer systems, you'll see the speed of the processor as one
of the settings.
</P>
<P>
   (Be very careful when entering this setup feature. If you make
any changes that don't match your computer's configuration, you
might run into serious trouble _ including rendering your PC
inoperable.)
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you might be able to tell the speed by the model
number. For example, Gateway numbers its PCs in a way that includes
the clock speed of the main chip. A G6-400 is a Pentium II
processor running at 400 megahertz. Check the Web site of your PC's
manufacturer for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try downloading SiSoft Sandra, an excellent shareware
utility that tells you all kinds of information about your PC,
including the processor's speed. Get it at
www.sisoftware.demon.co.uk/sandra/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently visited a Web site that had colored text on a
colored background. Unfortunately, the text's color was white, so
when I went to print it out, the paper was blank! What can I do to
get a hard copy of the text?
</P>
<P>
   A: By default, neither Netscape Navigator nor Internet Explorer
will print the background of a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using Netscape Navigator, you can tell the browser to
use only the colors you specify to view a Web page. This way, you
can choose the standard black type on white background, which will
make your printer happy.
</P>
<P>
   In Navigator 4.05, which comes with the latest version of
Communicator, click on Edit, then Preferences, then Appearance. Go
to the Colors menu and click the box titled ``Always use my colors,
overriding document.'' Remember to change it back when you are
done.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01, you can print the exact
colors on the Web page. Though this will use up lots of ink, it
will print the page exactly as you see it, including the
background. Click on View, Internet Options, then the Advanced tab.
Scroll to the bottom of the list of choices and click ``Print
background colors and images.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the simplest thing to do may be to copy the text and
paste it into your word processor, then print from there. Drag your
cursor through the text you want to print, which will highlight it.
Then, right-click and choose copy. Launch your word processor and
paste into a blank document. Start printing!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have Internet Explorer 4.01, and I'm interested in sending
secure e-mail. How do I do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll need to get a digital ID, a way to electronically
``sign'' and encrypt messages you send.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need to make sure that your recipients have a copy
of your digital ID, so they can read the messages you send.
</P>
<P>
   In Outlook Express, which is the e-mail software accompanying
Internet Explorer 4.01, go to the Tools menu and choose Accounts.
Click on your e-mail account, then click the Properties button.
Choose the Security tab.
</P>
<P>
   From here, you can sign up for a digital ID. A button called
More Info will tell you more about the process of acquiring and
using a digital ID.

HBO BUNGLES STORY OF SINATRA &AMP; CO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ring-a-ding-ding, baby _ call up all your hepcat
pals and tell them to skip ``The Rat Pack,'' HBO's new movie airing
Saturday night (see local listings).
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe anyone can screw up a film with such lively
subject matter as the complex relationships between Frank Sinatra,
his entertainer pals, John F. Kennedy and a host of mobsters. But
``Rat Pack'' is relentlessly bad, so bad, that you start reading
the press material early on, wondering if you missed the part that
says this is supposed to be a comedy. As a comedy, it's great _ the
portrayals are so over-the-top they just have to be intentional,
except that they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough blame to go around, but why not nail Kario Salem
first? The screenwriter, who turned in a fine effort with previous
HBO work, ``Don King: Only in America,'' is so heavy-handed with
the dialogue that there is zero room for nuance in the acting
realm. Everyone, by virtue of the lines they are forced to say,
becomes an instant caricature. Reading that Salem's next script
will be for an Oliver Stone movie on Martin Luther King sheds some
light _ Oliver Stone is a sledge hammer director, so maybe Salem
was just getting warmed up for Ollie.
</P>
<P>
   The story, such as it is, focuses on the late '50s and early
'60s when Sinatra and his Rat Pack buddies _ Dean Martin, Sammy
Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop _ ruled the Hollywood
roost. Being a skirt-chasing booze hound is back in fashion, so the
timing of the movie was perfect. These days, people like to smoke
and drink and chase broads and get crazy. Actually, people have
always been like that, only now it's cool again.
</P>
<P>
   So Frank, played by Ray Liotta, sets the pace, with Martin (Joe
Mantegna), close behind. The others _ Davis (Don Cheadle), Lawford
(Angus Macfadyen) and Bishop (Bobby Slayton) _ are essentially
hangers-on, although Davis at least had some talent. The casting is
debatable at best, and with Mantegna as Martin, downright horrible.
Mantegna looks like Dino's father _ which is unforgivable since
Dino was the absolute King of Cool of his time. Frank tried most of
his life to be as cool as Dean _ Dean just was cool.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, casting Slayton as Bishop is perfect, since
it takes one mediocre comedian to truly understand the inner
mediocrity of another. And it's tough to tell if Cheadle is playing
Davis for laughs, since Davis was always just downright bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, which is pretty much historically accurate, revolves
around Sinatra's fascination with the Kennedy mystique and the
power of the office of the presidency and JFK's equal intrigue in
the world of Hollywood. Through Lawford, Kennedy's brother-in-law,
introductions are made and wheels are set in motion that ultimately
involve alleged Mafia assistance in rigging elections in Kennedy's
favor, Kennedy's subsequent ``betrayal'' of the mob through his
appointment of his crusading brother Bobby as attorney general, and
all the hell Sinatra has to go through when he is ultimately
rejected by both the mob and the Kennedys, those ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   It's great material for a movie, just not this movie. The
language is crude and vulgar, which isn't so bad, but even
Kennedy's assignations with Marilyn Monroe and Mafia moll Judith
Campbell were probably arranged with a tad more grace than imagined
here. One hopes, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rat Pack'' is great for all it's period authenticities,
from the clothing to the cars to the unfiltered Camels
Sinatra/Liotta shamelessly inhales. The singing is handled largely
by studio pros, although Cheadle and Mantegna croon a bit, badly.
If you want a few laughs, go ahead and tune in.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a little Rat Pack reality, give it a miss.

VOODOO2 CHIP CASTS GOOD SPELL ON GAMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Diamond Multimedia first introduced its Monster 3D video
card in late 1996, it didn't immediately catch on. Most users
couldn't see why they'd need a second graphics card in their
computer _ certainly not for $200!
</P>
<P>
   That changed by late last year, when it was nearly impossible to
find a Monster 3D card on store shelves. What began as a curiosity
among hard-core gamers grew to become a must-have addition for
anyone who regularly plays PC games.
</P>
<P>
   The Monster's magic comes from a set of chips made by 3Dfx
Interactive called Voodoo. Not only does the Voodoo chip set
dramatically accelerate 3-D game play, but it also can enhance the
appearance of a game. With the Voodoo, 3-D really looks ... well,
like 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   When 3Dfx announced it would create a second generation of the
chip, the Voodoo2, other graphics card companies decided they
wanted to cash in. Today, more than a dozen vendors are selling
Voodoo2 cards _ including Diamond. I reviewed the Monster 3D II
earlier this year (see
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/03/27/compute.html).
</P>
<P>
   There also are more reasons to get one of these cards than ever
before. Game software developers increasingly are including support
for the 3Dfx chips in their titles. Whether you're into
first-person shooters and action games or prefer more placid
pursuits, such as flight simulators and adventure titles, a card
that uses a Voodoo2 chip set can make computer gaming a more
realistic experience.
</P>
<P>
   All Voodoo2 boards use a pass-through connector, a cable that
links your regular, 2-D graphics card to the Voodoo2. You then plug
your monitor into the Voodoo2, and the signal from the 2-D card is
supposed to pass cleanly through to the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat _ you'll need a fairly powerful machine to enjoy a
Voodoo2-based card. I'd recommend at least a 166-megahertz Pentium
system with 32 megabytes of memory. If your system is less powerful
than this, you might want to consider an original Voodoo-based
card, which can be found dirt-cheap. I've seen the original Monster
3D advertised for as little as $50, after a rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at a pair of Voodoo2-based graphics cards that
plug into a Windows-based system's PCI slot. One's aimed at the
hard-core game market; the other at everyone else who wants killer
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pure 3D II, $289, Canopus Corp.: Most of the Voodoo2-based
graphics cards use a similar design recommended by 3Dfx's
engineers. Canopus, which marketed a popular original Voodoo card
called the Pure 3D, has opted to tinker with that design to add
features and performance.
</P>
<P>
   But those benefits may not be enough for the average game-player
to justify the price, which is more than what you'd pay for most
other Voodoo2 boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pure 3D II comes with 12 megabytes of video memory, as do
many of the other Voodoo2 cards. But that's about where the
similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   The Pure 3D II has a connection for a standard TV, allowing you
to connect your PC to a big-screen television for a truly immersive
experience. The image is not going to be as good as on a
high-definition computer monitor, but it is as good as, or even a
little better than, what you'd find on a game console.
</P>
<P>
   The board also comes with a built-in fan. Voodoo2 chips are
notorious for running hot. And hard-core gamers are notorious for
overclocking their systems and graphics cards _ meaning they fiddle
with settings so they run at faster-than-rated speeds. The Pure 3D
II's internal clock can be pushed up to 100 megahertz via a control
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pure 3D II uses a slightly different kind of cable to
connect to your standard video card, and the result is that, with
some 2-D cards, text in Windows applications appears to have a
slight shadow. This irritated me at first, but I don't even notice
it any more. Nevertheless, it's a defect not seen in other Voodoo2
cards that I wish Canopus would fix.
</P>
<P>
   The Pure 3D II comes with software that lets you change
brightness levels in games with a single keystroke, and a
taskbar-style launcher to give you quick access to your favorite
games.
</P>
<P>
   It comes bundled with only one game, but it's a nice one _ the
Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning from Activision. You'll need a
registered version of Quake II to play it, however.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3D Blaster Voodoo2, $250, Creative Labs: Creative Labs was the
first out of the gate with a Voodoo2 card, and it was a 12-megabyte
version at that. While the company now has an 8-megabyte version
for about $50 less, this is the one to get if you don't need all
the features in the Canopus card.
</P>
<P>
   The Blaster is about as plain-vanilla a Voodoo2 card as you can
get. In fact, it lacks some software features found in most
competing boards. For example, there's no easy way to goose the
Blaster's clock speed _ although there are shareware programs
available on the Web that will do this for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Blaster uses the more traditional pass-through cable, and
the result is a crisp, clean look for your regular Windows
programs. However, there's no TV-out connection, so you're stuck
with playing on a regular computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The 3D Blaster Voodoo2 comes with three games: Microprose's
Ultim(at)te Race Pro, Rage Software's Incoming and Psygnosis'
G-Police.
</P>
<P>
   How do these two cards compare in performance? I ran both on a
200-megahertz Pentium MMX system with 64 megabytes of RAM with a
variety of games. The Canopus card was slightly faster, but not by
much. I'd say most gamers probably could not tell the difference.
That makes the Creative Labs card a better buy if you can live
without the Canopus card's bells and whistles.

YOUR PERSONAL AQ MAY DETERMINE WHETHER YOU PREVAIL OR FAIL IN A
CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing like a crisis to winnow the winners from the
whiners.
</P>
<P>
   Some people hit with a setback become paralyzed and give in to
helplessness, while others seize the situation and turn it into an
opportunity for success.
</P>
<P>
   Why do some people prevail where others despair? The difference
lies in their ``adversity quotients,'' said Paul Stoltz, chief
executive officer of Peak Learning Inc., an Arizona-based training
and consulting firm that specializes in adversity training for
companies.
</P>
<P>
   An adversity quotient is a measure of how well someone handles
bad news, said Stoltz, who coined the term and has written the book
``Adversity Quotient _ Turning Obstacles Into Opportunities''
(Wiley, $24.95, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The good news is you can change your pattern of reactions to
adversity _ up your AQ, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes more than positive thinking to get people through a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always the people with the most positive, upbeat
outlook who do the best,'' Stoltz said. ``Sometimes it's the people
you would not have guessed who turn out to have the quiet spine of
steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoltz is not a big believer in what he calls ``happy-think
training,'' despite the fact that motivational pep talks have
turned into a $60 billion-a-year industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reached cultish proportions because adversity is so
pronounced and people feel so much more exposed, in their jobs and
elsewhere,'' he said. ``They're looking for solace.''
</P>
<P>
   But the motivational industry is like the coffee business, he
said. It's selling a product that makes people feel good for a
while, but then it wears off and they need another shot.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who knows how to rebound, no matter how difficult the
circumstances, is more likely to be able to sustain a positive
attitude, he said. That's good for people, and it's good for
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of response to life's hurdles is typically ingrained
early on, Stoltz said. If a child has a parent who panics, acts out
in anger, shirks responsibility or assumes helplessness, that child
often grows up to respond to adversity in a similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But those patterns can change, he said. ``They can rewire their
brains.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four components to handling adversity well.
</P>
<P>
   The first is control. People who deal well with adversity are
able to gain some sense of control, even in situations that appear
overwhelming, he said. People who do less well perceive that
matters are completely out of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   A second component is ``ownership'' of the problem. People who
hold themselves accountable for dealing with situations, even if
they didn't cause them, tend to do better in adversity than do
people who assume helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   A third component is ``reach,'' or how far a person lets fallout
from the adverse situation spill into other areas of his life.
People who don't do well in negative situations tend to
``catastrophize'' the problem, magnifying it and letting it gain
control over their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, there's endurance. People with high adversity quotients
can maintain their hope and optimism by seeing past even the most
seemingly insurmountable difficulties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Public Schools Superintendent John Stanford, who is
battling an aggressive and rare form of cancer, is a textbook
example of someone with a high adversity quotient. He would score
well in all four categories _ taking some control of his situation,
owning it by making his own decisions, refusing to let it leak into
other areas of his life, and remaining hopeful by being able to
envision a positive future.
</P>
<P>
   There are several steps people can take to move their adversity
quotients from the low end to the high end, Stoltz said.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to examine how you respond to a crisis, he
said. Then ask yourself what is realistically about to happen, and
what piece of it you can be accountable for dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   Next, don't give into suppositions and worst-case scenarios.
Instead, take a ``funnel approach'' for figuring out what to do.
Make a list of all possible moves you could make, and then commit
to at least one constructive step you can take immediately, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That automatically strengthens your sense of control,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this process of listening, analyzing and taking
action becomes automatic in a crisis situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity is an unfortunate fact of
</P>
<P>
   life. Few people escape it in one form or another.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't be afraid of bad times, Stoltz said. ``Without
adversity, what would we ever learn about ourselves and each
other?''

   Pieces of the radio dish which picked up the most tantalizing
evidence to date of extraterrestrial intelligence are up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The 260-foot Big Ear dish at Ohio State Radio Observatory
carried out the longest running search for extraterrestrial
intelligence program, or SETI.
</P>
<P>
   It shot to stardom in 1977 after it picked up the so-called
``Wow!'' signal _ a blast of radio power which lasted 37 seconds,
from the direction of Sagittarius. This signal has never been
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shuch, director of an organization of amateur SETI
enthusiasts called the SETI League, based in New Jersey, believes
that the signal must have come either from an alien civilization or
an as-yet undiscovered type of astronomical object. ``Either
possibility is mind-boggling,'' Shuch says.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ear dish was demolished earlier this year to make way
for a golf course. But before that happened, 100 small pieces of
the metal mesh covering its surface were rescued by members of the
SETI League.
</P>
<P>
   The salvaged pieces are 10.5 centimeters square _ half the Big
Ear's operating wavelength _ and are mounted on wooden plaques.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sections of antenna reflector were actually illuminated
by the Wow! signal,'' Shuch says. The price of a piece of SETI
history is a minimum donation of $100 to the SETI League. Proceeds
will be shared between the SETI League and the Ohio State Radio
Observatory. &QL;

   ``Flying saucers'' and thermos flasks full of pest-busters will
soon be helping farmers to control insects that devastate their
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
Shafter, Calif., are developing two fast, cheap ways to get
biological control agents such as wasps and mites where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   One is a clay pigeon or skeet catapult that fires parasitic
wasps and other predators into position, and the other is an
insulated dispenser that keeps tiny mites immobile while they are
being dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Carter, the USDA engineer who invented the two devices,
says farmers keen to use biological controls find that spreading
the insects by hand is expensive and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   To help them, Carter has developed the Aerodynamic Transport
Body, which looks like a clay pigeon and can be launched from a
catapult mounted on a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The ATB is a ``flying saucer'' about 10 centimeters wide and 2
centimeters high. It is made of limestone, hollowed out to hold
hundreds of Aphelinus wasps or big-eyed bugs (Geocoris punctipes)
which attack cotton aphids and other pests.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carter, tests show that such predators don't mind
being launched at 177 kilometers per hour. He adds, ``They are
flung about 20 meters to 50 meters, which is ideal for getting them
into the edges of fields, where pests first land when they invade a
farm.'' The ATBs, which split open on impact, will eventually be
made from biodegradable oatmeal or peat moss.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has also developed the Mite Meter, an insulated container
with a capacity of between 3 liters and 4 liters that distributes
the tiny mites into high-value crops such as strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting mites like Galendromus occidentalis onto crops is
hard,'' Carter says. ``If they are warm, they crawl to the top of
the container. Shaking it so they tumble to the bottom can kill up
to half of the mites.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Mite Meter, like a huge thermos flask, keeps the mites
and corn grits they are packaged with at a stable temperature, near
freezing. This keeps them immobile until they hit the ground. The
device can be towed behind a tractor or pushed by hand through the
field. A motorized belt running under the outlet at the bottom of
the meter determines the application speed. This precisely controls
the number of mites that are released in each meter of each row. &QL;

   Your reproductive ability may be written in your hands. But what
matters is the symmetry of your two hands and the length of your
fingers, not the crinkles in your palms.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments in mice have revealed that mutations in a single
gene, Hox, affected the development not only of digits but of
ovaries and testes as well. So John Manning and his colleagues at
the University of Liverpool decided to see if there was any link
between hand shape and fertility.
</P>
<P>
   They measured the hands of 60 men and 40 women who were
attending an infertility clinic. Some people had severe fertility
problems, others were their healthy partners. Manning found that
the men with the least symmetrical hands _ where one hand is not a
mirror image of the other _ had the lowest sperm count and lowest
sperm motility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digit asymmetry predicts the number of sperm per ejaculate,''
Manning says. ``The more asymmetry, the fewer sperm.'' Twelve of
his subjects, who were producing almost no sperm, had asymmetries
of up to 4 millimeters between their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Manning also looked at the relative lengths of fingers. For
reasons no one has been able to explain, men tend to have ring
fingers that are longer than their index fingers, whereas in women
the two fingers tend to be the same length.
</P>
<P>
   Manning found that men whose ring fingers are much longer than
their index fingers tended to have higher levels of the male sex
hormone testosterone, which plays a role in fertility. In women, by
contrast, a longer index finger is associated with higher levels of
the hormones estrogen and luteinizing hormone, both critical
hormones for female reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Manning thinks the relative lengths of the two fingers will be a
robust predictor of fertility, but warns that more research is
needed. Since the trait appears to be fixed in the womb, it may
shed light on other developmental disorders such as autism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting a window into the in-utero conditions in that
individual,'' he says. &QL;

IN POLL, PEOPLE SAY CLINTON DIDN'T REDEEM HIMSELF IN SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>

 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Responses to a San Francisco Examiner survey of
President Clinton's public apology this week showed a clear
majority, nearly 55 percent, said he had not redeemed himself with
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day after Clinton appeared on national TV and
admitted to an inappropriate relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, the Examiner asked readers to respond to
the following question: ``Did President Clinton redeem himself with
his speech to the nation about his role in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 people responded in the informal, three-day
telephone survey. The majority of the votes had been cast before
the U.W. attack Thursday on terrorist sites in Afghanistan and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Several letters, faxes and e-mails forwarded to the Examiner
expressed outrage and called for Clinton's immediate resignation.
Others ranged in their emotional intensity from despair to
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Many called for Clinton's resignation, but more than one
suggested that ``he who is without sin cast the first stone.'' And
many pleaded for an end to the national obsession with Clinton's
intimate indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6,031 responses, 3,314 said that no, Clinton had not redeemed
himself, and 2,717 said yes he had.
</P>
<P>
   No votes tallied Tuesday and Wednesday outnumbered yes votes by
a margin of about 900, but on Thursday the gap had closed
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what some readers had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Clinton) tries to continue in office, he will make a
laughing stock out of the presidency of the United States of
America, because he will go down in contemporary world history as
the only leader who has tried to continue in office after having
openly violated the 11th commandment (getting caught.)'' _ John
Buencamino.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the eyes are windows to the soul, Mr. Clinton's eyes were
blank Monday evening as he tried to persuade us the fault was (with
independent counsel) Judge (Kenneth) Starr. A simple, heartfelt
apology would have done the job _ but he could not pull it off with
his superior attitude and cockiness.'' _ A.R. Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only honorable thing Bill Clinton could do to save his
reputation for history/herstory is to gallantly resign from the
presidency. His speech was a finger-shake at everyone but himself.
... Bill Clinton has lost most of his credibility since he first
took office, but now his credibility is non-existent.'' Anita
Kristi, a self-described liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any of my children apologized the way President Clinton did
... I would send him back to his room.''_ Christina Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not care to see the personal life of my
commander-in-chief exposed daily. However, his poor judgment is the
cause. Any Marine who displayed the lack of judgment, compassion
and integrity that our president has displayed, would not be a
Marine for long.'' _ Sean P. Dalton, a former Marine first
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say this is a personal matter ... but if they stop to
think how stupid his behavior has been, how can they trust him to
make smart decisions. He has shown such poor judgment in his
personal behavior. For a so-called Rhodes scholar, he sure appears
to lack a cognitive brain.'' _ Eugenia Rome.

SIT DOWN AND `DANCE WITH ME'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like ``Ballroom Dancing,'' ``Flashdance,'' ``Dirty Dancing'' and
``Saturday Night Fever,'' ``Dance with Me'' is a feel-good movie
with great music, two beautiful lead actors and a good deal of
joyous choreography and booty-shaking.
</P>
<P>
   But also as in the other movies, the plot is shakier than the
dancing. ``Dance with Me'' is about a young Cuban named Rafael
Infante (Chayanne) who goes to Texas to find a dance studio
operator named John Burnett (Kris Kristofferson). John gives Rafael
a job as a janitor, unaware that he is Rafael's father. That little
tension buzzes through the movie as writer Daryl Matthews (a former
professional dancer and choreographer) defers Rafael's spilling the
beans for, I suppose, dramatic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rafael holds back some other vital information
you'd think he might want to reveal the moment he walked into the
studio: that he can dance better than Charo.
</P>
<P>
   You'd especially think he'd want this information out there
since he is immediately smitten with Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams), an
instructor who used to compete in Latin ballroom dancing
competitions but quit when she broke up with her egomaniacal
partner, who is also the father of her young son. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, once Rafael and Ruby start dancing together, both the
screen and their passions heat up. It would be tough to find two
more attractive people than Williams and Chayanne and director
Randa Haines makes us long for the pair to commingle, which they
obligingly do after the requisite hesitations.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofferson looks like he's never danced a step in his life,
but it doesn't much matter and Joan Plowright as a plucky dance
student adds a little comic whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Chayanne, who is a Puerto Rican singing idol and television
star, is especially fun to watch because unlike the other dancers
in this movie, he moves with a grace and fluidity that seem
organic. While Ruby's professional partner, Julian (Rick
Valenzuela), dances spasmodically as if he means to throw his limbs
out of their sockets, Chayanne's body is easy and loose when he
moves to the Latin rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography by Liz Curtis is exhilarating and not only as
spirited as you'd expect Latin movements to be, but also full of
humor and happiness. Just what you want for a couple of hours of
mindless fun.

COVER SCORCHED COUNTER TOP WITH CONTACT PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 23, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My Formica counter top was badly scorched when a hot pan was
put on it. How can I cover it, fix it, or restore it? Can I cover
it with Contact paper?
</P>
<P>
   AGNES MIRISOLA, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If it's a light scorch, you might be able to clean it with
baking soda and water, or light scouring with a scouring compound.
If it's a heavy scorch, the plastic is gone forever. But you can
cover it; your idea of using Contact paper is a good one. The paper
won't last very long, but it will be good enough until you replace
the plastic. The nice thing about the new Contact (new in the last
10 years or so) is that it is easily pulled off when the time
comes. The old Contact was impossible to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Another temporary fix is to put a cutting board over the scorch.
No one will know but the cook and the dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The roll roofing on my bump-out roof has degraded, with one
or two small holes, but they are not leaking. Can I put on a second
layer?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, and I suggest doing it before it springs a leak. Cut new
roll roofing to the size of the roof, lift the flashing where the
roof meets the wall, and tuck the roofing under the flashing and
line it up with the old, to check the proper fit. Then take off the
new and slather roofing cement on the old roof, along the edges and
in the middle. Put the new roof on; with luck, it will last 15 or
more years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is a cleanout plug in the four-inch iron pipe in my
basement that leads to the septic tank. It's a hexagonal plug
screwed into a brass fitting. I mashed the plug trying to take it
off. Any way to take it out now so I can clean out the drain?
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR BANEVICIUS, Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There might be, doing it as mechanics do to back out a bolt
that has lost its head or has a messed up screw slot. Spray some
pentrating oil into the threads of the plug. Place a sharp cold
chisel on one side of the plug and tap lightly, counterclockwise.
Chances are the plug moves counterclockwise and tapping might get
it started. The chisel will dig into the soft brass and will stay
in place, usually, when you tap. If no go, you may have to drill it
out, but make sure you can find, or have a substitute the right
size. Does the drain really need cleaning? I suppose it may if the
flow is sluggish, but I'd also have the tank pumped out, which may
allow the drain to clear itself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a sump hole in my basement that acts as a drain for
the condensing water from my air conditioning system. It is 3
inches wide and 18 inches deep, and in heavy rains the hole fills
and water backs up to flood the floor. How can I prevent that?
</P>
<P>
   JUDY AND DAVID SCHURGIN, Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The flooding is caused by the level of water underground
(ground water or water table, take your pick for a name), which
rose during heavy rains, filled the hole from below, and flooded
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, I think, is that the sump hole (that's a
redundancy; a sump is a hole) is way too small for the amount of
water it gets. Make the sump bigger: 18 inches square and 24 inches
deep. Add crushed stone to a depth of 6 inches. This bigger hole
may handle the ground water plus the condensate from the A/C. If
not, install a pump, which will pump the water automatically away
from the house before it floods the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My garage roof is a flat concrete slab, 70 years old, and it
has been leaking badly and damaging the cars under. A contractor
sealed the holes, then applied a clear sealer. It did not help.
Another man put in two inches of concrete which also did not work.
Still another man took off the concrete and sealed the roof, also
without success. Now what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   LEE BURNS, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. After spending a small fortune for all thsoe unsuccessful
patches, consider moving the cars out for a while until the roof is
fixed, once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   And this might be the once-and-for-all fix: If the roof is
relatively intact, I suggest hiring a roofer to put on a rubber
roof. But be warned that you cannot walk on this rubber roof, even
if it is on concrete. In fact, I know of no roof that can be walked
on (with added stress of furniture, etc.) that is waterproof. If
you want to use the roof as a patio, you have to build a deck above
it; a few inches above it will do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The set-tubs in my basement have small leaks, at the bottom
of the sinks where they drain out. How can I fix them myself?
</P>
<P>
   ELLIE CRONIN, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since the leaks are at the drains, dismantle the drains and
drain covers and install plumber's putty in the openings before
putting them back. And don't put them back too tightly.
</P>
<P>

RAIDS SHOW NEW PENTAGON STRATEGY TO HEAD OFF TERRORIST ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday's military strikes against targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan were aimed at stopping terrorists before they could carry out
attacks with chemical weapons, part of a new Pentagon strategy that
has been developing since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike just a few years ago, when the military focused on
conventional operations such as the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon has
shifted much of its attention to terrorists or rogue states capable
of launching attacks against U.S. targets with nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a different ballgame today,'' Joint Chiefs Chairman
Gen. Henry Shelton said Thursday. ``We're going against a terrorist
organization, and that calls for some different techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Called ``counterproliferation,'' the new military strategy is
about quick, incisive strikes that have a primary objective of
taking out, or severely crippling, the ability of rogue states and
terrorist groups to wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon began its multibillion-dollar counterproliferation
initiative to prevent nuclear, biological and chemical terrorism in
late 1993. It was formally made part of defense planning and
budgets the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen emphasized Thursday that the
U.S. military action was not merely retaliation, but a pre-emptive
strike to thwart additional terrorism that could involve chemical
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ... had convincing information that, for some time,
the (Osama) bin Laden network has been actively seeking to acquire
weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, for use
against U.S. citizens and our interests around the world,'' Cohen
said. Bin Laden is a Saudi millionaire accused by U.S. officials of
being a major sponsor of terrorism, including the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target was terror,'' President Clinton declared. ``Our
mission was clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has already invested more than $20 billion on a
wide range of technology improvements, sensors and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Busbee, a retired brigadier general who serves as Cohen's
principal deputy for counterproliferation, described the goals in
an interview:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bolster protection for American embassies and U.S. military
sites overseas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prevent attacks on the American heartland from nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide the military the means to fight and win a conflict in
which chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have been used.
</P>
<P>
   _ Locate, attack and destroy such weapons before they can be
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterproliferation is designed to give the president and
national leadership options to deal with weapons of mass
destruction if our good-faith (diplomatic) efforts ... and other
initiatives fail to halt the spread,'' Busbee said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to suspected terrorist organization's such as bin
Laden's, a number of countries _ including North Korea, Libya,
Syria and Iran _ are known to possess or to be attempting to
develop nuclear, biological or chemical agents and ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon anticipates spending an additional $30 billion on
counterproliferation over the next five years, although the vast
bulk of the money _ some $20 billion _ is earmarked for an array of
ballistic missile defense programs such as the Boeing-led Airborne
Laser System to destroy missiles after launch.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's U.S. attacks appeared to be against relatively
unprotected targets.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon faces a much more difficult and dangerous
threat as it bolsters its overall counterproliferation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Gulf War, several hostile states have
buried their critical nuclear, chemical and biological facilities
deep underground, where they would be invulnerable to cruise
missiles and other conventional weapons, experts warn.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include the North Korean nuclear weapons complex at
Yongbyon, where at least two nuclear devices have been built, and
the Libyan chemical weapons complex at Tarhunah, both of which are
buried under hundreds of feet of rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at a whole range of deeply buried
facilities,'' said Dan Goure, a counterproliferation expert at the
non-profit Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, D.C. ``Many of them are built under mountains ... where
stuff goes on may be thousands of meters under rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure said some experts doubt Yongbyon could be destroyed even
by a tactical nuclear weapon. ``Its doubtful you could do it with a
nuclear (bomb), even with an earth penetrator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A significant amount of counterproliferation money is being
spent on sensors to detect such underground sites, intelligence
systems to monitor and track the sites and weapons materials that
may be moved from them. And money is being spent on weapons to
destroy both the facilities and the weapons materials, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   As a fail-safe move, elite commandos from the U.S. Special
Operations Command also have been tasked with developing weapons,
technology and tactics to fight their way into hardened underground
sites to destroy or seize weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs under development:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground sensors: A high-frequency research project aims at
producing an active sensing system that can locate underground
sites. Other, mobile unmanned sensors are being built that can be
covertly deployed near an underground facility to provide
continuous surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobile sensors: A new generation of space-based sensors to
detect nuclear detonations will improve U.S. ability to track
nuclear proliferation. Other sensors mounted on unmanned aerial
vehicles, Navy ships and aircraft can detect trace elements from
weapons materials being smuggled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earth-penetrating munitions: New conventional bombs and
missile warheads are being designed that penetrate deeply
underground before detonating to increase the destructive power of
the weapon, and other warhead designs will incinerate chemical or
biological agents instead of dispersing them in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weapons: The Pentagon is exploring adapting the Army Tactical
Missile System for use by the Navy and Marines as a weapon against
underground facilities. Other research is examining the
reconfiguration of cruise missiles for this mission.
</P>
<P>
   Counterproliferation also encompasses a wide variety of programs
designed to encourage other nations to prevent proliferation of
nuclear, chemical and biological materials and and critical
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement with the
countries of the former Soviet Union, the Pentagon and U.S. Energy
Department have provided security courses and materials to
safeguard such materials. They also have assisted the centralized
storage of such weapons in Russia, Busbee and other officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile element of counterproliferation is the
Pentagon's recent announcement that it will vaccinate all
active-duty personnel against the biological agent anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the urgency of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a very significant danger we face,'' says
retired Gen. John Shalikashvili, Shelton's predecessor as Joint
Chiefs chairman from 1993 to 1997. ``Despite the best arms-control
efforts, the proliferation of both conventional weapons capable of
producing mass casualties and ... chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons will continue to expand,'' Shalikashvili said in an
interview the day before the raids.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn there is no easy or simple formula that will
guarantee the United States can prevent attacks by terrorist groups
or rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon Thursday demonstrated it had been able to
compile data from eavesdropping satellites and other sources to
identify the bin Laden terrorist sites, the CIA and other
intelligence agencies are still recovering from a massive failure
to detect the plans by India and Pakistan to detonate nuclear
devices earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said the problem is not in obtaining data, but in
fielding sufficient analysts who can identify threats from the
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data was all there, but the analysts were not devoted to
watching it 24 hours a day,'' the retired general said.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George Tenet in July announced a series of
management reforms to beef up the agency's counterproliferation
center in the wake of the India-Pakistani blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proliferation is a new and very serious threat and not just to
the military,'' Shalikashvili said. ``This country needs to
understand that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
... is a threat to the whole country in peacetime, not just in
wartime. I'm very concerned the country is not yet well organized
to deal with a chemical or biological terrorist attack.''

EVENTUALLY, `BLADE' LOSES ITS EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BLADE 
Directed by: Stephen Norrington 
Screenplay by: David S. Goyer 
Starring: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe
Wright, Donal Logue, Udo Kier, Traci Lords, Arly Jover 
Running time: 120 minutes 
Rated: R (strong, pervasive vampire violence and gore, language and
brief sexuality) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those vampires! They never say die, except to the likes of us,
so you can see why Wesley Snipes couldn't say no to the idea of
climbing into black neoprene armor, loading up on heavy-duty
weaponry, and blasting away in _ and as _ ``Blade.'' The gimmick is
that he's as strong as the vampires because there's a bit of
vampire in him, untimely ripped from his mother's womb after a
vampire tore her throat open. But the vampire Macduff is mostly
human, despite a need to ingest the odd vial of blood when thirsty.
And he's bent on revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's dark gothic world, inherited from the comic book
on which it's based, the powerful vampires have organized and are
on the verge of taking over the earth after buying time by bribing
human power brokers. But why, the ringleader asks, go on making
deals with your food? Played by Stephen Dorff in black duds and a
pond scum look, he suggests Kiefer Sutherland's rancid kid brother,
a downtown entrepreneur in whose after-hours club the sprinkler
systems rain blood as the vampires sprout fangs and perforate their
victims to a techno beat.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Snipes as Blade, blasting and slicing and dicing away,
alone except for Kris Kristofferson's grizzled weapons-maker and
N'Bushe Wright's hematologist, who does her best between action
scenes to do something about Blade's blood problem. It's lively
enough as Snipes easily establishes himself as the American action
hero who comes closest to the incredible acrobatics of the Hong
Kong breed of supermen. There isn't an art that he isn't prepared
to be martial about as he wades into the vampire nation, swinging
away.
</P>
<P>
   But the more strenuous and elaborate the effects become, the
less scary and kicky the film becomes until we're unable to escape
the glum truth that what we're watching has turned into high-energy
claptrap. In fact, ``Blade'' stops seeming a film, and suggests
instead a large-screen video game, no longer remotely linked to any
pretense of being connected to something human. The ending more
than hints at a sequel, but long before it does, ``Blade'' does
what most sequels do as Snipes turns into his own action figure.

DRINK UP, KNUCKLEHEAD! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after Gillette Co. debuted its Mach3 three-bladed
razor, another Boston product was launched in late July with much
less marketing fanfare _ Three Stooges Beer.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, plans called for the beer launch to be supported by
an advertising campaign from Boston ad agency Holland Mark Martin
Edmund, but now ads may not run before October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see how well the beer does by word of mouth,'' said
Dewey Parsons, who, along with Mike Herbert, cofounded Panther
Brewing Co. of Westwood to market Three Stooges Beer.
</P>
<P>
   Ads will run ``when the beer starts to wane a tad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For boys who grew up with Larry, Moe, and Curly, the idea of
buying a six-pack of Three Stooges Beer is almost irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   For aesthetic reasons and display purposes alone, every fan is
sure to covet a Stooge longneck beer bottle. And who wouldn't want
to swagger into some saloon with two sidekicks and demand the
tattooed publican, ``Three Stooges, chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, plans are in the works for tap handles that would
emit such signature Stooge noises as ``Nyuk, nyuk, and nyuk'' and
``Woo, woo, woo,'' when a Stooge draft is poured.
</P>
<P>
   All this is very nice _ and a major news flash for the Stooge
aficionado _ but when it comes to the beer, will anyone actually
want to drink more than one?
</P>
<P>
   According to the brewing industry, the biggest consumers of beer
are men in their 20s. At first glance, it would seem that this key
demographic is far too young to have many fond memories of the
Stooges, a comedy team that tossed its first custard pie in 1923
and whose later film work, with its witty eyepokes and slapstick
repartee, perfectly captured a 10-year-old's beau ideal of what
male adulthood ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, 43, acknowledges that market research is not the forte
of Panther Brewing. (The company's name is inspired by a Stooge
episode that may represent a defining moment in the trio's comic
oeuvre.)
</P>
<P>
   What market research the first-time brewers did convinced them
that Stooges beer would be pretty much ``a guy thing,'' Parsons
said. ``Only 6 percent of women like the Stooges. The rest of them
think men who watch the Stooges are complete idiots.'' He paused.
``My wife is in that 94 percentile.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Herbert believed there was a strong overlap between beer
lovers and Stooge fans. And for years, he secretly harbored his
dream of a Stooges beer before broaching it to his pal.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons was reluctant at first. A food broker, he was thinking
of getting out that business and buying a car wash, but when
Herbert vehemently pleaded his case in a predawn phone call,
Parsons bid adieux to a prospective career in suds and turtle wax
and said hello to Three Stooges beer.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business was obtaining the costly Stooges
licensing rights, which are controlled by Bela Lugosi Jr., son of
the famous horror-movie star, Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks so much like his dad, it's like meeting with
Dracula,'' he said. ``You want to wear garlic to feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it had licensing rights, the Panther team chose a recipe
that could be made under contract at a Pennsylvania brewery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something mainstream, not a microbrewed beer,'' said
Parsons, who claims Panther has shipped about ``30 truck loads'' of
the product to liquor stores since late July.
</P>
<P>
   If the beer catches on, there are plans to make a Curly Light
and maybe a Shemp special reserve, Parsons said. (After the duress
of superstardom forced the original Curly to take a much deserved
early retirement, several substitutes, including his real-life
brother Shemp, were brought in to replace him.)
</P>
<P>
   A pale ale to honor Curly Joe DeRita, another Stooge
replacement, seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans hear Joe DeRita and they say, `Forget about it,' '' says
Parsons, adding, ``We're trying to create a brand here.''
</P>

<P>
   For years, Jordan's Furniture of Avon, Mass. has run ads that
parody ads made for other companies. No one had ever objected until
a recent complaint by Gap Inc., a Jordan's spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it responded to a Gap request, Jordan's stopped running
an ad that showed khaki-clad hoofers dancing around a couch to the
tune of ``Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's acknowledged that the ad was about to go off the air
anyway. Scheduled for a six-week flight, the ad began airing Fourth
of July weekend, said Jordan's spokeswoman. Would Jordan's have
scrapped the ad if the Gap had yapped earlier?
</P>
<P>
   Replied the spokeswoman, ``That's very hard to say. I would say,
yes. We don't create parodies to stir up hard feelings.''

IS BOSTON STILL BILL CLINTON'S CASH MACHINE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynics call Boston ``Clinton's ATM.'' No matter what kind of hot
water the president douses himself in, donkey-loyal Hub Dems can be
relied on to show up at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser to cheer on
the president and pour a cool mil or two into Democratic coffers.
I've been a guest at two of these events, which inevitably take
place at the Park Plaza and quickly devolve into an unseemly
Bootlickers' Ball, as the Clintons' delightful friends from the
real estate and nursing home industries vie for face time with the
First Couple.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I attended, Hillary was there, and her husband
addressed the plutocrats via video feed from the White House. Fancy
that.
</P>
<P>
   How very unsurprising then, that the president and vice
president are scheduled to return to the Park Plaza Sept. 17 for
yet another shake of the Boston money tree. The occasion: the
biannual ``Unity Dinner,'' when the Democratic primary candidates
kiss and make up (Down Tom! Down Lois!) and vow to sally forth
against the Republican threat etc. etc. One might expect the ardor
of the Lincoln Bedroom crowd to have dimmed in recent weeks, so I
wasn't surprised when a friend of mine who's been invited said
``there's a big push on'' to fill up the tables.

Meet Paul Adao, literazzi
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My friend Joyce Maynard's decision to sell the story of her
nine-month affair 25 years ago with reclusive New Hampshire writer
J.D. Salinger has resuscitated more than just her own career. It
has also breathed new life into the bank account of stalkerazzi
photographer Paul Adao.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Adao and a partner snapped the first photographs
taken of Salinger since 1955. They camped out for six days in
Salinger's hometown of Cornish, N.H. and eventually took a picture
that ended up on the front page of the New York Post. It shows an
enraged Salinger approaching Adao's stakeout. ``I was inside the
car and he came over and started hitting me,'' Adao said, sounding
aggrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to him, the shot made literary history. Novelist Don
DeLillo has cited the picture as an inspiration for his 1991 novel,
``Mao II.'' ``When they took his picture he came at them,'' DeLillo
told The New York Times. ``His face is an emblem of shock and rage.
It's a frightening photograph.'' Adao himself is not exactly
bookish. He once told an interviewer that ``Catcher in the Rye''
``is supposed to be a great book. ... I found it kind of boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Adao returned to the Salinger beat. After a
trip to Cornish, he sold a full-page Salinger shot to Vanity Fair,
and Newsweek bought a second image. When I reached him by telephone
in Hyannis, (why do I think he was headed for the Vineyard?) Adao
turned press-shy. ``You're irritating me,'' he complained, cutting
short our brief chat.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being a footnote to literary history, Adao's name
endures in the annals of law. Earlier this summer, he ``won'' a $1
settlement _ the lowest amount permitted by law _ from actor Woody
Harrelson. Three years previously, Adao alleged, Harrelson
assaulted him and a colleague while they were taking pictures of
the actors' young children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
We can top that
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, I conceded to Dan Kaercher, the editor of
Midwest Living magazine, that New England has nothing so cool as
the life-size, refrigerated butter cow displayed at the Iowa State
Fair. But several readers wrote in to correct me. ``Two years ago
at The Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in West Springfield, there
was a butter cow (full size),'' according to Scott Poitras, ``and
last year there &UR;  &LR; was a butter goat and turkey, along with a few
other butter animals.'' This year's Big E runs for three weeks
starting Sept. 18; Poitras says ``the butter carving will be of a
team of Clydesdale Draft Horses pulling a milk wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, we learn that Len Libby Candies of Scarborough,
Maine, has a 1,700-pound, life-size, chocolate moose on display in
its store. Designed by candymaker Fernand Hemond with the help of a
sculptor from the Maine College of Art, ``Lenny'' is standing in a
pond of white chocolate. How very Midwestern.

CLINTON'S ONLY OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can there be any moral authority left in President Clinton? It
is nearly impossible to take him seriously after he admitted lying
about his sexual relations with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Take problems confronting our youth. Last year, Clinton said,
``We still have some pretty big problems in our society. None
stands in our way of achieving our goals for America more than the
epidemic of teen pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd pay to see this guy tell teenagers now about abstinence. Or
safe sex. Is anyone placing bets that Clinton used condoms with
Lewinsky? On second thought, Kenneth Starr might consider that
tampering with the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to cease with the rationalizations. It is time to
stop enabling this man before he disables the Democratic Party and
gives the right wing a clear path to the presidency in 2000.The
nation can no longer ignore Clinton, just because we are not at war
and most Americans have a car in the garage, a chicken in the pot,
and a cellular phone in the ear. Nor can it fall for the assertion
by Clinton defenders that his lying pales next to Richard Nixon's
attempt to corrupt democracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   We have reached the point where Pinocchio, by any angle, has a
long nose. My wife told me Clinton's sex drive probably would not
matter as much if all his targets were consenting, mature women,
independent of his office. Then it really would be between Bill and
Hillary. Clinton could claim that he was behaving no more badly
than John F. Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's second brain led him down a path no one should
accept. In his speech to the nation Monday night, he said, in an
amazingly unapologetic way, ``Even presidents have private lives.
It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the
prying into private lives and get on with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing private about Clinton and Lewinsky. Both held
jobs paid for by the taxpayer. He was elected and she was hired to
serve the public, not each other, on the public's time and dime.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important, Clinton should not be allowed to walk away
from this matter with his arrogant declaration that ``our country
has been distracted by this matter for too long.'' His acts are a
fireable offense at many universities and workplaces.Clinton is
twice Lewinsky's age and held infinite power over her, so much
power that Lewinsky's intentions in the affair are irrelevant
compared to her vulnerability. It was incumbent on the president to
say to himself, don't ask, don't touch.
</P>
<P>
   He went ahead with a woman barely older than his college
daughter. Lying to his own daughter was the icing on his hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Clinton who puritanically drove, by his count,
three million women off welfare. He demanded a morality from single
moms that he was not willing to strive for himself, despite a life
where he never has to cook a meal or clean a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton said welfare reform ``ended the old welfare
system when we said to those on welfare, responsibility is not an
option. It must be a way of life.'' Clinton's way of life, his
endless rhythm of dalliance, denial, and forced divulgence have
cost him incalculable energy that should have gone to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco settlement, like health care reform in Clinton's
first term, has died. Clinton's race dialogue has virtually
disappeared. The economy may be booming for some, but too many
public schools are wastelands, health care and Medicare remain
dangersously unresolved and too many Americans are forced to play
musical jobs as corporations send jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   All of those issues require a president who can rally enough
popular support to make Congress sweat. But the only perspiration
is coming from the Democrats, steaming from betrayal. Any chance to
push an agenda for Americans who have the least, slim to begin with
against the now snickering Republican majorities in Congress, are
now gone.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why we should have to live with such a
weakened leader. There is not a parent who would not demand the
head of a college president who hits on their daughter. There is
not a feminist organization that would stand still if the next
Supreme Court nominee had this track record. There is not a
newsroom that would not be thrown into turmoil if a 50ish managing
editor went down the hall to have sex with a summer intern.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no America that tolerates a president who lets
his ``private life'' defile the public trust. In talking about teen
pregnancy, Clinton has said it is wrong unless ``you are ready to
take on the responsibilities of parenthood.'' He said, ``It's
something you pay for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that Clinton never intended to hold himself
responsible for practicing what he preached, whether as a lying
parent or lying president obsessed with sex on public time and with
his employees. For that, it is time for him to pay with his
presidency. When Bill Clinton returns to Washington from Martha's
Vineyard, it should be for only one reason.He should return to
resign.

PRICEY ISLAND COURSE LURES THE JET-SET ELITE

<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ At the new Nantucket Golf Club, there are no
tee times.
</P>
<P>
   Members and their guests, some of the richest and most powerful
people in the nation, just show up and tee off whenever they want,
as Microsoft's Bill Gates, General Electric's Jack Welch, and
Republic Industries' Wayne Huizenga did the other day.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a club where privacy is valued as much as a hole in
one, officials declined comment on the trio's power golf outing.
But the club's determination to keep a low profile hasn't stopped
island tongues from wagging about the spectacular new course
designed by Rees Jones that has helped transform golf into a
jet-set activity.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the club's 303 members don't even have a
home on the island where they can hang their hat. They just fly in
on their private jets, play golf, and fly out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's causing quite a bit of additional traffic,'' said Fred
Jaeger, manager of the Nantucket Airport, one of the busiest in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Green, whose Edwards, Colo., company oversaw the
development of the Nantucket Golf Club and who is its the titular
president, of the club, said a second private golf course was
desperately needed on the island because the wait to get into the
Sankaty Head Golf Club was 40 years. There are also two nine-hole
public courses on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who does not own a home on Nantucket, refused to discuss
how much it cost to build the course or how much it costs to become
a member. ``It's a lot of money,'' is all he would say.
</P>
<P>
   According to records on file with the Registry of Deeds, the
250-acre property was purchased in 1995 for $8.25 million, which
may have been a bargain given today's hot real estate market.
Island sources estimate another $15 million was spent designing and
building the par-72, treeless course, erecting the elegant but
hardly ostentatious clubhouse and adjacent cottages for members and
guests, and complying with environmental agreements needed to gain
clearance for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The club, which will be open only six months this year, may be
one of the most expensive in the country to join. Sources say the
cost of membership has risen from $200,000 for early initiates to
$300,000 for the last to join. On top of the membership fee, most
of which sources say is reimbursable if the member quits, annual
dues run about $6,500.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Sankaty Head Golf Club charges $15,000 for a
full family membership and $1,500 in annual dues. About 50 of
Sankaty Head's members also belong to the Nantucket Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known out there as being one of the most expensive golf
courses around,'' said Thomas Bresette, the Nantucket Golf Club's
clubhouse manager. ``But that hasn't stopped people from joining.''
</P>
<P>
   The membership list is closely guarded, but it includes Dirk
Ziff, No. 127 on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans; John
Loose of Corning Inc.; Arie Kopelman of Chanel Inc., and most
likely Welch and Huizenga, both of whom have houses on the island.
What members get for all their money is a purist's golf experience.
There are no tennis courts and no swimming pool. Other than a nice
restaurant and grill, there's nothing to distract from the golf.
</P>
<P>
   Carts are not allowed on the course unless a member is unable to
walk. Everybody takes caddies, who get paid $40 for each bag they
carry. Most of the caddies are island residents, trained by eight
professional caddies imported from the South and put up at a 42-bed
employee lodge at the club.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse is set well back from Milestone Road, on the
southern side of the island. There's no sign for the club along the
road, in keeping with its low profile. Visitors drive up a road
until they come to a guard who keeps unwanted visitors out.
</P>
<P>
   The course itself is links-style, meaning it rolls with the
existing landscape. And it is as quiet as the nearby moors and
almost as desolate. All golfers hear is the wind whistling through
the tall brown grass that forms the rough along the lush green
fairways. Kevin Walker, the club's golf pro, said the 7,081-yard
course is never boring because it is constantly changing with the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's a tournament-caliber golf course, but I don't
think that's on the agenda,'' Walker said. ``If you don't need to
do it, why would you?''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers aren't the only ones raving about the course, which
opened in April. Even though its construction meant bulldozing one
of the most pristine areas of the island, home to several
endangered plants and animals, environmentalists generally praise
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does a fabulous job of fitting into that
landscape,'' said James Lentowski, executive secretary of the
Nantucket Conservation Foundation. ``On a continuum of choices,
this certainly is a choice closer to the most desirable rather than
the least desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's willingness to spend money to solve environmental
problems also didn't hurt. In an agreement negotiated with the
Massachusetts Fish and Wildlife Department, the club agreed to
locate and transplant two species of rare plants _ the bushy
rockrose and the St. Andrew's cross _ and to try to propagate them
at a nursery on site. Charlie Passios, the golf course manager,
said the propagation efforts are going well so far.
</P>
<P>
   The club also agreed to spend about $800,000 to fund a 50-year
effort to restore sandplain grasslands and coastal heathlands on
1,110 acres of land owned by the Nantucket Conservation Foundation
and the Massachusetts Audubon Society. The effort, already begun
with clear-cutting of scrub oak in the middle moors section of the
island, is expected to help bring back the rare northern harrier, a
bird of prey often known as the marsh hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Bresette said all the buzz about the club is well deserved.
``When you get all the rumors about the prices here, people want to
come out and see what it's all about,'' he said. ``But what's
amazing is that it lives up to their expectations. There's not too
many places that do that.''

THE RAT PACK 
Starring: Ray Liotta, Don Cheadle, Joe Mantegna, Angus Macfadyen,
Dan O'Herlihy 
Directed by: Rob Cohen 
On: HBO 
Time: Saturday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA

<P>
   No matter how expertly the makeup people round his forehead, Ray
Liotta is Ray Liotta, and not Frank Sinatra. When he arches his
ferocious eyebrows and throws a fit because Jack Kennedy has
rejected him, or when he gets in a passionate spat with a drunken
Ava Gardner, or when he trades ethnic jabs with fellow Rat Packers
Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, he is strangely, stubbornly,
ultimately, and forever, Ray Liotta.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the barriers it's hard to get over while watching
``The Rat Pack,'' a new HBO movie premiering tomorrow night at 9.
It's consistently a strain to make the leap of imagination that is
all-important when watching a traditional biopic, to let the
present subside into the legendary past _ in this case the boozy
Las Vegas nightclub scene of the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Basically, the ``Rat Pack'' actors adopt a few obvious trademarks
of their famous characters _ Don Cheadle adds the word ``baby'' to
the end of every sentence to simulate Sammy Davis Jr., Joe Mantegna
has Dean Martin's cocktail manner down pat, Dan O'Herlihy spews
that very-easy-to-sound-ridiculous Kennedy accent _ leaving none of
them quite convincingly transformed. Nor do they aim for cartoon
versions, except, perhaps, Barbara Niven's Marilyn Monroe and
Zeljko Ivanek's Bobby Kennedy, whose accent gradually evolves into
some kind of strange Southern scat.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Cohen and writer Kario Salem, the screenwriter of
HBO's superior ``Don King: Only in America,'' focus their Rat Pack
story on the years when Sinatra courted the friendship of
presidential hopeful John F. Kennedy. Sinatra procures women for
Kennedy, who is rumored to fancy more than one at a time, and he
also procures votes for the young candidate from Massachusetts,
with a little help from mobster friends like Sam ``Momo'' Giancana.
After the election, much to Sinatra's dismay, Kennedy distances
himself from the Chairman of the Board precisely because of those
mob connections. Meanwhile, Davis falls in love with Swedish
actress May Britt, and the public protests that greet their
engagement cause him to postpone his wedding until after the 1960
election.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the script plays like a jukebox of the
biggest hits of Rat Pack gossip. There's the scene with Marilyn
Monroe drooling over Kennedy while Joe DiMaggio gets uptight; the
scene of Sinatra and Gardner screaming at each other with love-hate
intensity; the saga of Peter Lawford's role as secret messenger;
Kennedy putting down J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI, asking ``Isn't he
getting his estrogen?'' While it's obvious why Sinatra's family
refused to give its blessing to ``The Rat Pack,'' with its bold
portrayal of the connections between the entertainer and the mafia,
still the movie is not really a tabloid treatment. It is clearly
fictionalized and heavily romanticized, pandering to our desire to
witness the condensed story of history without pretending to be
factual. If you blindly believed this movie, after all, you'd have
to think that entertainment meant nothing to Sinatra next to his
political power plays.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ``The Rat Pack'' is its lush period look, a
vivid nightscape of clubs and stages and restaurants and drinking
parties. One effective montage moves smoothly in and out of rooms
at the Sands Hotel, as Davis, Sinatra, Kennedy, and Lawford have
sex with women in character-revealing ways (Lawford, for instance,
watching himself in the mirror). Another imaginative sequence has
Davis fantasizing about performing ``I've Got You Under My Skin''
before an angry mob of cross-burners. It's one of the only scenes
that pushes a little beyond our cliched understanding of these men.

`BABY' EMOTIONS ARE PITCH PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BABY DANCE 
Starring: Laura Dern, Stockard Channing, Richard Lineback, Peter
Riegert 
Written and directed by: Jane Anderson 
On: Showtime 
Time: Sunday night at 9 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may come to pass that Laura Dern will be one of the great
actresses. In movies like ``Rambling Rose,'' ``Wild at Heart,'' and
``Citizen Ruth,'' she has given performances that are utterly
seamless in their emotional reality. Like, say, Gena Rowlands in
``A Woman Under the Influence,'' she has acted with her heart and
her instinct, exposing deep levels of vulnerability without lapsing
into sloppiness or attention-getting. She has been especially good
playing intellectually limited women without leaving the impression
of condescension, or calculation.
</P>
<P>
   And she is the main reason _ though not the only reason _ to
watch ``The Baby Dance,'' a beautifully made cable movie that
premieres on Showtime Sunday night at 9. From the moment you see
Dern's Wanda LeFauve at a Bingo game with her mother, with her long
blond hair in a crummy perm, you already feel the authenticity
about her and the movie itself. Wanda is a poor mother of four who
decides to sell her forthcoming baby, to give it a better chance in
the world with a wealthy, childless couple. She loves her children
profoundly, but she and her husband, Al, live in a tiny,
stifflingly hot trailer in Shreeveport, La., while their kids have
to stay at her mother's slightly more spacious house. ``I gotta get
my tubes tied,'' she moans to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The dance of the title is between the LA couple who are eagerly
planning to buy the baby, Rachel and Richard Luckman, and Wanda and
Al. It's a beautifully choreographed series of forward moves, and
retreats, and sidesteps, as the couples need something from each
other, but feel mutual discomfort about their different
backgrounds. And because the script and the performances are so
fully persuasive, the dance is also between the viewer and the
movie, as our sympathies move from one character to another and
back again in a slow, complicated rhythm. In some scenes, it seems
as though Wanda and Al are doing a good thing by delivering their
baby from their trailer-park hell, which even has a barking dog at
its gate; in others, Rachel and Richard are like vultures as they
drop checks for $500, waiting impatiently to take home another
couple's infant.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing black and white about ``The Baby Dance,''
particularly at the very end, which I will not disclose. Wanda and
Al are clearly in love, but in one scene Al smacks Wanda and you
know it has happened many times before. ``He doesn't hit hard,''
says Wanda, justifying it to Rachel. ``It's all for show.'' One of
the virtues of the movie is that after this horrible moment it does
not become about Al's abuse, and indeed Richard Lineback's
performance as Al makes him a fully dimensional guy, an overgrown
child who feels both helpless and wily. In one series of scenes, Al
starts drinking, and you see the anxiety register on Wanda's face.
She knows liquor brings out his aggressive side. But the movie
avoids reducing itself to the alcoholism theme, as well, and the
drinking problem becomes just part of the tapestry of Al and
Wanda's life together. At certain moments _ particularly a lovely
scene in which his daughter silences a restaurant with her
beautiful singing _ Al looks like the model of a proud family man.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel is played by Stockard Channing as a realist who, after
nine miscarriages, is still brave enough to hope. She watches Wanda
with envy, and possessiveness, and she can't help but flinch when
she spies Wanda sneaking a smoke, or drinking coffee. She tries to
restrain herself from demanding that Wanda take better care, but
she fails and Wanda lets some of her suppressed anger leak out:
``Don't worry, I won't mess up your baby,'' she snaps. The scenes
between just Dern and Channing are pitch perfect, with the sort of
focus and physical acting usually found in the theater. In fact,
``The Baby Dance'' began as a play that ran both in Los Angeles and
off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jane Anderson, who wrote the play and the screenplay,
has given the Showtime production the sort of texture and detail
you'd expect from a big-screen movie. Rachel faces a whirlpool of
kids and dogs as she visits the trailer-park, where Wanda serves
her a cold-cut platter with white bread and American cheese.
Wanda's mother is a hairstylist who sports a very bad wig and works
on customers in her kitchen sink. The sign in front of her house
reads: ``Elegance by Doreen.'' These kinds of incidental touches _
showing Richard rearranging the cheap motel room where he and
Rachel wait for Wanda to give birth, or Al listening to his
father's only recording _ nicely embellish the solid drama that the
actors and the script have created. The premise of ``The Baby
Dance'' makes it sound like one of those network made-for-TV issue
movies that's just this side of ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' But
without a lot of self-congratulation, it reaches the sort of
emotional depths that most network movies avoid.

 Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Ingvar Kamprad, the founder and owner of the innovative
Ikea assemble-it-yourself furniture chain in 30 countries, started
from nothing to become one of the world's wealthiest men.
</P>
<P>
   But the 72-year-old Swedish-born billionaire has just added a
chapter to the literature of rags-to-riches by admitting in a new
biography that during the years he built his commercial empire, he
was usually in an alcoholic daze.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, he drank so heavily that he had to enter
a sanitarium to be ``dried out'' every four months or so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His condition apparently did nothing to hinder Ikea's growth,
one of the great retail success stories of our time. Yet Kamprad
was wholly in charge, all decisions emanating from him. His
associates either failed to detect his woozy state or kept quiet.
The bankers whom he borrowed money from in the early days also seem
to have been in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if he had been an employee instead of the boss, he
would soon have been out of a job. However, not only was he the
head of the company, he wholly owned it, as he does to this day,
with no shareholders looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   This strikes me as a fabulous tale that raises some intriguing
questions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, would he have made an even greater success if he
had been sober? This is hardly likely, given that it is difficult
to see how Ikea could be bigger or more profitable than it has
turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
   But on the reverse side, the Kamprad confession poses the
question of whether it really matters much who is running the shop
if the idea behind it hits the right note with the buying public.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I've wondered for years whether big executives
who are paid six- or seven-figure salaries plus huge stock options
and bonuses for what are often vaguely defined responsibilities are
really worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   A debate over this question has gone on for a long time in
America where executive remuneration is on average the world's
highest. Now the same discussion has shifted across the Atlantic.
Chief executives in Europe receive two or three times as much as
they did a decade ago, a trend accentuated by the privatization of
many previously state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics point out that company results frequently don't
justify the big increases. Many enterprises are doing no better
than they did under modestly paid chief executives. Some are doing
distinctly worse. But the pay hikes keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of being accused of excessive cynicism, I would
suggest that some of these handsomely paid but under-achieving
executives might do worse than try the Kamprad method, which seems
to have consisted of taking several stiff drinks before, during and
after a day's hard work. Admittedly, not everyone could manage, but
those who could might prove to be winners.

`WONDERLAND' HAS TASTY TWIST OF WRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
NEXT STOP WONDERLAND 
Directed by: Brad Anderson 
Screenplay by: Anderson, Lyn Vaus 
Starring: Hope Davis, Alan Gelfant, Victor Argo, Jon Benjamin, Cara
Buono, Phil Hoffman, Roger Rees, Sam Seder, Robert Stanton, Holland
Taylor, Callie Thorne, Jose Zuniga, Paul Wagner, Robert Klein 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most romantic comedies turn too sugary too soon. There's a
bracing against-the-grain quality to Brad Anderson's ``Next Stop
Wonderland'' that sets it apart from most of the formulas to which
the genre usually succumbs. Maybe it's just the way the film so
easily aligns with the bred-in-the-bone Boston conviction that
nothing should come easily. Struggle is an integral part of the
Boston ethos and it's embodied with wry ease by Hope Davis's glum
nurse, Erin, and Alan Gelfant's plumber, Alan, who wants to become
a marine biologist.
</P>
<P>
   They don't meet until the final reel, and you can understand why
it might take a while. Apart from the fact that each is sloshing
around in joylessness, Alan is lumbered with a father pressuring
him to take over the family plumbing business. All Alan asks is to
be hired by the Aquarium as a biologist while trying not to be
depressed by the fact that the Aquarium values him more for his
plumbing skills than his pescatorial ones. He's also kept busy
dodging demands for pay back by the loan shark to whom his gambling
addict father is indebted. And he's also dodging a nymphet chasing
him through night school.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is an actress poised on the brink of a big career
breakthrough, and while this film doesn't quite supply it, it
nevertheless gives her the chance to create an original character,
and a likable one, if you can get past Erin's initially off-putting
rejection of anything that comes at her. She's usually right to be
sharp-tongued, starting when her mother takes it upon herself to
insert a personals ad on Erin's behalf that brings Erin the
attentions of a string of full-of-themselves jerks. Not that she
suffers them gladly, or in silence. She's witty enough and just
malicious enough to shoot them down amusingly.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Davis's Erin is a delightfully unplacating character,
uninterested in charm or self-marketing. Erin's is a genuinely
melancholy temperament, she convinces us, reinforced by the
departure of her longtime political activist live-in lover and the
death of her surgeon father. A character of palpable presence whose
absence is felt, the father is a gifted and sensitive man who
dedicated a volume of his poems to his adoring daughter. Davis
convinces us she's very much her father's daughter, not easy, but
worth sticking with.
</P>
<P>
   She's got heart, but doesn't make it readily accessible,
especially since she dropped out of Harvard after a promising med
school start and snatches solace by easing the pain of others as a
nurse. What she and Gelfant have in common is a stubborn integrity.
They don't mind being thought of as unruly, and are true to
themselves as they tool around Boston _ she caught in an undertow
of sadness, he trying to conceal his desperation to blast free of
his working-class baggage and move to the South End, where Erin
lives in dispirited ennui. The film uses other Boston-area locales,
most notably the Burren in Somerville. Part of the fun lies in
spotting local notables, ranging from Jeremy Geidt to Jimmy Tingle,
in cameos.
</P>
<P>
   There are rough edges, loose ends, bits of narrative drift, and
an ending that seems tacked-on, not of a piece with what went
before. But the gritty and deliberately roughhewn ``Next Stop
Wonderland'' achieves an anti-slickness that's refreshing and
believable. If I hadn't read the program notes afterward, I would
never have learned that Anderson intended to make a film that took
its cue from the wistful and melancholy Brazilian music called
saudade. Certainly this accounts for the evocative soundtrack on
grounds deeper than the fact that one of Erin's false romantic
starts is with a Brazilian musicolgist. ``Next Stop Wonderland''
entertains with rueful humor and an undertow of bluesy yearning.

SALSA, WINNING STARS PUT MUSIC IN `DANCE WITH ME'

DANCE WITH ME 
Directed by: Randa Haines 
Screenplay by: Daryl Matthews 
Starring: Vanessa Williams, Chayanne, Kris Kristofferson, Jane
Krakowski, Beth Grant, Harry Groener, William Marquez, Scott
Paetty, Joan Plowright, Rick Valenzuela 
Running time: 126 minutes 
Rated: PG (mild language and sensuality) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dance With Me'' is a tangy screenful of salsa that makes a
strong bid to mainstream its Latin dance movements into the kind of
popularity enjoyed by ``Flashdance'' and ``Strictly Ballroom.''
Like those earlier films, it doesn't let a clunky script detract
from the winning charm of the leads, Vanessa Williams and Puerto
Rican pop star Chayanne. She's sultry, and he's sexy in a boyishly
engaging way that should do a lot for his crossover potential as
the film overrides its lumps by convincing us that it really goes
for dance.
</P>
<P>
   There's more soap opera and less dance than you hope for, at
least in the early stages, as ``Dance With Me'' laboriously sets up
its romance. It begins inauspiciously as Chayanne's character,
Rafael Infante, arriving in Houston from his native Havana
following the death of his mother, is given a job by the man who
used to be a dance instructor on a cruise ship where his mother
sang. What Kris Kristofferson's tired proprietor of a downmarket
dance studio doesn't know, and what Rafael is shy about telling
him, is that he is Rafael's father.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael and Ruby, the instructor played by Williams, are mutually
attracted. But she's reluctant to be deflected from her goal of
reentering professional competition after a six-year timeout to
mother the son she had by her ex-partner; he, meanwhile, is ready
to jump-start both their careers, unaware that he's a father. Her
mixed feelings remain mixed after Rafael takes her to a salsa club
and shows her what a sinuous sizzler he can be on the dance floor.
Ruby looks down her nose at salsa, which she considers too
down-home amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ruby is about to enter a professional competition, and
Rafael isn't professional, he teams up with a promising amateur,
Jane Krakowski's lyrical ballet-oriented newcomer. This means each
of the predestined lovers enters the competition in different
divisions, with different partners, which whets the curiosity as to
how they're going to be brought together. There's not a lot of
suspense in terms of who winds up with whom, or even whether Rafael
can bond with Kristofferson's crusty and outwardly warm but
essentially standoffish father.
</P>
<P>
   The script by Daryl Matthews doesn't exactly move like the wind.
But the dancing, once it finally gets going, does. Williams
convinves us that although she's dancing with one man, she'd rather
be dancing with another. Chayanne wins us over with his
graciousness _ and with Rafael's gratitude at encountering
something resembling the communal spirit he left behind in Cuba
when he's ushered into the family celebration of a Cuban auto
repairman he visits.
</P>
<P>
   The film is most at home on the dance floor, though. While it
serves up a juicy array of Latin steps, it also includes swing
dancing and even gets away with a disco sequence. It avoids the
usual pall of Hollywood cliches when it comes to portraying Latin
cultures. Chayanne adds humor in a beguiling genuflection to Gene
Kelly's ``Singin' in the Rain'' puddle solo when he dances through
a grassy stretch of geysering lawn sprinklers. Even in the dance
movie genre, where scripts invariably are schematic and
predictable, Matthews's is singularly maladroit. But ``Dance With
Me'' loves dance and loves its leads, and Randa Haines's fluid
camera embraces them with winning advocacy.

DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Written by: Michael Traeger, Mike White  &QL; 
Directed by: Alan Cohn &QL; 
Starring: Tom Everett Scott, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Poppy
Montogomery, Lochlyn Munro, Randy Pearlstein, Corey Page &QL; 
Running time: 96 minutes &QL; 
Rated: R (adult language, crude sexual humor, drug use) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There are three essential myths of college life:
</P>
<P>
   Cafeteria food is indistinguishable from your mom's home
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Diet pills are an acceptable study aid during finals week.
</P>
<P>
   You will automatically receive a 4.0 if your roommate commits
suicide during the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   The latter of this misinformation troika has caused countless
students to gaze eerily upon their roommates with images of
Seconals and straight A's dancing in the their heads. It is also
the premise of ``Dead Man on Campus,'' a lame college comedy about
two flunking buddies who decide to drive a chronically unstable
roommate to off himself. There are freshman biology lectures with
more laughs than this one.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Everett Scott, an actor who becomes less likable with each
film role (he last appeared in the abysmal, ``American Werewolf in
Paris''), is Josh, a pre-med student from Indiana. His success at
fictional Daleman College seems guaranteed until he meets his
suitemate, Cooper (an occasionally charming Mark-Paul Gosselaar
from that endless ``Saved by the Bell'' series.) The son of a
wealthy toilet manufacturer, Cooper is one of those kids who has
always ridden Daddy's money and influence to get what he wants _
and what he wants to do most is party. Babes, booze, and bongs are
the sum of Cooper's college experience. Eventually, Josh gets
sucked into Cooper's world, and soon finds himself failing
everything, and in danger of losing his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Then the two discover an obscure rule in their school's charter
which will award straight A's to the grief-stricken survivor of a
suicidal roommate. So, instead of hitting the books to bring up
those lousy grades, Josh and Cooper start hanging around the
school's mental health center to nab some stooge likely to commit
suicide, especially if they can help push him over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   There's Cliff (played with a take-no-prisoners verve by Lochlyn
Munro), a dangerously psychotic frat boy, who may not kill himself,
but is likely to wipe out everyone around him; there's Buckley
(Randy Pearlstein), a hyper-paranoid conspiracy theorist convinced
that Bill Gates is trying to take over the world (What's so wacko
about that?); and lest we forget, Matt (Corey Page), a bitter,
bile-spewing Brit who has clearly listened to way too much Joy
Division.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they fill their room with instruments of
self-destruction: knives, a noose, pills, pills, and more pills.
</P>
<P>
   Are you laughing yet?
</P>
<P>
   In the right hands, this film could have been as sharp as
``Heathers,'' Michael Lehmann's jet-black comedy about high school
cliques and pecking orders. If wicked humor could be found in
murdering obnoxious classmates, then certainly there should have
been something funny, in an equally sinister premise. But Michael
Traeger's script isn't that smart or ambitious, and the film flunks
miserably.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this little moldy slab of cheese comes courtesy of
MTV Productions, the same folks responsible for the roach-infested
(literally and figuratively speaking) ``Joe's Apartment,'' a very
bad movie very few people saw.
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate should await ``Dead Man on Campus.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Ingvar Kamprad, the founder and owner of the innovative
Ikea assemble-it-yourself furniture chain in 30 countries, started
from nothing to become one of the world's wealthiest men.
</P>
<P>
   But the 72-year-old Swedish-born billionaire has just added a
chapter to the literature of rags-to-riches by admitting in a new
biography that during the years he built his commercial empire, he
was usually in an alcoholic daze.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, he drank so heavily that he had to enter
a sanitorium to be ``dried out'' every four months or so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His condition apparently did nothing to hinder Ikea's growth,
one of the great retail success stories of our time. Yet Kamprad
was wholly in charge, all decisions emanating from him. His
associates either failed to detect his woozy state or kept quiet.
The bankers whom he borrowed money from in the early days also seem
to have been in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if he had been an employee instead of the boss, he
would soon have been out of a job. However, not only was he the
head of the company, he wholly owned it, as he does to this day,
with no shareholders looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   This strikes me as a fabulous tale that raises some intriguing
questions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, would he have made an even greater success if he
had been sober? This is hardly likely, given that it is difficult
to see how Ikea could be bigger or more profitable than it has
turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
   But on the reverse side, the Kamprad confession poses the
question of whether it really matters much who is running the shop
if the idea behind it hits the right note with the buying public.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I've wondered for years whether big executives
who are paid six- or seven-figure salaries plus huge stock options
and bonuses for what are often vaguely defined responsibilities are
really worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   A debate over this question has gone on for a long time in
America where executive remuneration is on average the world's
highest. Now the same discussion has shifted across the Atlantic.
Chief executives in Europe receive two or three times as much as
they did a decade ago, a trend accentuated by the privatization of
many previously state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics point out that company results frequently don't
justify the big increases. Many enterprises are doing no better
than they did under modestly paid chief executives. Some are doing
distinctly worse. But the pay hikes keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of being accused of excessive cynicism, I would
suggest that some of these handsomely paid but under-achieving
executives might do worse than try the Kamprad method, which seems
to have consisted of taking several stiff drinks before, during and
after a day's hard work. Admittedly, not everyone could manage, but
those who could might prove to be winners.

BEAUTY, HIGH-MINDEDNESS DON'T HEAL `REGENERATION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
REGENERATION 
Directed by: Gillies MacKinnon 
Screenplay by: Allan Scott (novel: Pat Barker) 
Starring: Jonathan Pryce, James Wilby, Jonny Lee Miller, Stuart
Bunce, Tanya Allen, David Hayman, Dougray Scott, John Neville 
Running time: 113 minutes 
Rated: Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Regeneration'' is a high-minded and luxuriantly brooding but
ultimately inert study of the clash between idealism and expediency
in an upper-class World War I rehab facility. Craiglockhart
Hospital, a requisitioned Scottish castle, is bathed in an underlit
decorousness as the film rides an actual historical circumstance _
the meeting there of poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen in
1917. The upper-class Sassoon, played with just the right edge
toff-like entitlement by James Wilby, is a problem patient. He was
stashed away, we soon learn, in an effort by the government to
discredit his impassioned anti-war writings.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that the poet's attack upon the shift of the
war from defense to aggression is the product of shell shock. The
catch is that if he is judged sane he could be tried for treason.
To his credit, Wilby convinces us of Sassoon's essential
worldliness and romantic heedlessness. Go ahead and persecute me,
he says in effect to his nominal superiors. Either way, I'm your
problem. Wilby's air of familiarity with the ways of power is just
palpable enough, moreover, to convince us that he just might be
attempting a daring power gamble.
</P>
<P>
   He's aided by two things _ a respected army psychiatrist is
sympathetic to him, and a young unpublished poet finds in him a
friend and mentor. Owen, the poet from Shropshire whose poetry was
published posthumously after his death in the war and later set to
music by Benjamin Britten in his ``War Requiem,'' is played with
frayed-nerve hesitations by Stuart Bunce. Poet and writer Robert
Graves, played by Dougray Scott, is also seen, but only fleetingly.
Perhaps to avoid the implication that this was a celebrity war, the
film allots equal screen time to Jonny Lee Miller's earnest
working-class bloke, traumatized into muteness.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the ethical dilemmas embodied by his patients
come close to unhinging Jonathan Pryce's high-minded psychiatrist,
William Rivers. After he visits a sadistic colleague who in effect
tortures the wounded into declaring that they're ready to return to
combat, he becomes shell shocked, too, although nowhere near a shot
fired in anger. The battlefield sequences only punctuate what
should be but isn't often enough the tension between the walking
wounded and the officers who, ironically, become their enemy no
less than the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   As the English officer class and politicians seem intent on
confirming the merit of Sassoon's arguments, Sassoon, meanwhile,
befriends Owen. He encourages the latter's writing, advising him to
turn from ideals of beauty to the horrifying realities of war they
both experienced and for which Sasoon had been decorated. Without
ever betraying any sense of awareness that Sassoon was one of those
charmed souls who could walk through fire and remain unscathed (he
in fact lived until 1967), Wilby justifies the poet's arrogant air
by underpinning it with believable moral passion.
</P>
<P>
   Miller brings sensitivity to a character who seems a cardboard
cutout, despite a sympathetic romance with a local munitions worker
played by Tanya Allen. Pryce is always interesting to watch, even
if his character _ Rivers, too, really lived _ seems needlessly
muted. But then the whole film seems rather more muted than you
expect, given its weight and resonance. The film's title, by the
way, refers to one medical researcher's goal of regenerating nerve
tissue. But the film remains a beautifully crafted, lugubrious
reminder that literacy, intelligence, and compassion aren't enough
to galvanize a film.

HOMEGROWN COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over Shania, LeAnn, and Faith. There's a new woman topping
the country charts _ and she just happens to be a Yankee. She is Jo
Dee Messina, who is not yet known only by her first name, though
that day may come since she's had two No.1 hits this year.
</P>
<P>
   Messina's double-sided single _ with the playfully assertive
``I'm Alright'' and comic kiss-off song ``Bye Bye'' _ has been a
phenomenon resulting in both tunes cresting the charts in recent
months. Each time, Messina, who grew up in the Boston suburb of
Holliston, has been left in a happy daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like when you ring the bell at the circus,'' says
Messina, 27. ``When I first heard I had a No.1, I flipped out and
started screaming. The rest of my band was on the bus and when I
ran on the bus to tell them, they thought someone had been in an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   No accident here. Rather, Messina's latest radio hits _ coupled
with two Top 10 hits in 1996 with ``Heads Carolina, Tails
California'' and ``You're Not in Kansas Anymore'' _ follow a life
of hard work dating to the days she played defunct clubs such as
the Blue Star in Saugus, Saco's in Watertown, and the Adelphia in
Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   She was only in high school then (she left right after
graduation for Nashville) and the apex of her year was watching the
Country Music Association awards to ``check out the latest
hairstyles'' and see who won the Horizon award for rising star.
</P>
<P>
   So guess what? Messina is now nominated for that same Horizon
award, going up against Trace Adkins, Lee Ann Womack, the Dixie
Chicks, and Michael Peterson. She's also up for top music video for
``Bye Bye.'' The CMA awards will be broadcast nationally on Sept.
23 from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew this was what I wanted to do,'' Messina says of
her country dream. ``But I didn't picture all of this. Hey, you
might want to be a movie star, but you don't picture yourself
standing on a set with Steven Spielberg, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   When Messina first came to Nashville, she went to endless talent
contests and jam sessions, but struggled and watched her savings
sink so low that the electricity in her apartment was shut off.
Still, she ``sang every chance I could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Her big break came when she was at a party and went up to a Curb
Records executive and dared to say, ``What you all need over there
is a redhead.'' The exec thought about it, then called her for a
demo tape. The rest is a Yankee-goes-to-Nashville fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I said that to him,'' says Messina. ``The
minute I said it, I thought it was goofy. But I guess it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   She also fatefully befriended Tim McGraw, who is now a huge
Nashville star (and husband to Faith Hill). ``We were both poor and
scurrying around to get a record deal,'' notes Messina. ``I said,
`When you make it big, don't forget me.''' He didn't and has since
produced both of her albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is awesome. He's so creative _ and he knows what it's like
to be on both sides of the music. He knows the business, but he
also knows when to tell you that a song tempo is weird or something
like that, and you should change it. He's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina has learned well herself. For ``I'm Alright,'' a
hard-driving, middle-class anthem (key verse: ``I'm stuck in the
middle where money gets tight, but I guess I'm doing all right''),
Messina decided at the last minute that she wanted a dobro on the
track. ``So they called in a dobro player and it's on there,'' she
says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   As the daughter of a onetime football coach at Holliston High
School, Messina grew up as a tomboy and youngest of four children.
``I know how to throw a football,'' she says. She also saturated
herself in the music of her main influences _ Tammy Wynette, Reba
McEntire, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, and Janie Fricke.
</P>
<P>
   After initial success in Nashville two years ago with ``Heads
Carolina, Tails California'' and ``You're Not in Kansas Anymore,''
Messina went a long time without a follow-up hit _ and that proved
to be one of the best lessons of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Carolina' had hit, I had a jillion friends and my phone
was ringing off the hook,'' she says. ``But then in '97, my record
wasn't out and we weren't hot. And my phone wasn't ringing off the
hook. I'd call up and hear someone say, `Well, we're going to
so-and-so's No.1 party. See you later.' So I changed my phone
number and only my real friends call me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina writes only a few of her songs (and none of her hits so
far), but she has good taste in choosing material. Her two recent
No.1 hits are both written by rising songwriting star Phil Vassar,
a personal favorite. ``We've got three of his songs on hold for the
next album,'' she says. ``And we start working on the record in
September. We want to have it ready before long, so we can keep up
the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, her latest album, driven by the two hits, is still
cooking. The next single is likely to be ``Stand Beside Me,''
featuring an assertive message about a woman who breaks up with her
man, takes two jobs so she can make it on her own, and then when he
wants to come back, tells him no.
</P>
<P>
   The sentimental choice for next single, however, is ``Even God
Must Get the Blues,'' a ballad that touched the crowd when Messina
performed it at Great Woods during the WKLB-FM (99.5) Boston
Country Festival earlier this summer. It's a topical song about the
bad news found in daily newspapers, including a story about a
battered woman. ``The devil's been busy,'' she sings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an in-your-face song. I started doing it on stage after
the Oklahoma City bombings,'' she adds. ``We've talked about it as
a single, but I think it frightens the folks at the record label. I
don't think it will be a single any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, you can expect Messina to keep plugging away,
because that's her nature, again going back to her Holliston tomboy
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Are you going to sit back and relax now that
you've had some success?' No way. You fight to get into the game _
and you fight to stay in the game.''
</P>

LOOKING AT ARTISTS THROUGH THE EYES OF ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Because they depict members of the species about
which we hold infinite curiosity, portraits have always been an
alluring genre among the arts of representation, and portraits of
artists, the people who make the images, have exerted an especially
strong pull on those who follow the arts. There is something
fascinating about artists' portraits, whether made by the artists
themselves or by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Face of Art,'' at the Ansel Adams Center in San Francisco
through Oct. 18, might be the sleeper of the season. The show
includes more than 100 photographic images of primarily American
artists made from 1850 to 1950, and they document the radical
changes that occurred during that time in fashion, lifestyle and
art itself at the same time that they show how artists, both
well-known and unknown, looked.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs come from the collection of Susan Herzig and
Paul Hertzmann, private photography dealers who collect artists'
portraits for themselves. They state that their interest in
artists' portraits dates from their sale, in the early 1980s, of a
portrait of Ash Can School painter Robert Henri by pictorialist
photographer Gertrude Kasebier. Having let an extraordinary print
go, they vowed to hold onto every artist portrait that subsequently
came their way. To date, they have collected nearly 900 such
images.
</P>
<P>
   The show is nicely installed and organized. Most of the work is
made in a variety of standard processes such as daguerreotype or
albumen or silver prints, but a number of carte de visites _
calling cards bearing photographic images _ and stereo views give
the exhibition variety.
</P>
<P>
   The stereo views, once you've learned how to use the glasses
that give the images a sense of three-dimensionality, are a kick.
The picture of Thomas Moran, who specialized in painting the Grand
Canyon, sitting on the Canyon's edge in startling 3-D, for
instance, is an exhibition highlight.
</P>
<P>
   The show is neatly divided between photographs made in the 19th
and 20th centuries, and it allows you to trace the development of
the medium from that of a relatively unself-conscious tool to
capture likenesses to a vehicle of self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Herzig and Hertzmann write that they are particularly drawn
toward images of artists in their studios surrounded by their
paraphernalia and of images of painters who traveled West during
the age of exploration. They also went out of their way to collect
portraits of women artists.
</P>
<P>
   The prints of artists in their studios form a lively leitmotif
that runs through the exhibition. In the first grouping of artists
at work or pretending to be at work, there are images of Hudson
River School painter John Frederick Kensett in a painting-filled
interior, brush in hand; of academic sculptor Daniel Chester French
shot from above (by Jessie Tarbox Beals) in his sculpture-filled
studio; and of academic painter Elizabeth Nourse in her
objet-d'art-filled studio painting two children in Dutch costume.
</P>
<P>
   Especially noteworthy among them is the portrait by Ansel Adams
of Gottardo Piazzoni in his studio in front of the murals he was
creating for San Francisco's old Main Library. Adams portrayed
Piazzoni smocked and with head turned down in reflection, the very
image of the romantic artist. It is a shame that the Asian Art
Museum, in its legitimate desire for a better building to house its
collections, plans to destroy those murals, which are widely judged
to be Piazzoni's masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Also interesting are portraits of cowboy artists _ or cowboy
wannabes _ among them Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of the
presidential portraits on Mount Rushmore, and Charles Marion
Russell, the sculptor of cowboys in action. The image of Maynard
Dixon by his then-wife Dorothea Lange is particularly striking.
Shot in shadow, Dixon presents a dark, undifferentiated form
against the Western landscape, the easel and brushes in his hands
and his cowboy hat providing him with a distinctive profile.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most memorable images, however, are standard head
shots. The exhibition's title wall includes some seven artistic mug
shots ranging from a circa 1845 daguerreotype by Boston
portraitists Southworth &AMP; Hawes of painter George Peter Alexander
Healy to more recent pictures of mid-century artists Thomas Hart
Benton, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Paul Manship, Pavel Tchelitchew and
Yasuo Kuniyoshi, some of them endowed with the glamour of Hollywood
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Modernist aesthetics mirroring the work of the artists depicted
is evident in a portrait of Yves Tanguy by George Platt Lynes in
which a double-exposure shows the artists' head emerging from a
surrealist landscape of one of his own paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Two other works memorably capture in portraits of Paul Cadmus,
George Tooker and Jared French the campy light surrealism of their
work. In an amusing photo by Cadmus, Tooker, French and pal Monroe
Wheeler strike stilted homoerotic poses on the beach with a large
piece of driftwood. In a group portrait by Lynes, Cadmus, Tooker
and French are each captured at work, each in his own room,
receding in perspective as radical as the Italian Renaissance
painting that inspired them.

<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ At the new Nantucket Golf Club, there are no
tee times.
</P>
<P>
   Members and their guests, some of the richest and most powerful
people in the nation, just show up and tee off whenever they want,
as Microsoft's Bill Gates, General Electric's Jack Welch, and
Republic Industries' Wayne Huizenga did the other day.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a club where privacy is valued as much as a hole in
one, officials declined comment on the trio's power golf outing.
But the club's determination to keep a low profile hasn't stopped
island tongues from wagging about the spectacular new course
designed by Rees Jones that has helped transform golf into a
jet-set activity.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the club's 303 members don't even have a
home on the island where they can hang their hat. They just fly in
on their private jets, play golf, and fly out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's causing quite a bit of additional traffic,'' said Fred
Jaeger, manager of the Nantucket Airport, one of the busiest in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Green, whose Edwards, Colo., company oversaw the
development of the Nantucket Golf Club and who is its the titular
president, of the club, said a second private golf course was
desperately needed on the island because the wait to get into the
Sankaty Head Golf Club was 40 years. There are also two nine-hole
public courses on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who does not own a home on Nantucket, refused to discuss
how much it cost to build the course or how much it costs to become
a member. ``It's a lot of money,'' is all he would say.
</P>
<P>
   According to records on file with the Registry of Deeds, the
250-acre property was purchased in 1995 for $8.25 million, which
may have been a bargain given today's hot real estate market.
Island sources estimate another $15 million was spent designing and
building the par-72, treeless course, erecting the elegant but
hardly ostentatious clubhouse and adjacent cottages for members and
guests, and complying with environmental agreements needed to gain
clearance for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The club, which will be open only six months this year, may be
one of the most expensive in the country to join. Sources say the
cost of membership has risen from $200,000 for early initiates to
$300,000 for the last to join. On top of the membership fee, most
of which sources say is reimbursable if the member quits, annual
dues run about $6,500.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Sankaty Head Golf Club charges $15,000 for a
full family membership and $1,500 in annual dues. About 50 of
Sankaty Head's members also belong to the Nantucket Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known out there as being one of the most expensive golf
courses around,'' said Thomas Bresette, the Nantucket Golf Club's
clubhouse manager. ``But that hasn't stopped people from joining.''
</P>
<P>
   The membership list is closely guarded, but it includes Dirk
Ziff, No. 127 on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans; John
Loose of Corning Inc.; Arie Kopelman of Chanel Inc., and most
likely Welch and Huizenga, both of whom have houses on the island.
What members get for all their money is a purist's golf experience.
There are no tennis courts and no swimming pool. Other than a nice
restaurant and grill, there's nothing to distract from the golf.
</P>
<P>
   Carts are not allowed on the course unless a member is unable to
walk. Everybody takes caddies, who get paid $40 for each bag they
carry. Most of the caddies are island residents, trained by eight
professional caddies imported from the South and put up at a 42-bed
employee lodge at the club.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse is set well back from Milestone Road, on the
southern side of the island. There's no sign for the club along the
road, in keeping with its low profile. Visitors drive up a road
until they come to a guard who keeps unwanted visitors out.
</P>
<P>
   The course itself is links-style, meaning it rolls with the
existing landscape. And it is as quiet as the nearby moors and
almost as desolate. All golfers hear is the wind whistling through
the tall brown grass that forms the rough along the lush green
fairways. Kevin Walker, the club's golf pro, said the 7,081-yard
course is never boring because it is constantly changing with the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's a tournament-caliber golf course, but I don't
think that's on the agenda,'' Walker said. ``If you don't need to
do it, why would you?''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers aren't the only ones raving about the course, which
opened in April. Even though its construction meant bulldozing one
of the most pristine areas of the island, home to several
endangered plants and animals, environmentalists generally praise
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does a fabulous job of fitting into that
landscape,'' said James Lentowski, executive secretary of the
Nantucket Conservation Foundation. ``On a continuum of choices,
this certainly is a choice closer to the most desirable rather than
the least desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's willingness to spend money to solve environmental
problems also didn't hurt. In an agreement negotiated with the
Massachusetts Fish and Wildlife Department, the club agreed to
locate and transplant two species of rare plants _ the bushy
rockrose and the St. Andrew's cross _ and to try to propagate them
at a nursery on site. Charlie Passios, the golf course manager,
said the propagation efforts are going well so far.
</P>
<P>
   The club also agreed to spend about $800,000 to fund a 50-year
effort to restore sandplain grasslands and coastal heathlands on
1,110 acres of land owned by the Nantucket Conservation Foundation
and the Massachusetts Audubon Society. The effort, already begun
with clear-cutting of scrub oak in the middle moors section of the
island, is expected to help bring back the rare northern harrier, a
bird of prey often known as the marsh hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Bresette said all the buzz about the club is well deserved.
``When you get all the rumors about the prices here, people want to
come out and see what it's all about,'' he said. ``But what's
amazing is that it lives up to their expectations. There's not too
many places that do that.''

SMALL CONTRIBUTION HIKES NOW MEAN BIG GAINS LATER

 (For release Sunday, August 23, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am employed at a company which has recently expanded the
menu of investment options available in its 401(k) program. It now
offers these options: MainStay Institutional Multi-Asset, MainStay
Growth Equity Index, MainStay Indexed Bond, Janus Fund, Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock, Invesco Industrial Income, PBHG Emerging Growth,
PIMCo Mid-Cap Growth, T. Rowe Price International Equity, and
Warburg Pincus International Equity. My wife is a former employee
of the same company and has left her $19,000 401(k) balance there.
I have a balance of $32,000, to which I add $10,000 a year and plan
to increase this at a rate of 5 percent annually. We both now have
our investments evenly divided between Janus and Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock funds, both of which have served us well. With the
broader menu, we would like to diversify more to spread the risk,
although we have a fairly high tolerance for risk. Ideally, I would
like to retire at age 60, which means I have 27 years to go.
</P>
<P>
   P.N., Gloucester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree that more diversification would serve you well,
although you don't need to make drastic changes. I would continue
to hold Janus fund as your core position, retaining the full 50
percent commitment to that fund. Since Invesco Industrial Income
and MainStay Growth funds have largely the same makeup and mission
but a records that aren't as strong as Janus Fund's, I would cross
them off. I would also cross off the two MainStay fixed-income
funds, because you don't need any bonds at all at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Low-Priced Stock has a superior record to PBHG Emerging
Growth, so no need to make a move in that direction. But PimCo
Mid-Cap Growth fund has a fine record, and I'd add it to the list.
Of the two international stock funds, I'd give the nod to T. Rowe
Price International Stock, based on its superior record. As for
allocations, I suggest you simply divide the second half of the
portfolio evenly among Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, PIMCo Mid-Cap
Growth, and T. Rowe Price International Stock.
</P>
<P>
   Where should all of this get you? After a long calculation,
adjusted for a 5 percent increase in contributions for each of the
27 years, the answer came out at $2,622,122. To give you an idea
how important those small-but-regular increases in your
contributions will become, the initial calculation, which presumed
all 324 contributions at the current rate, came out at $1,935,043.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 52-year-old woman, and I have had a $40,000 rollover
IRA in a savings account for two years now. I am currently
attending school, but will be working full time in a year. I know I
am in a situation in which the word ``retirement'' will not be
used. So the money won't be needed for about 15 years. How do you
suggest I put this money to work for me? What do you think of
purchasing large-cap stocks? From what I've been reading, mutual
funds are not making as much money as the stock market. Also, how
do I access the IRA to purchase stocks, if that's your suggestion?
How would I set up a brokerage account? Would I fund a discount
broker or can I purchase them myself?
</P>
<P>
   P.T., Santa Ana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether you decide to go with a personal stock portfolio or
whether I can persuade you that mutual funds are the better route,
you'll need some entity _ either a brokerage firm or an agent
assigned by a mutual fund company _ to serve as the custodian for
the money _ thus retaining its status as an IRA. If you tried to
simply withdraw the money yourself, it would become a premature
withdrawal in the eyes of the IRS, and you would not only face
taxes on the amount in question, but early withdrawal penalties as
well. To make this transfer while retaining the account as an IRA,
make your choice of the target investment, tell them what you want
to do, and they will supply you with an application that includes a
form by which you authorize the new custodian to obtain the money
from your bank. Still with me? It's just red tape, but it's
important that it be done right.
</P>
<P>
   So the main question becomes where to put the money. I'm against
your idea of a portfolio of individual large-cap stocks, for two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that if you were to select six or eight stocks, you would
have very little diversification. Even if most of them did well,
unfavorable results with one or two of the issues could wreck the
overall portfolio average.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's the large-cap stocks that have been behind the
much-heralded stock market gains of the last few years, and to my
way of thinking they should be about played out at this point.
</P>
<P>
   If I were designing a long-term portfolio for a person in your
situation, I would use four different funds at the outset, and
eventually weed them down to three.
</P>
<P>
   I'll cite Vanguard funds in this selection, although many fund
families could be used to build a similar portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I would select the three stock funds that will become the
critical parts of the portfolio. Target half the money for a
value-oriented large-cap fund, such as Vanguard Index Value. Start
by plunking down $1,000 _ the minimum allowed to open an IRA
account at Vanguard _ there. I would then move down the scale to
Vanguard Mid-Cap Index, again making the $1,000 minimum initial
investment, but targeting it for a position that will eventually
represent only 25 percent of the portfolio. The same goes for the
final element, Vanguard Small-Cap Index.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $37,000 would go into one of Vanguard's money
market funds, of which the largest is Vanguard Prime Money Market.
You could then ask Vanguard to move $850 a month into your three
target funds. If you achieved 5 percent average returns from the
money fund, this would spread your investment over 48 months _
providing you with a degree of protection against a short-term drop
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   It would require a bit of juggling at the outset to get your
allocations on schedule. The first month, you would move the entire
$850 into Vanguard Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   The second money, $500 would go to Index Value and $175 each to
the Mid-Cap and Small-Cap funds. Then you would have achieved the
target allocations, so for all subsequent months, the moves would
involve $425 going to Index Value and $212.50 each to the remaining
funds.

   BOMBING-NEW-WAR (Undated) Thursday's military strikes against
targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were the first battle in a new
form of war the Pentagon has been gearing up for since 1994 _ one
against terrorists or rogue states capable of launching attacks
against U.S. targets. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Henry Shelton made
a point of noting that the U.S. operation was very different than
the Gulf War: ``We are in a different ball game today,'' Shelton
said. ``We're going against a terrorist organization, and that
calls from some different techniques.'' The military option used
Thursday is part of a multi-billion-dollar Pentagon initiative
against terrorism that was began in late 1993 and formally was made
part of defense planning and budgets the next year. It was a
reponse to the heightened threat of nuclear, biological or chemical
attacks against American targets.

   WORKPLACE-COLUMN-SMITH (Undated) There is nothing like a crisis
to winnow the winners from the whiners. Some people hit with a
setback become paralyzed and give in to helplessness, while others
seize the situation and turn it into an opportunity for success.

   USSTRIKES-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Eleven days before he is set to meet
with President Clinton in Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Friday sharply condemned the U.S. air strikes against suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, calling them
``indecent.'' Yeltsin said: ``My attitude is negative, just as to
any act of terrorism. The basis for (armed) intervention is
impotence to solve this question through talks.'' U.S. Ambassador
James Collins held talks at the Kremlin and the foreign ministry in
an effort to explain the U.S. actions and soothe Russian concerns.

   USSTRIKES-QUESTIONS _ WASHINGTON _ Although the U.S. government
provided no air cover for the more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles
fired at terrorist operations in Sudan and Afghanistan, officials
provided plenty of ``on-air cover'' for the operation itself.
Following President Clinton's Oval Office address, readily
accessible administration officials blanketed the airwaves with
briefings and interviews. Air cover that continued Friday morning.
But curiously, they're offering few specifics on the so-called
``compelling evidence'' that led to the air strikes, thus leaving
numerous questions remaining about the most significant operation
aimed against terrrorism in U.S. history. (Glass, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   USSTRIKES-HOME _ WASHINGTON _ The morning after the U.S. forces
launched missiles to send a strong message to terrorists around the
world, Americans awoke to ``terrorist warnings'' at home.
Travelers, tourists and commuters were immediately bombarded Friday
with warnings of heightened security at airports, mass transit
systems, federal buildings and even national monuments. ``Watch
for, and report suspicious packages and/or people,'' Washington,
D.C. area METRO riders were told. All that seemed to be missing
were the air raid sirens. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).

   ATTN EDs: With its brilliant hand-woven rugs, shimmering black
pottery and fantastic carved animals, Oaxaca state is indisputably
one of Mexico's favorite travel destinations. Three villages
minutes from Oaxaca city specialize in these widely-recognized
crafts, which have found their way into museums, galleries and
homes around the world. Cox Newspapers Mexico correspondent Susan
Ferriss visited the three towns, and talked to Zapotec Indian
artisans about their crafts and how their businesses have helped
curb poverty. Following are the budget lines for three short
stories:
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-RUGS _ TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Some have business
cards printed in English. Others have clients who fly in to buy in
bulk. Zapotec Indians in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca, make
hand-dyed and hand-woven rugs that are considered some of Mexico's
finest in arts and crafts. With chickens and children running about
her patio, Margarita Sosa Vasquez proudly demonstrates how her
family produces these rugs _ which are a bargain when bought in the
village but can fetch hundreds more in the United States. To dye
wool for the rugs, Margarita shows how a blight is scraped from
cactus leaves to produce various shades of red. Greens are squeezed
from alfalfa, browns from nutshells and blues from indigo. The
patterns Margarita weaves are ancient, depicting lightening bolts,
mescal plants, diamonds and other shapes. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ANIMALS _ ARROZOLA, Mexico _ Carved from pieces of the
copal tree and painted in riotous colors, the animals of Arrazola,
Oaxaca, enrich Mexican culture -- and have enriched the Zapotec
Indian families that produce the creatures that tourists flock here
to buy. Claudio and Teresa Ojeda, who are particularly successful,
fashion animals that are larger than most in town, sometimes
measuring up to three feet wide or tall. The pieces are in demand
as far away as Hong Kong. And no wonder: they are mind-bending
fusions of shapes and colors that defy the imagination.
Fire-breathing dragons sport tails that turn into spitting
serpents. A giant lobster sprouts a lizard on its back. A ram with
curved horns ripples with sensual, almost human muscles. The Ojedas
say their designs are spontaneous. But they also attribute them to
visions they've seen after eating hallucinogenic mushrooms, an
ancient tradition among some Oaxacan Indians. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POTTERY _ SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ For thousands
of years, Zapotec Indians in this Oaxacan community have harvested
a dull gray clay from a special place in the hills and fashioned it
into pots and sculptures that turn black once they are fired. In
the 1950s, a tiny Zapotec potter named Dona Rosa discovered that if
she rubbed her black pots with a crystal stone and fired them again
the pieces would take on a lustrous shine that people seemed to
love. Today Dona Rosa's son carries on his mother's art in the
village of San Bartolo Coyotepec, not far from the city of Oaxaca.
Using ancient methods _ and the same clay as their ancestors _
potters here spin vessels huge and small and sculpt candlesticks,
mermaids and other creatures. The pots are often pierced with
delicate patterns that cast flickering shadows when candles are
placed inside. And some of the larger vessels are scored with
intricate webbed patterns that resemble South Pacific tattoos.

Beach _ the photographers and TV technicians who have camped

``As a citizen, I guess I am glad to see it ending. But jobwise _

   TRYPTOPHAN _ WASHINGTON _ A popular food supplement,
L-tryptophan, sickened hundreds of people in the United States and
caused 30 deaths in the late 1980s, when a contaminated form was
sold. The supplement was temporarly withdrawn from the market. Now,
the pills appear again to have been contaminated, scientists say.
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic, in a paper to be published Sept. 1,
in the journal Nature Medicine, say they tested L-tryptophan now
being sold in health food stores and found some lots contaminated,
possibly in the same manner as before. L-tryptophan is marketed as
``nature's sleeping pill,'' taken for insomnia, obesity and
headaches. Although no cases of the condition that led to deaths in
the 1980s have been reported, the FDA has been notified of the
potential contamination. Some scientists call the situation an
``epidemic waiting to happen.'' This paper is embargoed for
publication only after Aug. 31. If the embargo is not lifted by
Nature Medicine, we plan to break it because of public safety
implications. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

MORE AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE ASKED THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gallup pollsters and their media partners, CNN and USA
Today, have been busy explaining a discrepancy in their instant
analysis of public reaction to President Clinton's post-grand-jury
speech Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup's initial polling after the speech suggested that the
percentage of respondents holding a favorable view of Clinton had
plummeted from 60 percent to 40 percent. The precipitous drop was
amazing, especially when compared with Clinton's 62 percent job
approval rating in the same poll.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a change in the wording of a poll question
produced a misleading result. The pollsters normally ask folks if
they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the president; this
time, they asked those polled if they had a favorable or
unfavorable opinion of Clinton ``as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see what happened here. Lots of Americans believe
that Clinton is OK in his role as chief executive of the country.
But Bill Clinton ``as a person?''
</P>
<P>
   That's another story.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, the editor in chief of the
CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll explained that the decrease in Clinton's
favorable rating was probably half what the wrongly worded poll
suggested _ meaning that 50 percent of poll respondents viewed
Clinton favorably after the speech, compared with 60 percent before
he publicly confessed to participating in a relationship that was
``not appropriate'' with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In quickly clarifying the discrepancy, the pollsters were trying
to be fair to Clinton. The misleading 20 percent drop in his
favorability rating was widely reported in the media _ this column
included _ and was generally interpreted to suggest that Clinton
had suffered a severe loss of good will as a result of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the mixup raises an interesting question: Why doesn't every
poll try to find out how the American people view their president
``as a person''?
</P>
<P>
   As Gallup's mistakenly worded question emphasized, there is a
distinct difference between Americans' assessment of Clinton the
man and Clinton the president. Why isn't any president's standing
as a person considered crucial to measuring his standing as
president?
</P>
<P>
   The American people made it clear during Clinton's second
campaign for president that they were willing to separate their
view of his job performance from any misgivings they might have
about his character. Numerous polls showed that a majority of
voters believed that Clinton was deficient in the areas of honesty
and trustworthiness, but he still racked up a decisive victory over
Republican opponent Bob Dole, whose ratings for honesty and
integrity were far superior.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean what it seems to mean _ that Americans don't
care what sort of rogue their president might be as long as the
economy is strong and most people have a job?
</P>
<P>
   If so, then perhaps we are witnessing the ultimate triumph of
cynicism over citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out soon enough. In the coming days and weeks, we
will surely learn more and more about the depths of Clinton's
failings as a person.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming more difficult by the minute to believe the
president's claim that his answers under oath to questions about
Lewinsky in a January deposition were ``legally accurate.'' And
it's increasingly difficult to believe that Clinton made no effort
to influence the testimony of Lewinsky or others who were dragged
into the sordid sex-and-lies scandal that has besieged the White
House for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the president has committed no ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' that would demand his removal from office, can we
continue to accept the leadership of a president who has admitted
to deliberately deceiving the American people, the judicial system,
his family, his devoted friends, his loyal advisers?
</P>
<P>
   This is a president who has confessed to a ``critical lapse in
judgment'' in his personal conduct. Can we now trust his judgment
in ordering military action against our nation's enemies?
</P>
<P>
   How do we know that Clinton is telling the truth when he says
that Thursday's attacks on terrorist facilities were a legitimate
and necessary use of America's military might?
</P>
<P>
   The attacks almost certainly were legitimate _ maybe even
urgently overdue. But if the man who ordered them is a known liar,
how can we be sure?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Gallup's mistaken question about Americans' view of
the president ``as a person'' wasn't a mistake at all. It's a
question that far more Americans should have asked and answered
before extending Clinton's contract as commander in chief.

TIME TO GO BACK TO `SWEAR' ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Not long after I installed Win95 on my PC this
spring (after a memory upgrade), it refused to start up correctly.
About halfway through the startup cycle, I get a recurring message,
``Unable to read Drive C: Abort, Retry, Ignore.'' Is this
catastrophic?
</P>
<P>
   _ Breakdown
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BREAK: You are, to use a technical term, hosed.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of reasons you may be getting that error
message. Most of them are pretty grim, but don't give up. The first
thing you should do is dig back into the computer's innards to make
sure everything is hooked up correctly. Doublecheck the big flat
cable that hooks the drive to your motherboard or drive controller
card. Some have special tabs that will only allow a correct
connection and keep you from being a dunce; some don't. If you have
one that doesn't, look for a red stripe on one side of the cable
and make sure it goes to the same number pin on either end.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more than one place to plug the cable in, so dig
through the trash until you find the instruction manual, which
should have a motherboard diagram. Now, make sure the four-wire
power connector is tightly in its socket on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Also check the drive for a little jumper that should be set to
the ``master'' position instead of ``slave.'' Do you think the guy
who dreamed that up was feeling lonely?
</P>
<P>
   Assuming everything's hooked up right and that you didn't at
some point spill your tropical drink into the computer so that the
little paper umbrella is jamming the works, try booting again.
Didn't work? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Sorry. Just my cruel little joke. I
didn't think all that would work, but you never know.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you've got the case open, take out the memory you
added. I don't think that will work either, but we need to try and
get things back to the way they were before the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   Now try starting your computer's built-in setup program. It's
possible a bad battery caused the PC to forget what sort of hard
drive it had. You'll have to dig out the books to figure out all
the gibberish it's asking for, but if it indicates that you
currently have no hard drive, there's your problem. Of course, if
that really were the case, it should also be forgetting things like
the correct time or whether you have a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, you have a physically corrupted hard drive. No,
that's not Freudian. It just means something's goobered up on your
disk. Make yourself a boot floppy disk (oh, just find a geek at
work who knows how to do it) with Scandisk.exe on it. Start things
up, then run Scandisk on your hard drive to repair things. Didn't
work? I'm not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   There are about a hundred other things you can try, but stop
making yourself crazy. Nuke the drive. Reformat it and start over.
It's not doing you any good like it is. And get your geek buddy to
help. That way you can blame him if anything else goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If things still aren't working, then the drive is probably
cratered. New ones are cheap and not that hard to install, but have
the store do the work anyway. If the real culprit is a bad
motherboard, you won't have to mess with returning the drive. All
you'll have to do is figure out how to pay for a new computer. And
this time, don't buy the cheapest one in the store.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, you can try replacing the motherboard first. I was just
trying to save you some frustration. And, no, I don't get a
kickback from the store. We're still negotiating that.

CARE CENTERS GIVING PARENTS A CHANCE TO SPY ON BABY VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENDAN LYONS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA, N.Y. _ Clients of a day care center here will soon be
able to check on their children without leaving the home or office.
</P>
<P>
   The YMCA Day Care Center is among the growing number of centers
in the United States to provide video pictures of activity rooms
live over the Internet, allowing anxious parents some control after
they drop their children off for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the parents a chance to see their kid when they're at
work for 10 hours a day,'' said Kelly A. Decker, the director of
the center in this small town north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   But critics fear the technology could be exploited by pedophiles
who could download images of the children. Some also fear it could
lull parents into a false sense of security because incidents can
still occur off-camera, such as in a bathroom. The audio-free
images also wouldn't disclose verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, as a parent, would never dream of allowing an image of my
child to be on the Internet,'' said Robert Ellis Smith, publisher
and editor of Privacy Journal, a monthly newsletter based in
Providence, R.I. ``I think parents are not as naive to think no
wrongdoing is not going to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian R. Loomis, vice president of the Binghamton, N.Y.-based
Open House WorldWide, the company providing the service for the
Malta facility, insists the system is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis explained that a private server line, similar to a phone
line, links the Malta day care center to the company's facility in
Binghamton. Parents of children can access the World Wide Web site
of live video feeds for $9.95 per week.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, grandparents or others who are pre-approved to use the
site are able to see images taken by the video monitor only in the
room where children are playing. At the Malta day care center, for
example, there are eight different rooms for children.
</P>
<P>
   The video feed actually takes a freeze-frame shot of a room
every 20 seconds, and is not a continual image like a normal video
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Parents access the Web site with a pass code, and then enter
another pass code to link onto the video feed that depicts their
child's day care room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who can see the children in the center are
subscribing parents from that center,'' Loomis said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Web sites operated by Open House and similar
companies do not identify the name or location of the day care
center.

   If a hacker were able to break a code and access a video feed,
the person stealing the live images wouldn't know where the center
was located, said Frank Wagner, vice president of Watch Me!, a
Dallas company that offers a similar program at 22 day care centers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Malta center has sent a letter to parents about the video
feeds and so far, no one has objected, Decker said. While parents
don't have to sign up for the service, they can't prevent their
child from being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one parent is really, really adamant about not having their
children (on video), then at that point maybe it's time that they
look for another center,'' Loomis said.

SQUARE-DANCE (Los Angeles) _ While other clubs and organizations
are hanging on by a thread, losing members right and left, the
Trail Dusters square dance club is celebrating its 40th anniversary
Aug. 29 with more than 500 Valley members, and still taking in new
ones. By Carol Bidwell. 
. 
KROFFT-PUPPETS (Los Angeles) _ To anyone who grew up in the '70s,
the Krofft brothers' puppets were as inescapable a part of Saturday
morning TV as sugary breakfast cereals. H.R. Pufnstuf, Lidsville
and Sigmund &AMP; the Sea Monsters were among their creations of
puppetmasters Sid and Marty. At a one-of-a-kind auction Sunday at
the Beverly Hilton Hotel, they'll be auctioning off some of their
signature works. By Reed Johnson. 
. 
RATPAC-TV (Los Angeles) _ The year is 1960, and John F. Kennedy is
the president. His interaction with Frank Sinatra and the Mafia and
the floozies who go along with both are at the center of the
misleadingly titled HBO movie ``The Rat Pack.'' It would have been
more fitting to call the movie ``Frank &AMP; Jack.'' By Keith Marder. 
. 
BABY-TV (Los Angeles) _  Fox, the network that promises to be
daring and distinctive, kicks off its new season with ``Holding the
Baby,'' a formulaic sitcom that breaks less ground than a plastic
shovel. By Keith Marder. 
. 
SEVENTIES-TV (Los Angeles) _  You get to hear ``Love Will Keep Us
Together'' and ``Hooked on a Feeling,'' the lamps are filled with
lava, and the lips on the Farrah Fawcett poster move and sing a
song. ``That '70s Show'' is a special-effects-laden romp back in
time that does its best to re-create a more loudly dressed _ if not
innocent _ time. By Keith Marder.

HUNGER THRIVES ON A SHORTAGE OF COMPASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stranger is traveling through town late one night when his car
crashes in a drenching rain.
</P>
<P>
   After a long string of motorists passes him by and he is near
death, he pens a note saying he would rather die than live in a
world so void of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   I read this story, or some version of it, nearly 20 years ago as
a student at the University of Southern Mississippi. The
particulars, of course, have faded with the passage of time. But
I've never forgotten the utter horror in it, or its message about
the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of both the other day as I read a letter from
Dorothy Schilling, responding to a column I wrote recently about
the Tarrant Area Food Bank's plans to open a Kids Cafe and provide
a badly needed meal to children who might otherwise go to bed
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 45,000 children go hungry in Tarrant County, Texas,
on any given day; more than 12 million live in communities
nationwide. And now Schilling was asking me to talk about the
responsibility of their families to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1921,'' she wrote. ``My poor mother and father
thought it was their job to feed their family. Was this wrong? ...
If you have answers, please do answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that there's nothing wrong with a mother and
father taking responsibility for their family. Nor is it wrong, as
Schilling suggests, to expect others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   I feel that way every time I see an able-bodied man or woman on
the street with a sign that reads, ``Will work for food.'' I want
to scream, because the longer he stands there in the middle of the
road, off somebody's payroll, the more taxes I will have to pay and
the longer I will have to struggle to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   But in a world where little children go to bed hungry, where
some even dine from Dumpsters, I find it hard to talk about family
responsibility. No sooner have I gotten the words off my lips then
I am reminded that there, but for the grace of God, go I.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm able to confront my own human frailties, the answer
becomes much more complicated, because then I'm willing to think
with something other than my head.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't grow up during the Depression, but I lived in a family
that knew hard times, knew hunger like a best friend. We also knew
what being responsible meant, and that it went far beyond taking
care of ``us and ours.'' Responsibility meant loving your neighbor
as yourself, giving them water when they thirsted, providing food,
shelter and clothing when they had none.
</P>
<P>
   And now, because that family taught me the importance of sharing
(even though more often than not, we were on the receiving end), I
am constantly amazed at how God blesses me to do much with the
little that I have.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility? Jesus said that when we do unto the least of
these, we've done it unto him.
</P>
<P>
   You only have to look at my daughters to know they've never
missed a meal. Recently, as Asha led us in prayer before leaving
home one morning, she thanked God for food, ``because you know we
Staples women love to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   As often as we can, we donate nonperishable food items to those
who are less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   And yet every night in Tarrant County, in this country and the
world, children goes to bed hungry. I can't speak for Schilling,
but I'd rather die than live in a world that didn't care enough to
take responsibility for that.
</P>

FIGURE-SKATING BOOM BOOSTS SPORT'S FASHION SENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's not just little girls who want to grow up to
be the next Tara Lipinski. Middle-aged women are ice skating before
work or on their lunch breaks, turning the Olympic sport into a
fashion parade on ice.
</P>
<P>
   And Miz Hot Tips wonders if many of those women are the same
ones who stocked up on shiny leotards and wrap skirts back in the
'70s when aerobic dance arrived on the scene. Apparently she's not
alone, as Capezio (maker of dance fashions) is now making
ice-skating dresses for girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   To get the scoop, Miz Hot Tips called Mary Spencer, the buyer
for Pickwick Ice Center in Burbank, where you might see
up-and-coming Olympic champions practicing their routines.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spencer, ``The popularity of ice skating has really
increased, at least 100 percent up from 10 years ago. And it's
become a dress-up thing, now that designers like Vera Wang are
making skating clothes.'' So obviously Spencer is anxiously
awaiting the arrival of the new Capezio styles, which will include
suede fabric practice dresses and a beaded dress with jacket.
Colors are deep, like plum, brown and copper, says Spencer, who
adds that pink isn't as popular with skaters as you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the petite Lipinski can get more fashion direction at 3
p.m. today at Saks Fifth Avenue, 9600 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly
Hills. The youngest Olympic gold medalist will be there to sign
autographs and introduce Donna Karan's new DKNY Kids back-to-school
collection.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GOT A NEW SPIN: Remember when you were happy with a
spinning top or yo-yo that didn't do anything special? Longing to
share your childhood memories with your own kids but don't want
them laughing at a top that merely spins?
</P>
<P>
   Maui Toys of Youngstown, Ohio, has put a '90s spin on several
old faves. In their newest collection are tops with flashing lights
that play '60s hits like ``Wipe Out,'' ``California Girls'' and
``Tequila'' for $2.99; yo-yos with fake fur sides, musical yo-yos
and a Lava Flo yo-yo that works sort of like a lava lamp when
you're walkin' the dog, priced at $2.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   Other bright ideas are Light-Up Shooters, a package of huge
plastic marbles that sparkle when you roll them, for $4.99, and
Sparkler Bow-Biters for shoes, a little fluff of pink or lavender
feathers with fiber optics that sparkles and flashes with each
footstep, priced at $7.99. Look for them at Kmart, Target and Toys
R Us.
</P>
<P>
   A FAIR TRADE: Got an old Pacific Bell phone book lying around?
You can get a ticket to the IMAX Theatre at the California Science
Center in Exposition Park for an old directory anytime between
Sept. 14 and Oct. 11. Of course, there's a catch. You have to buy
one adult ticket and you get the other one free. For more
information about the recycling program, call (800) 953-4400. For
IMAX ticket information, call (213) 744-2014.
</P>
<P>
   ON MALL PATROL: You can learn all about the latest trends in
decorating from Annie Kelly of House &AMP; Garden magazine and design
experts from Nautica Home collection at 1 p.m. Sunday at Macy's at
the Promenade Mall, Woodland Hills. The store will also unveil its
new Nautica furniture collection for shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And beginning Thursday, all Robinsons-May stores are going to
offer free jazz performances to kick off their exclusive launch of
Yves St. Laurent's new men's fragrance Live Jazz. The
not-for-sissies scent is a heady combination of bergamot, amber,
vanilla and grapefruit; priced at $35 and up.
</P>
<P>
   OH, DIANA: It's hard to believe Princess Diana has been gone
almost a year, but her beauty and fashion style live on in two
cocktail-table-worthy books.
</P>
<P>
   To recall all those stylish ensembles that made us smile, check
out ``Diana: The Secrets of Her Style'' by Diane Clehane (GT
Publishing; $30) and ``Diana: Queen of Style'' by Jackie Modlinger
(Courage Books; $19.98).
</P>
<P>
   Both are written by fashion journalists with some insight into
the royal closet and are packed with rarely seen photos.

   ``That '70s Show'' is a special-effects-laden romp back in time
that does its best to re-create a more loudly dressed _ if not
innocent _ time.
</P>
<P>
   The team that created ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' is back with
another trippy show, chock-full of fantasy sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Point Place, Wis., the Foremans, Pinciottis and Hydes
don't live far from Milwaukee, where the Cunninghams, Webers and
Malphs lived 20 years earlier in fictional neighborhoods born on
TV. It is the first _ and most blatant _ attempt to take us back
two decades, a mini theme of the new television season.
</P>
<P>
   The date: May 17, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The location: Eric Foreman's basement.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-age men get permanents, kids steal beer, grown-ups wear
gold Italian horns around their necks, teen-agers make fun of ``The
Brady Bunch,'' and all of the carpets are shag.
</P>
<P>
   The kids _ including Taft High School student Wilmer Valderrama,
who plays a foreign exchange student _ and parents in this show
often mock each other in ways that are difficult to describe, but
worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the show is all '70s, from kitchen appliances to
fashions to hairstyles.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some controversy over some content in the pilot,
such as the 16- and 17-year-olds drinking and apparently smoking
pot. In one scene, the kids have an inane, obviously stoned
conversation in a smoke-hazed room. Eric then goes up to speak with
his family while the walls in the background move in a psychedelic
manner.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is some high school students drink beer and smoke
marijuana. Depiction of such behavior on the show, while not
glorifying the use, adds to the show's honesty, as does its
portrayal of young love, which the program dissects like a frog in
a biology lab.
</P>
<P>
   There are many fabulous pop-culture references, such as the kids
taking the Vista Cruiser wagon to a Todd Rundgren concert, people
dancing the hustle, KISS posters, a game of Yahtzee and teen-age
boys wishing they lived in Hooterville.
</P>
<P>
   Some will like to relive the memories ``The '70s Show'' evokes.
Those too young may be happy they never lived there.

`BABY' A FAR CRY FROM CLEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Fox, the network that promises to be daring and
distinctive, kicks off its new season with ``Holding the Baby,'' a
formulaic sitcom that breaks less ground than a plastic shovel.
</P>
<P>
   The baby should fire his agent for getting him into this mess.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called comedy is about a guy who works, but his marriage
didn't; his brother who works too little; his boss who wants him to
work more; a nanny who doesn't want to work; and a kid who causes a
lot of people a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of weeks, when Fox drops ``Holding the Baby,'' a lot
of people should be looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   The acting in this show is often forced, the premise is
contrived and the characters are not believable.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, however, is cute. And, the oldest cast member, Ron
Leibman, who plays boss Stan Peterson, steals every scene he's in.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Stiles (Eddie McClintock) plays a struggling actor/drunk
who is somewhat of a babe magnet for no apparent reason. Kelly
O'Malley (Jennifer Westfeldt) plays a chatty, opinionated grad
student who berates someone she wants to work for because he bought
a carpet made by Third World sweatshop workers.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the show is Gordon Stiles (Jon Patrick Walker),
whose wife leaves him after meeting a man at a women's retreat. She
has moved to Tibet and Gordon is left .... holding the baby.
</P>
<P>
   The show is all too predictable. Not even a mother could love
``Holding the Baby.''

TAKING L.A. DESIGN TO THE MAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles fashion designer Max Azria soon will
be the new owner of the famous French couture house of Herve Leger.
</P>
<P>
   Azria, a past California Designer of the Year whose BCBG line of
contemporary mens' and womens' fashions is expected to reach $200
million by the end of the year, told the Daily News this week that
the transaction will be complete in September. He would not
disclose the selling price, but earlier this month he announced
that he had reached an agreement with GH Mumm &AMP; Cie, a subsidiary
of the Seagram Co. LTD, to buy its 95 percent stake of Leger.
</P>
<P>
   The French company, whose clients include supermodel Cindy
Crawford, has been losing money, but Azria will work to turn it
around and double its volume. Currently, it is $10 million, with 40
percent of its business from sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the local fashion industry has been buzzing with
speculations that Azria would be moving his operation to Paris.
According to Azria, ``I have liked this designer for many years,
and I had the opportunity to buy it, so I did. This is a dream come
true for me. I cannot ask for better in life than to have my own
business and also own the house of Herve Leger. But I will be the
director, not the designer, and I have no plans to leave Los
Angeles. Ever. I will die here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the designer says the relationship will create what he
calls a ``global synergy'' which will benefit both companies. Not
only does Azria expect it to increase sales for Leger, but he
expects that its French connection will help BCBG open boutiques in
Paris, Milan and London in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   BCBG clothing and shoes already are sold in numerous department
stores, including Macy's and Neiman Marcus, as well as in 13 BCBG
boutiques throughout Southern California. None of his businesses
are in the San Fernando Valley, but Azria says he is looking at the
community of Calabasas as a future location.
</P>
<P>
   Azria also owns Parallel, To the Max and Maxime clothing lines.

STRANGERS IN THE NIGHTCLUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The president is a handsome philanderer who is a
little too close to Hollywood and takes a lot of policy advice from
a family member.
</P>
<P>
   The story is true and extremely familiar. Only in this scenario,
Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr are nowhere in sight. Monica Lewinsky
and Gennifer Flowers are replaced by Marilyn Monroe and Judith
Campbell; Ted Danson is replaced by Frank Sinatra; and Hillary
Rodham Clinton is replaced by Bobby and Joe Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1960, and John F. Kennedy is the president in
question.
</P>
<P>
   His interaction with Sinatra and the Mafia and the floozies who
go along with both are at the center of the misleadingly titled HBO
movie ``The Rat Pack.'' It would have been more fitting to call the
movie ``Frank &AMP; Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Rat Pack conjures up images of ring-a-ding,
koo-koo-crazy times when a bunch of guys drank together, smoked
together and womanized together in between delighting America with
song and dance, sprinkled with racist barbs.
</P>
<P>
   There is some of that in ``The Rat Pack,'' an altogether
watchable film, but not enough to warrant the name.
</P>
<P>
   Mantegna's Martin delivers the best line in this regard when he
tells Bishop, ``The whole world is drunk, and we're just the
cocktail of the moment, pally. One of these days, everybody's gonna
wake up with a heckuva hangover, down two aspirin with a glass of
tomato juice and wonder what the hell all the fuss was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, we get no idea what enabled this uncommon bond and
brought these five entirely different entertainers together. There
was Sinatra (Ray Liotta), the volatile Alpha member; always-cool
Dean Martin (Joe Mantegna); omni-talented Sammy Davis Jr. (Don
Cheadle); Brit twit actor Peter Lawford (Angus Macfadyen); and the
reigning King of Zing, Joey Bishop (Bobby Slayton).
</P>
<P>
   The group dynamic is glossed over, as is the reason that these
men worked so well together on stage and in films.
</P>
<P>
   You are asked to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours. The
actors, for the most part, don't look or sound like the men they
play, nor are they trying to. And the beginning scene is a little
hokey, with an aging Sinatra standing in the wings, waiting to go
on stage, Jack Daniel's in one hand, cigarette in the other,
repeating twice, ``I miss my guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But the transformation to the Frank of the late '50s and early
'60s is slick, and screenwriter Kario Salem and director Rob Cohen
team to tell the story they set out to, even if it wasn't the one
they have advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra is infatuated with the idea of being a pally of the
president. His ex-friend Lawford becomes a friend again after he
marries Kennedy's sister, Patricia, and is able to be the
matchmaker between politician and crooner.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the ``Brother-in-Lawford'' character gets a bit too much
screen time in comparison to his place in Rat Pack history.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys use Sinatra's mob ties to help rig the election. As
it turns out, these same ties _ and Sinatra's stubborn loyalty _
lead to his demise with the first family.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Liotta plays Sinatra's roller coaster of emotions
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an 18-karat manic depressive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle, who had to learn how to play drums, twirl guns and tap
dance to play ``Mr. Wonderful,'' is impressive, and Mantegna does a
good job as the suave Martin, despite his lack of matinee-idol
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank &AMP; Jack'' is worth a watch, even if it is called ``The
Rat Pack.''

HIP TO BE SQUARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The music starts with a flourish of guitars and
fiddles, and the big skirts _ held out stiff by layers of
petticoats _ start to swish and swirl. Boots stomp in time to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   The caller sings a few bars and breaks into a yodel.
</P>
<P>
   From among the knot of dancers, somebody calls ``Yee-haw!'' and
everybody laughs.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a barn-raising in Oklahoma or a box social in
Arkansas. It's the back yard of a stately two-story home in
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   And a couple dozen members of the Trail Dusters, with more than
500 members one of the largest square dancing organizations in the
world, are just kicking up their heels. In fact, the lively Valley
bunch is celebrating its 40th anniversary tonight with a big
barbecue and dancing till everybody drops. Then, they'll probably
dance some more.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't square dancing a pioneer, covered-wagon kind of thing
that went out with the Gold Rush?
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say tickets for tonight's event have been sold out
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have so much fun,'' said Farol Brifman of Northridge,
co-president of the group with her husband Mark. ``We have such a
good time, it should be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   This group _ whose members range in age from their 30s to their
60s _ has been having a ball for a long time indeed. It was 1957
when a bunch of firefighters and their wives decided they wanted to
learn to square dance and started a club they called Chicks and
Chaps, a name almost immediately changed to Trail Dusters. As more
couples joined _ and the group grew to include lawyers, doctors,
media executives, fashion designers and more _ the club moved from
place to place, seeking an ever-larger site.
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't dancing, they were collecting canned goods and
filling Christmas baskets for needy families, collecting Christmas
cards for charity projects and entertaining at local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   After their original caller retired in 1968, interest waned for
a while, but the group reinvented itself a year later and began to
grow again. Now, the bursting-at-the-seams club still welcomes new
members of all ages, offering classes each fall for those with a
yen to learn the dances that have their roots in folk dances
brought to the United States in centuries past by Irish, English
and Scottish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The basics are simple: Each ``square'' is formed by four
couples, one couple on a side. The dancers advance and retreat,
twirl with their own partner and others, and often connect in a
kind of dance floor free-for-all involving all four couples in
moving circles and intricate footwork.
</P>
<P>
   The caller is the boss, directing the dancers through their
paces to the background of changing music styles. Most songs _
played on 45 rpm records spinning on a turntable _ are
country-western in theme, but dancers also move expertly to reggae,
big band and popular songs. No matter what the music, the beat
remains the same, said Dick Hodnefield, the Trail Dusters' caller
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music tells the dancers when to put their feet down,'' he
said. ``Feet go down on the downbeat, up on the upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   And while dancers could carry out their dance floor maneuvers in
sweats or shorts, the outfits _ big skirts covering modestly
ruffled ``sissy pants'' for the women, jeans and boots for the men
with shirts and neckerchiefs matching their ladies' dresses _ are
part of the ambience.
</P>
<P>
   As the music heats up, the dancers seem to twirl faster and
faster, becoming a blur of color.
</P>
<P>
   While some clubs also function as a source for singles'
matchmaking, the Trail Dusters is strictly a husband-and-wife
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a couples activity, something you do together that you
both have fun at,'' Hodnefield said. ``Square dancing doesn't
attract the type of person who wants to spend their life on a
barstool.''
</P>
<P>
   The lively pastime has many benefits, the dancers say: It's good
exercise, a great stress reducer, a way for couples to spend time
together _ and it's a downright good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to square dancing, you leave all your problems
outside the door,'' said Jackie Kantor of Woodland Hills, who
dances with husband Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really clears your mind,'' agreed Stuart Levy of Calabasas,
who with wife Judy, has been square dancing since 1996. ``You
really have to concentrate on the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because in just the first class, a fledgling square
dancer is expected to learn 96 calls.
</P>
<P>
   To ease new couples into the group, each is paired with a pair
of ``angels,'' veteran dancers who can help sort out the unfamiliar
footwork as well as make them feel like part of the existing group.
</P>
<P>
   But even with willing mentors, women say they initially face the
same balkiness they see any time they even think of heading for a
dance floor: They want to dance; their husbands' reaction ranges
from reluctance to outright rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   But that's soon overcome, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband, Mitch, promised me he would go one time, and I was
never to ask him again,'' said Arlene Zoren of Chatsworth.
``Halfway through the first evening, he said, `Can we do this
again?'''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha and Saul Zwirn of Northridge, who've been dancing nearly
three years, confirmed the man-woman stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three years, I tried to get him to try this,'' said
Marsha.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dragged me here one night _ and I was hooked,'' Saul said.
``Now I would dance every night of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the attraction?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just learning that there was more to square dancing
than what you learned in junior high school,'' Saul said. ``It's a
lot more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to men, they say they can't do any kind of
ballroom dancing,'' said Margie Hausman of Calabasas, who dances
with husband Jeff. ``But they can do this. The men look at it as
sort of a puzzle to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the 500 or so Trail Dusters have become inactive,
largely the result of partners lost to poor health, death or
divorce. But many inactive members are expected to turn out to mark
the group's 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the old-timers expected at tonight's celebration will be
Mary Alice and John Schilinger of Calabasas, who've attended most
club functions and classes for the past 20 years. Lured into the
dancing life by friends, as most square dancers are, they didn't
know quite what they were getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some exercise,'' said Mary Alice. ``We thought we
were in good shape _ but we found that this was quite a workout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to come back from square dancing and be tired,'' said
John. ``Now, we go for pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brifmans, co-presidents of the group, say they were amazed
at how their lives changed when they took up square dancing five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to spend time when we weren't dancing with the
people we danced with,'' said Mark Brifman. ``That's the thing
about square dancing _ you do everything by couple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our closest friends are in this room,'' Farol Brifman
said, looking around at the smiling faces of other dancing couples.
``My very best friends in the whole world, I've known only five

THAT SHOW ABOUT THE '70S IS ALL RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the title.
</P>
<P>
   Producers Bonnie and Terry Turner tossed around dozens of names
for their '70s-based sitcom, beginning Sunday night on Fox, and
nothing stuck. Not ``Reelin' in the Years,'' not ``Feelin'
Alright,'' not ``The Kids Are All Right.'' Frustrated and a little
fried, the producing partners took the name that was right under
their noses.
</P>
<P>
   Test audiences could never remember the show's title and would
finally mutter in frustration, ``You know, that '70s show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept calling it that for so long that we started to
say to ourselves, you know, `I'm going to be over at the '70s
show,''' says Terry Turner, whose writing credits include such
offbeat projects as ``Wayne's World'' and ``The Brady Bunch
Movie.'' ``Finally, we just gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' (7:30 p.m. Sunday) is getting an aggressive
push by Fox, largely because the network is convinced that it will
be a hit. That's a bold forecast, even for a network that had one
of only two new hit shows from last season, the Emmy-nominated
dramedy ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   A snappy, funny and lively treatment of '70s living stuffed into
a sitcom format, ``That '70's Show'' comes from the creative brains
of the producers whose other high-concept comedy with an odd name
(''3rd Rock From the Sun'') and premise (aliens set up camp on
Earth) was a pleasantly surprising success for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is so giddy about ``That '70s Show'' that it wedged it
between ``The Simpsons'' and ``The X-Files,'' and dispatched its
first two episodes to the press, figuring that early buzz would
generate a following before the annual onslaught of new entries.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1976, the series follows Eric Foreman (Topher Grace) as
he navigates the treacherous waters of the teen years. Lanky but
baby-faced, smart but unsure, Eric leads a small band of buddies
who lean on him for approval and who find his parents' spacious
basement the perfect chill-out zone.
</P>
<P>
   His pals are a tight-knit group of misfits who could probably be
friends only with one another; all are unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mila Kunis is Jackie, a spoiled loudmouth; Ashton Kutcher is
Kelso, Jackie's boyfriend, Eric's best bud and something of a
gullible nut case; Danny Masterson is Hyde, the resident conspiracy
theorist (Hyde on ``Petticoat Junction'': ``Does it bother anybody
else that these women live in Hooterville?''); Wilmer Valderrama is
Fex, the naive foreign-exchange student; and Laura Prepon is Donna,
Eric's childhood friend and, judging from the first two episodes,
involved in a touchy-feely story line with Eric.
</P>
<P>
   Adding extraordinarily to the mix are Eric's parents, Kitty and
Red, played by Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith, who does such
subtle work here it appears he's not even acting. His voice _ a
deep monotone usually reserved for big-screen bad guys _ slides
from elation to frustration with only the slightest tonal change.
He's hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70's Show'' is filled with disco music and pop-culture
references, but for the Turners, the plastic garishness of '70s
fashions and decor is more than a matter of camp nostalgia. It
speaks to the ironic innocence of what may be the last moment in
this country when people simply did what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of Sunday night's episode, in which the teens
sit around getting stoned. It's actually quite a funny scene,
particularly when Eric is talking to his parents while the walls
behind them dip and dance.
</P>
<P>
   The producers agonized over whether to keep it, finally deciding
to let the chips fall where they may. ``I think we would be
criticized if we ignored it and criticized if we did it,'' Bonnie
Turner says. ``It happened. Kids did it, adults did it. We feel
we've written _ hopefully what we've done _ is portrayed the '70s
in a very honest form.''
</P>
<P>
   Also new Sunday night:
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Stiles (Jon Patrick Walker) is in trouble. And from the
looks of it, so is his sitcom. ``Holding the Baby'' (6:30 p.m.) is
a standard-issue comedy about a workaholic learning how to parent
an infant after his wife skips town.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly O'Malley (Jennifer Westfeldt) is the cutie-pie graduate
student who ends up as the kid's part-time nanny. There's also
Jimmy, (Eddie McClintock) Gordon's freeloading brother, who's
perpetually between acting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Press materials stress that the three may not have much
experience in handling a baby, but ``working together, they may
just add up to be one great parent.'' I'd settle for one decent
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH CHECKING OUT THIS WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   Although often overshadowed by other groups that emerged in the
'60s, the Beach Boys have remained a part of American pop culture.
``Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys and Their Music'' (8 p.m. Sunday
night, VH1) documents the group's music, including recent and
vintage interview footage in which Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Bruce
Johnston and Carl and Dennis Wilson talk about the inspiration
behind their songs and how they were created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endless'' was researched for a year and features footage from
collectors as well as from Dennis Wilson. ``Seventy percent of
these clips haven't been seen before,'' producer Stephanie Bennett
says. ``It's great stuff.'' It is.
</P>
<P>
   ELSEWHERE:
</P>
<P>
   Roma Downey (''Touched by an Angel'') hosts ``Before Your Eyes:
Don't Take My Daddy'' (9 p.m. Monday, CBS) a documentary about
three American women, all with young children, who are dealing with
the threat that their husbands, natives of Northern Ireland, may be
deported because of allegations that they have ties to the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids of Survival: The Life and Art of Tim Rollins &AMP; K.O.S,'' a
``Reel Life'' documentary on Cinemax, follows one man's crusade to
help at-risk kids through art. Set in the south Bronx, ``Kids of
Survival'' (5:30 p.m. Tuesday on Cinemax) is one of the success
stories we don't hear enough of, and it shows the difficulties of
running unconventional programs. With few large-scale corporations
willing to pitch in, the workshop is entirely funded by the sale of
the group's art. It's not always easy, as ``Kids of Survival''
reveals.
</P>
<P>
   The daytime soaper ``Sunset Beach'' gets a prime-time showing
Friday on NBC with a story line said to be ``easily accessible'' to
those who aren't regular viewers. Hmmm. Better be, since it airs at
7 p.m. The daily series, still trying to find a footing in the
ratings, revisits a previous ``Sunset Beach'' tragedy that did
fairly well _ about a tidal wave smashing into a cruise ship. When
all else fails, drum up a disaster.

GOOD SAMARITAN FENDS OFF KNIFE ATTACK

 By KATE HUNGER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A couple of would-be carjackers picked the wrong
target Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sanchez, 49, said he stopped to help two young men who
flagged him down as they peered under the hood of a dirty white
Camaro on a San Antonio street.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of receiving thanks for his trouble, Sanchez, found
himself staring at the glint of a knife blade pointed at his chest.
One of the men cursed at Sanchez and demanded his silver, 1997 Ford
F-150 pickup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to hand him the keys, but he lunged at me,'' he
said. ``He was going to take me, so I took him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he grabbed the man's arm and pushed it toward the
ground. The action deflected the knife away from his chest, but
into his leg.
</P>
<P>
   With the weapon still in the assailant's hand, Sanchez said, he
turned the knife and thrust it deep into the abdomen of the
attacker. After seeing his companion get stabbed, the second man
started the Camaro and began to speed away.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the wounded man jumped through the front
passenger window of the Camaro with the knife still lodged in his
abdomen, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle left Sanchez with four stitches above his right
knee and a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of grew up on the streets,'' said Sanchez, a compact
man with a cheerful demeanor and streaks of gray in his dark hair.
``I didn't grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Leal of the San Antonio police said officers notified
emergency rooms citywide to be on the lookout for he wounded man.
Leal said the suspects were in their early 20s.

   MALIBU, Calif. _ If the ultimate reward for a man of ideas is to
see an idea make a difference in the real world, then James Q.
Wilson should feel rewarded indeed. No less a figure than former
New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton has given him
credit for an important concept in the much-publicized reduction of
crime in American cities, especially in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is known as the ``broken window'' theory, and it dates
back to an essay Wilson wrote with George Kelling in The Atlantic
Monthly in 1982. The authors argued that paying attention to the
small things _ drug dealing on street corners, street walkers,
petty vandalism, fare beating _ could have a disproportionate
effect on the big things as well.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Wilson, a political and social scientist who has
written frequently on crime prevention, continued to make that
argument, and, according to Bratton and others who know Wilson's
work, there is a direct link between ``broken windows'' and such
initiatives as New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
quality-of-life campaign and the widespread practice of community
policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that it's had some influence,'' Wilson, interviewed
at his home in Malibu, said of the broken-windows concept. ``It was
important that the police pay attention to orderliness as well as
to crime. But `Broken Windows' is the title of one essay I wrote
among many. I don't see it as a great literary moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has in fact had quite a few ideas in his many years of
writing about public policy, bureaucratic behavior and human
values. Jim Wilson, as he is known to his friends, has over the
years been among the most influential thinkers in the country, an
academic who has combined scholarship with widely read public
commentaries on issues ranging from drugs to morals.
</P>
<P>
   He is known as a conservative, a label he does not repudiate. He
has, for example, been on the boards of conservative organizations
like the Smith-Richardson Foundation, the Randolph Foundation and
the American Enterprise Institute. He is also on the publication
committee of The Public Interest quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   But what many of his colleagues and friends believe sets Wilson
apart has been the way in which the data have driven his ideas, not
some pre-existing ideological commitment. Writing on such subjects
as the social bases of Reaganism, the behavior of bureaucracies and
the police, crime prevention, and, most recently, the role of
morality in human affairs, Wilson has focused on the empirical
data, on practical consequences, in a word on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very empirically grounded,'' said Neal Kozodoy, the
editor of Commentary magazine and the publisher of numerous Wilson
articles ``He engages the big questions of human existence, like
morality and character, but he does so not from a religious
position or on the basis of immutable first principles, but from
what the evidence allows us to say. The interesting thing is how
consistently the evidence confirms those immutable first
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Barnard College
and Columbia University, said she saw Wilson ``as one of the most
important political scientists of the past 40 years.'' She
continued: ``His perceptions about city politics remain
paradygmatic in that field. People hold him up as a conservative
thinker, but he's first and foremost a social scientist. There's
nothing, for example, inherently conservative about the
broken-windows idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson put it this way: ``I know my political ideas affect what
I write, but I've tried hard to follow the facts wherever they
land. Every topic I've written about begins as a question. How do
police departments behave? Why do bureaucracies function the way
they do? What moral intuitions do people have? How do courts make
their decisions? What do blacks want from the political system? I
can honestly say that I didn't know the answers to those questions
when I began looking into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was born in Denver, but grew up in Long Beach, Calif. He
graduated from the nearby University of Redmond and, after three
years in the Navy, went on to finish graduate studies in political
science at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Harvard in 1961, teaching there until 1983, when
he moved back ``home'' to UCLA. He now lives north of Malibu, in a
home that he and his wife, Roberta, built a decade or so ago. It is
an airy, open place and has sweeping views of the Pacific, but it
is also unpretentious, like Wilson himself.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a trim and youthful 67, was in the midst of planning a
scuba diving expedition to Truk Island that he and his wife are to
go on later this summer, and he was not working on a book. He still
participates in cattle roundups in Colorado and likes to drive fast
cars, occasionally on a race track. (``Once,'' he said, ``my
driver's license was suspended in three states.'')
</P>
<P>
   He has a quiet, unobtrusive style, more West Coast than East
Coast, even though most of his career was spent in Cambridge,
Mass., where for three years he was director of the Joint Institute
for Urban Studies of MIT and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   One of his notable early essays was called ``A Guide to Reagan
Country: The Political Culture of Southern California,'' which was
published in Commentary when Ronald Reagan was only beginning to be
seen as a strong possible contender for the presidency. Not a
Reagan backer himself, Wilson presciently observed that Reagan's
support rested on a bedrock of values and preferences that, while
perhaps strongest in Southern California, were widespread
elsewhere. ``We must, I think, take Reaganism seriously,'' he
wrote. ``It will be with us for a long time under one guise or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts,'' Wilson recalled, ``and
that essay very literally grew out of a desire to explain the West
to my Eastern friends.'' ( Wilson sardonically noted in his
Commentary essay that even if he liked Reagan, he wouldn't admit it
anyplace where his Harvard colleagues were likely to see it.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there is a single thematic strand running through
his work, Wilson hesitated for a moment and then said no. And yet
it is tempting to see in his hundreds of articles and books (with
the exception of the scuba diver's guide to viewing fish that he
wrote with Mrs. Wilson) if not exactly a single thread, then at
least a logical progression of interests, moving from the narrowly
political to the broadly moral.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What seems to bind together much of Wilson's work is the
combination of empirical research for which he is known and what
are generally taken to be conservative social values. To Wilson,
``Southern California had become an outpost of Middlewestern
civility.'' It is clear that he identifies with that civility and
with what he believes are its characteristics, among them ``a
strong socially reinforced commitment to property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with growing up in an era when there was no such
thing as moral ambiguity,'' Wilson said. ``Individualism and
personal effort were highly rewarded. It was a white Anglo-Saxon
culture, and it had all of the defects of that culture, especially
its racism, but it also had all of the advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson studied urban politics under his mentor, Edward Banfield
at the University of Chicago, one of whose interests was
discovering the informal rules and incentives by which
organizations worked. Under Banfield, Wilson was one of the first
political sociologists to look closely at the role of blacks in
urban politics.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career at Harvard, he was teaching a course in
public administration, part of which involved a study of police
departments. The result was a book, ``The Varieties of Police
Behavior,'' and, following that, an invitation to serve on the
Commission on Crime and the Administration of Justice created by
President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seemed to be a shortage of criminologists with an
interest in public policy,'' Wilson recalled. ``I had to learn
about crime, a subject in which I had no professional training, in
order to function on that task force.'' But that interest led
Wilson to frame a common question in an uncommon way. ``The
standard question was why did people commit crimes,'' he recalled.
``I wanted to ask why people don't commit them. And that led me
eventually to my book `The Moral Sense.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's argument in that book is complicated and the goal is
ambitious: to reassert the validity of morality in an age that
lacks religious conviction and is dominated by moral relativism. It
asserted the neglected notion that moral rules are part of human
nature and spring from the ordinary experiences of life. The
dominant relativism portrays morality as nothing more than a social
convention, an arbitrary set of rules that differ from one society
to the next.
</P>
<P>
   What Wilson found was that while specific rules certainly do
vary from culture to culture, every culture has what he calls a
moral disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is to be found,'' he wrote in one article in Commentary
on this subject, ``a desire not only for praise but for
praiseworthiness, for fair dealings as well as for good deals, for
honor as well as for advantage.'' Wilson argued further that the
moral sense stemmed from every day experience. ``A good
character,'' he wrote, ``arises from the repetition of many small
acts, and begins early in youth. That habituation operates on a
human nature innately prepared to respond to training.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, of course, could be said about Wilson's broken-windows
theory of crime prevention. In his view, just as society can
disintegrate when it ceases to pay attention to small violations,
to an overall orderliness, so, too, individuals can disintegrate
when they fail to perform the ``small acts'' that construct the
moral sense.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the moral sense is innate but that the practice of
morality is learned seems to be at the heart of many of Wilson's
positions and of his conservative conviction that the liberal
culture has eroded the practice of morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take an adult cautioning young people about something they've
done wrong, like telling a kid not to litter or not to shout in a
crowded subway car,'' he said. ``It's almost unheard of now, but
when I was growing up it was common for an adult to say to a child,
`You shouldn't do that.' We've passed that point because of fear
and because we think it improper, that we don't have the right to
interfere in somebody else's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's lament may sound to some people like nostalgia, a
yearning for the lost wholeness of small-town America, and perhaps
there is something of that in there. But Wilson's work is too
firmly oriented toward practical consequences, the data of everyday
life, for nostalgia to play a big role.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, in an essay in Commentary, he provided what could be a
credo about the social necessity of enforcing the habit of good
behavior:
</P>
<P>
   ``If morality is thought to be nothing but convention or
artifice, then it will occur to those persons who are weakly
attached to society and its rules that they are free to act as they
wish provided they can get away with it. And if they would have
broken the rules anyway, the relativism of our age makes it easier
for them to justify their action by the claim that the rules are
arbitrary enactments.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it seems odd that there's a framed article about
Isaac Mizrahi at the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge Club, a musty
place bustling with Upper West Side retirees, then you've got a
thing or two to learn about style-conscious New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   No, the place doesn't turn into a lounge at night. And the chef
who makes lunch ($2, prix fixe) and dinner isn't famous. But
Mizrahi, along with the socialites Nina Griscom and Sandy Hill and
the fashion photographer Wayne Maser, have beaten a path to the
Manhattan Bridge Club in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   They, and many other unlikely converts to bridge, have sought
out Jeff Bayone, the charismatic, straight-shooting owner of the
club. Tall, slightly stooped, with strawberry blond hair and an
endearingly droopy moustache, Bayone is the master of this
universe. On a sunny Tuesday afternoon, the dowdy club was jammed
with mostly older Manhattanites fond of telling visitors that
they've been playing bridge since the war. (They meant World War I,
not II, and not all of them were joking.)
</P>
<P>
   A mentor to seniors with plenty of time to build their master
points, Bayone, along with a fellow teacher, Tom Ng, has also
attracted a new crowd recently. It looks as if bridge is enjoying
something of a hip resurgence, along with pedal pushers and
mid-century Richard Neutra houses. The newcomers play at night,
drawn in no small part by the retro ambiance of the game they once
watched parents or grandparents play, with cigarettes and highballs
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   On Mondays, when Bayone teaches beginner classes, chances are
good that there will be a 30-ish editor from Conde Nast learning to
bid at the same table with a Florida-bound pharmacist who is eager
to learn the game, which is still a staple of retirement
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Equal parts teddy bear, drill sergeant and Jewish mother,
Bayone, 50, badgers his students, yells at them and hugs them.
</P>
<P>
   The first paragraph of a book he has just written, ``It's
Bridge, Baby: How to Be a Player in 10 Easy Lessons'' (Riverhead,
1998), reads: ``Picture this. I am 6 feet 4 inches tall. One
hundred ninety pounds. I have a moustache. My name is Jeff. And I
am your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The book offers a combination of tough love, motivational
language and straightforward instruction. His club has the same
no-fuss charm. The sunny, wood-paneled playing rooms, a kitchen and
an office occupy the top floor of the Olcott residential hotel on
West 72nd Street. Framed Collier's magazine covers line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Before classes, Charles Nurse, the club's manager, sets out a
tray of midafternoon snacks (licorice sticks, vegetables and dip,
Oreo cookies, peanuts) on a Formica-top table. Nothing fancy.
That's how the students like it. When Bayone sauntered into the
room last Tuesday, the 12 intermediate students who sat patiently
practicing at the felt-top tables fell silent like an awe-struck
first-day kindergarten class.
</P>
<P>
   Bayone _ in gold-rimmed glasses, gold bracelet,
green-and-blue-plaid polo shirt and blue slacks _ sauntered over to
Muriel Sherwood's group to ponder the cards. He looked over one
woman's shoulder and then announced her hand to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she has eight diamonds, she has 11 tricks,'' he said. He
set his steely gaze upon Ms. Sherwood. ``What do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherwood, a retired secretary who lives in Manhattan,
thought for a moment. He pointed at one card in her hand, wrinkled
his brow and glared playfully at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the master has spoken,'' she said, as Bayone glided
silently on to the next table.
</P>
<P>
   Bayone has been teaching at the club, one of about six bridge
clubs in Manhattan, since 1976, when he bought it. He estimates
that he has turned more than 3,000 novices into competitive
players. Does he think of himself as a bridge guru?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think of myself that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before you could say, ``Four no-trump,'' Ms. Sherwood
interjected, ``He has a very philosophical approach.'' With one
hand holding her cards and the other picking at a dish of peanuts,
she explained: ``He's not like a teacher. He wants you to
understand the concept. Bridge, you see, is about intellect and
memory. It's not in just how the cards lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kamlot, a manager of Broadway shows who plays at
Manhattan Bridge, said that Bayone's secret is that he doesn't
overcomplicate the game. ``He's very straightforward, and he's got
this method called `kiss,''' Kamlot said. Kiss? ``Yes. `Keep it
simple, stupid,''' Kamlot said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Older styles of bridge instruction encouraged memorization of
long lists of maneuvers. Bayone just wants his students to play.
``Young people are attracted to bridge because it's fast and it's
social,'' he said, his face shining. ``Chess is a two-hour
struggle. In bridge, each hand is about seven and a half minutes.
It's about as fast-paced as you could have. You can play 40 games
in a night, and every hand is a new adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bayone was back at the club preparing for the week's
big social night, when more than 60 players of all levels come to
play, paying $10 admission. He offered the secret of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned to be mellow and adaptable,'' he said. ``I have
to be the policeman, the director of activities, the final judge,
the referee, and sometimes I have to walk over to a table that's
acting up and say: `What? Do I have to be the kindergarten teacher,
too?' ''

TRAVEL BAN IN GAZA REGION PUSHES PALESTINIANS' IRE TO `CRITICAL'
POINT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 23) 
(Eds.: Subheds included) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUSH KATIF, Gaza Strip _ A donkey cart carrying Palestinian
women draped in long black veils hurries across the highway, then
resumes its slow journey down a side road cut through sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   After the women cross the main highway, an Israeli pickup with
yellow license plates speeds down the road. Yellow-plated cars on
their way to the Israeli settlement of Neve Dakalim follow.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Palestinians have been barred from traveling on this
stretch of highway in Gush Katif, the southern region of the Gaza
Strip that remains under Israeli control. Israel says the ban is
necessary to safeguard the area's 6,000 Israeli settlers, most of
whom live along the road.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiators agreed to give Israel control of this
part of Gaza _ and, by extension, the right to impose travel
restrictions _ when they signed interim peace accords in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, nearly 80 percent of Gaza _ which Israel
took from Egypt in the 1967 war _ was handed over to the
Palestinian Authority. Palestinians, who hope to create their own
state in Gaza and in the West Bank, had assumed that Israeli
settlements would eventually disappear. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Three years after the interim peace agreement was signed, the
scene along the highway in Gush Katif has come to symbolize what
ordinary Palestinians despise about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like the occupation is still here,'' says Marwan
Najjar, one of a few thousand Palestinian farmers who live in the
area. ``It interferes in our life, in our work, in our land. Even
roads are separate, and this is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   As peace talks falter and tensions rise, the travel restrictions
also highlight the &UR;  &LR; dangers posed by an arrangement _ meant to be
temporary _ that forces longtime enemies to live side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, as frustration over the travel restrictions mounted,
a Palestinian minister demanded access to the highway reserved for
Israeli settlers. Within minutes, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
police were training their weapons on each other. The 12-hour
standoff ended peacefully, however.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 months now, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been
unable to drag peace talks out of a deep freeze, which began with a
dispute over a new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem, despite
several attempts to agree on the scope of a long-overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In a scenario that has changed little since the two sides
embarked on a new path toward peace, Israeli settlers and
Palestinians continue to squabble over land, plot by plot, parcel
by parcel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's army is now preparing for the possibility of a war that
military analysts may come in 1999 if Palestinians make good on
their threat to declare an independent state in the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical moment,'' says Yaron Ezrahi, a political
scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``If there is not going
to be withdrawal, there is going to be a wave of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`I MUST FOLLOW ORDERS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a stretch of beach in Gush Katif, four Israeli soldiers and
four Palestinian policemen emerge from separate orange-flagged
jeeps to take a short break from the rounds of their joint patrol.
</P>
<P>
   When the joint patrols first started in 1994, something akin to
camaraderie developed. Palestinians and Israelis ate in the same
mess halls, and they got to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now during breaks, they stand in separate groups around jeeps
parked in the sand. Few words pass between them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, arguments break out. Last month, an Israeli soldier
was hospitalized with minor wounds after getting into a fight with
a Palestinian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to like my work,'' says a 25-year-old Palestinian
policeman assigned to a joint patrol. ``Now I do it because I must
follow orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and police charged with keeping the peace sometimes
take sides in squabbles between Israeli settlers and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, 15 Israeli soldiers and 60 Palestinians, many of
them policemen, were killed when high-pitched battles broke out
over a controversial archaeological tunnel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the flare-ups have been less deadly but no less
tense. Nightly news programs often show soldiers and police
pushing, shouting and pointing weapons at each other following
incidents like one earlier this month in Gush Katif in which
Palestinians tore down a fence built by settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians question how long the joint patrols can go on in
the absence of progress in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my job,'' says the policemen. ``The problem is that I
feel that I am enforcing a way of living that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SETTLERS HUNKERING DOWN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the steel gates of Neve Dakalim, the largest of 17
Israeli settlements in Gush Katif, children's music played in a
small zoo wafts through the air. On a manicured lawn next to a bank
and a supermarket, Naomi, a 28-year-old settler, talks about why
she moved here with her husband two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important for the security of Israel for us to
live here,'' explains Naomi, who declines to give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we weren't here, the army wouldn't be here, and it would be
easier for the Palestinians to establish a state,'' she says. ``But
it's our country. They have enough Arab states. I don't think we
should give them another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli settlers have hunkered down since most of Gaza came
under Palestinian rule. Like Naomi, many settlers came here out of
conviction that their presence would help stifle Palestinian
independence.
</P>
<P>
   On Gaza's highways, settlers take extraordinary precautions,
using only certain roads and sometimes traveling in convoys
escorted by the army.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the settlements, even petty crime is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Neve Dakalim, the dust and grime of Gaza's crowded,
squalid chaos are forgotten. Besides the zoo, the Israeli
settlement boasts a high school, recreational facilities, a
synagogue, a seminary college and a botanical garden, all ensconced
behind a barbed wire fence guarded by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   As most settlers see it, they have a right to live in Gaza and
the army has an obligation to protect them. If they evacuate Gaza,
they say, an Israeli retreat from the West Bank will inevitably
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Unless security deteriorates to unbearable levels, few settlers
seem willing to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see that it will be insecure for our children, that will
be a reason to leave,'' Naomi says. ``But now I think it's a great
place to raise children, here in the country. We don't even really
need to go out anywhere. Everything we need is in here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT IS STILL PART OF GAZA' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Neve Dakalim, past banana trees and tomato fields,
teen-age Palestinian girls play volleyball at a makeshift summer
camp set up in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Run by Zenab al-Wazir, the sister of slain Palestinian guerrilla
Abu Jihad, the camp, like most things in Gaza, is rife with
political symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Even the camp's name _ Statehood and Return _ is saturated with
meaning. Independence and the right of return for Palestinian
refugees displaced by wars with Israel have become almost sacred
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the volleyball nets, two shrines to ``martyrs'' who died
in clashes with Israeli soldiers display the faces of young
Palestinian men. Large banners read, ``Jerusalem is the capital of
Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Camps like this have sprung up all over Gaza, even in Gush
Katif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still part of Gaza,'' says al-Wazir, the camp's
director.
</P>
<P>
   Her words speak volumes about the way Palestinians view the
Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Most consider the red-roofed houses as temporary intrusions on
Palestinian land. They view the settlers who live in them as
nuisances who use security as a pretext to bring Israeli soldiers
to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel wants real peace, they say, the settlements will have
to go.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE PRICE OF PEACE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Peleg understands the Palestinian viewpoint. She is one
of a handful of Gaza's Jewish citizens who came to Kfar Yam, a tiny
beach settlement near Neve Dakalim, for the quiet aesthetic life
that it offered. She espouses none of the religious or
nationalistic beliefs that brought most settlers to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here, because I wanted a quiet place where I can
work,'' says Peleg, who paints and makes pottery. ``If I could pick
all of this up and put it somewhere else, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Peleg says the government should offer aid to settlers who want
to leave Gaza but are trapped by mortgage payments and other debts.
</P>
<P>
   If help were available, she and her husband, Nir, could afford
to leave their greenhouse, where they grow carnations for export to
Europe, and begin again somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Peleg and others launched a campaign to try to
persuade the government to compensate settlers who wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with peace negotiations stalled, the demands for
compensation are dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most vocal settlers moved out of Gaza without
compensation. Others, like Peleg, are quietly waiting to see what
negotiations will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradox,'' Peleg says. ``We want peace, but real peace
would mean the settlements would have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will cost me my way of life.''

HISTORY BOOKS AND MOVIES OVERLOOKED FORGOTTEN COWBOYS OF SOUTH
TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REFUGIO, Texas _ The image of the Texas cowboy has been deeply
stamped in our minds: tall, weathered, rugged, Marlboroesque _ and
white.
</P>
<P>
   That image is dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Wayne wouldn't be nothing beside of us,'' Nathaniel
Youngblood, a black cowboy from the Texas coastal plains, was fond
of saying. ``They just didn't take our picture. John Wayne and Tim
Holt, Durango Kid, and that other one _ Gene Autry, oh, no. They
ain't nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the coastal bend of Texas, nearly a third of the cowboys
pushing cattle up the Texas trails in the 1840s were black. Roughly
another third were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   They never enjoyed a place in the prevailing cowboy myth _ these
weren't flashy rodeo cowboys, or the silver-saddled cowboys of the
movies _ but they helped forge ranching empires along the coastal
plains.
</P>
<P>
   They were poor people from meager beginnings _ slavery primarily
_ but they learned to work cattle on the muggy landscape. They
lived on the ranches, raised their families there, worked tooth and
nail, and accrued an uncommon respect.
</P>
<P>
   Their descendants remain there today, a century and a half later
_ the last of their kind.
</P>
<P>
   Another generation works the ranches now, but they drive trucks
from brick homes in town to the pastures. They haul their horses in
trailers. And there aren't as many of them as there once were.
Technology has wiped out some of the jobs. Many, including the sons
and daughters of the old black cowboys, have found better pay and
benefits in town. The work is easier, too.
</P>
<P>
   Toney Lott is one of the original cowboys, one of only a dozen
or so left in this flat, brushy country just off the Gulf Coast. At
92, he is the oldest.
</P>
<P>
   When Lott talks about his early days around the ranches of South
Texas, he insists that his Bible be close by. It serves as proof
he's telling the truth, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It is by God's grace that he's still alive, Lott says. Wild
cattle, mean horses and bad weather have all chipped away at him.
He started out dirt poor in the backwoods of the San Antonio River
bottoms, but says the Lord's hand left him rich in pride and
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is sitting at the O'Connor ranch with fellow cowboys E.J.
Garza, 80; K.J. Oliver, 84; and Willie Brown, 69. Both Garza and
Oliver were born on ranches and began their cowboy careers before
they reached 10. Garza left ranching at 15 to follow the rodeo
circuit but was back within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Garza and Oliver are retired now; Brown works for the sheriff's
department in Refugio.
</P>
<P>
   Lott glances around the air-conditioned room and gathers his
thoughts. Then, with a voice that comes from deep within and
explodes as a shout, he proclaims: ``The Lord was the one that got
us here. I remember a time when we couldn't be around no white
folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you all know we'd be sitting out there under a tree
somewhere,'' he says, shaking a finger at the rest of the group.
``The white people be in here, the Spanish-speaking people out
there with us under that tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``But see how the Lord fixed it? We're all together now. Look
where we come from.''
</P>
<P>
   CRYIN' FOR DAYLIGHT TO COME: Where they come from is the vast,
humid, brushy land in and around Refugio, Goliad, Victoria and San
Patricio counties. It is an old area where cattle and cattlemen
have worked for centuries. They were always different from their
northern counterparts _ never all white, always heavily Spanish and
African.
</P>
<P>
   At first, in the 1700s, the men who worked the cattle were
``vaqueros'' of Spanish and Indian descent, called ``mestizos.''
Later, there were ``mulattos,'' African and Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico wanted the land populated, both to provide commerce and
to establish a barrier against unfriendly Indians who often raided
deep into its territory. By the 1820s, the Spanish were promising
huge land grants to those who would come.
</P>
<P>
   The whites who first settled here were Catholic colonists from
Ireland. Eventually, others came from the coastal regions of
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama in the 1820s and 1830s. They
brought with them their whips, dogs and slaves to work the cattle.
</P>
<P>
   South Texas, though, was far more vast than the small pastures
they were accustomed to. The raw-boned, half-wild cattle were
unlike the Eastern breeds they worked. The whips and dogs were
overwhelmed; slaves on foot were useless.
</P>
<P>
   The slaves, watching the ``vaqueros,'' learned to work
horseback. They continued, generation to generation. Families
intermarried; Spanish, black and Anglo heritages became
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all mixed in,'' says Oliver, who went to work in 1929,
the same day his father drowned while swimming cattle across a
river. ``Some white, Mexicans, blacks ... we all eat at the same
table, and we all looked out for each other's interest. You never
know who's going to get in a jam, and you had to have somebody help
you out. You couldn't walk around with a chip on your shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   No one had much, he says, but what they had they shared. If one
man had a biscuit and the other had corn bread, they divided it
evenly. If one had a nickel, they all had a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were raised together,'' Lott says. ``I didn't get no higher
than the third grade, and I didn't learn anything then. Listen. I
ain't lying, we were very poor people. Me and Papa had to go
hunting for coons, polecats and possums to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The cowboys didn't get any richer by working cattle. When Lott
started, the pay was 50 cents a day. By the time Oliver and Garza
came along a few years later, the daily wage had inched up to
$1.25.
</P>
<P>
   They all worked the same ranches _ the O'Brien, the O'Connor,
the McFaddin. Those ranches are still there today, though they are
known as much for their oil production as for their cattle. The
O'Connor, established in 1836, still covers a half-million acres
and is still run by the O'Connor family.
</P>
<P>
   Louise O'Connor, a fifth-generation family member, published a
book on cowboys and ranchers in the area. She called it ``Cryin'
for Daylight,'' after what one cowhand told her: ``We just loved to
work cattle so much we'd just be sittin' around cryin' for daylight
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the hours you worked,'' says Brown. ``You just
worked until the job was done. Sometimes you would get your horses
ready before breakfast.'' It might be dark when you returned. That
was working ``from can't to can't'' _ you can't see when you get
up, and you can't see when you lay down.
</P>
<P>
   Like all cowboys, those on the coast got beans to eat, but most
of the time they were out in the pasture and had to make do with
strings of tasso. ``When you kill a beef, you string it; make
strings out of the meat,'' Brown explains. ``Then you would trim
most of the fat off, leave some on it. Every morning you would hang
it out on a line, just high enough so the dogs couldn't get to it.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``You could soak it in water all night, then the next morning
fry it and take it with you, or make a stew out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer the meat dried in the burning sun, the longer it
would last. The cowboys coated it with cornmeal and pepper _ not
for seasoning, but to keep the flies away.
</P>
<P>
   USING THE FRONT DOOR: Working cattle on the coastal plains was
like working cattle anywhere; the meanest of the steers would break
from the herds and try to hook the horses with their horns. The
bulls would stand on their back feet and fight a rope. Cows had to
be doctored daily against screwworms, and the whole herd had to be
dipped for ticks.
</P>
<P>
   In the pasture, all the cowboys were equal. Only the top hands
stood out, and they had loftier positions because of their ability
to rope, or ride or handle cattle. Color had nothing to do with a
man's stature.
</P>
<P>
   In town, it wasn't the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lott remembers the time a calf kicked him in the head and
knocked him out. James Welder, the boss at the Welder ranch, loaded
Lott in the truck and took him to Victoria to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   When everything checked out all right, Welder and Lott went for
lunch at the Manhattan Cafe in town. Blacks were expected to go to
the back door for service, but Welder ushered Lott through the
front door with him.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress brought a single glass of water to the table;
Welder insisted on another.
</P>
<P>
   Lott couldn't read the menu, so he waited for Welder to order _
a T-bone and french fries. Lott ordered the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I was getting,'' he says. ``I'm telling you
the truth. I got one of my french fries. Scared to death, I cut off
a piece of my steak, and that's all I had. I left all that good
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the ranch, Welder joked with the other cowboys,
claiming, ``Old Toney ate a whole cow.'' The crew pressed in close
to Lott, asking him if it was true that he went in the front door
and ate at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yeah, I went in there.' That was something. I was
about 18 or 19 years old, and you didn't see that at that time,''
Lott says.
</P>
<P>
   In town, Lott had to endure racial epithets, but on the ranch he
was treated the equal of any man. Even the bosses asked permission
to ride his horses. They did that with all the cowboys. It was
understood.
</P>
<P>
   BORN A COWBOY: Their memories sustain them now. They are men who
endured the hardships of the coastal plains and carved out
individual reputations _ Oliver with a rope, Garza riding tough
horses, Lott and Brown handling cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Life has never been as good for them as when they rode herd in
the hot sun. They never held their heads as high as when they were
working cowboys. They would continue to ride out at the break of
day if age hadn't stiffened their joints and shortened their
strides.
</P>
<P>
   They miss their friends: Nathaniel Youngblood died in November;
the Rev. Mack Williams, one of their most ardent spokesmen and a
spiritual leader, died in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in the middle of a pasture, so I was born a
cowboy,'' Williams once said. ``When I was just a kid I would hang
out with the cow crowd, eating and sleeping with them, and
eventually, I became a cowboy without even trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was raised on the O'Connor ranch. His grandfather,
Thornton, was a slave sold at auction in Louisiana to the O'Connor
family.
</P>
<P>
   Williams became a man of God in the 1940s when, while riding a
pasture, he heard a voice calling him to the Lord. He retired as a
cowboy and established his own church in Tivoli.
</P>
<P>
   Their memories are kept alive by their widows, who also worked
on area ranches. ``I was born and raised on the Pete Fagan Ranch in
Tivoli, and my family was nothin' but cowboys, so I married a
cowboy,'' Alice Mae Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Youngblood remembers her husband's love of ranching.
``They might be gone five or six or seven days at a time. Then on
Sunday night they would be ready to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood was proud of his heritage. He worked hard to gain it.
``These ranches were strength to us,'' he once said. ``It was our
backbone _ like leanin' on somethin' _ you don't worry about
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems impossible, the things we done. We'd do it and leave
the sun hangin'.''

EVANGELIST OFFERS HIS TAKE ON WOMEN, LOVE AND GOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men and women don't speak the same language, says Bishop T.D.
Jakes, a talented writer, nationally known evangelist and pastor of
a megachurch between Fort Worth and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``The Lady, Her Lover, and Her Lord,'' Jakes
says that men often don't use verbal communication to express their
deepest emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men seldom speak love with words,'' he asserts. ``We speak
love in glistening eyes. We speak it in heavy sighs and tender
smiles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jakes is not at a loss for words in discussing male-female
relationships, whether in the bedroom, the church or the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes sex, love and God to make a marriage last,'' writes
the pastor of the 15,000-member Potter's House congregation in
Dallas, who appears on national television each week.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, released by G.P. Putnam's Sons and selling for
$19.95, is already at the top of the Publisher's Weekly list of
bestselling religious books.
</P>
<P>
   Women, to be happy, must learn to love themselves. Then they
must develop a close relationship with God, and then they are ready
for a lover, or life partner, Jakes says.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they have an intimacy with God, he states, women tend to
look to their husband as ``a god,'' and inevitably will be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, 40, one of the most prominent Pentecostal evangelists in
the nation, moved from West Virginia to Texas in 1996 and started
the Potter's House. His multiracial church is one of the country's
fastest-growing congregations, and its members include Dallas
Cowboys players Deion Sanders and Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelist's rise to national prominence has been
significantly fueled by his flair for speaking meaningfully to
women.
</P>
<P>
   His first bestseller, ``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!,'' declares that
women can heal the verbal, physical and emotional abuse they
receive from men. Every year, Jakes conducts ``Woman, Thou Art
Loosed!'' conferences. The latest one, this year, drew 20,000 women
to the Ice Palace Arena in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The new volume builds on his earlier writings about women. Jakes
declares that men and women are not far apart in their needs,
thoughts and desires, but that they have differing ways of
expressing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter titled ``Make Him Feel Safe Enough to Love You,''
he says men often fall silent when asked to express their emotions
because they fear being rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far easier for him to give his money, his body, his
advice; but when he gives his heart, then he is terrified,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't say that women should submit to men, Jakes
says women who make more money than their spouses should find a way
to make their husbands feel that they have the primary role in
providing for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kills a man's spirit when he cannot take care of his
family,'' he says. ``He feels worthless, unmotivated and
defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Jakes plunges into sensual language. He describes Eve
in the Garden of Eden as a beautiful woman whose soft, satiny skin
was covered only by the bright yellow rays of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the night, the moonlight cradled her breast with tender
hands and a radiant glow,'' he continues. In another part of the
book, he warns of the dangers of depending solely on ``the burning
passion that erupts like a volcano, releasing the hot lava that
burns through clothes, rips covers from a bed, and leaves satisfied
partners panting in sweet tranquillity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, who is happily married and has five children, defends his
use of sensual imagery. He says that Christians are normal people
who lead sexual lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious, from the many children you see in the church,
that we have relationships,'' he said. ``It doesn't assassinate the
integrity of my faith to admit I'm a sensual being who struggles
with passion like anyone else.''

EMPLOYERS FIND EX-PEERS TELL MORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employers have warned their managers for years not to provide
much information about a former employee when a prospective
employer calls for a job reference.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about lawsuits from former employees who are unhappy
about what was said, company officials instruct their front-line
supervisors to provide only the former worker's title and dates of
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the dearth of information, some employers are
striking back. Instead of calling a former supervisor and hitting a
brick wall, they're calling the folks who have never been warned
not to provide details: the applicant's former peers, who are happy
to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Peers provide a lot of valuable information and often have a
good handle on what makes a candidate ``tick,'' said Bill Bufkins,
director of human resources for Johnson Engineering Corp. in
Webster, Texas. Co-workers know about an applicant's work habits
and whether he's a good performer, said Bufkins, who regularly
calls peers when his company is considering a candidate. And peers
often are not as guarded as supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Peer evaluations often provide better information than a
supervisor, said Mel Kleiman, president of Humetrics, a consulting
company in Houston that designs recruiting and retention systems
for companies. For example, a supervisor may hem and haw about why
an employee was terminated. A co-worker often will lay it on the
line _ he was so bad, everyone wondered how long the company was
going to keep him around.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the popularity of work teams, it's often the
co-workers who know more anyway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiman suggests that employers ask a job candidate for names
and phone numbers of co-workers. And 90 to 95 percent of the time,
Kleiman estimates, they'll talk about their co-worker's job
performance.
</P>
<P>
   There's also another plus to this approach: It's a great
recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to all those co-workers is a great way to find other
good employees, said Bufkins. When he was considering an engineer
for a job, Bufkins called one of the candidate's co-workers who
mentioned he was looking for a job himself.
</P>
<P>
   The co-worker turned out to be a dream candidate with his great
breadth of experience and wide range of skills, said Bufkins, who
ended up hiring him, too.
</P>
<P>
   A senior human resource executive from an industrial service
company in Houston said he also tries to recruit the co-workers an
applicant supplies for a job reference.
</P>
<P>
   They are typically good employees because people associate with
people like themselves, he said, asking not to be identified
because he doesn't want his competitors to know how he is stealing
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch is easy once he has them on the phone, he said. A
rapport is developed, and he tells the co-worker that he sounds
good, too, and might he possibly consider a job change?
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the time they end up switching jobs, said the
human resource executive. He also credits the fact that his company
keeps its human resource office open until 8 p.m. during the week
and open on the weekends to accommodate job candidates who can't
come in during the day because they're working or in school.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers have done a great job warning supervisors and
managers on the dos and don'ts when asked to comment on a former
employee's job performance, many employers don't realize that the
comments from lower-level employees can get them into big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Say, for example, a prospective employer asks a co-worker about
his colleague's suitability for work and the co-worker mentions his
friend stole from the company. If it isn't true, the co-worker's
employer could wind up with a defamation lawsuit on his hands, said
Dorene B. Cohen, an employment lawyer with Vinson &AMP; Elkins in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who represents employers, said she would argue that
commenting on an employee's job performance is not within the
duties of the co-worker and that he is not authorized to speak for
the company. But it's a sticky situation, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends that employers put in employee handbooks that all
requests for information on a worker's job performance should be
directed to human resources. The handbook should go on to say that
any infraction could result in disciplinary action, including
termination, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not a bad idea to send out a memo once a year to
reiterate the rule, Cohen said.

 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Barbara Clementine Harris knelt at the altar, her
68-year-old knees padded only by her cassock's thin beige cloth.
Head lowered, she gently lifted a wet cloth from a plastic tub and
washed a man's bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   The foot washing is a yearly Episcopal ritual, symbolic of
Jesus' washing the Apostles' feet, a show of humility. For those
gathered, seeing Harris humbled was impressive. After all, she is
the suffragan (assisting) bishop for Massachusetts, which means she
is second in command of the nation's largest Episcopal diocese. She
has held the job since 1988, when she became the first woman
elected as a bishop in the world's 70-million member Anglican
Church.
</P>
<P>
   But what the 12 barefoot celebrants may not have known is that
they were seeing just one side of Harris, who, before becoming a
priest at age 50, spent nearly three decades as a corporate
executive _ occasionally barefoot herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara used to sit at her desk and take off her shoes while
she talked on the phone,'' said Bud Davis, who worked for Harris
when she was a Sun Oil Co. public relations manager. ``She'd turn
her head, and we'd go in and steal her shoe. Practical jokes were
not only tolerated, they were expected in Barbara's department.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was 30 years ago, when Harris was known for throwing
fabulous dinner parties in her native Philadelphia. And this is
now. Being a bishop for 10 years has to have changed Harris, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Dorothy Cousins, a retired Philadelphia
police detective who has been one of Harris's closest friends since
seventh grade. Harris still drives her BMW. She still vacations at
a condo in Cancun, Mexico. She still calls her three best friends _
friends she's had for 60 years _ once a week. She still has a
cleaning lady. She still spends her free time listening to
classical music. She still cooks like a chef. Harris has not
changed. It just so happens that she has always been a complex and
motivated human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't set out in life to be a bishop,'' Harris mused
during an interview in her office on the fourth floor of the
diocesan headquarters on Tremont Street, across from Boston Common.
``At least I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, dressed impeccably in slacks, a shirt tailored for her
petite frame, and purple pumps several shades removed from her nail
polish, did not choose to sit behind her large desk. Instead, she
offered her guest a seat on the crimson sofa and positioned herself
on a hard wooden chair nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's religious mentor, Philadelphia's Reverend Paul
Washington, said that when he thinks of Harris, he gets an image of
a witty storyteller standing in front of a giggling group of
onlookers in her living room. He said he has often suggested,
almost seriously, that she be a stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
   But in this formal office setting, that sense of humor was
clearly under wraps. Harris spoke in measured tones, outlining her
schedule as dryly as a press release. She works about 80 hours a
week, much of it spent behind the wheel of her car, en route to
churches, or to her home in Foxborough, Mass. The 45-minute
interview, rare and methodical, was all she could fit in.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the office, however, hinted at the passions Harris
has experienced since she was a young girl. The framed watercolor
of a stained-glass window in a Roxbury, Mass. church spoke of her
upbringing in a black Episcopal parish; the honorary degrees showed
that little in life is impossible if you have faith (Harris never
completed college); the colorful African wall hangings were a
reminder that, despite the church's reputation in New England as a
white Anglo-Saxon institution, most Anglicans worldwide are not
white. (There are more in Uganda and Nigeria than in all of the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was a framed photograph of Harris herself, a
staff in one hand. A secret smile played at the corner of her
mouth. She looked as if she was meant to be here. As if someone had
called her. And, according to Harris, someone did.
</P>
<P>
   God.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Harris was 16 years old, and it was New Year's Eve. Her
friend Marilyn Allston was over at the Harris family home in
Germantown, Pa. The girls were doing their hair and laying out the
dresses they would wear for their double date. The plan was to go
to a church social. But the girls were sleepy and decided to take a
nap. When they woke up, it was past midnight. The boys had been
sent home, and they'd missed the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other, and I said, `What are we going to do
now?''' recalled Allston. ``The first thing Barbara said is `We are
going to pray.' That's the kind of person she's always been.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A segregated life
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris grew up in a black neighborhood outside Philadelphia at a
time when life was segregated, including the YMCA, where her
picture now hangs in the Hall of Fame. Her father was a quiet,
gentle, and educated man who labored at a local steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days you had doctors working at the post office,''
said Allston. ``Among blacks, just because someone worked a
blue-collar job did not mean they were not well educated or well
mannered.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's mother, Beatrice, was a classical pianist who worked as
the organist and choir director at the neighborhood church, Saint
Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call her Miss Bea,'' recalled Washington. ``I knew
Miss Bea rather well. She was a very outspoken person, unafraid to
address the issue or the question, no matter how sensitive. I
certainly feel that she gave Barbara a good dose of that dimension
in herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's elder sister, Josephine, still lives in the family
home. Younger brother Walter lives in Florida. Harris said she is
close to both.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Harris kept busy with school, piano lessons, church
activities, and writing. At the Philadelphia High School for Girls,
she was recruited to write a weekly column on high school life in
the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper aimed at the African-American
community. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making religion fun
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoons and evenings, friends recall, the Harris
home, with its enclosed porch and baby grand piano, was the place
to go. ``Barbara and her family had a way of making elegance, and
even religion, seem fun,'' said Dorothy Cousins. At 16, Cousins
converted to the Episcopal Church, just so ``I could go with
Barbara.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Harris attended
Philadelphia's Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and
Journalism. In 1949, at age 19, she was hired by Joseph V. Baker
Associates Inc., a local public relations firm. Without a college
degree, but armed with a quick mind, Harris moved up in the
company. By the time she left, in 1968, she was the president.

 (Repeating for all needing.)  
 UNDATED: ... was the president.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1968, Harris took a job at Sun Oil as a community relations
consultant. Once again, she was promoted, eventually chosen to head
the company's public relations department in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was briefly married and divorced. She has no children.
None of her friends was willing to talk about the former husband,
except to say that he remained close enough to the family to attend
Miss Bea's funeral. Harris declined to answer questions about her
personal romantic life.
</P>
<P>
   Key elements in Harris's life have been her friendships, her
civil rights activism, and her work in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church was not something to be played with for Barbara,'' said
Washington. He met Harris in the mid-1950s, when both worked as
church youth counselors. ``She was never someone you could describe
as a pew warmer. She was going to get in the midst of things.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Civil rights crusader
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris switched parishes as an adult to be closer to Washington,
a priest and author well known in Philadelphia for his political
activism. Fighting for the rights of blacks and women became a
central part of her life during the 1960s. She marched with Martin
Luther King Jr. and worked for the Urban League and other
organizations. She is still active in Episcopal groups for
African-Americans and is very outspoken against the church's
lingering disapproval of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Harris, still a laywoman, was asked to be the cross
bearer at a historic ceremony in Philadelphia when the first 11
women were ordained as Episcopal priests.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a beautiful foreshadowing of what was to come,''
according to Reverend Ann Robb Smith, now the priest at Harris's
hometown church, and one of many in attendance that day who
remember her leading the procession.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the ceremony, Harris said, she felt God tugging
at her to become more involved in the church. When asked to
describe that time in her life, Harris got a look in her eyes that
was so peaceful and intense it bordered on sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to explain,'' she said. ``I had a very
active lay ministry, which was very satisfying. But I discovered
that there was a different shape to my ministry, and that I was
being led to the ordained ministry for a different dimension of
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled against it for a long time. I didn't feel that I
was a worthy candidate. A friend of mine who was a priest and is
now a bishop said, `God does not call those who are worthy; he
makes worthy those who are called.' That helped.''
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to become a priest, Harris continued working at
Sun Oil. She took seminary classes nights and weekends and spent
her vacations studying, a nontraditional route. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Entering the order
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris was ordained a deacon in 1979, and a priest in 1980, at
the age of 50. She left her position at Sun, but remained a
consultant for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Her first religious job was as part-time priest in charge of a
church in Norristown, Pa., called Saint Augustine of Hippo. Then,
in 1984, Harris was named executive director of the Episcopal
Church Publishing Co. and publisher of The Witness magazine, long
an open forum for dissent within the church. Harris had been on the
board of the company for years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she took Washington's place as interim director of the
Church of the Advocate when he had stepped down. That same year,
she attended the Lambeth Convention, a gathering of Anglican
bishops from all over the world, in Canterbury, England, as a
reporter for The Witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was open talk at the time that a woman might be elected
in the United States,'' said Reverend Canon Edward W. Rodman, the
canon missioner for Massachusetts and Harris's friend for 30 years.
``Her name was lifted up at that time as one of the possible
candidates. She came back sort of on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really torn about whether it was something I really
wanted to do,'' said Harris. ``I thought about all of the potential
problems. I thought I wouldn't be nominated, as a woman. Then I
thought that I would not be elected, even if I was nominated ... I
was greatly surprised at each step in the process.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Caring and alert'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came in for the formal interview with the committee,
it was so very clear in that time that she would be one of the
nominees,'' said John J. Bishop, a retired priest living in
Yarmouthport, who chaired the committee that elected Harris as a
bishop. ``She was just caring, alert, bright, committed to the
issues that were confronting the church at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington remembers the day Harris was elected. ``She received
a call from David Johnson, the bishop of Massachusetts at the time,
saying she had been elected. I did the sermon at her ordination to
the priesthood, and she called and said `You better get another
speech prepared.' That was deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's consecration as bishop was widely supported in this
liberal state. But some in the church, such as the Episcopal bishop
of South Carolina, who resigned one week after Harris was selected,
said her unorthodox religious education was unacceptable. Others
showed up at the consecration to protest, because of Harris's
gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the protests were very personal,'' Harris said. ``I
got death threats.'' She stopped to grin, and added, ``All in the
name of the Lord, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since Harris became a bishop, her performance
has opened doors for other women in the church. There are now eight
female bishops in the United States, seven in Canada, and one in
New Zealand. ``That's why the people who protested did so,'' Harris
said. ``They knew that if one woman was consecrated, that there
would be no stopping us after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has also elevated the visibility of nonwhites in the
local Episcopal church, which has become increasingly diverse. She
works in tandem with the diocesan bishop, Thomas Shaw, in a
relationship that those who know them describe as harmonious and
productive. The arrangement, by which they share most duties, is a
new system, and one that Rodman says was created to increase
Harris's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her energy, and her clear love of the work, church rules
require that all bishops retire at 72, four years from now for
Harris. Though she is vague about her plans after retirement, those
who know her say to stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that we haven't seen the best from Barbara Harris
yet,'' said Rodman. ``There's no telling what she'll do next, but
you can be sure it will be amazing.''

LET'S CURB SPREADING REQUESTS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll admit to being way behind the curve on this tidbit of
information, but then, I haven't had to renew my driver's license
in person in more than six year.
</P>
<P>
   The white sign with its bold red letters, hanging above the
heads of the Texas Department of Public Safety employees, announced
in no uncertain terms that all applicants must present a Social
Security card to receive a new, renewed or replacement driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   For something that was never supposed to be used as universal
identification, my nine-digit Social Security number sure gets a
workout.
</P>
<P>
   When the Social Security Administration was created in 1936, the
government assured the public that use of the number assigned to
each citizen would be limited to Social Security programs. Being
that no assurances ever made by the government is a promise, the
United States Code has been amended to allow states (or any
political subdivision of the federal government) the use of Social
Security account numbers in the administration of taxes or general
public assistance, or the issuance of driver's licenses or motor
vehicle registration.
</P>
<P>
   Since Feb. 3, 1997, Texans renewing their driver's licenses in
person or requesting a duplicate have been forced to provide what
should be a very private piece of information. The reason? The
state attorney general's office needs help in tracking down folks
delinquent in their child support. So we all get treated like
potential felons in the name of the Texas Family Code.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why you great outdoorsmen and women preparing for the
upcoming game seasons are going to be asked for your Social
Security number when you apply for a hunting permit. The AG is
using every type of state-issued license to track down deadbeat
parents.
</P>
<P>
   There was no use in refusing the pleasant but firm woman behind
the counter at the Department of Public Safety office _ no SSN, no
driver's license. I need a driver's license to do my job, among
other things crucial in my life, so I presented said card. But not
happily.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an upside to the Texas experience, at least the state
doesn't use Social Security numbers as the driver's license number.
Some do.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you living in a state where such information is not
yet required, get ready. In October 2000, a federal immigration law
will go into effect that mandates all states to record Social
Security numbers for all driver's licenses and state-issued ID
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations dealing with privacy issues warn citizens to guard
their Social Security account numbers as precious information.
According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, banks and credit
card companies across the nation are reporting increases in
SSN-related fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Resist at every turn in providing a Social Security number to
retailers, telemarketers or nongovernmental agencies that request
it. Although the original law has been bastardized to allow use of
the number for government programs other than Social Security, that
doesn't mean you have to let go of the information without a fight.
If a retailer demands that you put the number on a check, take your
business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Why should people care about who has access to their account
numbers? Because someone can literally steal your identity, running
up charges, ruining your credit and basically wrecking havoc on
your good name without your knowing about it until after
considerable damage is done.

`THAT 70'S SHOW': HEART AND HORMONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trappings of ``That 70's Show'' are specific. The decade is
invoked through leisure suits and bell bottoms; lava lamps, smiley
faces and the Hustle, and references to Todd Rundgren and the
gasoline shortage. But the appeal of this new sitcom, which Fox is
unveiling Sunday night, is its universal heart. Peering out from
beneath the laugh track is the coming-of-age story of a 17-year-old
boy and the girl next door, his lifelong pal who has unsettlingly
become the object of his hormone-soaked reverie.
</P>
<P>
   If neither the decade nor the adolescent yearnings were ever
this sweet, the nostalgia is appealingly packaged by a bunch of
seasoned pros. The executive producers include Marcy Carsey, Tom
Werner and Caryn Mandabach (``The Cosby Show,'' ``Roseanne'' et
al.), as well as Bonnie and Terry Turner, creators of ``Third Rock
From the Sun,'' who wrote Sunday's episode.
</P>
<P>
   No one is blazing bold trails. Here is a white suburban family,
the Foremans, living in Point Place, Wis., in 1976. Mom (Debra Jo
Rupp) is a nurse; Dad (Kurtwood Smith) has some kind of job at
which his hours have been cut back. The economy, you know. They
have just taken a big step and bought a Toyota. ``The last time I
was that close to a Japanese machine, it was shootin' at me,'' says
Dad. (Wait a minute. He's in his late 40s in 1976? How old was he
in, say, '43? Oh, never mind.) Under their polyester clothes, they
are stock parents from television's eternity, a little dim but
basically good folks.
</P>
<P>
   When first glimpsed, their son, Eric (Topher Grace), is sitting
in the basement rec room with his goofy guy friends, also out of
the sitcom cupboard, and that neighbor, the red-haired Donna (Laura
Prepon). There is immediate chemistry between these adorable young
people. Something is happening that they clearly don't understand.
The look in Eric's eye, a mixture of fear, excitement and
resignation, is both more eloquent and more funny than the words he
speaks. (This show wins higher marks for sit than for com.) As for
Donna _ well, if more guys had girls like her next door, a lot of
them would never leave home.
</P>
<P>
   Eric and his friends are a bit more rebellious than Richie
Cunningham's gang on ``Happy Days,'' a decade-clinging show this
series inevitably calls to mind. The '70s teen-agers swipe some
beer and smoke some pot. But Eric's guilty pleasure comes from
taking the family car all the way to Milwaukee against Dad's
orders. The sweetness here is never saccharine, but it might seem
rather mild to viewers just coming off a half-hour of ``The
Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   The second episode, to be shown next week (written by the
Turners and Mark Brazil), has more laughs. When Eric and his
friends are having an unsupervised (though tame) party at home, his
mother imagines the worst: They're recklessly endangering her
furniture by _ gasp! _ not using coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the joke count, this show will rise or fall on the quiet
adventures of Eric and Donna. Clunky heels or not, you've been in
their shoes. And you know that some day she's going to break his
heart.

   Ranan Lurie is an internationally known political cartoonist and
analyst, whose work is published in 103 countries in 1,105
newspapers with a total circulation of 104 million readers. A
former Israeli Army combat major, who served as a commando during
the Six Day War _ and survived 144 paratrooper jumps into enemy
territory _ Lurie is also a master military tactician.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks here about the U.S. retaliatory raid into Sudan and
Afghanistan and raises important questions about U.S. goals, combat
readiness and willingness to fight _ as well as our understanding
of terrorism and the degree of threat it poses for the future.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: What do you think of the U.S. mission into
Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for the embassy bombings in
Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: The problem with this action is the historical
problem of human warfare, where generals always prepare for the
last war. Generals plan the next war according to the criteria of
the last war.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the French prepared the Maginot line in the late
'30s according to the trench warfare of World War I, and the
Germans just made a big circle with their very fast Panzer tanks
and encircled them. And France just fell. The French were not
planning for such a blitzkrieg.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's come back to what happened now.
</P>
<P>
   A: The cruise missiles were the most anticipated guests of those
super-Saudi Arabian/Afghanistani terrorists. The United States has
established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as much
as possible on technology, and sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. We don't want to report about casualties. So what
happened here ... that gentlemen, Osama bin Laden, just prepared
himself for it. The fact is that he is living deep in the
mountains. He is well-prepared for cruise missiles; he is not
impressed by them. And the cruise missiles really cannot serve any
function against terrorists unless they have a known, above-ground
headquarters or training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of today, what should U.S. forces be doing instead?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta force-type units, special-commando forces that also
enjoy superb intelligence. This is where the CIA has to come in
very strongly. The units would actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Meaning what?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clear the area, meaning demolish the ... for instance, I
could envision an attack from Pakistan, with the aid of Pakistan,
of our very superior helicopters, on that specific spot, protected
by air power, and a unit of about two companies coming down,
knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place. And hopefully
capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do we not do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pardon me?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't have the stomach for it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which means?
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Of ... let us
take when President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran
in '79. He sent the helicopters and the helicopters got screwed up
... there was a sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was also taken as a certain sign of inadequacy of the
training of our troops.
</P>
<P>
   A: Correct. There has to be, and I hope we have these kinds of
units ... we are speaking really about nothing more than a few
hundred top warriors who go out to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Delta Force, SEALS ...
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes exactly. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so much
fire power, they could demolish the place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That leads us back to stomach. Is this a problem,
particularly given what war scenarios are going to be in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Look, I would say that the bin Laden individual is a person
who is so rich _ he's a billionaire, not merely a millionaire. And
there is already talk that he is planning a nuclear bomb,
purchasing a nuclear bomb. If this guy will deliver such a bomb to
Philadelphia or New York or Los Angeles without any moral
hesitation _ and establish himself as a hero for the next 1,000
years in the fanatic Islamic world _ well, we have to compare
stomachs to stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   We have to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20
or 30 very good young warriors to the stomach we'll need to face
the loss of millions in a metropolitan area of the United States.
This is not a game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Based on your knowledge of American society, what will
meeting the challenge have to come to?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will have to come to American society understanding the
real threat _ the real nuclear threat _ to our cities, in order to
understand that we have to sacrifice everything in order to reach
him before he reaches us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we saying it would take some kind of tragic disaster in a
major city to give us the stomach to retaliate in the way that is
required?
</P>
<P>
   A: Either this or a very graphic description that conveys the
knowledge that this is quite imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given the current skepticism about government, I wonder if
what you're suggesting is a realistic scenario.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid that it's not a realistic scenario. I'm afraid
that the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a military lip
service. In brief, we say something and we don't really mean it.
Here, it was a military operation that really could not solve a
problem. On the contrary, that kind of military reaction is almost
a knee-jerk reaction, because the military is shouting from here to
Timbuktu, so that all the world can hear: ``We can't afford losing
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say that you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists have a tremendous edge over us because they can relax.
They know that they are not going to suffer direct contact with
American forces. For they would lose in any kind of contact with
our elite troops. No one is trained as well as our elite troops.
I'm saying this ... my son is a West Point graduate and I know what
is happening there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is no timidity among Mr. bin Laden and his forces about
losing lives, or is there?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is none whatsoever. On the contrary, the whole concept
is, like the classic Iranian concept, that the terrorists who blow
themselves up in buses, driving toward our embassies or
marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them losing lives is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So if among those who were killed in the camp in Afghanistan,
any of them were terrorists, they would be heroes, or have ...
</P>
<P>
   A: They are shahids. Shahid is the Arab word for martyr. And as
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they have a life of terrific
_ a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You mentioned ``no moral hesitation'' in connection with a
bin Laden person being willing to take out numerous cities and
millions of people. There are some who view this as a sign of
principles, in that it reflects a belief system that is adhered to,
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and they should
be burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what Osama bin
Laden also thinks. That the Islamic way is the right way. That
America is Satan. And basically the only force that really stops
Islam from spreading is the American way of life and culture which
ruins the moral fabric of young people, including young Islamic
people. And therefore, we are condemned. And a nuclear bomb is a
very legal thing from his point of view, from his ``principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe the U.S. troops _ the special-ops you would
use in antiterrorist actions _ are ready to fight?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. That's why they volunteer. Once you volunteer to
the Green Beret or the Delta Force or to the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment. You make a declaration. No one forces them to do it.
And they join because of love of country, or maybe because of the
green beret, or they want to impress their girlfriends, or they
want to be higher paid, or they want action and adventure. In all
cases, they choose to do it. And they would like to do it because
that is what makes them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So who is it that doesn't have the stomach? Their mothers?
fathers?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's, yes, but ... it's not even the high command. It's
basically the politicians who have to report and to say, ``I'm
sorry but we failed miserably.'' You know, this fiasco in Iran
caused Carter tremendous damage. He came out as a very incompetent
leader. Of course, while he approved the mission, he didn't know
the details, so technically he wasn't responsible, but he WAS
responsible, he was the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And other commanders in chief would not want to accidentally
follow in those footsteps?
</P>
<P>
   A: Exactly. And when you have the cruise missile that does the
job, it sounds terrific. But they forget _ Clinton forgot _ that
the cruise missile by now is a very known quantity, a very known
weapon. It's not surprising any more.

years in the fanatic Islamic world _ well, we have to compare
stomachs to stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   We have to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20
or 30 very good young warriors to the stomach we'll need to face
the loss of millions in a metropolitan area of the United States.
This is not a game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Based on your knowledge of American society, what will
meeting the challenge have to come to?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will have to come to American society understanding the
real threat _ the real nuclear threat _ to our cities, in order to
understand that we have to sacrifice everything in order to reach
him before he reaches us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we saying it would take some kind of tragic disaster in a
major city to give us the stomach to retaliate in the way that is
required?
</P>
<P>
   A: Either this or a very graphic description that conveys the
knowledge that this is quite imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given the current skepticism about government, I wonder if
what you're suggesting is a realistic scenario.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid that it's not a realistic scenario. I'm afraid
that the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a military lip
service. In brief, we say something and we don't really mean it.
Here, it was a military operation that really could not solve a
problem. On the contrary, that kind of military reaction is almost
a knee-jerk reaction, because the military is shouting from here to
Timbuktu, so that all the world can hear: ``We can't afford losing
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say that you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists have a tremendous edge over us because they can relax.
They know that they are not going to suffer direct contact with
American forces. For they would lose in any kind of contact with
our elite troops. No one is trained as well as our elite troops.
I'm saying this ... my son is a West Point graduate and I know what
is happening there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is no timidity among Mr. bin Laden and his forces about
losing lives, or is there?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is none whatsoever. On the contrary, the whole concept
is, like the classic Iranian concept, that the terrorists who blow
themselves up in buses, driving toward our embassies or
marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them losing lives is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So if among those who were killed in the camp in Afghanistan,
any of them were terrorists, they would be heroes, or have ...
</P>
<P>
   A: They are shahids. Shahid is the Arab word for martyr. And as
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they have a life of terrific
_ a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You mentioned ``no moral hesitation'' in connection with a
bin Laden person being willing to take out numerous cities and
millions of people. There are some who view this as a sign of
principles, in that it reflects a belief system that is adhered to,
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and they should
be burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what Osama bin
Laden also thinks. That the Islamic way is the right way. That
America is Satan. And basically the only force that really stops
Islam from spreading is the American way of life and culture which
ruins the moral fabric of young people, including young Islamic
people. And therefore, we are condemned. And a nuclear bomb is a
very legal thing from his point of view, from his ``principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe the U.S. troops _ the special-ops you would
use in antiterrorist actions _ are ready to fight?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. That's why they volunteer. Once you volunteer to
the Green Beret or the Delta Force or to the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment. You make a declaration. No one forces them to do it.
And they join because of love of country, or maybe because of the
green beret, or they want to impress their girlfriends, or they
want to be higher paid, or they want action and adventure. In all
cases, they choose to do it. And they would like to do it because
that is what makes them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So who is it that doesn't have the stomach? Their mothers?
fathers?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's, yes, but ... it's not even the high command. It's
basically the politicians who have to report and to say, ``I'm
sorry but we failed miserably.'' You know, this fiasco in Iran
caused Carter tremendous damage. He came out as a very incompetent
leader. Of course, while he approved the mission, he didn't know
the details, so technically he wasn't responsible, but he WAS
responsible, he was the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And other commanders in chief would not want to accidentally
follow in those footsteps?
</P>
<P>
   A: Exactly. And when you have the cruise missile that does the
job, it sounds terrific. But they forget _ Clinton forgot _ that
the cruise missile by now is a very known quantity, a very known
weapon. It's not surprising any more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a sweltering Saturday in midsummer, when the department
stores in many big cities were dead, Jeffrey Kalinsky's Atlanta
mall boutique, which sells some of fashion's most desirable
designs, was jammed with customers.
</P>
<P>
   They were not bargain hunters at an end-of-summer sale, but
style mavens in search of full-price fall clothing from Helmut
Lang, Jil Sander and Comme des Garcons. The customers were so
numerous that the stockroom, bathroom and manager's office served
as dressing rooms. The floor was littered with Manolo Blahniks, the
counters and benches piled high with castoff Lucien Pellat-Finet
cashmere sweaters and sumptuous Dries van Noten skirts. It felt
like the backstage commotion of a runway show, with women in
mismatched outfits, scrambling to pull jackets and pants off the
racks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, work yourself, girl,'' Kalinsky chided a customer,
turning up the collar of a Prada coat she was trying on.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky, 35, a former shoe buyer for Barneys New York, arrived
in Atlanta in 1990, a Pied Piper of high fashion, convinced that a
desire for sophisticated apparel was not limited to Manhattan. His
insight, coupled with extraordinary personal attention to customers
_ he sometimes flies them to Europe to view runway shows with him _
has built a mini-empire of fashionable clothing below the
Mason-Dixon line.
</P>
<P>
   He owns three stores: Jeffrey, a multidesigner boutique; Bob
Ellis Shoes, a branch of his family's shoe-store chain, and a Jil
Sander boutique. All are connected in Phipps Plaza, a mall on
Peachtree Street in the Buckhead section of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the opinion of most people in the fashion industry that
if it's not in New York or L.A., then it doesn't exist,'' Kalinsky
said. ``We have a ton of people in Atlanta and everywhere who have
good taste and want nice things. You'd be shocked where my
customers come from _ Dothan, Ala., and Rome, Ga. A woman in
Mobile, Ala., who has money buys from me. She goes to Barneys in
New York, she calls Jil Sander in San Francisco, and then she
ultimately comes back to me because she realizes she doesn't have
to go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   With a reputation spread by word of mouth, even among fashion
insiders in Manhattan, Kalinsky's stores make more than 50 percent
of their multimillion-dollar yearly sales to out-of-town customers.
He handpicks items with a customer's shape and tastes in mind, then
sends off a package of clothes for her to try on. Other customers
fly to Atlanta expressly to visit his shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Atlanta today only to shop,'' Ellen Carey said,
standing before a mirror in an ivory Jil Sander skirt and sweater.
Ms. Carey, who said she is in her 30s, owns Seed, a wholesale and
public relations company in New York for young clothing designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a well-kept secret,'' she said of Kalinsky's stores.
``Jeffrey runs around and encourages you to try things you'd never
try. He has a total vision: the bag, the shoes and what else he's
bought, and puts it together in an amazing way. The joy of Jeffrey
is he does know what you want in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Also, you feel really glamorous flying to Atlanta
for the day to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Reses, an investment banker at Goldman, Sachs in New
York, accidentally discovered Kalinsky's stores on a business trip.
Now, she makes it a point to route her travel through Atlanta
whenever possible. ``I literally will go out of my way to go to the
store if I'm in Atlanta,'' said Ms. Reses, 28, who considers
Kalinsky's shoe selection the best in the country. ``If I were on a
Delta flight going toward the South, I would stop in Atlanta for
the store.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 Super Bowl and 1996 Olympics were held in
Atlanta, Kalinsky's mailing list expanded to include visiting
celebrities, musicians and athletes' wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably buy half my wardrobe through him,'' said Ann
Tenenbaum, 37, of Manhattan. ``In New York, you can buy whatever
you want, but it can be a hassle here. Jeffrey makes it easy. He
sends me these huge boxes. In the beginning of the season, he could
send me a box with 30 things in it, sometimes with an additional 10
pairs of shoes. It's like the store comes to you. I pick a few
pieces and send the rest back.''
</P>
<P>
   Both immensely accommodating and shrewd at business, Kalinsky
mails follow-up notes advising a customer how to wear her new
purchases, answers late-night emergency phone calls about shoes and
lavishes flowers and other gifts on preferred customers. He also
trains his 28 employees in the art of personal service and requires
them to attend Saturday-morning style clinics at the store,
complete with a makeshift runway and models. ``If I don't explain
the clothes to my sales associates, how could they understand
Commes des Garcons?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman president Dawn Mello said Kalinsky ``really
knows what people want to wear,'' adding: ``He's up to the minute
in the sense of style, but he's not extreme. It's right on
target.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking customers with him to Europe for the fashion collections
or paying for airline tickets for a shopping spree at his stores
might seem extravagant, but it pays off. ``To spend $300 on a plane
ticket for someone who spends $16,000 _ who cares?'' Kalinsky
exclaimed. ``Free gift with purchase!''
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky, who grew up in Charleston, S.C., said he worked from a
young age in the first Bob Ellis shoe store, which his father
opened nearly 50 years ago. It sold designer shoes and hard-to-find
sizes. After graduating from George Washington University in 1984,
he continued, he worked as a shoe manager at a Bonwit Teller branch
near Philadelphia. Within months, he moved to Bergdorf's in New
York, followed by five years at Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   His first Atlanta store was a branch of the Bob Ellis chain.
``The first year, we did $2.5 million of business,'' he said. ``We
shook up the local retail scene by bringing Prada, Blahnik,
Clergerie, Maud Frizon, Philippe Model, Henry Beguelin from Day
1.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gallant, a customer in Atlanta, confirmed the early
success. ``Until he came here, Atlanta never had a shoe store like
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Kalinsky expanded, opening Jeffrey, his multidesigner
boutique with hip names like Ann Demeulemeester and Martin
Margiela, followed by a Jil Sander store.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he has taken another big step: in partnership with
David Rubenstein, a designer who is a former director of sales and
merchandising for Tse, he started a clothing line, Kalinsky
Rubenstein. It will offer low-key luxurious sportswear _ cashmere
tops, deerskin jackets, tropical wool Capris _ for men and women.
``It's my dream closet,'' Kalinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to predict the success of the collection, which
will be available next spring, but Kalinsky insists that nothing
will take him away from Phipps Plaza. ``I'm happier in the store
than anywhere else,'' he said. ``It's in a mall in Atlanta, but I
don't even think about where it is.''

UNDATED: there's more. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my favorite features is the ``rainsense''
windshield-wiper system, which automatically detect when water is
hitting the windshield and turns the wipers on.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Magnasteer'' power-steering system adjusts to the speed of
the car. If the car is at highway speeds, the power assist is much
less than it would be during low-speed maneuvering, such as
parallel parking. Tighter, stiffer steering at highway speeds makes
for surer control.
</P>
<P>
   A computerized driver-information center can be set to display
its information in five languages: English, French, Spanish,
Japanese or German. This reflects Cadillac's efforts to market the
Seville worldwide as a competitor to such Japanese luxury cars as
the Lexus and Infiniti, and European bluebloods such at
Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Audi.
</P>
<P>
   Audiophiles will appreciate the Bose 4.0
AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc system, which is among the best you'll
find anywhere. The average Seville buyer, however, will probably
never crank up the volume enough to appreciate just how good this
stereo is. The system has 425 watts of eardrum-blowing power and
eight speakers, enough to produce the same volume you would hear on
the front row of your average Rolling Stones concert, although
without distortion.
</P>
<P>
   The optional On Star system, satellite- and cellular-phone-based
navigation and emergency communications, tracks the car through the
Global Positioning System satellites and notifies the On Star
operator automatically if either a front or side air bag deploys in
the Seville. The exact location of the car is transmitted to the
center, where operators call the appropriate emergency services.
The operator is immediately available in non-emergency situations
to guide you to your destination, send you to the nearest
automatic-teller machine, or help you with hotel reservations,
among other things. The system pinpoints your current location on
the operator's electronic map to within 200 feet and identifies
you.
</P>
<P>
   With all this high-tech stuff, let's not forget what's under the
hood in the STS. This car comes with Cadillac's outstanding
Northstar system: a 4.6-liter, 32-valve, V-8 engine rated at 300
horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of torque, coupled with that
smooth-shifting, four-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the
Lexus LS 400 and most of its European competitors, the Seville has
front-wheel drive, which is better than rear-wheel drive on
slippery surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   There is power galore at your disposal, plenty enough for
high-speed cruising, lane-changing, hill-climbing, or freeway
merging. The Seville will even pull a trailer of up to 3,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard amenities include power mirrors/windows/door
locks/headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control (with
separate controls for driver and front passenger), electronic
traction control, cruise control, and power tilt and telescopic
steering column.
</P>
<P>
   Leather seats are standard, of course. Our test car came with a
$495 wood-trim package for the steering wheel and shift knob. The
only other option was Z-rated tires (made for speeds in excess of
100 mph), a $250 addition. Total cost of the vehicle was $49,607,
including $665 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   My only real gripe was with the rear seat. The three inches
trimmed off the length of the Seville apparently came at the
expense of rear-seat leg room, making it a tight fit for most
adults. It's not all that easy to get into and out of the back
seat, either.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is surprisingly good for such a capable performer.
EPA estimates are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 26 mpg on the
highway. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline.

CADILLAC INTRODUCES ITS REDESIGNED SEVILLE SEDAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best American luxury car just got a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   If Cadillac's redesigned Seville luxury sedan for 1998 doesn't
wow customers with its muscular exterior styling and luxury
interior (brazenly patterned after the previous generation Lexus LS
400), perhaps all of this car's high-tech features combined will do
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Caddy is trying to do a better job of competing against import
luxury cars in the over-$45,000 price category. And the Seville _
which is all new except for the drivetrain _ is designed to appeal
to high-end buyers here and abroad. General Motors is even
producing right-hand-drive models for England and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The previous model, introduced for 1992, never quite reached the
sales goals GM set for it, even though it was by far the best
Cadillac built. The Seville just never caught on with baby-boomers,
who seem to view Cadillac as a stodgy old brand that their parents
might have bought.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac sought to break that image with the '92 Seville, and
this newer version is expected to continue to reshape the brand's
image with younger buyers. It comes in two models: the base Seville
Luxury Sedan, or SLS for short, and the top-of-the-line Seville
Touring Sedan, or STS, which we tested.
</P>
<P>
   The '98 STS, with a base price of $46,995, competes well against
similarly priced luxury cars that just aren't quite as peppy or as
well-equipped. Prices for 1999 haven't been announced, but there
are no significant changes in the vehicle. I would expect the price
to remain about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some consumers thought the previous Seville was just too
big. If that's the case, the new one might be more appealing. Even
though it still looks like its predecessor, it's three inches
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not even to mention all the high-tech stuff, which
surely should appeal to baby-boomers _ people who view technology
as a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Seville seats its front occupants in the lap of
luxury. The base bucket seats are comfortable enough, with their
lumbar support and eight-way power adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   But the optional ``adaptive'' front seats ($1,202), which came
on our test car, are enough to make weary folks want to sit in the
Seville for a long time. The seats are full of air cells that are
automatically filled or deflated to fit the backside, rump and
thighs of whoever is sitting there. The system even allows for a
wallet in a back pocket (which, of course, is a bit thinner after
paying the extra dough for these seats).
</P>
<P>
   The seat adjusts to the driver or front-seat passenger's profile
within 30 to 60 seconds, then checks again every four minutes to
make sure the settings are still correct.
</P>
<P>
   Another seat option, which didn't come on our test vehicle, will
also massage the back of the driver or front passenger at the touch
of a button.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots more high-tech features, many of them designed to
improve the car's performance, not just the driver and passenger's
posture.
</P>
<P>
   StabiliTrak, an exclusive on Cadillacs, works in conjunction
with the steering, traction control, suspension system and antilock
brakes to keep the car from skidding out of control. It used to be
that was the responsibility of the driver, but in the case of the
STS, I suppose even the lousiest drivers can look pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the system works: If the car begins fishtailing, this
computerized system gently applies the appropriate front brake to
bring the tail of the vehicle back into line. The whole effect is
to make the car go in the direction the driver wants it to go,
which is a concept that your passengers will heartily embrace _
especially in traffic on two-lane roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performance Algorithm Shifting,'' another creative use of
technology, allows the STS's four-speed automatic transmission to
perform like a manual gearbox (without the clutch) if the operator
is driving aggressively. It holds in each gear long enough to get
the best acceleration, and is particularly useful on long grades _
eliminating unnecessary up- and down-shifting.
</P>
<P>
   The Seville's ``Continuously Variable Road-sensing Suspension''
is yet another high-tech toy. This system monitors road conditions
and sets the suspension system accordingly, to ensure that the ride
is always smooth and sure.
</P>
<P>
   A separate ``road-texture detection'' system measures the
roughness of the pavement and sets the antilock braking system for
optimal stopping performance. Cadillac says it allows the car to
stop in shorter distances than normal on rough roads, while also
reducing unnecessary use of the antilock brakes and improving
steering response.
</P>
<P>
   Had enough yet? Read on _ there's more.

REBUILDING BERLIN AS A CITY OF INTELLECTUAL LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By KARL E. MEYER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ ``It is a new city,'' Mark Twain said of Berlin 107
years ago, ``the newest I have ever seen. Chicago would seem
venerable beside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, this seems true today of central Berlin. The city is
a forest of cranes, cavernous construction sites and a rising
palisade of new government ministries and imposing embassies
(including the United States', not far from the Brandenburg Gate).
</P>
<P>
   But the Berlin that Twain saw in 1891 had yet to make its mark
as an intellectual and artistic center. It was Europe's
third-largest metropolis, and its parks and boulevards were meant
to express imperial grandeur, but the total effect was pretentious,
as with the rows of marble statues of the royal Hohenzollern family
installed in heroic poses in the Tiergarten. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II
had doubts about his capital, remarking in an 1892 letter, ``Berlin
is a great city, a world city (perhaps?).''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, within a few decades, Berlin burst up near the top
as an acknowledged intellectual leader, especially in the sciences.
In 1901, Sweden bestowed the inaugural Nobel Prize for medicine on
a Berliner, Emil von Behring, for his serum against diphtheria. By
the 1930s, no fewer than 29 Nobel laureates had been associated
with Berlin University and its medical faculty, the biggest in
Europe, at Charite Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's general theory of relativity, Planck's quantum
mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle all came out of
Berlin. So did the spectroscope, the discovery of radio waves and
``the magic bullet,'' salvarsan, to treat syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's preeminence was ominously underscored in 1938 with the
discovery of nuclear fission at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute by
Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, building on the intuitive insight
of Lise Meitner, who fled Berlin that same year.
</P>
<P>
   The prestige of professors, including nonscientists, was
immense; they were like film stars, everywhere recognized and
deferred to. When historian Theodor Mommsen rode a streetcar home,
conductors always slowed down rounding his corner so he could
appear to hop from the moving tram _ a blue-collar tribute to the
no-longer-nimble professor.
</P>
<P>
   This adulation had its downside. Professors became rabid
nationalists, or ``Teutomaniacs,'' in the words of Alexandra
Richie, author of ``Faust's Metropolis'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf, 1998), a
full-length portrait of Berlin. To the self-appointed guardians of
German culture, she writes, ``German virgins were more virginal,
German loyalty was more selfless, and German culture was deeper and
richer than that found in Paris or for that matter anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Germans are hardly alone in wondering (and worrying) whether
Berlin, once more the capital of a united country, will again
emerge as an imperious world city. Its intellectual future is
similarly pondered.
</P>
<P>
   Though the professor is still admired in Berlin, academic
chauvinism is not. Professorial dogmatism has generally yielded to
prudential caution, one reason being that not even the sagest
German scholar foresaw the imminent peaceful downfall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Wolf Lepenies, the rector of the Institute for
Advanced Study at Berlin, said in a recent lecture: ``The collapse
of Communism is not so much a reason for triumph as a motive for
modesty. Nineteen eighty-nine has shown us the narrow limits of
expert culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has unification been a boon to the three universities in
Berlin. Humboldt, Technical and the Free University are mired in
financial crisis as government spending on higher education is
being cut by a third. The ballooning costs of readying Berlin for
its formal debut next year as federal capital is one reason for the
squeeze, but the end of the Cold War is probably the bigger factor.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1989, Berlin's schools were extensions of political wars
(Free University, for example, was founded in 1948 by students and
teachers fleeing the communist takeover of Humboldt, formerly
Berlin University, in East Berlin). But the wall is now a memory,
faculties are being reduced in size and free tuition is ending,
propelling a wave of strikes among Berlin's 135,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   An effect of these cuts is to widen further the gap in resources
between Berlin's science faculties and those in the United States,
the country of choice for gifted students in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berlin is trying to make an intellectual mark with
innovative postdoctoral institutes that are propagating eastward, a
benign form of Germanic outreach. In this, Berlin has exploited its
natural advantages: a tradition of research academies, strong links
with Western universities and a location at the heart of what
everybody now calls Middle Europe (from Berlin, it is one hour by
car to the Polish border).
</P>
<P>
   The heirloom among Berlin's 100-odd institutes is the Max Planck
Society, successor to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, founded in 1911
and once the world's leading laboratory for scientific research.
Since reopening its Berlin headquarters in 1993, the society serves
as the mother church for 75 research institutes, including a score
in eastern Germany reorganized on western lines (lubricated by $370
million in government money).
</P>
<P>
   Of newcomers, among the most enterprising is the Institute for
Advanced Study, established in 1981 and avowedly inspired by its
American namesake. This has historical justice because the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., was a haven in the
1930s for German scholars escaping Nazi rule, Einstein foremost
among them. In the verdant Grunewald quarter of Berlin, the
institute is funded partly by private foundations and partly by the
government, and it annually invites up to 40 fellows from around
the world, with a salting of writers (this author was one in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Lepenies, the sociologist of knowledge and house table tennis
champion, saw an opportunity to bring together two political
cultures _ intellectuals in Eastern Europe with high moral stature
but a ``rather low level of expertise'' and those in the West
``with a high degree of expertise but without much concern for
moral issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992, the institute secured support from six
European partners for the Collegium Budapest, the first such center
for advanced studies in the post-communist East. This was followed
(with help from the financier and philanthropist George Soros) by
the Graduate School for Social Science in Warsaw and an advanced
college in Bucharest, Romania _ the latter headed by a former
dissident, Andrei Plesu, who this year became Romania's Foreign
Minister. Soon to open is an academy in St. Petersburg, Russia, and
even a research center in Mali in West Africa, headed by a former
institute fellow.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital's postdoctoral circus, what promises to be the
third ring, vying with old and new institutes, is the American
Academy in Berlin, which will open in October as a center for
research and public debate. Generously endowed ($34 million), it
will be housed in a Wannsee villa with a typical Berlin biography
(owned first by a wealthy Jew, then by a Nazi official, later
plundered by the Red Army, used as a U.S. officers club and most
recently as a shelter for refugees from the East).
</P>
<P>
   Very much the brainchild of its chairman, Richard Holbrooke, a
former U.S. envoy to Bonn, the academy in his words is to be ``a
venue in Berlin where trans-Atlantic thinking will draw fresh
inspiration from the complex reality of the new German capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The academicians will be an eclectic mix of scholars, writers,
filmmakers and theologians; the inaugural Distinguished Senior
Fellow is the playwright Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The new Berlin very probably will not be as as arrogant,
riotous, inspired, sinister, catastrophic and heroic as the old.
But that may not be such a bad thing.
</P>

YOUR GRANDFATHER'S MORNING GLORIES CLIMB AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Iowa)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)  
(lb) 
 By TOVAH MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it from the azure-enshrouded mailboxes that
line many rural routes, but there's much more to morning glories
than Heavenly Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Thelma Crawford of Wellsville, Kan., one of the dozens
of morning glory aficionados who send correspondence, advice and
seed flying back and forth across the United States. She's 84 and
says that ``time is so precious.'' She hasn't a minute for idle
chatter: There are seeds that need collecting, packaging and
labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission is to cover the world with morning glories. And she
isn't particularly keen on the standard varieties like Scarlett
O'Hara or Pearly Gates that can be obtained through any seed
catalog. Instead, she's busy collecting Robe, with its white
picotee edge hemming velvety burgundy blossoms, or Carnaby Red,
smothered in cerise flowers accented by white throats.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Crawford and her correspondents are members of the Flower
and Herb Exchange, an offshoot of the Seed Savers Exchange, a
nonprofit international organization in Decorah, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Whealy, the head of the Flower and Herb Exchange, said
morning glories played a pivotal role in the founding of the Seed
Savers Exchange. In 1970, Mrs. Whealy's Grandpa Ott died, and she
found herself the custodian of the royal purple morning glory
strain that he brought to Iowa when he emigrated from Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   To make certain they never slipped into oblivion, she started
sharing seeds with friends near and far. The exchange now claims
more than 1,000 active seed-swapping members.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Ott was not the only one with his own morning glory
strain, according to exchange lore. Mrs. Crawford said that a
Midwesterner named Harris Carnaby nurtured the morning glory that
exchange members know as Carnaby Red and that another gardener
found a multicolored type and named it Christensen Factory in honor
of the place where the seed was first collected.
</P>
<P>
   Undreamed-of shades came to light, like Brazilian Orange, with
clusters of small carrot-hued blossoms. Weird patterns also
surfaced, like the tie-dyed blossoms of Flying Saucers.
</P>
<P>
   Need a morning glory adapted to an arid region? There's
drought-tolerant Texas Pink, with soft pink blossoms accented by a
magenta eye. Have a bent toward the macabre? Kniola Bowles Black
has blossoms that are such a deep purple they appear midnight-hued.
Want something to stand out against your dark barn? Plant Wedding
Bells, with 3-inch pinkish-lilac blooms. And that's just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the morning glories recently coming to light are
family heirlooms. Some were prominently featured in catalogs when
morning glories were enjoying their heyday in the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, morning glories have waltzed in and out of
fashion. Although Ipomoea ancestors first came to Britain from
tropical America via Spain and Italy in 1621, they looked too
similar to a noxious pest, bindweed, the bully in the family with
perennial roots and an expansionist personality. Gardeners were
leery of letting any Ipomoea loose.
</P>
<P>
   And why bother? Ipomoea tricolor Blue Star, Heavenly Blue's
prototype, didn't bloom until season's end, and people didn't want
a vine covered only with foliage. It had another hitch: The flowers
bloomed at 4 a.m. and faded before anyone could get outside to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century Americans used the rampant heart-leaved vine
to camouflage the family privy. But that was the extent of its
employment until 1931, when a Colorado gardener by the name of
Clarke discovered an early-blooming, free-flowering,
large-trumpeted, sky-blue mutant. It became known as Clarke's Early
Heavenly Blue, and it gave rise to all the sky-colored morning
glories that have meandered around mailboxes ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements came regularly enough to hold the public
spellbound, like a pure white version known as Pearly Gates that
won the All-America Selection Award in 1942, followed by a rainbow
of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1963, amid the craze for ingesting various
mind-altering substances, someone reported that chewing the seeds
could cause hallucinations. Sales skidded in the United States, and
Britain briefly banned their purchase. Many varieties that were
lost because of that character assassination are now resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   The current resurgence of morning glories, which are annuals but
tend to self-seed, probably owes its momentum to the new
fascination with cottage gardens. Any flowering vine capable of
encasing an arbor lickety-split is receiving a hero's welcome.
Morning glories not only fit that bill, but also thrive on neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from one quirk _ they prefer warm temperatures, and you
can't push the seasons by planting them too early _ they're easy.
Plant seeds when the soil is warm, preferably in a place where they
won't receive light at night, which could prevent blooming.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the variety, they'll usually start to bloom in
July. They don't bloom as well in fertile soil; they require no
deadheading and prefer to forge upward without interference. Any
old sturdy support will do. In fact, Mrs. Whealy recalls that one
of her chores as a child was to collect pieces of old twine to tie
together as a trellis for her Grandpa Ott's morning glories.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain seeds from the Flower and Herb Exchange, you must be a
member, which costs $10 a year. The address is 3076 North Winn Rd.,
Decorah IA 52101; telephone (319) 382-5990.

MEDICINE'S 10 GREATEST HITS: CURIOSITY'S REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget genius. Curiosity and methodical investigation are what
matter.
</P>
<P>
   At least those are the two characteristics that Dr. Gerald W.
Friedland and Dr. Meyer Friedman think are responsible for the 10
greatest discoveries in the history of Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admire the natural, totally understandable mental capacity
of our 10 discoverers,'' the two research doctors write in
``Medicine's 10 Greatest Discoveries,'' which Yale University Press
is publishing in November. ``But we are not amazed at this mental
talent, primarily because we can follow the working of their fine
minds. Indeed, we almost believe that were we in their situation,
we might have arrived at their discoveries. None of us, though, has
any illusion that we could equal the genius of Mozart's music,
Shakespeare's dramas or Newton's laws of physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's also luck. Antony Leeuwenhoek by chance left
his rainwater standing for a few days, enough time for bacteria to
grow. Crawford Long accidentally got the idea for surgical
anesthesia after hurting himself but feeling no pain while under
the influence of ether at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Friedland looked at the 5,000 or more discoveries
in Western medicine made over the last four centuries and consulted
other medical experts to select the winners, which fell into three
categories: the structure and functions of the human body and mind,
the diagnosis of medical disorders and their treatments.
</P>
<P>
   So which is No. 1? William Harvey's discovery in the early 17th
century that blood traveled in a closed circuit is labeled the
``greatest medical achievement of all time.'' Not only did it
initiate the field of physiology, but it also introduced the
principle of experimentation in medicine, the two doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Harvey's book, the doctors say, ``What the
authorized version of the Bible has been to the Church of England
and the Shakespeare Folio to English literature, `De Motu Cordis,'
has been to medicine everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As for future discoveries, the authors are betting on cures for
two mental disorders: schizophrenia and manic-depressive syndrome.
With a little luck, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Here is their list in chronological order:
</P>
<P>
   1543 _ Andreas Vesalius presents ``De Humani Corporis Fabrica,''
or ``The Structure of the Human Body,'' which detailed the anatomy
of the human body. He was the first to point out that without
bones, human beings would be mushy blobs. ``It presented medicine
with the precious gift of the scientific method with which to
approach an infinite number of future medical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   1628 _ William Harvey published ``De Motu Cordis'' or ``On the
Motion of the Heart,'' in which he described the functions of the
heart and the circulation of blood. Introducing his discovery of
circulation, Harvey wrote that his findings were ``of so novel and
unheard-of character, that I not only fear injury to myself from
the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for
my enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   1675 _ Anton Leeuwenhoek, a haberdasher and part-time janitor,
looking at a drop of rainwater under a microscope, discovered
``little animals'' _ or bacteria, a cause of myriad diseases.
</P>
<P>
   1796 _ By using cowpox, which causes a mild disease in human
beings, to protect a person from the deadlier smallpox, Edward
Jenner discovered vaccination. His method of injecting dead
bacteria or their toxins helped eradicate smallpox, and protects
against bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera, diphtheria, influenza,
measles, mumps, rabies, typhoid fever, tetanus and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   1842 _ Crawford Long, using ether to prevent his patients from
feeling pain, developed surgical anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   1895 _ Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the X-ray beam, and developed
one of the most important diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   1907 _ Ross Harrison figured out how to grow living cells
outside the body. ``It made possible the study of living organisms
at the cellular and even the molecular level and the development of
modern vaccines . . . and abetted the search for the causes of
cancer (and AIDS). Indeed, because of tissue culture, more has been
learned about the basic mechanisms of disease in the past 50 years
than in the previous 5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   1912 _ Nikolai Anichkov discovered that cholesterol was
responsible for coronary artery disease, currently the world's most
deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   1928 _ Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, which led the
way for the development of antibiotics to treat infections.
</P>
<P>
   1950-53 _ Maurice Wilkins did the pioneering work of isolating a
single fiber of DNA and examining it, which James Watson and
Francis Crick used to develop their own double helix model of DNA,
the heredity-bearing molecule. Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize with
them for the discovery, which opened the door to genetics research
in 1962.

COMPANY COURTED BY MAYOR OWES MONEY TO IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The security company Mayor Willie Brown has
courted to take over patrol and guard duties in the city's public
housing owes the U.S. government more than $300,000 in unpaid
taxes, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service filed a lien June 22 for $314,226
in back taxes, interest and penalties against Ambassador Private
Security Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hongisto, a former police chief and sheriff who heads
the security company, failed to pay taxes his company withheld from
employee payroll checks during two quarters in 1997. He said the
money was not paid because of ``explosive growth'' and temporary
cash shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Hongisto said he was working out an arrangement to pay the tax
debt and would resolve the issue before bidding on a San Francisco
Housing Authority security contract.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said on Aug. 11 that he personally solicited Hongisto to
bid on Housing Authority security contracts that now cost nearly $3
million per year. The mayor said he courted Hongisto's company
because it is based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a city-first policy. Richard's firm is out on Third
Street. He's not ever bid, and he wouldn't have this time if I had
not solicited him,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Personal Protective Services of San Mateo, hired by the Housing
Authority a year ago, has been credited with helping reduce the
crime rate in the several projects it serves. It also has been the
subject of brutality complaints from tenants. The San Francisco
police are investigating the company after allegations of excessive
force and illegal searches. The U.S. attorney's office also is
investigating the company because of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Personal Protective Services' $2.9 million contract expires in
2000, but the mayor-appointed Housing Authority Commission that
governs public housing could end it sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority also has security contracts with the
police and two other private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Authority spokesman Ron Sonenshine said Hongisto's tax
problems wouldn't prohibit his company from getting a Housing
Authority contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no request for proposals or contract to let, so it is
almost a moot point at this junction of the game,'' Sonenshine
said. ``There is no law that would preclude anyone with a tax lien
from applying for a federal job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the turbulent 1970s, TV delivered a nostalgic family
sitcom about the 1950s called ``Happy Days.'' It was an obvious
balm for a nation in which parents were breaking apart and kids
were feeding their heads with more than Ovaltine. Fonzie was meant
to serve as the anti-social figure in the cozy ``Happy Days''
society, but Fonzie was about as threatening as a water gun.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the 1990s and we are steeped in 1970s nostalgia, for
reasons that seem far less clear. Is it those smiley buttons we
long for? Or is it simply the Captain &AMP; Tennille? Tomorrow night at
8:30 on Ch.25, ``That '70s Show'' provides us with the newest
chapter in American entertainment's love affair with the 1970s, as
it brings elements of both ``Wayne's World'' and ``Dazed and
Confused'' to the small screen. Lava lamps, Farrah posters, sand
candles, bad haircuts, and the ``My nose!'' episode of ``The Brady
Bunch'' _ they're all back with a vengeance, along with a guest
appearance by at least one of ``Charlie's Angels,'' Tanya Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, ``That '70s Show'' is ``Happy Days'' _ only dressed
in more colorful duds. It's Richie Cunningham in bell bottoms and
Potsie in paisley. The series' formula is pretty stock teen
material, with immature guys and unsuspecting parents and ditsy
girls, but it's got a few inventively surrealistic scenes and a
breezy tone that makes it worth watching. Set in Wisconsin in 1976,
the show's central character is Eric Foreman, a sensible
17-year-old whose basement serves as the hangout for a group of
friends. There's neighbor Donna, Eric's pal and maybe girlfriend;
Kelso, a thick but sweet-natured guy; Jackie, Kelso's annoying
on-again-off-again girlfriend; Hyde, a paranoid dude of all trades;
and Fez, a forever baffled exchange student. There's also Eric's
parents, who are living out their own tacky '70s disco fantasy. All
these characters are inoffensive and easy-to-read, as are the
plots. In tonight's episode, for example, Eric's parents give him a
car, and he and the gang sneak out to a Todd Rundgren concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' has been in the news thanks to a scene in
which pot smoking is implied, though never shown. The friends sit
in a circle, as the camera work turns a little trippy, Hyde gets
more paranoid than usual, and a backdrop rocks behind Eric's
parents. In the show's defense, it is an ambiguous scene, and
younger viewers might not even recognize the drug context. Also, a
series about the 1970s would be inauthentic if it never addressed
the fact that behind every paneled basement wall there stood a
carefully stashed bong.
</P>
<P>
   The drug controversy makes the series sound edgy and realistic,
but ``That '70s Show'' is all soft edges and eight-track jokes. The
ensemble is appealing _ none of the young actors really stands out,
although Laura Prepon does look remarkably like Claire Danes _ and
the sets and costumes are a gas. The production team includes Marcy
Casey and Tom Werner of ``Roseanne,'' and Bonnie and Terry Turner
of ``3rd Rock from the Sun.'' They've got a promising series on
their hands, except, of course, for the awful title.
</P>
<P>
   Another new Fox series, ``Holding the Baby,'' premieres Sunday
night at 7:30. It is, in short, ghastly. A workaholic father named
Gordon finds that his wife has run off to Tibet with her yoga
instructor, leaving him with their infant son. Who'll take care of
the baby when Dad has to work? A bleeding-heart liberal named Kelly
applies to be his receptionist, but after some bluster around the
office about some new clients, Gordon bribes her into becoming his
new nanny. The nuttiness continues, as Gordon's do-nothing hunk of
a brother hangs around the house, wondering if the new nanny might
be willing to give him a little bit of attention, too. (This aspect
of ``Holding the Baby'' mirrors a forthcoming series from ABC
called ``Brother's Keeper.'')
</P>
<P>
   As Gordon, Jon Patrick Walker is unbearably high-strung, yelling
his lines and running around crazily to emphasize the fact that
this is meant to be farce. The only watchable character is little
Daniel, the baby, who looks like a space egg with his round bald
head and his complete lack of expression. How do you teach such
perfect deadpan to an infant? Maybe the other actors could look
into that same course.

THE ENEMIES OF LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- When Eric Partridge saluted the 100th
anniversary of the birth of a great guardian of civic discourse, he
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people have nothing to say, and keep on saying
it. Henry Watson Fowler had much to say, but most of us wish he had
said more on almost every subject he touched. Nor did he confine
himself to the vast field of English language. He did not, like
Goldsmith, adorn every subject he treated: he did better than that:
he enriched and illuminated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler and Partridge regarded cliches and euphemisms as enemies
of language. They did not live long enough to see cable television,
where discourse does not enrich or illuminate, but willfully
inflicts upon the English language what the Pentagon calls
collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   Print, too, can offend. A New York Times writer whom I admire
wrote last week that ``the president talks a good game on many of
these issues, but he has yet to really put his shoulder to the
wheel behind most of them.'' I shuddered and recalled George
Orwell's essay, ``Politics and the English Language,'' which
contains six rules, one of them: ``Never use a metaphor, simile, or
other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.''
</P>
<P>
   I mentally argued with the newspaper, muttering, ``Come on, pal,
it ain't brain surgery or rocket science.'' Oops. In journalism, as
in life, the temptation is always strong to first cast a stone
(John 8:7).
</P>
<P>
   Fowler warned that a cliche is ``better than the phrase that
fails.'' By definition, a cliche is obsolete jargon, sometimes
overused for centuries. Several presidents, including Thomas
Jefferson, have complained of being criticized from pillar to post,
a phrase from ancient horse-training techniques in France. We must
banish every cliche lock, stock and barrel, a phrase describing the
contents of a blunderbuss, which Partridge, in ``The Dictionary of
Cliches,'' traces to 1820.
</P>
<P>
   When I was an editor, an editorial writer warned that ``the
president and Congress are at loggerheads.'' What, I inquired, does
a loggerhead look like? The flustered polemicist stammered, ``You
know what it is!'' (It's an old iron tool.) I've never seen one.
Neither have most readers. Try something else.
</P>
<P>
   Many cliches are named after real people. The phrase ``tawdry
behavior'' has its origin in the cheap lace sold on the Isle of Ely
on the feast day of St. Audrey. A lynch mob refers to a vigilante
band in Pittsylvania County in Virginia in 1780, led by Captain
William Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The second edition of Fowler's ``Modern English Usage,'' first
published in 1926, says that euphemisms, ``a substitute for blunt
precision or disagreeable truth,'' blossomed in ``the mid-Victorian
era, when the dead were the departed, or no longer living, pregnant
women were in an interesting condition ... ladies once termed
mistresses (itself a euphemism for the earlier concubines and
paramours) are unmarried wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell wrote that ``the inflated style is itself a kind of
euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft
snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details. The
great enemy of clear language is insincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   The euphemism in politics is hardly a modern invention.
Partridge's ``Dictionary of Cliches'' traces terminological
inexactitude, for lying, to a Winston Churchill speech in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, Partridge, and Orwell, all English essayists, had no
cure for cliches and euphemisms, but Jonathan Swift, the Irish
satirist, suggested one approach:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blot out, correct, insert, refine,
</P>
<P>
   Enlarge, diminish, interline;
</P>
<P>
   Be mindful, when invention fails,
</P>
<P>
   To scratch your head, and bite your nails.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swift's high-concept notion might enrich and illuminate the
audio-visual food fight among talking heads on television. It could
even be a breath of fresh air.
</P>

`WRONGFULLY ACCUSED' MISSES ITS MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
<TEXT>
<P>
   Directed and written by: Pat Proft
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Leslie Nielsen, Richard Crenna, Kelly Le Brock, Sandra
Bernhard, Michael York, Melinda McGraw
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Stars: (BS) 1/2
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if Leslie Nielsen isn't your edge, you have to give the
star of ``Naked Gun'' and ``Airplane'' movies credit for the
physical pain he appears to endure for the sake of every joke. In
``Wrongfully Accused,'' he returns to the screen, this time as Tom
outsmarted by Jerry, or Wile E. Coyote burned by the Road Runner.
You're expecting a banana-shaped bruise to sprout from the top of
his scalp every time he hits his head against something hard.
</P>
<P>
   So the laughs are there from time to time. No doubt, they are
laughs mixed with grossed-out grimaces _ such as in the scene when
the seductive Lauren Goodhu, played by Kelly LeBrock, sticks her
toungue into one of Nielsen's ears, and out it comes through the
other. But considering there are 100 or so intended jokes,
``Wrongfully Accused'' hits the mark about as many times as
Shaquille O'Neal makes a free throw. In other words, a lousy
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``Naked Gun'' and ``Airplane'' film series that have
distinguished Nielsen as a gag comedian, this film is a spoof of
other movies and, more generally, pop culture. In particular, the
film parodies ``The Fugitive,'' the suspense-action movie in which
Harrison Ford, running from the law, tries to prove his innocence
in his wife's murder. Nielsen plays virtuoso violinist Ryan
Harrison, pursued by the wealthy socialite Lauren. Harrison finds
the body of Lauren's husband, a toilet tycoon, and brawls briefly
with a one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed killer who is scampering
around the murder scene. Harrison is wrongfully charged with the
killing but escapes from the bus of convicts after the wheels roll
over a banana peel. In his escape from the law and quest for
vindication, Harrison meets love interest Cass Lake (Melinda
McGraw). Richard Crenna, playing a role less memorable than Tommy
Lee Jones's marshal in ``The Fugitive,'' is US Marshal Fergus
Falls, the man who tries to track down the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible to sit through ``Wrongfully Accused''
without a chuckle. It's sick humor, at times, relying on material
that should just remain hands-off. But Nielsen has mastered the
bulgy-eyed or cross-eyed faces that are quite convincingly funny.
Or at least, he's trying hard, and that counts for something,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bernhard is on the credit line banner, but her role as
the prosthetics doctor for the one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed man
is minimal and forgettable. McGraw, who has played Scully's psychic
sister on ``The X-Files,'' shows promise with her deadpan face
amidst the contrived, off-the-wall antics around her. But the best
scenes are usually crafted by Nielsen, such as when he winks at the
camera while popping a Mentos before he jumps from a high-rise
window.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anyone who has tuned into TV and movies over the past
five years will quickly get every allusion, but laughing about it
may be another matter.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Drenching thunderstorms and gusty winds will accompany the
remnants of Tropical Storm Charley in southern Texas on Saturday.
Torrential rainfall of up to eight inches will cause local flooding
of low-lying areas. Isolated tornadoes are possible in some of the
heavier rain bands. A weak tropical disturbance will also promote
thundershowers across Florida and along the Gulf Coast. Meanwhile,
strengthening Tropical Storm Bonnie will bring gusty winds and
squally rains to the southeastern Bahamas as it tracks northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Hot conditions will dominate from the interior Southeast to the
central Plains on Saturday as strong high pressure at 18,000 feet
promotes ample sunshine and suppresses cooling showers. A front
separating the hot air to the south from a cooler air mass to the
north will be the focus for isolated thundershowers from southern
New England to the northern Ohio Valley. North of the front, ample
sunshine and less humid air will grace northern New England and the
upper Great Lakes States. Farther west, a large area of
thunderstorms will develop in the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota as
a jet stream disturbance rapidly lifts tropical air near the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonably cool air will cover the the Pacific Northwest. Low
clouds will embrace the immediate coast while mixed clouds and
sunshine dominate east of the Cascades. A weak disturbance may
ignite a few afternoon showers over the high ground of eastern
Oregon. Afternoon showers will bubble up over the southern Rockies
while seasonal heat covers the interior Southwest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Balloons in Bonnie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, as the sun was setting north of the Leeward
Islands, a hurricane hunter plane released 59 special weather
balloons into the circulation of Tropical Storm Bonnie. These
devices transmitted fine details of the developing storm that were
immediately fed into sophisticated computer models. The oceans,
where hurricanes grow, are huge voids of weather data makes
forecasting the storms a challenge. This experiment should help
produce better short term computer predictions which may prove
invaluable as Bonnie threatens the Southeast coast early next week.

`WRONGFULLY ACCUSED': A `FUGITIVE' PARODY THAT COULD BE FUNNIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can accuse ``Wrongfully Accused'' of a shortage of jokes.
Leslie Nielsen and his co-stars keep them coming, from a parody of
``Lord of the Dance'' to a romantic scene from ``Titanic'' with a
slapstick twist.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the ``Field of Dreams''-style baseball players
have barely disappeared into the cornfield before Nielsen is
already running from a small (very small) airplane a la ``North by
Northwest.'' Unfortunately, most of the jokes just aren't very
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pat Proft, who was a writer on the ``Naked Gun'' films and
``Hot Shots: Part Deux,'' works best as part of a team. Maybe he
needs one of his old collaborators _ ideally David Zucker or Jim
Abrahams _ to turn his concepts into punch lines. Without them,
``Wrongfully Accused,'' which Proft wrote, directed and produced,
feels like a tangle of funny ideas all dressed up with nowhere to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially the film is a parody of ``The Fugitive,'' with
Nielsen as Ryan Harrison, Lord of the Violin, who is found holding
a gun and lying beside the freshly deceased tycoon Hibbing Goodhue
(Michael York). Harrison insists that the murder was done by a
one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed terrorist, but no one believes him
and he's soon convicted of murder. Luckily the bus carrying him to
his execution slips on a banana peel and crashes, allowing Harrison
to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, Richard Crenna, as the Lt. Gerard
character, seems right on the verge of making his Tommy Lee Jones
imitation truly great, but he always just misses, maybe because he
has only his attitude to work with.
</P>
<P>
   And Nielsen still has a way with a ludicrous line: ``My head is
spinning like a dreidel in a sandstorm.'' ``I've got a gun. Not
here. But I've got one.'' ``Of all the women in all the world, you
had to walk into mine.'' (Kelly Le Brock and Melinda McGraw play
his love interests.)
</P>
<P>
   There are moments: the use of a first-draft manuscript of
``Titanic'' as a weapon, the Baywatch reference (a gaggle of
gorgeous, well-built lifeguards of both sexes adjusting their red
swimsuits and body parts as they jump into action), the
emergency-room PA message for Drs. Ross, Green, Benton et al. about
picking up their checks.
</P>
<P>
   And the film has some of its predecessors'
we'll-go-anywhere-for-a-joke sense of fun. For instance, the script
has Nielsen crash into an arts-and-crafts booth so he can emerge
with blue paint on his face, for a ``Braveheart'' moment. The
cappuccino cups in the happy-dating montage are the size of punch
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   But the dirty-diaper jokes and other adolescent humor would be a
lot easier to take if they alternated with real comic payoff. Even
a cameo by the generally fabulous Sandra Bernhard falls flat.
Things go better for Lamb Chop, the saccharine little sock puppet
whose creator, Shari Lewis, died earlier this month. Lamb Chop has
a cameo as an audience member in the opening concert scene and
steals the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrongfully Accused'' is rated PG-13 (parents strongly
cautioned). It includes profanity, double-entendres, sexual
situations, partial nudity, shootouts, explosions and miscellaneous
other acts of violence.
</P>

   When the Japanese pitcher Hideki Irabu joined the New York
Yankees last season, he spoke little English but quickly became
known for his magnetism. That is, for taping tiny magnets on his
arms before games, a practice common in Japan, where ball teams
also enlist Shinto priests and burn incense in hopes of improving
their performance.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Darryl Strawberry, Paul O'Neill, Derek Jeter and
Scott Brosius are following Irabu's lead and wearing U-shaped
magnetic bracelets, which are touted by their Japanese
manufacturer, Tsujimoto, to increase circulation, ease pain, help
balance and promote energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard about it, it's going to make me healthy
and I'm going to live to be 150,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Carlos Vallbona, a medical authority on magnet therapy,
said that any benefit the Yankees receive from the bracelets is
mind over magnets. ``For the magnetic field to work, magnets have
to be applied directly to the area of distress,'' he said, adding,
however, that the jewelry did work nicely with the team's 1996
World Series rings.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Yankees are on pace to win 120 games this season,
magnetic bracelets, which can be bought for $50 to $150, may not
become as common among major leaguers as batting gloves and
creatine drinks. Another Yankee, Chuck Knoblauch, recently tried
the bracelet, but during a batting slump decided to stick with just
a sweatband. _ JOE BRESCIA

   Martini Liftoff
</P>
<P>
   Did Adam Tihany's martini arrive too late? When he designed a
space-age cocktail glass for a Bombay Gin advertisement in 1992,
the martini craze was just taking off. ``That glass was my homage
to James Bond,'' Tihany said. ``It was kind of like a little rocket
launcher.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ad appeared, people wanted to know where they could buy
the handmade Venetian glass, with a sphere for a stem, set down in
a silver stand. Nowhere, unfortunately. There were only two, props
commissioned by Bombay, which held the rights.
</P>
<P>
   The rights have since reverted to Tihany, who has made 200
limited-edition glasses with Christofle. But now that martinis have
reached a saturation point, will anyone spend $550 a pop for the
glasses? In two weeks at Pavillon Christofle (800-799-6886), 50
have been sold. The thirst for martinis hasn't gone completely dry.

   Sneakers as Art
</P>
<P>
   In the window of DDC Lab, a recently opened boutique at 180
Orchard St., sneakers hang like museum pieces. Understandable,
since the treads on display are limited editions that can cost as
much as a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   Safe behind locked glass are Reebok Insta-Pump collectibles: the
$180 Bjorks (named after the Icelandic techno star); the $300
Jackie Chans, which have the Kung Fu master's signature on the
tongue and heel, and last but not least, the Hong Kong Furies, for
$2,500. These inflatable sneakers command an exorbitant price
because only 1,997 pairs were made, commemorating Hong Kong's
reversion to China last year, said Steve Gardner, a spokesman for
Reebok, which has a factory in China.
</P>
<P>
   Made in yellow, black and red _ the colors of China's flag _ the
high-tech souvenirs come with Chinese characters that read ``Hong
Kong '97,'' a gold-plated serial number and a hand-held pump. Who's
buying? A stylist, Sharon Stone, for one. But she didn't buy hers
for their historical value. ``If they cost this much, you can be
sure that not everyone walking down Broadway will have on the same
pair,'' she said.

   Let's Twist Again
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started during the first heat wave,'' explained Gwen
LeMoine Sabahi, the owner of Parlor, a three-chair salon on Ninth
Street that has produced some of the summer's most twisted hairdos.
``We were looking for a way to avoid blow-outs.'' Their solution
was a modern, disheveled version of the African Zulu knot, hair
coiled into a jumble of tiny bumps and secured with bobby pins.
Clients started dialing Parlor (212-673-5520) in droves for the
process, which takes 20 minutes, costs $30 to $50 (free with a
haircut) and can be customized: weaving wet hair into a tapestry
effect, adding flowered bobby pins or fashioning straight, dry hair
into a spiky fan. Though Scary Spice was a pioneer of the look,
teen-agers are not the only ones copying it. A pediatrician's wife
recently came in to be knotted for a wedding. ``Messy is O.K. these
days,'' Ms. Sabahi said. ``For a special occasion, you don't need a
'50s French twist.''

   Fire Island Fat Fix
</P>
<P>
   George Dellinger wakes at 5 a.m. each Sunday and begins his
donut marathon. By Jeep, ferry and, finally, little red wagon, he
races to get his cargo of Krispy Kreme donuts from Eighth Street,
where they're baked, to Fire Island Pines by 9. That's still not
early enough for many of his customers, who often have just
finished the night's dancing, haven't slept and want their fat fix.
The Pines is better known for men with firm physiques than donut
figures. But Dellinger, a party promoter inspired by his own
post-dance cravings, got an exclusive contract for Fire Island
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have risen from seven boxes the first weekend to nearly
200 last week for the annual Morning Party. Orders, $10 a dozen
(versus $6 in the store): (212) 358-5736. Next year, he will expand
to Ocean Bay Park and Cherry Grove. Now, if only he could get the
Kremes there still warm. Maybe a Domino's thermal bag?

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ We knew our life together had entered a new phase the
day my wife and I came home to find that our 7-year-old daughter
had decorated her room with posters of the pop group Hanson.
Seemingly overnight, Chelsea had gone from singing ``the wheels on
the bus go round and round'' to referring to Zac Hanson as her
``boyfriend in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the idea that our little girl wasn't so little anymore
sort of snuck up on us, at least we didn't have a problem with her
choice of music. Even snobby old Dad had to admit those Hanson boys
sound pretty good compared to a lot of stuff I cover on my job as
the pop-music critic for the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   When I gave Chelsea a Beatles greatest-hits tape to demonstrate
their influence on Hanson, she immediately claimed them as her
other favorite group. Before long, we were cruising around town
together belting out ``Eight Days a Week'' and ``Help!,'' and she
was asking me if I had any photos of Paul McCartney when he was
young and cute.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the unsettling day when most of the Hanson posters
were replaced by Spice Girls posters. Chelsea suddenly stopped
talking about Isaac, Taylor and Zac and started saying things like
``Girl Powah, blah, blah, blah'' in a dead-on working-class English
accent.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing was, she couldn't do the accent right without
also affecting a Spice-like pouty tone and impudent facial
expression, as if life among the young and beautiful was to suffer
through a series of petty annoyances, most of them caused by boys.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I examined the photos of Ginger, Baby, Scary, Sporty
and Posh in their heavy makeup, short skirts and low-cut tops. ``Is
this who we want our daughter looking up to as role models?'' my
wife asked. ``They look like bad girls,'' I said. (Actually, the
word I used is one we don't ordinarily print in the newspaper.)
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea and four of her girlfriends from school organized a
Spice Girls club. Each girl assumed the role of a different Spice,
dancing and lip-syncing to the tunes. We found some solace in the
fact that Chelsea's favorite is Sporty, who prefers athletic gear
and sneakers to little Gucci dresses and spiked heels.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was the matter of the nose ring and the tattoos,
with which she developed an obsession. She spent her allowance on
one of those costume-jewelry kits for kids and emerged with three
rings in each ear, one in her nose and one in her navel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, when I turn 18, can I get a nose ring for real?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't recommend it,'' I said. ``What if you were kissing
someone else who had a nose ring and got stuck?''
</P>
<P>
   She gave me one of those petulant Girl Power looks, as if to
say, ``You really think I'm still little and stupid enough to fall
for that?''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Spiceworld: The Movie'' came out, I took Chelsea to see
it despite my wife's mild protests. To my surprise, I enjoyed it
almost as much as she did. The madcap antics of a band on the run
reminded me of a classic rock flick from when I was a kid _ the
Beatles' ``A Hard Day's Night.''
</P>
<P>
   I was also relieved that the more risque humor seemed to go over
Chelsea's head, although she clearly got the movie's main themes _
girls just wanna have fun, and no uptight male should come between
a girl and a friend in need.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe the Spice Girls weren't such a bad influence after
all. But there was still the matter of the music. While I found I
could listen to Hanson's bouncy bubble-gum pop hits ``Mmmmbop!''
and ``Where's the Love'' over and over without retching, I have
considerably less tolerance for the Spice Girls' breathy, barely
tuneful vocals and factory-built disco grooves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I suggested to Chelsea that the Spice Girls simply
aren't as musically talented as Hanson, much less the Beatles, she
reacted as though I'd just stabbed her in the back. ``Yes, they
are!'' she exclaimed. Then she ran to her room, slammed the door
and cranked up ``Spice Up Your Life'' to maximum volume on her
boombox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where have I gone wrong?'' I wondered. This is, after all, a
kid who was rocking in the cradle to John Coltrane's ``A Love
Supreme''; who when she was 4 told anyone who asked that her
favorite music was zydeco; and who now knows the words to the
Beatles' greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   So how come all she wants to listen to is the Spice Girls?
</P>
<P>
   Then I remembered my own childhood: how from the time I was 5
years old my parents and I fought for control of the car radio; how
when I was 9 or 10 I sat outside a restaurant transfixed by the
elemental mystery of the Exciters' ``Tell Him,'' unable to get out
of the car until the song ended, even though the rest of my family
didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   That was my music then, and it's still my music. My daughter may
eventually outgrow the Spice Girls, just as I outgrew Jan &AMP; Dean,
but she has a right to stake out her own turf. If her parents
actually liked it, then it wouldn't really belong to her.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be a lot worse; she could have a giant poster of
Marilyn Manson hanging over her bed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(COLUMN CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when I was a kid, I never got the chance to talk to
any of my musical heroes. Because of her dad's job, Chelsea found
herself on the phone with Sporty Spice a couple of months ago.
Although Sporty was very nice, neither one had a whole lot to say
to the other. But it was enough to make a big impression on the
Spice Girls club at Chelsea's eighth birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're looking forward to the concert Tuesday in The
Woodlands, an unincorporated community of 51,000 about 30 miles
north of downtown Houston. &UR;  &LR;  Chelsea's been going to concerts with
me all her life, but this will be the first time she's been to a
concert of ``her'' music.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I asked my daughter what it was she liked so much
about the Spice Girls' music. She said basically the same thing
kids used to say on Dick Clark's ``American Bandstand:'' ``It's got
a good beat, and you can dance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her if she thought the Spice Girls were smart. She gave
me another one of those looks. ``If they weren't smart, how could
they be where they are?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you think they can be sexy and smart at the same time?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they can,'' she said, as if only a boy would ask
such an obvious question.

SPICE DAD MUST TACKLE `GIRL POWAH'

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ We knew our life together had entered a new phase the
day my wife and I came home to find that our 7-year-old daughter
had decorated her room with posters of the pop group Hanson.
Seemingly overnight, Chelsea had gone from singing ``the wheels on
the bus go round and round'' to referring to Zac Hanson as her
``boyfriend in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the idea that our little girl wasn't so little anymore
sort of snuck up on us, at least we didn't have a problem with her
choice of music. Even snobby old Dad had to admit those Hanson boys
sound pretty good compared to a lot of stuff I cover on my job as
the pop-music critic for the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   When I gave Chelsea a Beatles greatest-hits tape to demonstrate
their influence on Hanson, she immediately claimed them as her
other favorite group. Before long, we were cruising around town
together belting out ``Eight Days a Week'' and ``Help!,'' and she
was asking me if I had any photos of Paul McCartney when he was

</P>
<P>
   But then came the unsettling day when most of the Hanson posters
were replaced by Spice Girls posters. Chelsea suddenly stopped
talking about Isaac, Taylor and Zac and started saying things like
``Girl Powah, blah, blah, blah'' in a dead-on working-class English
accent.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing was, she couldn't do the accent right without
also affecting a Spice-like pouty tone and impudent facial
expression, as if life among the young and beautiful was to suffer
through a series of petty annoyances, most of them caused by boys.

RELIEF EFFORTS UNDER WAY FOR CHINA'S FLOOD VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Even as battles against raging flood waters continue
in parts of China, relief workers have begun the herculean task of
providing food, water, health care and housing to the millions who
have been displaced by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the government has had to evacuate 13.8
million people to keep them out of harm's way, sometimes with only
a few hours' notice; 5.8 million homes have been destroyed,
government officials said. And while the battle against new crests
and flood waters may be soon drawing to a close, the relief effort
_ which experts say will take months _ is only just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Chinese are now homeless, living on dikes or in
schools or factories that have been transformed into evacuation
centers. International aid workers say it will be months before
these people can return home or be moved into more suitable
housing. And in the meantime they are at high risk for infectious
diseases, from colds to cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders seem to be expecting a long haul, and on Friday
night President Jiang Zemin announced that he would postpone
important state visits to Japan and Russia that had been scheduled
for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are excellent at what they do, but this is really
hard: There are so many in need and it's hard to get things out
into the field,'' said Sharilyn Amy, spokeswoman for the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
which has been in Beijing for the last month to help oversee the
distribution of international aid. ``There is always flooding, but
other years were really incomparable to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, millions of soldiers and civilian volunteers have
been fighting raging rivers near the Yangtze and in the industrial
Northeast, working day and night, reinforcing old dikes and, where
those have broken, hastily building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a daily struggle to keep the water out of major
cities and away from important industrial sites, like the huge
Daqing oil field near the northeastern city of Harbin. The Nen
River has already submerged several thousand of the field's 20,000
oil wells, and others are at risk, according to Chinese reporters
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Factories in Harbin have been working round the clock producing
sandbags to be stacked atop the levees to prevent water from
flowing over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly news has featured endless images of this struggle
with soaked soldiers in chest-high water hauling sandbags to
reinforce the dikes. There has been far less coverage of the human
displacement, in part because the government has restricted access
to the more severely affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Public Health Bureau and the vast Chinese Red Cross
have nearly doubled the number of public-health teams out in the
field, to 10,000, over the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many people are living on dikes in China,
perched precariously on narrow man-made structures with water
lapping on both sides. But Ms. Amy, from the Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said that 300,000 people were
living on dikes in the Dongting Lake area when she visited two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   She said that some had been stranded because they had no time to
evacuate, but that many others angrily defied orders so that they
could guard their property. The government intentionally blasted
dikes and flooded some villages in order to reduce water levels in
urban centers downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Amy said some families had brought furniture, chickens, pigs
and even tractors. She added that the crowded living conditions,
poor sanitation and cohabitation of humans and animals made the
refugees vulnerable to disease. Many people are drinking river
water that is contaminated by human waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is distributing vast supplies of
water-purification tablets, medicines and chlorine spray for
disinfecting sanitation pits and previously submerged land once the
waters recede.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outbreaks of skin infections and infectious diarrhea have
already occurred, although more serious diseases like cholera and
typhoid that sometimes follow flooding have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard of these _ yet,'' said Ms. Amy. ``And I'm
saying `yet' because there are so many people out there and the
high-risk period hasn't arrived.'' She said that such diseases tend
to occur when the flooding stops and there is standing water that
allows for the breeding of germs.
</P>
<P>
   There have been emotional benefit shows on television in Beijing
the last two nights, featuring a mix of popular performers and
representatives of companies, schools and local Communist Party
cells announcing donations in cash or in kind. The Beijing Public
Security Bureau pledged $40,000. Mrs. Xue Wen and her 17 children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren pledged $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But there are rumblings that government policy, as well as the
rains, is to blame for the current catastrophe. An article this
week in a popular newspaper, Southern Weekend, blamed poor dike
upkeep and clear cutting of trees as factors.

   GEORGIA-PACIFIC _ With the stock prices of forest products
companies in a slump and Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s at the bottom of
the group, Chairman Pete Correll has indicated he'd be willing to
sell the company. He also told an analyst recently he'd be willing
to buy, too, but acknowledged the company's price-to-earnings ratio
was currently too low relative to the rest of the industry. Also

share-repurchase program it had to halt June 30 and GP's take on
how it will fare given the industry's gloomy forecast for both its

Raton, was picked as Able's top executive after a five-month search
by Korn/Ferry International, a Los Angeles-based executive
headhunting firm. He will start August 25 as Able Telcom's
president, director and CEO. (Murawski, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ If a shamed Bill Clinton stages a comeback, it
will be because a unashamed Marion Barry serves as his de facto
political role model. Such are the wretched depths to which we have
sunk in our public life. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED 8/21.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ President Bill Clinton's misbehaviors and the
corrosion they have set on his administration are his own fault and
his own responsibility but they never should have become a state
issue. They have because of the wanton misuse of a
special-prosecutor law and because there really was a vast
right-wing conspiracy out to get the president. (Teepen, Cox News
Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ The editorial board of the Miami News
has not met for almost 10 years. That's because the newspaper has
been out of business that long. But, after hearing Bill Clinton's
brief, incomplete talk to the nation last Monday, I wished the
board was still around _ to keep me from going off the deep end.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ IVANGOROD, Russia _ You pass through here by
train from St. Petersburg on the way to Estonia. It's the border
stop. A hundred yards or so farther down the track and you're free
and clear. I didn't make it. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN _ I was disappointed at the opening
ceremonies of the ninth annual National Poetry Slam Wednesday
afternoon at the Electric Lounge. More than 200 poets are in town
for this four-day event. And not one of these clowns recited my
favorite poem. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KABAT-COLUMN _ I missed it. Once again, I'm a day late and a
dollar short. Did you know there is a National Splurge Day? Neither
did I, until it was past. It's a day promoting self-indulgence and
the abdicating of responsibilities. I always miss the good stuff.

<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ I went looking for my missing box of Ding Dongs
when I came across my youngest son, holding a foil wrapper in his
hand and looking suspicious.''I absolutely, positively did not
steal that box of pastry -- Ding Dongs,'' he said, jabbing his
finger in the air. It was a pretty strong statement and despite the
physical evidence, I believed him. (Latham, Marshall News
Messenger) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ The reason we are in a foreign country is
because of a motorcycle convention in South Dakota and all the
trouble they're having in Wisconsin. Contrary to some reports, news
that Neal Boortz and his motor home were on our trail and gaining
had nothing to do with our decision to leave our native land.

</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ When I was halfway through
writing a column condemning President Clinton's treatment of his
closest supporters, my editor called an editorial board meeting to
discuss the bombings. ``What bombings?'' I asked. ``Have they
bombed us again?'' ``No,'' he said. ``Clinton ordered air strikes
against terrorists bases in Afghanistan.'' ``Awwright!'' I said.
``I'll vote for that.'' (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    Escaping to Canada
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This comes to you from just the other side of Bashed in Head
Buffalo Jump, located in Alberta, Canada. Bashed in Head Buffalo
Jump is where the Moye and Minter Corps of Discovery is anchored
for the night after abandoning the Lewis and Clark trail for safer
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we are in a foreign country is because of a
motorcycle convention in South Dakota and all the trouble they're
having in Wisconsin. Contrary to some reports, news that Neal
Boortz and his motor home were on our trail and gaining had nothing
to do with our decision to leave our native land.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about a possible dairy cow uprising in Wisconsin, we
decided to take our chances with buffalo and elk. As some of you
may have noticed while traveling on I-75, Wisconsin advertises
itself as ``America's Dairyland.'' Until lately Wisconsinites have
been as proud of the slogan on their automobile tags as we are of
the ``Fergit Hell'' tags we buy for our pickups as soon as we get
the gun rack paid for.
</P>
<P>
   That was before animal activists decided milking a cow is
offensive. Offensive to the cow, that is. Anyone who has performed
the chore of milking a cow on a cold winter morning knows it's
offensive to the milker, especially when the cow steps in the
bucket and swats you in the face with her tail.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe we've been so callous for hundreds, even
thousands, of years, milking all those cows and encouraging small
children to drink, without ever asking how the cows felt about it.
We still don't have it straight from the cow's mouth, but
fortunately the Wisconsin activists have learned how to ``speak for
those who cannot speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They're demanding that the governor remove the offending slogan
from that state's automobile tags. Thank goodness we're more
forward thinking in Georgia. We got ``Peach State'' off our tags
several years ago after some insensitive chamber of commerce type
stuck it on without asking the opinion of a single peach.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready to say that milking a cow is a crime you'd want to
impeach a president for, but the next time you order a milkshake
you might think about it. Actually, the motorcycle convention in
South Dakota worried me more than threats of cow riots in
Wisconsin. Apparently Moye and Minter and Lewis and Clark are the
only folks who come to that part of the country not riding a
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Sturgis, S.D., simultaneously with 250,000 _ maybe
up to a half-million, according to the papers _ Harley-Davidsons
and their riders. They had to skin half the cows in Texas to make
all the leather we saw in Sturgis and still didn't have enough to
adequately cover the female riders. I won't even go into the
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard that motorcycle gangs include doctors, lawyers,
accountants and elderly TV weathermen, but I don't think they came
to Sturgis. We did meet one fellow who said he was from Oregon, on
his way to Florida to teach history and law. Probably somebody
Steve Spurrier hired to tutor his football team.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get really nervous about the motorcycles until we went
to dinner at what we thought was one of the nicer restaurants in a
nearby village. Captain Moye, with all the elan we've come to
expect from residents of Northside Fayetteville, perused the wine
list, selecting a vintage white zinfandel. The steward poured the
ceremonial sip and let Captain Moye sniff the cork. We did have one
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you serving wine in plastic cups?'' inquired Mrs.
Moye. ``Back home many of the better restaurants use glasses,
especially in Peachtree City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we do, too,'' explained the steward, ``but we never
put glasses on the table when bikers are in town.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope I'm not offending anyone when I say I've long been wary
of motorcycle riders. Even when they're old and fat and needing a
shave they seem to appeal to womenfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when I was posing as a newspaper editor, we decided
to hire a nonconventional columnist to attract nonreaders.
Newspaper executives, for some strange reason, often value
nonreaders above readers.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing her resume I asked the young lady how a
preacher's wife in Texas got to be a nonconventional newspaper
columnist in Atlanta. She said one Sunday morning after services,
while her minister husband was shaking hands with his departing
flock, she wandered out to the street just as some fellows drove up
on their Harleys. One asked her if she'd like a ride. She said yes,
hopped on, and just kept riding. Left a pot roast in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of how much my own wife, a direct descendant of Marco
Polo, likes to travel, I was anxious to get out of Sturgis. That is
why, with apologies to Lewis and Clark, we are in Bashed in Head
Buffalo Jump, heading home to check the deer damage, and hopefully
before tomatoes quit bearing and the beans get too husky to eat.

   GEORGIA-PACIFIC _ With the stock prices of forest products
companies in a slump and Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s at the bottom of
the group, Chairman Pete Correll has indicated he'd be willing to

to buy, too, but acknowledged the company's price-to-earnings ratio
was currently too low relative to the rest of the industry. Also

   DESIGNERS-HOWPROSLIVE _ Brooks Garcia just can't get enough of
romance, both indoors and out. The East Atlanta bungalow he's
renovated harkens to the '30s, and his garden is spilling with
old-fashioned plants. It's a setting the garden designer relishes _
and a look he strived for in his work. With a list of tips from the
expert. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS. ETA 8
p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   HERBS _ Everything you ever wanted to know about herbs can be
found under one roof Aug. 28-29, when Callaway Gardens south of
Atlanta presents its gigantic Herb Days celebration. (Flanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   LEEMAY-COLUMN _ When it comes to gardens, every season something
happens that had not happened the year before, that might never
happen again: an unexpected bloom, a death... It's the little
garden surprises that makes it all worthwhile. (May, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   FACES-OF-FAITH _ These Faces of Faith are modest and humble. But
they touch lives in extraordinary ways. They are happiest when
serving their neighbors and surprised to discover those neighbors
think they are special. They came to our attention through readers
who suggested them for The Post's Faces of Faith feature. (Life
stories follow.) (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (d Category)
</P>
<P>
   COASTAL-FOOD _ If you want tips on finding a great waterfront
restaurant, ask a boater. That's the premise behind the just
published ``Intracoastal Waterway Restaurant Guide &AMP; Recipe Book''
by Susan and Charles Eanes (Espichel Enterprises, $14.95). The
book, the authors say, is ``a culinary cruise'' along ``the liquid
Route 66.'' (Norris, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   CATSUIT _ AUSTIN _ My day in a catsuit, inspired by The Avengers
movie, first person by Carolyn Kelly. (Austin American-Statesman)
ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-SHORTS _ Into That Good Night. By Ron Rozelle. Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux. $22. 182 pages. This memoir about memory _ or
rather the loss of it _ at first seems as plain as its East Texas
landscape. There are snakes living under the rocks in East Texas,
and one wishes Rozelle had looked under a few more of them. (And
other brief reviews of books.) (Warmbold, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   RATPACK _ The lifestyle is fun. The same can't be said about the
movie. While ``The Rat Pack'' gives us a fascinating _ and often
absorbing _ peek beyond the larger-than-life facades of Frank
Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Martin, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, it
can't overcome the fact that the actors look and sound almost
nothing like the characters they play. (Thompson, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.

<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   RATPACK-LIOTTA _ He got more press than Elvis. Wore the coolest
tailor-made suits. Bedded beautiful dames. Hung with mobsters and
helped elect a president. Oh, and Frank Sinatra could carry a tune,
too. HBO brings Ol' Blue Eyes and his booze-swigging, chain-smoking
cronies, Dean Martin (Joe Mantegna) and Sammy Davis Jr. (Don
Cheadle), back to life Saturday in ``The Rat Pack'' (9 p.m.).

STOCKS TUMBLE AS HONG KONG ENDS MARKET INTERVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ After a weeklong buying spree to prop up the
slumping stock market here, the Hong Kong government let the free
market take over Friday. And stocks promptly tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   To critics of the government, the abrupt reversal is proof that
its decision to intervene last Friday was wrongheaded _ a temporary
victory that will cost Hong Kong its reputation as a free-market
bastion in a region where governments do not hesitate to manipulate
markets.
</P>
<P>
   To supporters, the decline merely represents a tactical pause in
the government's campaign against currency speculators. They note
that since the Hong Kong Monetary Authority began buying stocks
last Friday, the Hang Seng index of 33 leading stocks jumped 16
percent, before Friday's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that Hong Kong curbed its purchases of shares
and futures contracts, and may even have sold some shares. As a
result, the Hang Seng declined 214.9 points, or 2.8 percent, to
7,523.61 Friday. Hang Seng index futures plunged 2.8 percent in the
final five minutes of trading, as brokers who had been buying for
the government stopped, prompting a flood of last-minute sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clear message to investors is: Lock in your gains and get
out,'' said Adrian Faure, head of China and Hong Kong research at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong. ``This market is artificially
inflated.''
</P>
<P>
   Faure estimated that the government spent between $640 million
and $770 million of its foreign reserves to buy shares of blue-chip
firms. That is less than 1 percent of Hong Kong's almost $100
billion in reserves, but some analysts said the money could have
been better spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong may have more financial resources than other Asian
economies, but using its reserves for this is a waste,'' said Chia
Yew Boon, research director at Santander Investment Securities in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials spent the week defending the decision to
intervene in the market. They said it was a necessary response to
hedge funds that were improperly manipulating the territory's
financial markets. The speculative attacks, they said, were
destabilizing Hong Kong and fraying consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not out there to support the stock market at a certain
level, we are not out there to support the stock market at any
level,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of Hong Kong, in a
speech here on Thursday. ``It is a very defensive effort targeted
specifically at this particular action.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung insisted that Hong Kong ``was not departing from our
traditional free-market economy principles,'' though he added that
the government would consider intervening again if traders
continued speculating against the Hong Kong dollar with the goal of
depressing share prices.
</P>
<P>
   It is that sort of open-ended statement that worries analysts
like Faure. He said that as long as the government was willing to
prop up the stock market, investors could not be sure of its
commitment to linking the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hong Kong's monetary system, known as a currency board,
the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a ratio of 7.8
to 1. When traders sell the currency in large volumes, the board
can act to raise interbank interest rates, which draws dollars back
into the system.
</P>
<P>
   A side effect of the rise in interest rates is a decline in
stock prices, in part because the Hang Seng is heavily weighted
with shares of property and financial companies, which are
sensitive to rising rates. In effect, Hong Kong's stock market
absorbs the pain of maintaining the value of its currency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By arresting the slide of the stock market, some analysts said
Hong Kong was implicitly acknowledging that it was no longer
willing to tolerate the pain that goes with having a fixed exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling than the mechanics is the symbolism. Investors
are accustomed to government intervention in financial markets in
countries like Japan, Korea and Malaysia. But Hong Kong has always
operated without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a signal,'' Chia said. ``Investors say, `I thought
only the Japanese and Malaysians rigged the market. But now Hong
Kong does, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks the intervention was ill advised. Miron
Mushkat, the director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management,
said the government had legitimate concerns that the maneuvers of a
small circle of hedge funds were causing havoc for every
shareholder in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Mushkat said he was troubled last Friday, when Hong Kong's
financial secretary, Sir Donald Tsang, announced the intervention
as if it were a vendetta against currency traders. But Sir Donald
has since taken a lower profile, while Joseph Yam, the cool-headed
chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has emerged as the
government's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Given Yam's more reasoned tone, Mushkat said he was now
convinced that Hong Kong was fighting a tactical battle rather than
an all-out war. ``The policy- makers should act to protect the
interests of the whole community, not the interests of a few hedge
funds,'' he said.

CALIFORNIA'S BEST LOOKOUT POINTS GIVE MORE THAN DRAMATIC VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The power of a special place is difficult to
define, but for those who have felt it, easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   California's 25 best lookouts are much that way. You get more
than a dramatic view _ you also get a sensation that goes with it,
and that is why the experience can stay with you _ sometimes for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights of the best viewpoints in California include
long-distance panoramas from mountain tops, an aerial tramway,
famous and not-so-famous lookouts, from San Francisco to Mount
Shasta to distant canyon rims at sunrise. To be eligible for
consideration, all viewpoints had to be reachable in one day's
hiking from San Francisco, and while some require long, ambitious
climbs, others require just a ride in a car and short walks.
</P>
<P>
   All share one element: They are places so gifted with natural
beauty that you leave refreshed, infused with the beauty, a feeling
that can be recharged for months.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my rankings:
</P>
<P>
   1. Glacier Point, Yosemite National Park. There is no more
perfect view anywhere, and anyone can reach the point by car or
shuttle bus. Yet the experience can be enhanced by taking either of
two trails (Panorama or Pohono) that provide a far more private and
extended tour into California's most breathtaking landscape.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mount Tallac, Tahoe National Forest. Looking down from
Tallac's 9,735-foot summit, the cobalt-blue waters of Lake Tahoe
cradled in an alpine mountain bowl make this one of the most
breathtaking sights in the world. From Mount Tallac, directly below
you is Fallen Leaf Lake, Emerald Bay and then Tahoe, all of it
surrounded by forest and sky, and you may even feel blessed to take
in such a pristine view. The hike up requires a climb of 3,175 feet
over the course of 6 miles. It's a tough trip, and you may ask,
``Can it be worth it?'' Yes. Yes. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mount Eddy, Shasta-Trinity National Forest. You can sit here
in awe for hours, as if you are absorbing power as well as beauty.
You see, Mount Shasta is by far California's most beautiful
mountain, and though it is visible from a 125-mile radius, there is
no more stunning viewpoint than from the top of Mount Eddy. That is
because Mount Eddy (9,025 feet) is set directly to the west of
Mount Shasta (14,162 feet), with Interstate 5 (at 3,200 feet)
running right down the middle between them, so you get a powerful
impression of how Shasta rises up 11,000 feet from the valley
floor.
</P>
<P>
   4. San Jacinto Peak (via aerial tramway), Mount San Jacinto
State Park. From start to finish, there is no experience like this
anywhere in California. From near the town of Banning, you start
the trip by taking the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, which carries
you nearly 6,000 feet to the staging area at 8,516 feet. With
long-distance views en route, for many, this is the end of the
trip. But it gets even better: A 2,300-foot climb over the course
of 6 miles takes to San Jacinto Peak, 10,804 feet high, where it
can feel like you can see to infinity: virtually all of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   5. Mount Livermore (at night), Angel Island State Park. At
night, San Francisco is transformed into the Emerald City, and the
bay area becomes a land of charm when seen from the top of 781-foot
Mount Livermore. Long after the last ferry boat has left for the
day, the view is available only for those spending the night,
camping at one of the hike-in sites.
</P>
<P>
   6. Coast Trail, Point Reyes National Seashore. In one turn of
the body, you can take in a view like no other. My favorite lookout
here is 2 miles north of Wildcat Camp on the Coast Trail, where
there is a rock outcrop that towers over the coast. From north to
south, it feels as if you are absorbing the view, taking in Point
Reyes, Drake's Bay, Sculptured Beach, Arch Rock, then turning and
scanning miles of ocean, and onward south to Alamere Falls, Wildcat
Lake, Stormy Stack and miles of untouched coast. You may also spot
passing whales, ships and fishing boats, pelicans, cormorants and
murres.
</P>
<P>
   7. Mount Whitney, John Muir Wilderness. You have foothold in the
sky atop Mount Whitney, at 14,496 feet, the highest point in the
continental United States. Both near and far, and in all
directions, the view is staggering. To the north are rows of
mountain peaks (dozens over 12,000 feet) lined up for 125 miles; to
the east is an awesome drop of 11,000 feet into the Owens Valley;
to the west is the entire Great Western Divide.
</P>
<P>
   8. Klamath Overlook, Redwood National Park. Where else can you
sense the curvature of the earth? Nowhere better than on the Requa
Trail, and it can trigger all kinds of special feelings. The
Klamath Overlook is located just north of the Klamath River in
Redwood National Park, where you can drive to a pretty viewpoint of
the ocean. It turns out that this is just a start. From here, you
then hike off, climbing 2,000 feet over the course of 4 miles to
this drop-dead gorgeous view, where you really can see that the
horizon is curved, that the earth is round. It can set off emotions
you'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   9. Sierra Buttes Lookout Station, Tahoe National Forest. It's a
euphoric sensation at the Sierra Buttes Lookout, where you stand on
a mesh-like metal deck, allowing you to look straight down, with
nothing but air beneath your boots for what seems a thousand feet.
The views of the Sierra Nevada stretch out for miles, to Mount
Lola, Castle Peak, Grouse Ridge and French Meadows Reservoir, but
what strikes the heart is the nearby panorama, of the nearby
Sardine Lakes, and the vertical drop on the Buttes' east face.
</P>
<P>
   10. Eagle View, Sequoia National Park. A hike of less than a
mile will take you to one of the best lookouts in the Sierra
Nevada. From the Crescent Meadow Parking Area in Sequoia National
Park, a half-mile walk will take you to a ridge on the High Sierra
Trail, and thus the views begin. It takes only about 15, 20 minutes
to Eagle View. At your feet is a plunging canyon, and as you scan
beyond, the landscape is highlighted by awesome Moro Rock (a
6,725-foot granite dome), Castle Rocks (granite spires) in the
relative foreground, with the horizon sprinkled with peaks all the
way to the Great Western Divide.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the rest:
</P>
<P>
   11. Kearsage Pass, Mount Whitney Ranger District, John Muir
Wilderness. 12. East Peak Lookout, Mount Tamalpais State Park. 13.
Yosemite Point, Yosemite National Park. 14. Shasta summit, Mount
Shasta Wilderness. 15. Cascade Falls (from the brink), Lake Tahoe
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   16. Thousand Island Lake, Ansel Adams Wilderness. 17. Fresno
Dome, Sierra National Forest. 18. Land's End (at sunrise), San
Francisco, Golden Gate National Recreation Area. 19. Mount Baldy,
Angeles National Forest. 20. San Pablo Ridge (at sunset) Wildcat
Regional Park.
</P>
<P>
   21. Lassen Summit, Lassen Volcanic National Park. 22. Hawk Hill,
Marin Headlands, Golden Gate National Recreation Area. 23. Half
Dome, Yosemite National Park. 24. Preston Peak, Siskiyou
Wilderness, Smith River National Recreation Area.; 25. Mt. Elwell,
Lakes Basin Recreation Area, Plumas National Forest.

THE FUTURE WILL KNOW THEM FOR WHAT THEY WORE

   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23.)

 BY JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was, of course, the telltale navy dress, apparently a
simple little number, not a fancy designer creation but an
off-the-rack staple from a store as unremarkable as the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the beret. Maybe it was not the fashion statement
that Monica Lewinsky wanted to be remembered for. But an endlessly
repeated snippet of videotape has locked it in the national memory
as indelibly as her pre-makeover helmet hair.
</P>
<P>
   Louis XIV, who knew a few things about closed-door doings in the
chambers of power, said that fashion is a mirror of history. So it
is no surprise that clothing has figured prominently in the furor
over President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky: the dress
and a T-shirt from the Black Dog restaurant on Martha's Vineyard,
which he apparently gave her _ and a tie that she is said to have
given him.
</P>
<P>
   There is a school of historians that argues that things _
``material culture,'' some call them _ can tell at least as much
about political events as closely reasoned analysis. They find
evidence in the display cases of museums, among the coats and wigs
of the past, for this is certainly not the first time that apparel
has been talked about at the highest levels of American government.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon mentioned his wife's ``good Republican cloth
coat'' in his Checkers speech in 1952. Nixon was denying spending
an $18,000 political fund on luxuries for himself and his family.
And Dwight Eisenhower's aide Sherman Adams had to resign after
accepting a vicuna coat from a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Coats were also a problem for Chester Arthur, the 21st
president. He was criticized for owning too many _ 24 in all. ``He
was a dandy,'' the historian Henry Graff said, without suggesting
that anyone but Arthur had selected the coats that filled his
closet. ``It was just that this was a lavish guy in a time when the
class struggle grew keener.''
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Ronald Reagan defended his wife for wearing
dresses she borrowed from well-known designers. ``If she'd spent
the money, she'd have been criticized anyway, and here she was
criticized for getting them free,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief
curator of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate burglars wore gloves, and other Nixon-era
operatives are remembered for their elaborate spy disguises. But
Warren Harding's letters were steamier than Nixon's tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you garbed,'' Harding declared to a woman not his wife,
``but naked more.'' Later he complained to another woman he was
involved with that she spent too much on clothes _ specifically, on
a fur coat she wore when she visited him at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The author Wesley Hagood writes that Harding made the first
remark to Carrie Phillips, with whom he had an on-and-off affair
over 15 years. The second was to Nan Britton, who was still in
school when they began seeing each other.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes Miss Britton intended to wear to their first
encounter are documented: a brand-new gray tailored suit and a dark
blue sailor hat with a gray veil. But there is a but: ``It is
unlikely she had time to change from her school outfit before
arriving at the Manhattan Hotel,'' Hagood speculates, describing
how Harding planted himself on the hotel steps, the better to see
her as she approached.
</P>
<P>
   Hagood suggests that all they did on that occasion was talk,
though they adjourned to his room, which happened to be the hotel's
bridal suite. After describing other meetings in hotel rooms,
Hagood writes, ``Nan believed she was safe and would not become
pregnant if she kept her clothes on.'' (She later had a child that
she said was Harding's.)
</P>
<P>
   But in the fashion-obsessed '90s, Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of
Grass,'' a copy of which Clinton is said to have given Ms.
Lewinsky, has not caught the public imagination the way Ms.
Lewinsky's beret has. ``The beret was a traditional kind of hat
wear for French men, and it was very much associated in World War
II with Frenchness,'' Ms. Steele said. ``But it became kind of
corrupted with French Fascists who were associating with the Nazis,
so there was a falling off of wearing berets after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   And for women, berets were a minor trend in millinery, hard to
wear well and perhaps too flashy for the buttoned-down, sack-suited
look of official Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing about clothing is it is the object which is
closest to the naked human body,'' Ms. Steele said. ``It's also
closest to personal identity. We won't be too upset if someone
criticizes the furniture in the living room, but we'd be very hurt
if someone criticized or laughed at our clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   This raises a question unlikely to be asked by the prosecutors
in their workday uniforms: What, really, was the message Ms.
Lewinsky was sending when she gave the president a $100-plus
Ermenegildo Zegna tie? She is said to have told him, ``When I see
you wearing this tie, I'll know that I am close to your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Was she prompting Clinton to dress more fashionably?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele recalled Thoreau's warning: ``Beware of all
enterprises that require new clothes.'' She added: ``Only an
American could have come up with that. I think this is a very
American saga. In France they could have exchanged apartment
buildings and jewels, and it still wouldn't have been anybody's
business.''

 By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She recorded one of the top-selling albums of the
year so far, but when Natalie Imbruglia, a small, slender figure in
jeans and a T-shirt, with sunglasses propped on her head, moved
through Nobu restaurant in SoHo recently, she was barely noticed.
Her cover-girl face, featured in magazines and music videos and on
billboards, drew not a glance.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't seem to surprise her a bit. A former teen-age
soap-opera star in Australia, she came out of nowhere to crash the
pop-music scene. And she is well aware that many who have done the
same disappeared even more quickly than they emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something about ``Torn,'' the heartbreak hit that
helped her album, ``Left of the Middle'' (RCA Records), go
platinum, that has led more than one critic to forecast a
continuing career for this 23-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The song, written by three other musicians, had been recorded
several times by others but never with this success. A catchy
melody with a rhythmic rock groove, the song has ``Imbruglia's sad
vocals reaching a true lonely girl splendor,'' said Rob Sheffield's
review in Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The song topped the charts in Britain and then in the United
States a few months after she made her first trip to a recording
studio. The album made its debut in the United States in March at
the No. 10 spot in Billboard's chart, rare for a disc by a
newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so prepared for the worst that it took me a while to
relax,'' Ms. Imbruglia said over lunch. ``Everyone was excited
around me, but I was almost too scared that it might go away.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. With some potent support from RCA and the Creative
Artists Agency, Ms. Imbruglia plans to make her first concert tour
of the United States in the fall. ``I'm scared,'' she said, as she
pushed her flyaway hair from her eyes. ``I get scared about the
next album, the next song, the next everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Imbruglia (pronounced im-BRUE-lee-uh) was born in Campsie, a
suburb of Sydney, Australia, the second of four daughters of an
Italian father and an Australian mother. ``The Italian culture was
extreme and the Anglo-Saxon side was extreme,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she grew up in the beach town of Berkeley Vale, her life was
centered on dancing and singing lessons and her parents' financial
sacrifices. Her mother was a teacher; her father switched from
business to business _ a screen-printing shop, a corner store, a
plant nursery. ``He would build them up and then he would be
overworked and he would move to something else. Money was always an
issue,'' Ms. Imbruglia said.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple put their daughters in Roman Catholic schools and
dancing classes, and at 13, Natalie began voice lessons. ``My
mother paid for all,'' she said. ``I felt it. I felt bad.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not her only worry. Boys made fun of her Italian name
and shouted slurs at her. She struggled with that until she was
around 12: ``I made myself fit in. I did what all kids do.''
</P>
<P>
   Later she quit high school and enrolled at a performing arts
college in Sydney. She dropped out again and tried acting. At 16,
she was doing commercials and had a role in ``Neighbors,'' a soap
opera popular in Australia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go clubbing, drinking _ vodka and lemon soda back
then,'' she recalled. ``I was living the lifestyle because I was
famous. It affected me then in ways it doesn't now. I had money. If
I was depressed, I could go shopping. I was a little big for my
breeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1994, she left the soap and moved to London,
and for a time enjoyed the lingering adulation. Then she crashed.
She couldn't get work as an actress. She was broke. Her visa was
expiring. Out of desperation, she said, she started writing. ``I'll
never forget sitting in my bedroom, getting a pen and paper, and
feeling stupid for ever thinking I could write songs.''
</P>
<P>
   An encounter at a bar changed that. She met Anne Barrett, now
her manager, who encouraged her to take her work to Phil
Thornalley, a producer, musician and co-writer of ``Torn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought me a schoolbook full of songs,'' Thornalley said.
``Her songs were a little bit different from most pop hits, more
left of center. We picked a few and started putting music to the
lyrics. The collaboration evolved. She does a lot of the melody,
she's very much in there, helping with the arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornalley played ``Torn'' for her, and it was her demo tape of
the song that locked the deal with RCA.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Levy, music editor of Rolling Stone, said that her album as
a whole did not match ``Torn.'' But he saw the potential for a long
career: ``People have one-hit singles, sell a lot of records and
disappear. She has yet to disappear. She's really just at the
starting point. It's incumbent on her record company to break
another song and see if they can broaden her field, take someone
who has become a sensation on the basis of one song and build a
career. If they don't, it won't be Natalie Imbruglia's fault. It
used to take people years to do what she's done in a matter of
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reviewers have been cooler, contending that she has
exploited the rage for angst-ridden female pop stars like Alanis
Morissette, whose ``Jagged Little Pill'' fired up the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an easy prey for critics,'' Ms. Imbruglia said. ``Pretty
face, pop artist, I used to be on a soap. It doesn't take much
criteria to be compared to Alanis Morissette. Be young, be female,
have a few angry songs and you are Alanis. It's something I was
aware was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   She has released another song from her album, ``Wishing I Was
There,'' which she co-wrote, along with black-and-white video that
is getting heavy airplay and moving up the charts. She will soon
release her third video, ``Smoke,'' and begin writing songs and
compiling her next album.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said: ``I don't check the music charts every week. I
actually keep myself far from it. If all this went tomorrow, my
world wouldn't fall apart.''

I SOLISTI VENETI: SAVORING AN APPETIZER OF ITALIAN SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For fans of Baroque music in the 1960s, I Solisti
Veneti often seemed like a vast offshore recording factory. The
chamber orchestra and its director, Claudio Scimone, plowed through
scores by the ream and churned out hundreds of disks for the French
Erato label, many of which were available inexpensively through the
Musical Heritage Society's mail-order record club. In more recent
times the group has been eclipsed by period instrument bands, but
Scimone and company have continued their explorations, both in the
Baroque and into the 19th century, and they have found ways to keep
their performing style fresh.
</P>
<P>
   For its contribution to the Mostly Mozart Festival at Avery
Fisher Hall on Thursday evening, the group presented an overview of
Italian compositional styles, from Vivaldi's to Rossini's. By far
the most compelling piece on the program was Boccherini's Symphony
in D minor (Op. 12, No. 4), a tone painting in three slow movements
(although the first and third have quick sections within them)
subtitled ``La Casa del Diavolo'' (``The Devil's House'').
</P>
<P>
   Boccherini's string writing is foreboding from the opening bars,
and touches like the brief horn bursts in the first movement and
the torrential string writing in the finale keep the work's
atmosphere changeable and its path unpredictable. Scimone and his
players supported Boccherini's coloristic touches with fluid
dynamics _ including some exquisite pianissimo playing _ and a
gorgeously balanced sound.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Vivaldi's less frequently heard violin concertos filled
out the first half of the program. Marco Fornaciari, the
orchestra's concertmaster, played the ``Grand Mogul'' Concerto in D
(RV. 208), an almost operatic work with an elegantly spun, songlike
slow movement surrounded by dramatic allegros. Myriam Dal Don, who
is listed on the roster as principal violinist, gave a graceful and
appealingly crisp account of the solo line in the Concerto in C
(RV. 581), a work in which the violin mediates between two distinct
orchestral groups. Both concertos demanded considerable virtuosity
of the soloists, whose able and sometimes brilliant readings were
tarnished slightly by passing touches of stridency.
</P>
<P>
   As unpredictable as the works on the first half of the program
were, the second half was largely a write-off. Tartini's Trumpet
Concerto afforded opportunities for the ensemble's trumpeter, Mauro
Maur, to show his bright tone and considerable agility, but the
work itself was bland and virtually featureless. Instrumental works
by Donizetti and Rossini are comparatively rare, but after a few
bars a listener is on entirely familiar ground: these pieces are
made of the same formulaic, mind-numbingly trivial chirping that
drives these composers' operas. Only the species of warbler has
changed: in Donizetti's Concertino in G, it is an English horn, and
Giuseppe Falco played it deftly; in Rossini's Variations on a Theme
from ``La Donna del Lago,'' Lorenzo Guzzoni played the solo
clarinet line with energy and spirit.

 &HT;    THE BIZARRE, UNPREDICTABLE, HISTORIC WEEK THAT WAS
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, August 23
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was muggy on Monday, a sticky, sweaty day in the
nation's capital, and room service at the Hay-Adams Hotel stayed
busy carrying bottled water and other refreshments to the TV crews
and correspondents working on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Located across Lafayette Park from the White House, the hotel
provides a picturesque perspective on history. And network anchors
Tom Brokaw of NBC and Peter Jennings of ABC and other newsmen wise
in the use of imagery chose this vantage point from which to report
the dramatic story unfolding at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world was watching.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that at the E. Everett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse,
several blocks away, federal marshals stuck pieces of dark paper
over the panes of glass above the guarded doors leading into U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's paneled courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Via closed-circuit television, Judge Johnson and 23 grand jurors
inside that darkened courtroom would be among the very few people
to witness the long, long day's first momentous event _ a five-hour
afternoon interrogation of President Clinton by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr and other prosecutors investigating whether the
president engaged in an illegal cover-up of a sexual affair with
young intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's second historic event in the White House Map Room would
attract a global audience, though, as Clinton went on national
television at 10 p.m. (Eastern time) to admit having an improper
relationship with Lewinsky and misleading the nation and his family
about it for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech lasted just over four minutes, but
airwaves were filled for hours with opinions on what it all meant.
The final room service delivery to the roof of the Hay-Adams would
not come until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the crowd that had stood on the sidewalk beside
Pennsylvania Avenue and peered at the White House through a
wrought-iron fence had dispersed. Police had taken away the young
man who screamed something about Iraq and stabbed himself in the
neck with a screwdriver. Gone was the group that sweltered in
overcoats and carried signs protesting Clinton's ``Snow Job'' and
``Blizzard of Lies.'' The TV correspondents had finally abandoned a
strip of crushed gravel _ dubbed ``Pebble Beach'' by photographers
_ that was laid to spare the presidential lawn when ``stand-ups''
are done with the North Portico as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   But in the basement of the Old Executive Office building, a
stone's throw from the Oval Office and from the TV stand-up sites,
military and intelligence planners from the CIA and Pentagon were
still working on a secret mission that would make the end of this
week as memorable as the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how Washington wished Tuesday that body language could truly
reveal the thoughts of the First Family.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and humidity of the previous day had mercifully
dissipated by mid-afternoon when the Clintons strode dutifully but
awkwardly across the South Lawn to the helicopter that would take
them on the first leg of their trip to Martha's Vineyard for a
planned two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton, the 18-year-old daughter, walked between her
parents and clasped a hand of both _ trying to hold her hurting
family together in the opinions of countless armchair analysts who
watched on TV. First Lady Hillary Clinton walked stiffly, mostly
keeping her eyes straight ahead, looking as happy as a wife whose
husband had confessed marital infidelity on national TV the night
before. The president, improbably dressed in a dark suit and tie
for his trip to the beach, held his Labrador, Buddy, on a leash
with his right hand and smiled and chatted with Chelsea during the
walk.
</P>
<P>
   On the walk, Bill and Hillary Clinton did not speak to each
other, but only an hour earlier the First Lady's spokeswoman had
released a statement that ``she is committed to her marriage and
loves her husband and daughter very much.'' Later, aboard Air Force
One, the president sat at a table while his daughter and wife sat
together elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the president's speech was receiving withering
reviews _ too much anger and self pity, too little contrition and
apology _ on editorial pages across the country and from
politicians of both parties. The words and tone also upset a
besieged young woman whom the world has glimpsed almost daily but
never heard for the past seven months. Reports soon circulated that
Monica Lewinsky was angered and saddened by the president's
depiction of their relationship. Friends said she considered their
bonds emotional as well as sexual and that she had been led to
believe they had a future together.
</P>
<P>
   On this Earth, at least, there is no future for the father and
son whose remains were mournfully borne in flag-draped caskets to
Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday. Among the Americans killed
at the August 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, were
Julian Bartley, Sr., a 54-year-old career diplomat, and his
namesake and only son, Julian ``Jay'' Bartley, Jr., a 20-year-old
sophomore at the U.S. International University there.
</P>
<P>
   Their untimely deaths were the products of ``cowardly, inhumane,
ungodly actions of vicious, deranged minds,'' said retired
ambassador Terence Todman, a family friend who spoke at the
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths would soon be revenged.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent most of Wednesday in seclusion on Martha's
Vineyard, emerging briefly to walk Buddy on the beach
</P>
<P>
   while wearing a sweater tossed casually over his shoulders.
Meanwhile, most folks were talking about his neckties.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times broke a story that prosecutors suspected that
the president was signaling Lewinsky on the day she testified _
August 6 _ by wearing a tie she had given him. The tie, which
Clinton wore in televised appearances that day, was a patterned,
gold-and-blue, $100 imported silk Zegna. Lewinsky said that when
she gave Clinton the tie for his 50th birthday, she had told him:
``When I see you wearing this tie, I'll know I am close to your
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidently, Clinton celebrated his 52nd birthday on Wednesday
with a barbecued chicken dinner at friend and grand jury witness
Vernon Jordan's vacation home on the island. He received a blue
sweater made with wool from Martha's Vineyard sheep.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, Clinton spoke four times by phone with Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger, his national security advisor, and was reassured
that planning was on track for two missile attacks at terrorists in
retaliation for the bombings that killed the Bartley men and over
260 other people in Kenya and Tanzania. Berger, who had stayed in
Washington, also phoned House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and
other congressional leaders to alert them that military action is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The corridors of Capitol Hill were occupied mostly by tourists.
Congress was in recess. Back in their home states, a few members
called for Clinton to resign but most were silent _ waiting to see
how the scandal plays out with the voters. At the federal
courthouse, a cool breeze blew across a largely deserted Monica
Beach _ the plaza and sidewalk where newspeople stake out Starr's
investigation _ as the grand jury took a day off. Inside, though,
secrecy still reigned _ albeit it in an unrelated case _ as a
federal appeals court ruled that the public and press cannot
witness the Justice Department's pretrial questioning of Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates in an antitrust suit scheduled to begin in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   Around town, TV technicians and correspondents went to bed
early. The next morning, Lewinsky was due to testify for a second
time before Starr's grand jury and prime spots on Monica Beach
needed to be staked out by 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At about 3 a.m. on Thursday, Berger called Clinton for the final
okay on launching Tomahawk missiles against terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and a chemical weapons plant in Sudan. Clinton said
``go.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday morning, the Kennedy Center announced that among
the recipients of its 1998 honors for lifetime achievement in the
performing arts was Willie Nelson, the braided, outlaw Texas
troubadour who played a character pretty much like himself last
year in the movie ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the last mention of that film on this momentous
day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by mid-morning, outside the federal courthouse, NBC
News make-up artist Linda Boyle was busy keeping correspondents and
commentators looking cool and competent for a sunny, eventful day.
``There are no real prima donnas,'' she explained. ``They treat me
well because they know I have to treat them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, prosecutors showed Lewinsky a videotape of Clinton's
testimony on Monday. Reports would soon be emanating from Monica
Beach that the star witness had contradicted the president on the
extent of their sexual relationship and how she came to turn over
gifts he had given her to presidential secretary Betty Currie. The
testimony could help Starr build a case of perjury and obstruction
of justice against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 p.m., Lewinsky left the courthouse wearing a gray
suit, teal shirt and sunglasses. ``She answered all questions
truthfully and completely,'' said spokeswoman Judy Smith. ``It is
our expectation that today's appearance concludes her grand jury
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, Lewinsky ``is looking forward to beginning the
process of rebuilding the rest of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Lewinsky was leaving the courthouse,
Clinton made a surprise visit to the makeshift press center at
Edgartown School on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have struck back,'' he informed shocked reporters,
many of whom who were dressed casually in shorts and T-shirts.
``The United States launched an attack this morning on one of the
most active terrorists bases in the world .''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was returning to Washington immediately,
scrambling the small traveling pool of reporters that would
accompany him.
</P>
<P>
   From the Pentagon briefing by Defense Secretary William Cohen to
movie buffs around the nation, the question was immediately raised:
Isn't this eerily like ``Wag the Dog.'' In that satirical film, a
president is caught in a sex scandal involving a young girl in the
Oval Office and his aides bring in a Hollywood producer to stage a
fake war and divert the nation's attention. Willie Nelson plays a
songwriter who writes the musical score to the war, incidentally.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was offended by such cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute
obligation to protect the American people from terrorist
activity,'' insists Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and many other Republicans declared their support for
the mission. But Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said ``given the
president's difficulties this week, it is legitimate to question
the timing of this action.''
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon, Clinton addressed the nation from the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let our actions today send this message loud and clear,'' he
said. ``There are no expendable American targets. There will be no
sanctuary for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Security was tightened Friday at the Washington Monument,
Smithsonian Institution and other landmarks in the nation's
capital. Outside the Pentagon, police in black SWAT uniforms
brandished automatic weapons on patrols. Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi-born Islamic militant whose terrorist camp was targeted by
the missile strikes in Afghanistan, reportedly issued new threats
against the United States, including a warning to Clinton that
``the battle has not started yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to suggest to you or to the American people
that what happened yesterday means there will be no more
terrorism,'' Berger told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright went to Capitol
Hill to brief members of Congress and staffers about the missile
attack. They answered some questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we launched what we believe to be a successful
attack upon a training camp, a terrorist training camp, and we
believe it is successful in the sense that we destroyed a number of
facilities,'' said Cohen. ``The extent of that damage has yet to be
determined in terms of the clarity which we would want.''
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:50 p.m., Clinton left the White House and returned to
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reuters News Service reported that videotape rental
stores can't keep up with demand for ``Wag the Dog.''

   USSTRIKES-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Eleven days before he is set to meet
with President Clinton in Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Friday sharply condemned the U.S. air strikes against suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, calling them
``indecent.'' Yeltsin said: ``My attitude is negative, just as to
any act of terrorism. The basis for (armed) intervention is
impotence to solve this question through talks.'' U.S. Ambassador
James Collins held talks at the Kremlin and the foreign ministry in
an effort to explain the U.S. actions and soothe Russian concerns.

   USSTRIKES-POLICY - WASHINGTON - U.S. officials hinted at a major
shift in American policy against terrorism with a vow Friday to go
on the ``offense'' in a ``sustained'' campaign against terrorist
groups. But experts warned that any such effort must include not
only bombs but diplomatic initiatives to expose terrorists as
murderers as opposed to warriors. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

   USSTRIKES-QUESTIONS _ WASHINGTON _ Although the U.S. government
provided no air cover for the more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles
fired at terrorist operations in Sudan and Afghanistan, officials
provided plenty of ``on-air cover'' for the operation itself.
Following President Clinton's Oval Office address, readily
accessible administration officials blanketed the airwaves with
briefings and interviews. Air cover that continued Friday morning.
But curiously, they're offering few specifics on the so-called
``compelling evidence'' that led to the air strikes, thus leaving
numerous questions remaining about the most significant operation
aimed against terrrorism in U.S. history. (Glass, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   USSTRIKES-HOME _ WASHINGTON _ The morning after the U.S. forces
launched missiles to send a strong message to terrorists around the
world, Americans awoke to ``terrorist warnings'' at home.
Travelers, tourists and commuters were immediately bombarded Friday
with warnings of heightened security at airports, mass transit
systems, federal buildings and even national monuments. ``Watch
for, and report suspicious packages and/or people,'' Washington,
D.C. area METRO riders were told. All that seemed to be missing
were the air raid sirens. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).

   ATTN EDs: With its brilliant hand-woven rugs, shimmering black
pottery and fantastic carved animals, Oaxaca state is indisputably
one of Mexico's favorite travel destinations. Three villages
minutes from Oaxaca city specialize in these widely-recognized
crafts, which have found their way into museums, galleries and
homes around the world. Cox Newspapers Mexico correspondent Susan
Ferriss visited the three towns, and talked to Zapotec Indian
artisans about their crafts and how their businesses have helped
curb poverty. Following are the budget lines for three short
stories:
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-RUGS _ TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Some have business
cards printed in English. Others have clients who fly in to buy in
bulk. Zapotec Indians in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca, make
hand-dyed and hand-woven rugs that are considered some of Mexico's
finest in arts and crafts. With chickens and children running about
her patio, Margarita Sosa Vasquez proudly demonstrates how her
family produces these rugs _ which are a bargain when bought in the
village but can fetch hundreds more in the United States. To dye
wool for the rugs, Margarita shows how a blight is scraped from
cactus leaves to produce various shades of red. Greens are squeezed
from alfalfa, browns from nutshells and blues from indigo. The
patterns Margarita weaves are ancient, depicting lightening bolts,
mescal plants, diamonds and other shapes. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).

<P>

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ANIMALS _ ARROZOLA, Mexico _ Carved from pieces of the
copal tree and painted in riotous colors, the animals of Arrazola,
Oaxaca, enrich Mexican culture -- and have enriched the Zapotec
Indian families that produce the creatures that tourists flock here
to buy. Claudio and Teresa Ojeda, who are particularly successful,
fashion animals that are larger than most in town, sometimes
measuring up to three feet wide or tall. The pieces are in demand
as far away as Hong Kong. And no wonder: they are mind-bending
fusions of shapes and colors that defy the imagination.
Fire-breathing dragons sport tails that turn into spitting
serpents. A giant lobster sprouts a lizard on its back. A ram with
curved horns ripples with sensual, almost human muscles. The Ojedas
say their designs are spontaneous. But they also attribute them to
visions they've seen after eating hallucinogenic mushrooms, an
ancient tradition among some Oaxacan Indians. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POTTERY _ SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ For thousands
of years, Zapotec Indians in this Oaxacan community have harvested
a dull gray clay from a special place in the hills and fashioned it
into pots and sculptures that turn black once they are fired. In
the 1950s, a tiny Zapotec potter named Dona Rosa discovered that if
she rubbed her black pots with a crystal stone and fired them again
the pieces would take on a lustrous shine that people seemed to
love. Today Dona Rosa's son carries on his mother's art in the
village of San Bartolo Coyotepec, not far from the city of Oaxaca.
Using ancient methods _ and the same clay as their ancestors _
potters here spin vessels huge and small and sculpt candlesticks,
mermaids and other creatures. The pots are often pierced with
delicate patterns that cast flickering shadows when candles are
placed inside. And some of the larger vessels are scored with
intricate webbed patterns that resemble South Pacific tattoos.

   MONICABEACH _ WASHINGTON _ Among those Americans who aren't so
anxious for independent counsel Kenneth Starr to wind up his
investigation of President Clinton are the residents of Monica
Beach _ the photographers and TV technicians who have camped
outside the E. Everett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse since January.
``As a citizen, I guess I am glad to see it ending. But jobwise _
no,'' said a network cameraman. ``This has been a gravy train.''
For networks employees, the overtime pay has been great. And for
freelance photographers, the endless stream of witnesses has meant

   TRYPTOPHAN _ WASHINGTON _ A popular food supplement,
L-tryptophan, sickened hundreds of people in the United States and
caused 30 deaths in the late 1980s, when a contaminated form was
sold. The supplement was temporarly withdrawn from the market. Now,
the pills appear again to have been contaminated, scientists say.
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic, in a paper to be published Sept. 1,
in the journal Nature Medicine, say they tested L-tryptophan now
being sold in health food stores and found some lots contaminated,
possibly in the same manner as before. L-tryptophan is marketed as
``nature's sleeping pill,'' taken for insomnia, obesity and
headaches. Although no cases of the condition that led to deaths in
the 1980s have been reported, the FDA has been notified of the
potential contamination. Some scientists call the situation an
``epidemic waiting to happen.'' This paper is embargoed for
publication only after Aug. 31. If the embargo is not lifted by
Nature Medicine, we plan to break it because of public safety
implications. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

House bed, from a buffalo hunter's Sharps carbine to a Baby
Boomer's Daisy ``Red Ryder'' BB gun, the new museum recalls a
nation's history through its guns. The National Rifle Association's
$3.1 million National Firearms Museum provides an array of dramatic
displays illustrating the notion that guns are as all-American as
baseball or Old Glory _ a controversial concept in an era when
schoolchildren shoot classmates and politicians bemoan the
availability of assault weapons. (Dart, Cox News Service). WITH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Barbara Clementine Harris knelt at the altar, her
68-year-old knees padded only by her cassock's thin beige cloth.
Head lowered, she gently lifted a wet cloth from a plastic tub and
washed a man's bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   The foot washing is a yearly Episcopal ritual, symbolic of
Jesus' washing the Apostles' feet, a show of humility. For those
gathered, seeing Harris humbled was impressive. After all, she is
the suffragan (assisting) bishop for Massachusetts, which means she
is second in command of the nation's largest Episcopal diocese. She
has held the job since 1988, when she became the first woman
elected as a bishop in the world's 70-million member Anglican
Church.
</P>
<P>
   But what the 12 barefoot celebrants may not have known is that
they were seeing just one side of Harris, who, before becoming a
priest at age 50, spent nearly three decades as a corporate
executive _ occasionally barefoot herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara used to sit at her desk and take off her shoes while
she talked on the phone,'' said Bud Davis, who worked for Harris
when she was a Sun Oil Co. public relations manager. ``She'd turn
her head, and we'd go in and steal her shoe. Practical jokes were
not only tolerated, they were expected in Barbara's department.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was 30 years ago, when Harris was known for throwing
fabulous dinner parties in her native Philadelphia. And this is
now. Being a bishop for 10 years has to have changed Harris, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Dorothy Cousins, a retired Philadelphia
police detective who has been one of Harris's closest friends since
seventh grade. Harris still drives her BMW. She still vacations at
a condo in Cancun, Mexico. She still calls her three best friends _
friends she's had for 60 years _ once a week. She still has a
cleaning lady. She still spends her free time listening to
classical music. She still cooks like a chef. Harris has not
changed. It just so happens that she has always been a complex and
motivated human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't set out in life to be a bishop,'' Harris mused
during an interview in her office on the fourth floor of the
diocesan headquarters on Tremont Street, across from Boston Common.
``At least I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, dressed impeccably in slacks, a shirt tailored for her
petite frame, and purple pumps several shades removed from her nail
polish, did not choose to sit behind her large desk. Instead, she
offered her guest a seat on the crimson sofa and positioned herself
on a hard wooden chair nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's religious mentor, Philadelphia's Reverend Paul
Washington, said that when he thinks of Harris, he gets an image of
a witty storyteller standing in front of a giggling group of
onlookers in her living room. He said he has often suggested,
almost seriously, that she be a stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
   But in this formal office setting, that sense of humor was
clearly under wraps. Harris spoke in measured tones, outlining her
schedule as dryly as a press release. She works about 80 hours a
week, much of it spent behind the wheel of her car, en route to
churches, or to her home in Foxborough, Mass. The 45-minute
interview, rare and methodical, was all she could fit in.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the office, however, hinted at the passions Harris
has experienced since she was a young girl. The framed watercolor
of a stained-glass window in a Roxbury, Mass. church spoke of her
upbringing in a black Episcopal parish; the honorary degrees showed
that little in life is impossible if you have faith (Harris never
completed college); the colorful African wall hangings were a
reminder that, despite the church's reputation in New England as a
white Anglo-Saxon institution, most Anglicans worldwide are not
white. (There are more in Uganda and Nigeria than in all of the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was a framed photograph of Harris herself, a
staff in one hand. A secret smile played at the corner of her
mouth. She looked as if she was meant to be here. As if someone had
called her. And, according to Harris, someone did.
</P>
<P>
   God.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Harris was 16 years old, and it was New Year's Eve. Her
friend Marilyn Allston was over at the Harris family home in
Germantown, Pa. The girls were doing their hair and laying out the
dresses they would wear for their double date. The plan was to go
to a church social. But the girls were sleepy and decided to take a
nap. When they woke up, it was past midnight. The boys had been
sent home, and they'd missed the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other, and I said, `What are we going to do
now?''' recalled Allston. ``The first thing Barbara said is `We are
going to pray.' That's the kind of person she's always been.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A segregated life
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris grew up in a black neighborhood outside Philadelphia at a
time when life was segregated, including the YMCA, where her
picture now hangs in the Hall of Fame. Her father was a quiet,
gentle, and educated man who labored at a local steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days you had doctors working at the post office,''
said Allston. ``Among blacks, just because someone worked a
blue-collar job did not mean they were not well educated or well
mannered.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's mother, Beatrice, was a classical pianist who worked as
the organist and choir director at the neighborhood church, Saint
Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call her Miss Bea,'' recalled Washington. ``I knew
Miss Bea rather well. She was a very outspoken person, unafraid to
address the issue or the question, no matter how sensitive. I
certainly feel that she gave Barbara a good dose of that dimension
in herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's elder sister, Josephine, still lives in the family
home. Younger brother Walter lives in Florida. Harris said she is
close to both.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Harris kept busy with school, piano lessons, church
activities, and writing. At the Philadelphia High School for Girls,
she was recruited to write a weekly column on high school life in
the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper aimed at the African-American
community. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making religion fun
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoons and evenings, friends recall, the Harris
home, with its enclosed porch and baby grand piano, was the place
to go. ``Barbara and her family had a way of making elegance, and
even religion, seem fun,'' said Dorothy Cousins. At 16, Cousins
converted to the Episcopal Church, just so ``I could go with
Barbara.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Harris attended
Philadelphia's Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and
Journalism. In 1949, at age 19, she was hired by Joseph V. Baker
Associates Inc., a local public relations firm. Without a college
degree, but armed with a quick mind, Harris moved up in the
company. By the time she left, in 1968, she was the president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Harris took a job at Sun Oil as a community relations
consultant. Once again, she was promoted, eventually chosen to head
the company's public relations department in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was briefly married and divorced. She has no children.
None of her friends was willing to talk about the former husband,
except to say that he remained close enough to the family to attend
Miss Bea's funeral. Harris declined to answer questions about her
personal romantic life.
</P>
<P>
   Key elements in Harris's life have been her friendships, her
civil rights activism, and her work in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church was not something to be played with for Barbara,'' said
Washington. He met Harris in the mid-1950s, when both worked as
church youth counselors. ``She was never someone you could describe
as a pew warmer. She was going to get in the midst of things.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Civil rights crusader
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris switched parishes as an adult to be closer to Washington,
a priest and author well known in Philadelphia for his political
activism. Fighting for the rights of blacks and women became a
central part of her life during the 1960s. She marched with Martin
Luther King Jr. and worked for the Urban League and other
organizations. She is still active in Episcopal groups for
African-Americans and is very outspoken against the church's
lingering disapproval of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Harris, still a laywoman, was asked to be the cross
bearer at a historic ceremony in Philadelphia when the first 11
women were ordained as Episcopal priests.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a beautiful foreshadowing of what was to come,''
according to Reverend Ann Robb Smith, now the priest at Harris's
hometown church, and one of many in attendance that day who
remember her leading the procession.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the ceremony, Harris said, she felt God tugging
at her to become more involved in the church. When asked to
describe that time in her life, Harris got a look in her eyes that
was so peaceful and intense it bordered on sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to explain,'' she said. ``I had a very
active lay ministry, which was very satisfying. But I discovered
that there was a different shape to my ministry, and that I was
being led to the ordained ministry for a different dimension of
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled against it for a long time. I didn't feel that I
was a worthy candidate. A friend of mine who was a priest and is
now a bishop said, `God does not call those who are worthy; he
makes worthy those who are called.' That helped.''
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to become a priest, Harris continued working at
Sun Oil. She took seminary classes nights and weekends and spent
her vacations studying, a nontraditional route. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Entering the order
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris was ordained a deacon in 1979, and a priest in 1980, at
the age of 50. She left her position at Sun, but remained a
consultant for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Her first religious job was as part-time priest in charge of a
church in Norristown, Pa., called Saint Augustine of Hippo. Then,
in 1984, Harris was named executive director of the Episcopal
Church Publishing Co. and publisher of The Witness magazine, long
an open forum for dissent within the church. Harris had been on the
board of the company for years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she took Washington's place as interim director of the
Church of the Advocate when he had stepped down. That same year,
she attended the Lambeth Convention, a gathering of Anglican
bishops from all over the world, in Canterbury, England, as a
reporter for The Witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was open talk at the time that a woman might be elected
in the United States,'' said Reverend Canon Edward W. Rodman, the
canon missioner for Massachusetts and Harris's friend for 30 years.
``Her name was lifted up at that time as one of the possible
candidates. She came back sort of on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really torn about whether it was something I really
wanted to do,'' said Harris. ``I thought about all of the potential
problems. I thought I wouldn't be nominated, as a woman. Then I
thought that I would not be elected, even if I was nominated ... I
was greatly surprised at each step in the process.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Caring and alert'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came in for the formal interview with the committee,
it was so very clear in that time that she would be one of the
nominees,'' said John J. Bishop, a retired priest living in
Yarmouthport, who chaired the committee that elected Harris as a
bishop. ``She was just caring, alert, bright, committed to the
issues that were confronting the church at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington remembers the day Harris was elected. ``She received
a call from David Johnson, the bishop of Massachusetts at the time,
saying she had been elected. I did the sermon at her ordination to
the priesthood, and she called and said `You better get another
speech prepared.' That was deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's consecration as bishop was widely supported in this
liberal state. But some in the church, such as the Episcopal bishop
of South Carolina, who resigned one week after Harris was selected,
said her unorthodox religious education was unacceptable. Others
showed up at the consecration to protest, because of Harris's
gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the protests were very personal,'' Harris said. ``I
got death threats.'' She stopped to grin, and added, ``All in the
name of the Lord, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since Harris became a bishop, her performance
has opened doors for other women in the church. There are now eight
female bishops in the United States, seven in Canada, and one in
New Zealand. ``That's why the people who protested did so,'' Harris
said. ``They knew that if one woman was consecrated, that there
would be no stopping us after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has also elevated the visibility of nonwhites in the
local Episcopal church, which has become increasingly diverse. She
works in tandem with the diocesan bishop, Thomas Shaw, in a
relationship that those who know them describe as harmonious and
productive. The arrangement, by which they share most duties, is a
new system, and one that Rodman says was created to increase
Harris's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her energy, and her clear love of the work, church rules
require that all bishops retire at 72, four years from now for
Harris. Though she is vague about her plans after retirement, those
who know her say to stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say that we haven't seen the best from Barbara Harris
yet,'' said Rodman. ``There's no telling what she'll do next, but
you can be sure it will be amazing.''

JOB MARKET REMAINS STRONG IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite problems in Asia, the Massachusetts job market
is as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate dropped to 3.1 percent in July, the
second lowest level in the last 10 years, the Division of
Employment and Training reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts also added more than 89,000 jobs over the last
year, the largest annual increase since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The June jobless rate was 3.4 percent in Massachusetts, well
below the national rate of 4.5 percent. In April, the state's
jobless rate dipped to 2.9 percent, then the lowest in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing expansion throughout the country, and in
Massachusetts as well,'' said Wayne Ayers, &UR;  &LR; chief economist at
BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Will the good times continue? ``That's open for question,'' said
Ayers. ``As the US economy begins to slow down in the wake of Asia
so, too, will the Massachusetts economy. Right now, though, we are
beyond full unemployment. It can't get much better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is not the only state with positive news. Thirty
states and territories had July jobless rates below the national
average, Bloomberg News reported. By contrast, 18 states and the
District of Columbia had jobless rates above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Regionwide, the jobless rate in the Northeast was 4.6 percent,
according to the US Labor Department. The Midwest, by contrast,
reported a jobless level of 3.7 percent in July, the lowest of the
nation's four regions. The South's jobless rate was 4.3 percent
last month, while the West recorded a rate of 5.1 percent _ the
highest among the regions.
</P>
<P>
   Job gains in July were strong in nearly all sectors in
Massachusetts. The service sector, which added more than 44,000 new
jobs over the last year, led the way. Gains were reported in
business services, engineering, and management. Even the
manufacturing sector bucked a national downward trend and added
2,800 new jobs, bringing the total number of manufacturing jobs in
the state to 456,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also seeing gains in hotel building, office, and home
construction,'' said Sara Johnson, an economist with Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen such incredible growth that the only factors
holding back business growth right now are labor supply shortages
and the inability to find enough skilled workers,'' Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Kim Milosh, an associate economist at Fleet Financial
Group in Boston: ``The low unemployment rate is good for people who
are looking for jobs. But for companies that are looking to hire
people to fill those jobs, it's a difficult situation. With an
unemployment rate this low, there just aren't enough qualified
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1997 and July 1998, the number of people without
jobs dropped 23 percent, from 131,400 to 100,800, said Angelo
Buonopane, director of the Massachusetts Department of Labor and
Workforce Development. &UR;  &LR;

CISCO SYSTEMS BUYING AMERICAN INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   California technology titan Cisco Systems Inc. is expanding its
presence in Massachusetts with a $56 million stock deal to buy
American Internet Corp., a networking software company in Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, privately held AIC's 50 employees will remain in
Bedford under the leadership of the company's current president,
Bob Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Darby, manager of business development at Cisco in San
Jose, said the deal grew out of a previous contract with AIC to
provide software for Cisco, which makes devices that manage traffic
on the Internet. ``We had an existing partnership with these
guys,'' said Darby. ``The chemistry's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco already operates a major facility in Chelmsford, Mass.
where engineers design hardware for use by Internet service
providers. The software produced by AIC is intended to strengthen
Cisco's line of products for this market.
</P>
<P>
   AIC makes software that makes it easier to attach computers to
networks that use the standard Internet Protocol, or IP. This
protocol was developed to direct Internet data to its final
destination, but IP has also been adopted as a standard for many
corporate computer networks as well.
</P>
<P>
   One AIC product, called Network Registrar, allows users of
portable computers to plug into network connections anywhere inside
an organization. Network Registrar automatically assigns a IP
address to the computer so that it can send and receive messages.
The software is used at Boston College, where students with laptops
can plug into the campus network in a library or dining hall, and
gain instant access.
</P>
<P>
   Another AIC product, Access Registrar, is used by Internet
service providers like MediaOne Express. This product automatically
assigns IP addresses to users of cable modems or telephone modems.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan said that the AIC software had been tailored to manage
IP addresses much faster than existing products, resulting in
faster service for users. In addition, the software can assign
different levels of service quality for different users. Someone
connecting to the network in order to send e-mail could get a
standard level of service, while a user sending a videoconference
would automatically get high-priority service, and be billed at a
higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco will take a one-time after-tax charge of between 3 and 6
cents per share to pay for ongoing research and development at AIC.
In the year ended in July, Cisco earned $1.05 billion, or $1.01, a
share, on sales of $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, its stock closed at 102 3/4, up 1/8.

<P>
   A Natural Disaster's Human and Economic Toll &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flood waters broke through a dike near Daqing, China, last week,
inundating more than 1,800 of the northeast region's oil wells.
Across China, the floods, the worst in 60 years, have killed more
than 2,000 people, left millions homeless and caused $24 billion in
economic losses. The damage is expected to cut at least 0.5
percentage point off economic growth this year. &QL;

<P>
   RUSSIA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floating Like a Butterfly Or Sinking Like a Stone? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government moved hastily last week to avert
financial collapse with a series of drastic measures, including
delaying payments for 90 days on foreign debt owed mostly by banks,
a restructuring of government bonds and the sacrifice of the ruble
to market forces.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Russian currency is now free to float as low as
9.5 to the dollar, a risky step _ tantamount to devaluation _ that
many people fear could prompt a new round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It could also wipe out as much as a third of the ruble's
purchasing power in an economy heavily dependent on imports. The
decision came after a request for $22.6 billion from the West was
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's cut Russia's long-term foreign-currency debt
rating by two notches. For this beggar at a McDonald's in Moscow,
the collapsing ruble was not of immediate concern. &QL;

<P>
   The Pain Worsens &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The global economic crisis and the aftermath of United States
strikes on Afghanistan and the Sudan ravaged Wall Street stocks on
Friday. After rising strongly early last week, the Dow fell
slightly on Wednesday, more than 80 points on Thursday, and more
than 200 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a mini-panic here,'' said Michael Metz, a
managing director at CIBC Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. Many traders could do
little more than hold their heads and hope for the best. &QL;

   An iMac Moment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Apple Computer &UR;  &LR; climbed to near a three-year high
after the company's debut of its iMac personal computer. Apple said
it had advance orders for 150,000 of the new computers, which, the
company says, will get users onto the Internet very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer &UR;  &LR; is also flying high, reporting a 62 percent gain
in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, exceeding Wall Street
analysts' estimates. Dell also cited market research showing that
it had moved into the No. 1 position in the United States in
desktop computer sales, and the No. 2 position over all, behind
Compaq Computer. &QL;

<P>
   Honda's Global Dividend &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After years of taking grief from its Japanese rivals for its
overseas emphasis, Honda Motor &UR;  &LR; is now benefiting more than ever
from that globalization. Even with the domestic market shrinking
rapidly, Honda, Japan's No. 3 auto maker behind Toyota and Nissan,
reported a 26 percent profit gain for the latest quarter, largely
because of sales in Europe and in Honda's largest market, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other Japanese car makers did not have such a good week. Moody's
Investors Service cut its rating of Toyota Motor's &UR;  &LR; long-term debt,
citing concern that falling sales in Asia would eat into profits.
</P>
<P>
   The downgrading followed an earlier announcement by Moody's that
it had lowered the credit ratings of Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi
Motors. Still, Toyota's credit rating remains well above those of
General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This New House &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Housing construction jumped last month for the second straight
month _ its fastest pace in more than a decade. New housing units
were going up at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,718,000
units in July, the heaviest activity since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve did its part to help that boom by deciding
to leave short-term interest rates at 5.5 percent. Given that
United States consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2
percent in July after a 0.1 percent increase in June, the Fed's
action was not unexpected. ... The trade deficit narrowed slightly,
to $14.2 billion in June, but was still not far from the record
high as deficits with troubled Asian nations continued to soar. The
June deficit was off 8.9 percent from the record $15.5 billion in
May, marking the first decline since January. &QL;

   GLOBAL WARMING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Melting, It's Melting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alaska is thawing, and much of northern Russia and Canada with
it. And many scientists say the warming of these cold regions is
one of the most telling signals that the planet's climate is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have long said that in an era of global warming, this
bellwether region should warm more and faster than the Earth as a
whole, and that is just how things are turning out, to the
consternation of walruses and people alike.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 study, longer summers have allowed Alaska's
tourism industry to grow and should expand shipping in the region,
too. But the warmer weather is taking a heavy toll on forests, and
by extension, eventually the forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
   The warming has promoted a buildup of tree-eating insects in
general and has prompted some species, like the spruce budworm, to
move farther north.
</P>
<P>
   Across southern Alaska, some of the forest is more than sick; it
is dead or dying, and spruce bark beetles are the killers.
Scientists estimate that a third to half of Alaska's white spruce
have died the last 15 years. &QL;

<P>
   Downsizing With Less Gusto &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The country's most comprehensive survey of permanent layoffs
found that in the last three years, downsizing affected a smaller
percentage of the work force than in any other period this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the layoff rate is still significantly higher than in the
1980s, and women now get pink slips almost as often as men. Eight
million people were pushed out of their jobs involuntarily in the
1995-97 period, the Labor Department said in its report, or one out
of every 15 adult job holders.
</P>
<P>
   That was down from 8.4 million in the previous three years, or
one in 12 workers, the decade's worst performance. But downsizing
is still occurring at a faster rate than in the late 1980s. Then
the displacement rate was one out of every 18 job holders. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   SEMICONDUCTORS &QL;

<P>
   The Chips Are Down &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two computer chip makers said they expected sharply lower
quarterly results because of Asia's economic crisis, and a third
said its quarterly net earnings fell 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings from LSI Logic and National Semiconductor, coupled
with the results from Analog Devices, suggested that any talk of a
recovery in the chip manufacturing industry might be premature.
</P>
<P>
   Chip companies are finding that they are much more vulnerable to
Asia's problems than they had thought. ``When something like Asia
happens, it doesn't really matter how good your products are or how
well managed your company is, you're going to feel it,'' said Drew
Peck, an analyst at SG Cowen &AMP; Co. &QL;

   A mouse pad made of reindeer hide? Well, maybe that's a bad
example of a high-technology business with a big future. But Sweden
has a few other ideas up its reindeer coat-covered sleeve,
including extreme telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the flight of people from what is already
one of the world's most sparsely settled areas, the government is
encouraging businesses to set up computerized telephone-call
centers in remote Arctic Circle villages _ such as Arvidsjaur,
where Sara Andersson, is director of trade _ and to staff them with
young people who otherwise would be scouting for work in the
population centers to the south, or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The companies benefit from special government subsidies, and
they find that outlying parts of Sweden have a supply of educated,
keyboard-literate young people with the Swedes' noted ability to
function comfortably in several languages.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes and telephones have a cozy relationship: The country has
the highest number of lines per person in the world _ 70 for every
100 inhabitants _ and 44 percent of Swedes have mobile phones.

   FORGOTTEN COWBOYS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REFUGIO, Texas _ The image of the Texas cowboy has been deeply
stamped in our minds: tall, weathered, rugged, Marlboroesque _ and
white. That image is dishonest. ``John Wayne wouldn't be nothing
beside of us,'' Nathaniel Youngblood, a black cowboy from the Texas
coastal plains, was fond of saying. ``They just didn't take our
picture. John Wayne and Tim Holt, Durango Kid, and that other one _
Gene Autry, oh, no. They ain't nothing.'' Along the coastal bend of
Texas, nearly a third of the cowboys pushing cattle up the Texas
trails in the 1840s were black. Roughly another third were
Hispanic. They never enjoyed a place in the prevailing cowboy myth
_ these weren't flashy rodeo cowboys, or the silver-saddled cowboys
of the movies _ but they helped forge ranching empires along the
coastal plains. By ART CHAPMAN. Story has moved in ``a'' general

<P>
   Out along the North Shore of Long Island, in a land popularly
associated with lockjaw, ``Sabrina'' and Wall Street wealth
predating the crash _ the one in 1929 _ the wrong pair of shoes
gives you away.
</P>
<P>
   At the Piping Rock Club one night this summer, two men in khakis
and blue blazers crossed the wooden deck above the beach with their
30-something dates. Both women had on pretty cotton sundresses and
wore their blond hair in just-so bobs. Yet, the heels of their
patent-leather sandals were suspiciously thin.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-year-old club member, who was sipping a southside cocktail
with a friend, looked them over and whispered, ``They are not from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   This world of subtle uniforms and unspoken codes is called
Locust Valley, a slice of Gatsbyesque, upper-class living, which
seems preserved in aspic.
</P>
<P>
   Just 30 miles from Manhattan, it is a land of French manor
houses, private dirt roads and small shops selling monogrammed
wastebaskets. The respect for life's little niceties would bring a
smile to Emily Post. Strangers wave from cars, everyone says
``please'' and ``thank you,'' and friends exchange exaggeratedly
warm greetings at the country club, even though they had lunch
together just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, darlins,'' said Jeff Lincoln, 38, a Manhattanite
walking from a game of golf, as he greeted two friends, Olexa
Farrell and Leah Ramirez. ``I'm looking at the prettiest women
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The young women blushed. They asked Lincoln, an interior
designer who was formerly a Wall Street Journal reporter, about the
rumor that his picture, clipped from W magazine, was going to be
posted on Elizabeth Shue's bulletin board in a new movie. It was
Lincoln's turn to blush. ``I am going to be Elizabeth's love
interest,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The women giggled and moved on to lunch, joining two others
beneath a navy umbrella. They wore headbands and white cotton
dresses appropriate for the club's grass tennis courts, and ate
quartered egg-salad sandwiches. The conversation moved from cedar
shingling to Stubbs &AMP; Wooten slippers to what time everyone would
meet for dinner at the club that night.
</P>
<P>
   A scene from the 1920s, when Wall Street fortunes made by
families named Phipps and Morgan built Georgian piles, and Locust
Valley first rose to prominence? It could have been. But these days
the heart of the famous Gold Coast is not just a relic of a former
age.
</P>
<P>
   It has been rediscovered by a wave of young Manhattanites in
their 20s and 30s who are choosing Locust Valley as a weekend and
summer retreat over the Hamptons, where too many barbarians, as
they see it, have been let in the gates.
</P>
<P>
   What they've discovered is a Ralph Laurenlike world, little
touched by postwar suburbanization, which is both less expensive
and less socially formidable than the old-guard clubs and
neighborhoods of Southampton; Greenwich, Conn., and Bedford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people our age that have begun to find
Locust Valley,'' said Ms. Farrell, 31, who is married to Bowen
Farrell, 38, the managing director of Triton Capital, a leveraged
buyout company.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of their friends, they live in Manhattan and drive to
Locust Valley for weekends packed with golf, horseback riding and
dinners at a half-dozen private clubs, including Piping Rock, the
Creek Club and Seawanhaka Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Anderson, a senior vice president of Sotheby's International
Reality, who has sold luxury properties in the New York area for
two decades, said, ``Right now, Locust Valley is at the top of the
list for young people looking for a country house.'' It outranks
Greenwich, Bedford, Southampton and Far Hills, N.J., he said.
``When people ask for Locust Valley, you know they know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are not celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, the
news media and professional sports. Just as the North Shore was
built by discreet Wall Street bankers from the turn of the century
through the '20s, it is being revived by the latest wave of bull
market winners, self-effacing in the 1990s way.
</P>
<P>
   Flashiness of all sorts is frowned upon, and clubs like Piping
Rock, perhaps the most sought-after in the area, turn away people
with profiles that are a little too high. Deborah Norville, a
former NBC television anchor who is a member, goes by her married
name, Deborah Wellner.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, Locust Valley is the name only for an
unincorporated village, the site of a Long Island Rail Road
station, firehouse, library and a few shops. But Locust Valley is
also a state of mind, the name used by area residents to include
the villages of Lattingtown, Matinecock, Mill Neck, Upper
Brookville, Old Brookville and the estate section of Glen Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Boundaries matter in this enclave, where some refer to the
densely populated towns just beyond as ``Buttafuoco territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although life in Locust Valley seems lavish, it can be quite
affordable. Many young couples and single people rent two or
three-bedroom cottages or gate houses for $1,500 to $2,000 a month,
compared with $5,000 and up per month for a summer rental of
similar size in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of this year, 450 houses sold in the
Locust Valley area at an average price of nearly $700,000 for a
four-bedroom house, on about two acres with a swimming pool, said
Bonnie Devendorf, a vice president and manager of Daniel Gale
Associates in Locust Valley. A comparable home in Greenwich on
one-third of an acre lists for about $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   One affordable way to summer in the area is open to junior
members of the Piping Rock Club, ages 21 to 35, who for about $50 a
night can stay in rooms at the club reminiscent of prep school
dormitories. There are rooms for couples, and others for those the
club refers to as ``bachelors'' and ``bachelorettes,'' furnished
with chintz-covered armchairs and white bedspreads on twin beds.
</P>
<P>
   Piping Rock, a club begun by wealthy sportsmen in the early
1900s, was once famous for polo and equestrian sports, but those
programs ended in the '60s. As the membership aged _ today
60-something men in straw hats wrapped with plaid bandanas drive
golf carts past 60-something women in hot-pink skirts _ the club
sought out new blood through its junior program. With just a single
sponsor's letter from a member (full admission requires multiple
letters), and for a fee of about $1,000, young people can try out
the club while simultaneously being sized up themselves. The junior
program has never been so popular, members say, with about 90
participants in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These younger members say that the emphasis on juniors makes
Piping Rock more accessible than similar country clubs in the
Hamptons and elsewhere. At Greenwich's Round Hill Country Club, for
example, new members must wait five years for full golf privileges.
``God, I would be 50 before I ever tee off out there,'' said a
Piping Rock member in his 30s, citing a prime reason he rents a
room at the club rather than moving to Greenwich, where he has
family and social connections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who described country clubs in Locust Valley,
which form the core of social life, spoke on condition of
anonymity, because of the old guard's longstanding, unwritten
prohibitions on discussing personal issues in the press. ``They
still believe the only time to be mentioned in the paper is when
you get married and when you die,'' said a 36-year-old newcomer to
Locust Valley, who used parental connections to get into Piping
Rock. ``We don't want to hurt them in any way. And we don't want to
jeopardize our position.''
</P>
<P>
   The socialite C.Z. Guest, who has lived in Old Westbury most of
her life, put it this way: ``It's a different class of people out
here than in the Hamptons. Out there they need publicity to exist.
Here you know who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident noted the emphasis on politesse and good
manners, what etiquette writers used to call ``breeding.'' ``You're
going to get further being thoughtful to people than being tough
with them,'' she said. ``It's the opposite of the whole New York
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Boardman, a decorator in Manhattan whose family has had
a Locust Valley home for generations, said, ``In a funny way, it's
been preserved out here.'' She said she was surprised at the number
of young people, many of them single, discovering the area. In some
cases, grandparents once lived in Locust Valley, parents moved away
and now grandchildren are coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am utterly amazed by the enormous groups of people in their
mid-20s and mid-30s coming out here,'' Ms. Boardman said. That
includes her two daughters, Serena, 28, who works at Sotheby's, and
Samantha, 26, a medical-school student. Both stay at their mother's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Many attribute the rediscovery of Locust Valley to a
disillusionment with the excesses of the Hamptons. ``This is our
antidote to the Hamptons,'' Lincoln, the interior designer, said.
Many young Locust Valley residents like to drop in on the Hamptons
for a society party like a recent benefit for Southampton Hospital.
But invariably, they drive the 100 miles back home for the night.
``You don't get stuck out there, God forbid,'' a Locust Valley
woman in her 20s said.
</P>
<P>
   The flirtation with the Hamptons might seem paradoxical _ except
when one considers that it is the old-line, exclusionary Hamptons
embodied by the Meadow Club or the Bathing Corporation, both in
Southampton, that many Locust Valley young people see as a social
pinnacle, although one that is all but insurmountable by newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are not to the manner born, which includes many of
Locust Valley's new wave, the old money look can be acquired by
hiring the right decorator or visiting the right haberdasher. Thus
is the community socially accessible to members of ethnic groups
that were never welcome in the area's earlier heyday as a WASP
enclave. Piping Rock has a number of Jewish and Asian members, more
than tokens, several members said.
</P>
<P>
   Locust Valley's most popular decorator is Tom Samet, who gives
newcomers' homes an instant old money look with chintz, toile de
jouy, early American and English furniture and knickknacks from
consignment shops that look like they've been in the family for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sells out there is anything that looks old,'' said Marcos
Delgado, who ran a design store in Locust Valley until last year.
His most popular items included tin sconces, Windsor chairs,
painted American furniture and old lanterns for walkways.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three years ago, F. Scott Fitzgerald described a piece
of the North Shore that was the setting for ``The Great Gatsby'' as
``the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Charles Scribner III, a great-grandson of
Fitzgerald's publisher, acquired a summer house in Locust Valley,
which in popular imagination has become identified with Gatsby's
East Egg.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, 47, plainly admits that the draw of the place is the
fantasy of moving into the pages of the classic novel about the
self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby, who in his quest to recapture
his lost love, Daisy Buchanan, throws extravagant parties populated
by social swells. The drive to the Scribner house, a modified Cape
of white shingles and white-washed brick, passes a line of Oriental
cherry trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Nick Carraway's cottage,'' Scribner said wryly,
ushering in a guest. The reference, of course, was to the narrator
of ``The Great Gatsby,'' who observed the action from a modest home
adjacent to Gatsby's.
</P>
<P>
   The Scribner ``cottage'' is unassuming but exquisitely tasteful,
with mahogany furniture, English chintz and paintings by Scribner's
wife, Ritchie. It seems out of an earlier, less-frantic era, with
its black-and-white televisions and rotary-dial telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The Scribners invited their guest to sit by a marble-dusted pool
and sip iced tea with orange juice and fresh mint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out here we're left our privacy and quiet,'' Scribner said.
``Locust Valley is so blissfully quiet that the only noisy thing
you hear is the rushing of air when you open a new can of tennis
balls.''

UTILITY STOCKS REMAIN A SAFETY NET IN TURBULENT TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Utility stocks, a traditional shelter for investors in times of
market upheaval, have run true to form this summer, despite utility
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   While the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is down 8.9 percent
from its high on July 17, the S&AMP;P utility index has fallen only 1.8
percent. One big reason is that utilities offer a relative safety
net in dividends. Payouts average 4.8 percent for these stocks,
more than three times the typical 1.5 percent dividend of the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that utility stocks are relatively cheap now,
having been hammered over the last five years for lackluster
earnings growth and concern over deregulation. Their average
price-to-earnings ratio is 30 percent below that of the S&AMP;P 500, so
investors reason that they have less downside potential than the
high-fliers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to good defensive characteristics, other factors
strengthen the case for utilities, several money managers said.
Mario Gabelli, chairman and chief investment officer of Gabelli
Funds, who has been buying electric and gas utility stocks lately,
said the drive by state regulators to unbundle the generation side
of the business from the transmission and distribution side, which
would stay regulated, was creating ``very powerful dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite stocks is Eastern Enterprises, which he
expects to ``either consolidate or be consolidated.'' He has also
been nibbling at electric utilities north of New York City, looking
to potential takeover targets like Central Hudson Gas and Electric,
based in Poughkeepsie, and New York State Electric and Gas, of
Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Another money manager who has played the consolidation theme _
including a position in Central Hudson _ is Sheldon Simon,
co-manager of the Putnam Fund for Growth and Income. Until June he
was senior portfolio manager at Putnam Utilities Growth and Income.
His other picks include Connecticut Energy and Yankee Energy, which
both provide gas in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A more conservative way to play the industry's consolidation is
to invest in companies that have already announced mergers. Phillip
Davidson, portfolio manager of the American Century Value and
American Century Equity Income funds, bought both Sierra Pacific
Resources and Nevada Power this spring after the companies
announced that they were merging.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two good companies getting better, selling at a
discount to the industry,'' he said, adding that the merger should
eliminate the discount.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction is when regulatory issues have been resolved
more favorably than analysts expected, specifically for what is
known as ``stranded costs'' _ how much companies can collect from
rate payers for plants that generate power at above-market costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Simon bought Peco Energy and PP&AMP;L Resources, which
are resolving these issues. Simon expects Peco, which adopted a
plan in May, to trade up to $38 a share within the next 18 months;
PP&AMP;L should trade ``north of $30 a share'' in that period, he said.
They now trade at $31.875 and $24.4375, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk Power in New York should also benefit from
resolving the stranded-costs issue. In June it adopted a
restructuring agreement that allows it to terminate or amend 27
high-cost power contracts. ``This company has gone through a
gut-wrenching reorganization,'' said Richard Howard, manager of T.
Rowe Price Capital Appreciation. He sees ``lots of upside'' in the
stock, which is selling at $15.1875, just above book value, and
figures it should be worth $22.50 within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular stock pick is Duke Energy, which is committed to
increasing its earnings at an annual rate of 8 percent to 10
percent over the next three to five years. ``It is my favorite
among the big, liquid names,'' Simon said. ``They probably have the
best management in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seeking defensive issues should stick to big, liquid
stocks _ that's what institutional investors do when they're
looking for a ``parking place'' for money, said Steven Fleishman,
electric utility analyst at Merrill Lynch. His picks include Duke
Energy, Texas Utilities and Consolidated Edison.
</P>
<P>
   The hazards for utility stocks include interest-rate risk,
normal market risk and, this year, a slowing of merger activity,
which Fleishman expects to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the risk involved in trading electricity or having
to buy high-priced power on the new open market. That was
highlighted in June when utility prices spiked during a heat wave
in the Midwest. Pacificorp, First Energy and other companies took
hits to their second-quarter earnings as a result. But there were
also winners _ companies that sold power into the market _
including Peco and Duke. ``It supports the view that to be a
long-term winner, you have to be big,'' Fleishman said.

TRIMMING STOCK POSITIONS: INVESTING WITH C. BETH COTNER 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When to sell is an anxiously asked question in a jittery stock
market. C. Beth Cotner offers some answers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cotner, lead manager of the Putnam Investors fund, imposes a
``trim discipline'' for fast-growing stocks: If a holding goes up
10 percent or at more than twice the market rate within 10 days,
she trims her position by 10 percent, thus locking in some profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when stocks go up quickly it's because there's
very positive news or positive developments that investors get
euphoric about,'' she said, ``and then later on, the euphoria wears
off or something happens so the stock comes back down again.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, she buys back trimmed shares after the price has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices have helped make Putnam Investors a strong
performer during her tenure. The fund _ categorized as a
large-capitalization growth fund _ returned 18.59 percent for the
12 months ended Thursday, surpassing the 16.79 percent average of
its peer group, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial
publisher in Chicago. And the fund has narrowly outperformed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index over the last three years and
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Started in December 1925, Putnam Investors is one of the three
oldest open-end funds in the country. It has assets of $4.5
billion. Ms. Cotner, 45, has been lead manager since the end of
September 1995; she previously managed mutual funds at Kemper
Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's management team uses quantitative screening with a
point system to find attractive stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A computer model developed by Putnam Investments, based in
Boston, scores companies on a 1-to-5 scale in each of five
categories: potential earnings surprises, earnings revisions,
cash-flow reinvestment, dividend yield and sales-to-price
valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the category scores gives a company a composite score
of 1 to 5, and a stock with a 1 or a 2 merits further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've back-tested our model, 1's and 2's have
consistently outperformed the market,'' while 5's have
underperformed, Ms. Cotner said.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes fundamental research _ visiting the companies, their
suppliers and their competitors, then putting together extensive
five-year earnings and cash-flow models.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cotner said she discussed all buying decisions with the
fund's co-managers, Richard England and Manuel Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a controversial issue, we try to assign someone to
be the devil's advocate,'' Ms. Cotner said. No miracles are
required for a stock to make the portfolio, she added, but ``we try
to reach the right decision, not just one that seems to be easy to
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a stock is in the portfolio, the three managers continually
review its financial and management fundamentals. If there is a
basic problem, or a company is likely to miss earnings targets, Ms.
Cotner said, ``we'll eliminate the whole position.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, when a company is doing well and its share price is growing,
``we'll trim the stock, if it just gets to be too large as a
percentage of the overall portfolio,'' she said. The co-managers
rebalance the portfolio each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``we would trim back something like Microsoft to 3
percent,'' Ms. Cotner said. ``If we just let it ride all the time
and it never hit the trim discipline, it might just gradually over
time grow to be 10 percent of the portfolio, and that's too big.''
</P>
<P>
   Using their quantitative scoring program, the co-managers
rescreen the portfolio's stocks daily, immediately looking into any
that have fallen to a 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it remains a 4 more than a week or two, it triggers a sell
decision on our part, and by the time it gets to a 5, it's gone
from the portfolio,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Growth stocks tend to do better than value stocks under current
economic conditions, with a slowing economy and stable interest
rates, Ms. Cotner said, but she acknowledged that because of its
growth bias, Putnam Investors tends to be slightly more volatile
than the benchmark S&AMP;P 500 and could underperform in a down
market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finding stocks that would weather a bear market is not easy, she
said. The best bets might include drug chains and grocery chains,
``areas that are relatively immune'' from economic or political
events, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among these groups, Putnam Investors has stakes in Safeway Inc.,
Walgreen Co. and CVS Corp.
</P>
<P>
   CVS, the nation's No. 2 pharmacy chain, after Walgreen, has been
expanding rapidly through acquisitions and now has more than 4,000
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 it merged with Revco, which had more than 2,500 stores,
and this year it bought Arbor, a Michigan chain with more than 200
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a lot of their sales through filling prescription
drugs,'' Ms. Cotner said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the aging population and recent approvals of new drugs
like Viagra, ``prescription drugs are growing very rapidly,'' she
said, adding that ``drugs are taken no matter whether the economy
is strong or weak.''
</P>
<P>
   CVS is also good at merchandising in the other parts of its
stores, she said, adding, ``They have been able to go into the
newly acquired stores and ramp up their product offerings in what's
called the front end of the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cotner predicted that CVS earnings would grow 18 percent
this year and again next year. Putnam Investors bought the stock,
which is now trading at $44.25, at $22 more than two years ago. She
expects the stock to reach $57 in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Another retailer that Ms. Cotner likes is Wal-Mart Stores. It
has been improving its systems by allowing stores to cut prices to
meet local competition and to manage in-store inventories more
efficiently. Putnam Investors started buying Wal-Mart stock in
spring 1997 at about $28 a share, and it continued to buy over the
last year, for an average cost of about $40, Ms. Cotner said. The
stock ended last week at $65.
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, the price could be $75, she estimated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 holding in Ms. Cotner's fund is Tyco International, a
holding company with a market capitalization of about $35 billion
and subsidiaries that offer disposable medical and specialty
products, fire and security services, flow-control supplies and
equipment, electrical and electronic components and underwater
telecommunications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco announced in May that it was buying U.S. Surgical Corp., a
medical products company, in a $3.3 billion stock trade. That and
other acquisitions, Ms. Cotner said, are expected to raise
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, their strategy is to buy the company,'' she said.
``They cut costs quickly in the first year, and then they build the
businesses in the second, third and fourth years so that not only
do they get cost-cuttings, but they get growth out of these
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyco is expected to produce earn $2 a share for the fiscal year
ending in September, up about 40 percent, and for the next year of
$2.65, up about 33 percent, Ms. Cotner said.
</P>
<P>
   Her fund bought Tyco early last year ``at around 30,'' she said.
In Putnam's last SEC filing in January, Tyco accounted for 2.1
percent of assets. A spokesman said the fund had since built up the
position, but declined to say how much. Tyco is now trading at $59,
and Ms. Cotner predicted that it would reach about $80 in 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Such predictions, of course, are based on the assumption that a
particular stock's gains will not be wiped out by the treacherous
currents of a volatile stock market. But the thought does cross Ms.
Cotner's mind.
</P>
<P>
   She spent her childhood in Crescent City, a usually tranquil
spot on the coast of Northern California, where a tidal wave struck
in 1961. ``A lot of houses there got wiped out _ a lot of
casualties,'' she said. ``Maybe you can tie that in to the tidal
wave of today's market.''

A RARE STAR TURN FOR THE BOND MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic on total returns for bonds vs. other indexes is

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With bonds selling at historic highs, many investors are
wondering whether there are more good plays to make or whether a
peak has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, bond investors have had good returns of late. Over
the past 12 months, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond has
generated a total return _ capital appreciation plus interest _ of
15.4 percent, far better than the performance of any of the major
stock indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, is up
9.98 percent for that period _ and is now down 8.6 percent from its
historic high on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   As inflation has stayed low, prices of long-term bonds have
risen and the bonds' yields, which move in the opposite direction,
have fallen to 30-year lows; interest rates on the 30-year Treasury
bond have slipped to 5.43 percent from a 12-month high of 6.66
percent last August.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, the booming stock market has received
an ever-expanding slice of the average investor's portfolio while
the slivers for bonds and cash have shrunk. According to data
compiled by the Federal Reserve, the share of household financial
assets composed of equities rose 12.6 percent between 1994 and
1997, to a total of 47.3 percent. Fixed-income assets like bonds
declined 7 percent, to 20.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of recent turmoil in stock prices, some investors
want to decrease their allocation to equities.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, one analyst says, they will still find a good
alternative in the bond market. ``Bonds continue to have very
favorable fundamentals,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment
strategist for Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``In fact, when you account for
inflation and taxes, bond yields are more attractive now than in
1981.''
</P>
<P>
   During that year, inflation was 10.3 percent, the yield on the
long-term government bond was 13.5 percent and the top tax bracket
was 70 percent. This combination of inflation and taxes meant that
the real after-tax yield was a negative 6.25 percent, Battipaglia
said. In contrast, the real yield after taxes is now 1.63 percent,
based on a 1.7 percent inflation rate and a much lower top tax
bracket of 39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Battipaglia predicted that the favorable climate for bonds would
continue, thanks to ``the absence of inflation in the economy and a
gradual decline in the supply of bonds,'' as the government's
budget moves from deficit to surplus. Although the last 20 years
have been marked by rate volatility, ``from a historical
perspective, this new low-rate scenario actually typifies the
normal level of interest rates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Battipaglia suggests Treasuries and investment-grade corporate
issues for tax-deferred retirement accounts, and municipal bonds
for most taxable accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the municipal arena, Battipaglia favors some bonds currently
trading above their face values. ``While the premium is sacrificed
over the life of the bond, the higher coupon payments provide an
enhanced cash flow to investors,'' he said. He likes the 5.75
percent New York City general obligation bonds that are due to
mature Aug. 1, 2013. They are trading at 106\ _ $106.25 for every
$100 of face value _ having moved up in price as yields have
fallen. There is one caveat: the city could elect to call them
before maturity, once in 2007, when it would pay holders $101 per
$100 of face value, or it could call them in 2009 and pay par. The
yield to maturity is 5.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Battipaglia also sees favorable investment opportunities in
corporate bonds. He favors Lehman Brothers' 7| percent bonds due
June 1, 2006, priced at 107] to yield 6.40 percent. The bonds, with
no call provision, are investment grade.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the zero-coupon bond of Revlon Worldwide that is
due March 15, 2001. Typically, zero-coupon bonds pay no monthly
interest and are sold at a discount to face value. The Revlon issue
has a current price of 77} to yield about 10.09 percent at
maturity. It is callable as of March 15, 2000, at a price of 92.479
and rises to 101.81 on the due date of Feb. 15, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Battipaglia likes convertible securities when a stock price has
collapsed. Known in Wall Street parlance as ``broken converts,''
these securities trade below par value. He cited Sunglass Hut
International, which is in a turnaround situation and has had a
sharp increase in revenues. However, the stock price, which was at
$13 on June 10, has lagged, closing Friday at $7.625.
</P>
<P>
   Because he expects the stock to catch up, Battipaglia likes
Sunglass Hut's 5.25 percent convertible bonds due June 15, 2003,
which are priced at $80.25 to yield 10.59 percent at maturity and
are likely to gain with the stock.

GOLD: A HEDGE THAT'S WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN HISTORY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ERIC HUBLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bit over four years ago, an aging German Jew who has seen a
lot of trouble gave his niece a wedding gift of three gold coins,
along with this admonition: ``May you never have to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope not. Those coins, slumbering in a bank vault, have
declined 26 percent in dollar terms. Blue-chip stocks, meanwhile,
and, some real estate have more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of hedge is that _ a hedge against getting rich? Is
gold, the traditional talisman against everything from tyrants to
inflation to stock market plunges, losing out?
</P>
<P>
   No, says Douglas M. Cohen, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter _ but you could be forgiven for thinking so. ``History is
full of episodes where people have said gold is dead, and sure
enough, it's tended to rally back very strongly,'' he said. ``Gold
has thousands of years of history on its side.''
</P>
<P>
   What's scary now is that, at about $289 an ounce, gold is not
far from its production cost of $250 to $260 an ounce, though it is
up from January's 18-year low of $278.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, gold has quite a roll call of negatives. Start with
currencies: Because gold is denominated in American dollars, which
are currently strong, it is less affordable than it once was in
traditionally gold-hungry markets like India.
</P>
<P>
   But even with demand down, production has been rising in
Australia, Canada and South Africa, and there are fears of more
gold coming to market, perhaps from the Russian central bank or the
International Monetary Fund seeking to raise cash during Russia's
fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What is bad for gold has been even worse for gold shares. Gold
has fallen less than 2 percent in 1998, but Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago mutual fund publisher, says the average precious-metals
fund fell 21.8 percent this year through last Monday and 43.5
percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Bingham, who manages two gold funds for Van Eck, says
gold is as important as ever. ``Gold is the only money,'' he said.
``You might say silver is money, but that's only pocket change. And
everything else we call money is really a credit instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 market crash, when stocks declined 90 percent,
gold rose 70 percent, and the shares of gold producers like
Homestake Mining catapulted 700 to 800 percent. Talk about a
diversifier: ``Ten percent in that would have salvaged the whole
portfolio,'' Bingham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some paper money just evaporate'' today, he said,
citing the Indonesian rupiah and the South Korean won. ``So I think
we're probably fairly close to a turning point in the perception of
the value of gold versus paper money.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel B. Leonard, manager of the Invesco Strategic Gold
Portfolio fund, said: ``If you were in the yen and bought gold a
couple of years ago, you're looking pretty good now.'' The same
goes, he says, for people who have to put food on the table with
rubles or yuan or Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, gold investors typically buy shares in
either gold mutual funds or mining companies, rather than the metal
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Martin, manager of the American Century Global Gold fund,
favors Barrick Resources, which has reduced costs to $150 an ounce
at a new mine in Peru and has sold its production forward for $400
an ounce for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Larkin, a metals analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, mentions
Newmont Mining, Placer Dome and Barrick as low-cost producers.
</P>
<P>
   The woman with the wise uncle, meanwhile, reports that those
three nuptial coins are staying right where they are.

 &HT;    U.S. HEIGHTENS SECURITY FOLLOWING AIR STRIKES, FEARING TERRORISM
AT HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The morning after surprise U.S. military air
strikes against terrorist operations in Sudan and Afghanistan, many
Americans woke to their own ``terrorist warnings'' about their
daily train ride to work or their weekend sightseeing destinations.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, in airports, train stations and even
popular tourist attractions, security was heightened on Friday by
officials fearing a possible -- no matter how remote -- terrorist
retaliation for the U.S. air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the nation's capitol, the local transit authority
increased police patrols throughout the busy regional rail system
and said it is taking ``a number of other measures'' to ensure the
safety of its passengers.
</P>
<P>
   During train rides, thousands of riders heard announcements
urging them to adhere to safety precautions such as using emergency
intercoms on the trains and at the stations to report anything
``unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reminding passengers who see any suspicious persons,
packages or activities to contact Metro personnel immediately,''
said Metro System Police Chief Barry McDevitt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, however, most passengers didn't seem
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same-old, same-old,'' said Linda Hicks, a native
Washingtonian. ``I don't really feel any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, 42, said she knows the government will protect her
because terrorists have never attacked D.C. in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known any building to be blown up in D.C.,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Metro System police and other personnel, who were advised to be
extra vigilant in light of the international developments, also
said Friday was business-as-usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very calm. They haven't asked any questions,'' said
officer Tito Aguilar.
</P>
<P>
   The safety precautions are a reaction to Thursday's surprise
attacks in which U.S. cruise missiles destroyed a suspected
chemical weapons factory in Sudan, and hit a terrorist training
camp in a remote, hilly region of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Many military experts say a swift retaliatory strike against the
U.S. is unlikely, especially within U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, at Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty and all
other federal park sites in New York City, security was increased
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At Ellis Island, Lt. Don Roofener said tourists Friday were not
asking about security. ``They don't seem to be afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, the police department went on a
heightened-alert status, just moments after President Clinton
announced the bombings. Police Commissioner Howard Safir referred
to it as ``Condition Bravo,'' which entails beefed up patrols at
consulates, religious institutions and other sensitive locations.
</P>
<P>
   While Federal Aviation Administration said Friday's ``heightened
state of emergency'' has become standard procedure over the past
three years, many of the nation's largest airports stepped up
security noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, at Los Angeles International Airport,
security was increased and police said they would monitor the local
situation for any potential problems. Airport officials also
advised passengers to expect some delays due to closer screening of
baggage and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, bomb-sniffing dogs
and police officers were on increased patrols. Airport security
officials at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport warned
passengers to arrive early for their flights and not to leave their
cars unattended or they would be towed.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. Park Police ``increased patrols and
heightened security'' at all national monuments including the
Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson memorials and the national Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very political area and we have to react to what's
happening,'' said U.S. Park Police Capt. Valerie Fernandes.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Fernandes recalls this type of heightened security
was during Operation: Desert Storm. She said the precautions are
not an indication that a strike is expected but that ``it's better
to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington monument Friday, tourists packed the souvenir
stand and waited in line to see the marble structure like any other
day. On a wooden and wire gate, a paper sign warned visitors that
all packages will be searched prior to entering.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Eastman, 35, from Elmo, Utah, said the extra security
checks at many tourist sites were not alarming but were a bit of a
nuisance. In particular, he wondered why there had to be a package
check at the National Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want to blow up the fishes?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes said the stepped-up security in Washington at the
national monuments and the Mall will continue indefinitely,
depending on what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we'll wait and see,'' she said.

WHEN IT COMES TO CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS, BUYER BEWARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who hasn't heard the stories?
</P>
<P>
   Punch-drunk prize fighters, their championship belts
long-pawned, shuffling and greeting the swells at Vegas casinos,
trading faded fame for a pocketful of recognition and a handful of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   One-time millionaire ballplayers, their riches spent on
God-knows-what excesses, trolling the bushes for minimum-wage
coaching gigs.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name jocks, forced into court to find out what happened to
all that money they made _ and what happened to the financial
manager who ``invested'' it all for them.
</P>
<P>
   The personal finances of famous athletes do not always make for
pleasant memories.
</P>
<P>
   So I wonder: Would you entrust your life savings or your home to
a ballplayer?
</P>
<P>
   Thought not.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes all the more interesting this trend of using
athletes, mainly retired stars, as celebrity pitchmen on TV
commercials for consumer loan companies.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Among others, there's Terry Bradshaw for The
Associates (''We make loans that make life better.'') Dan Marino
for FirstPlus Financial. Phil Rizzuto for The Money Store and
George Foreman for Beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon it'll be Mike Tyson for Loan-and-Groan.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is not a challenge to the investment acumen of
Messrs. Bradshaw and Marino, et al. For all I know, their financial
smarts outstrip Michael Milken's. But that's between them and the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   What I wanted to know is why a person would listen to an old
jock when it comes to money matters, especially when those matters
might involve hocking your house and taking on double-digit
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   So I asked someone who should know. Doug Shabelman is vice
president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago firm that
links athletes with advertisers for endorsement deals.
</P>
<P>
   Burns put Foreman and Beneficial together.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are looking for someone who's trustworthy, and
these people are,'' Shabelman explained. ``Plus, these guys,
especially the quarterbacks, are seen as field generals _ it's a
leadership issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people aren't a big risk,'' Shabelman said. ``They've
been around a long time, and they have a following.''
</P>
<P>
   Their followings, he added, continue to expand thanks to their
sports media careers. Bradshaw, for example, gets heavy weekly
exposure as a football commentator on network TV. Former New York
Yankee Rizzuto has broadcast major-league baseball. Foreman and
Marino are still competing. Plus, they've received additional
celebrity through other commercials and even through movies.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Associates said Bradshaw ``epitomizes hard
work, honesty and integrity, which are the very attributes we hope
our customers see in us.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bradshaw is good for Associates' image. But are all consumer
loan companies good for the athlete's image?
</P>
<P>
   In its July issue, in an article headlined, ``Poverty Inc.,''
``Consumer Reports'' magazine tackles lending companies, saying
some poor or unsuspecting borrowers can wind up losing a home
because they can't afford to pay back ill-advised loans.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine talked with a publicist for Bradshaw and a
spokesman for Marino. Bradshaw's publicist said the Fox broadcaster
only recently learned of questions over industry lending practices.
Marino's spokesman defended FirstPlus, although not the entire
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chance-taking is part of any celebrity product endorsement, and
both sides share some risk. Kmart suffers when Fuzzy Zoeller
speculates on Tiger Woods' dining habits. Michael Jordan suffers
when Nike is criticized for treatment of its overseas factory
workers.
</P>
<P>
   What seems like a good partnership in a strict
business-marketing sense, doesn't always hold up under the scrutiny
of social activism.
</P>
<P>
   Like they say: Buyer beware.
</P>

Washingtonian. ``I don't really feel any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, 42, said she knows the government will protect her
because terrorists have never attacked D.C. in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known any building to be blown up in D.C.,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Metro System police and other personnel, who were advised to be
extra vigilant in light of the international developments, also
said Friday was business-as-usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very calm. They haven't asked any questions,'' said
officer Tito Aguilar.
</P>
<P>
   The safety precautions are a reaction to Thursday's surprise
attacks in which U.S. cruise missiles destroyed a suspected
chemical weapons factory in Sudan, and hit a terrorist training
camp in a remote, hilly region of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Many military experts say a swift retaliatory strike against the
U.S. is unlikely, especially within U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, at Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty and all
other federal park sites in New York City, security was increased
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At Ellis Island, Lt. Don Roofener said tourists Friday were not
asking about security. ``They don't seem to be afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, the police department went on a
heightened-alert status, just moments after President Clinton
announced the bombings. Police Commissioner Howard Safir referred
to it as ``Condition Bravo,'' which entails beefed up patrols at
consulates, religious institutions and other sensitive locations.
</P>
<P>
   While Federal Aviation Administration said Friday's ``heightened
state of emergency'' has become standard procedure over the past
three years, many of the nation's largest airports stepped up
security noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, at Los Angeles International Airport,
security was increased and police said they would monitor the local
situation for any potential problems. Airport officials also
advised passengers to expect some delays due to closer screening of
baggage and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, bomb-sniffing dogs
and police officers were on increased patrols. Airport security
officials at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport warned
passengers to arrive early for their flights and not to leave their
cars unattended or they would be towed.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. Park Police ``increased patrols and
heightened security'' at all national monuments including the
Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson memorials and the national Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very political area and we have to react to what's
happening,'' said U.S. Park Police Capt. Valerie Fernandes.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Fernandes recalls this type of heightened security
was during Operation: Desert Storm. She said the precautions are
not an indication that a strike is expected but that ``it's better
to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington monument Friday, tourists packed the souvenir
stand and waited in line to see the marble structure like any other
day. On a wooden and wire gate, a paper sign warned visitors that
all packages will be searched prior to entering.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Eastman, 35, from Elmo, Utah, said the extra security
checks at many tourist sites were not alarming but were a bit of a
nuisance. In particular, he wondered why there had to be a package
check at the National Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want to blow up the fishes?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes said the stepped-up security in Washington at the
national monuments and the Mall will continue indefinitely,
depending on what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we'll wait and see,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. government officials hinted at a major shift
in American policy on terrorism Friday with a vow to go on the
``offense'' with a ``sustained'' global war against terrorists,
striking them down before they can act.
</P>
<P>
   But experts outside the government cautioned that any such
effort must include more than military strikes. It must be
accompanied by diplomatic steps and legal actions to expose
terrorists as murderers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The hint of a major policy shift came from National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger as he briefed reporters at the White House on
the result of Thursday's U.S. missile strikes at suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly going to do everything we can to defend
ourselves, but we're also going to be on offense as well as on
defense,'' Berger declared. However, in response to subsequent
questions, he declined to elaborate on the opening salvos of a new
war against global terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do what we think is prudent and wise and deliberate
and necessary in each context,'' he said in a brief reply to a
question about policy. ``Each situation is different.''
</P>
<P>
   But his use of the word ``offense'' immediately raised eyebrows
among terrorism experts, many of whom viewed Berger's comments as
marking a new phase in U.S. efforts to wipe out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of that word being used in the past,'' said Lee
Colwell, the former associate director of the FBI who served as
vice president of the White House Task Force on Terrorism during
the Reagan presidency. ``It certainly sounds like the policy is
being redefined or clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also fueled such
speculation with comments to reporters on Capitol Hill following a
briefing for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to understand now that ... the terrorist threat
is a longer-term one, and it's a global one,'' she said. ``And we
will maintain, along with other civilized countries in the world, a
sustained effort to deal with what is an increasing terrorist
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Anderson, an international terrorism expert at Idaho State
University, said Berger's comments suggested the United States is
adopting the Israeli model of ``preemptive counterterrorism'' _
trying to stop terrorists before they act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears we are moving beyond an eye for an eye,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Perlstein, co-author of a 1991 book, ``Perspectives on
Terrorism,'' agreed, but added that, to be successful, any
counterrorism effort must also strive to strip terrorist leaders of
any political legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it won't just be jump in, kill and leave,'' he
said. ``It might be that we go in with a small surgical team, bring
(terrorist leaders) out and arrest them and brand them before the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlstein questioned whether an escalating war on terrorists
could be sustained by the United States without damaging diplomatic
relations with the countries where the terrorists are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diplomatic question becomes: what right do we have to
enter the sovereign territory of another nation when war has not
been declared?'' he said. ``But, of course, the Israelis have done
it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Colwell, ``A government has a right to protect
itself, its property and its citizens without regard to political
boundaries.''

MARIJUANA USE AMONG ADOLESCENTS SURGED SINCE 1992, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Marijuana use among adolescents aged 12 to 17 is
continuing to skyrocket because fewer youngsters see the drug as
dangerous, the administration warned in a report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of youngsters in that age group who had used the drug
in the month before they were interviewed jumped nearly a third
between 1996 and 1997 _ from 7.1 percent to 9.4 percent, according
to an annual national survey on drug abuse by the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS).
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 number is nearly triple what it was in 1992 _ 3.4
percent _ the report showed.
</P>
<P>
   HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said at a news conference here that
adolescents increasingly think marijuana is not dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young people are wrong,'' Shalala said. ``Marijuana is
not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that youngsters' perception that taking
marijuana is risky or harmful has dropped from 57 percent in 1996
to 54 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's overall use of illicit drugs _ 6 percent of people
12 and older _ did not rise in 1997, but Shalala said she was
renewing the administration's ``commitment to our long-term
strategy to protect children from marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the report, compiled
from a survey of 25,000 households, underscores the need to help
children 10 and under get past the age of 19 without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weber, a spokesman for the HHS' substance abuse and mental
health services agency, which compiled the report, attributed much
of the rise in teen drug abuse to the media, which he said makes
drugs look attractive to young people.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, there is ``a new generation of youth coming
through the pipeline that didn't have a clear anti-marijuana use
campaign.'' Weber added that the parents of many of today's
adolescents may have used marijuana themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, charged that the rise in marijuana use is a direct
result of President Clinton's drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken a step backward with an appearance on MTV (in June
1992) when he said, `I didn't inhale' (with a) wink and smile, and
said, `I would try it again,''' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Just Say No'' Campaign from the Ronald Reagan and George
Bush administrations was effective, he said, adding that Clinton
``gutted'' the budget and staff of the national drug policy office
when he became president in 1993. That did ``future generations a
disservice,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In July Clinton stepped up the government's fight against drug
abuse by launching a five-year, $2 billion media campaign targeting
young people with advertisements and pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said parents are the key to changing children's
attitudes about illicit drugs. The HHS report shows that only 1.8
percent of adolescents aged 12 to-14 use pot if their parents never
did. But if the parents have used marijuana on occasion in the
past, the percentage of their children using it doubles to 3.9. If
the parents have used it in the past year, 6.8 percent of their
children use it too.

 &HT;    KEY QUESTIONS ON THE U.S. STRIKES
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-POLICY-0822.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are some of the key questions raised by the
American missile strikes against sites in Afghanistan and Sudan:
</P>
<P>
   Question: Were the attacks on Thursday timed to draw attention
away from President Clinton's confession on Monday that he had
``misled people'' about his adulterous affair with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon brass would spurn any such Hollywood-style caper.
As National Security Adviser Sandy Berger noted in a Friday
briefing, the attack plan was developed by Clinton's advisers,
including its proposed timing. Only then, Berger said, was it given
to Clinton for his approval. The key decisions were made last
Friday, before the president testified to a federal grand jury
about the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in light of his testimony, administration officials
felt obliged to provide Clinton with ``air cover'' -- saturating
the electronic media with a virtually non-stop interviews. These
intensive public briefings seem to have the dual goal of slackening
coverage of dissenting voices, mostly from abroad, and of shoring
up Clinton's eroded credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Q: By and large, are Americans less safe from a terrorist
onslaught because the administration took, as Berger put it,
``offensive action''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most probably so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, unfortunately, the war of the future,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said on Friday. Since the raids, Albright
herself has been moving around Washington with a heavily armed
SWAT-type escort in tow. Ordinary tourists encounter beefed-up
security measures at most public places. These measures reflect
officials' well-founded fears that the Islamic radicals are getting
ready to retaliate against the strikes. They know that's how things
work in that part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If that's so, where will the terrorists strike next?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, responding to intelligence reports, ordered U.S.
embassies in Albania, Egypt and Pakistan reduced to skeleton staffs
until the crisis eases. American military bases around the world,
including the Pentagon, are also being much more closely guarded.
</P>
<P>
   But a bomb can be planted in any place where its sends a lethal
message to the enemy, especially if attackers are ready to die in
the bargain. Since not every site can be safeguarded, heightened
security may merely serve to point terrorists toward more
accessible targets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what can be done, once and for all, to end the terrorist
threat against Americans at home and abroad?
</P>
<P>
   A: At this point, not much.
</P>
<P>
   Well-heeled terrorist networks, such as the one funded by exiled
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, would agree to back off only if
the United States agreed to shut down its bases in the Middle East,
lifted the oil embargo against Iraq and halted its political and
financial support for Israel. None of these steps are viable policy
options for the Clinton team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the administration offered any direct convincing or
compelling evidence that Bin Laden's network was behind the Aug. 7
U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, beyond repeated assertions that he did it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen led an
official mission to Capitol Hill to brief members and key
congressional intelligence staffers, who had been kept in the dark.
Cohen said they shared ``what the information was we had to operate
on, what kind of intelligence we had, (and) the basis for the
action.'' None of that data has yet to be made public, however.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were U.S. officials hoping to kill Bin Laden when the
missiles struck an Afghan terrorist training camp -- originally
built for his followers with CIA funds to fight the Soviets?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably so, although they can't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually Bin Laden was a collateral target, much as Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi was viewed in 1986 when President Reagan
ordered a retaliatory U.S. air raid against Gaddafi's home as he
slept. Nor is it at all clear that a long-standing presidential
executive order which bars assassination attempts against foreign
officials would apply as well to terrorist chieftains
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should Sudanese assertions that Washington itself committed a
terrorist act by destroying a totally harmless pharmaceutical plant
in a northern suburb of Khartoum be believed?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. planners say they have hard proof that the plant was doing
more than producing medically useful drugs. At some point, either
at the United Nations, where Sudan has launched a complaint, or in
another venue, the administration must offer its evidence or risk a
loss of face in the Arab world. Berger dismissed Sudanese claims of
innocence on Friday, telling reporters: ``This was a plant that was
producing chemical warfare-related weapons and we have physical
evidence of that fact.''

ordered a retaliatory U.S. air raid against Gaddafi's home as he
slept. Nor is it at all clear that a long-standing presidential
executive order which bars assassination attempts against foreign
officials would apply as well to terrorist chieftains
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should Sudanese assertions that Washington itself committed a
terrorist act by destroying a totally harmless pharmaceutical plant
in a northern suburb of Khartoum be believed?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. planners say they have hard proof that the plant was doing
more than producing medically useful drugs. At some point, either
at the United Nations, where Sudan has launched a complaint, or in
another venue, the administration must offer its evidence or risk a
loss of face in the Arab world. Berger dismissed Sudanese claims of
innocence on Friday, telling reporters: ``This was a plant that was
producing chemical warfare-related weapons and we have physical
evidence of that fact.''

 &HT;    Like his gardens, designer Brooks Garcia draws inspiration from
the past
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the trees, the sunlight dances on a warm and peaceful
afternoon. Deep in the woods, the birds are singing as all the
world sits back in joy, yearning for nothing beyond this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   The words may seem sappy for his office answering machine
recording, but for those who know Atlanta garden designer Brooks
Garcia, they speak volumes about a plantsman whose passion is as
much spiritual as scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this has been a gift to me, to be able to create
beautiful settings for people,'' Garcia says. ``Plus, I'm just a
big old romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more evident than the East Atlanta cottage he's
been refurbishing the past four years. Surrounding the 1930s house
on Metropolitan Avenue is an overstuffed, overgrown English cottage
garden _ a look that's become Garcia's signature style.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rear deck holds romantic touches, such as the quaint
collection of watering cans sitting next to a nostalgic milk box
from Garcia's childhood. Lush grapevines billow from the rail,
while below, giant sunflowers bob over a stone path wandering
through a forest of everything from heirloom tomatoes to
old-fashioned roses. It's an intown jungle with just enough order
to make it charming and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put 15 plants where most people put one,'' Garcia says of
his addiction to green.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old has been hooked since childhood. The native
Atlantan rattles off memories of his earliest gardening experiences
as if they occurred yesterday. ``I planted my first garden when I
was 12 or 13 to attract hummingbirds,'' he recalls. ``The first
plant I ever dug up was bloodroot. It put it in my pocket and
planted it in the yard. When most kids were building huts out of
old Christmas trees, I was planting them.''
</P>
<P>
   An early bloomer. The inspiration to garden came early for
Garcia, as did his talent for arranging plants.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Kenneth Garcia, founded an interior design business,
and his mother, Betty, had studied fashion illustration. ``I can
remember the vegetable garden my father had outside his shop,'' he
says. ``And my grandmother was a big gardener _ mainly daffodils _
so I couldn't escape gardening if I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once, when he was 12, was horticulture ``forced'' on him.
After a Chastain Park neighbor caught him riding his bike over her
flower bed, the victim, Goody Davis, sentenced him to some dirty
work _ hauling horse manure into her garden. An avid gardener, she
began to nurture Garcia's interests. As a teen, he won the
horticultural sweepstakes at Rich's Harvest Show _ on his second
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Buckhead ladies started hiring me to work in their
yards,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While earning his degree in landscape architecture at the
University of Georgia, Garcia worked in a flower shop, a job that
would help prepare him for a later stint with Atlanta garden
designer Ryan Gainey.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, Garcia formed his own design business, Fine
Gardens. Though well-versed in gardening styles, he soon developed
a niche for cottage gardens. ``I always end up with this overgrown
look,'' he says. ``I hope one day to be able to do something more
restrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the romantic look, reminiscent of those rose-filled
enclaves in the English countryside, strikes a chord with
homeowners weary of the suburban cookie-cutter blend of manicured
landscapes. During consultations, Garcia says, clients unsure of
what they want often become nostalgic. ``I tell them to tell me
about your grandmother's garden,'' he says. ``I ask, `What do you
remember from your childhood? Is it a fragrance? Is it the
pathways?'''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the most successful projects result when the client
gets just as involved as he does. ``For me, gardening is such a
spiritual thing,'' Garcia says. ``It just transcends everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Davis feels the same way _ which made the two quite a team
when Garcia designed her last two gardens, the first teeming with
more than 300 roses. ``Brooks is wonderful with color, especially
with mixing roses with perennials,'' Davis says. ``He has gotten a
very good overall education _ both in life as well as gardening.''
</P>
<P>
   A new classroom. One of Garcia's best classrooms was the cottage
garden he created outside his last home _ an apartment building on
East Paces Ferry Road. There, he experimented with an assortment of
perennials, roses, annuals and herbs, grabbing the eye of many
passing admirers.
</P>
<P>
   But four years ago, Garcia left Buckhead for East Atlanta. ``I'd
always wanted to live in a 1920s or '30s house that was well-built
_ one with big attic fans, a screened porch, all reminders of my
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   He found it in a red brick cottage that had been well-maintained
but needed some personality. Garcia painted the living room and
dining room walls with a mottled yellow wash and the ceilings light
blue. In the bathroom, he replaced bright red wall and floor tiles
with slate. A spare bedroom made a convenient office for his
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside was nothing but grass and one tree, and an enormous
carport took up half the back yard,'' Garcia says of the lot, a
former peach orchard.
</P>
<P>
   A large deodar cedar shrouds the front yard enough to create the
perfect spot for a shade garden, while on the side, a blue gate
ushers visitors into a rear cottage-style oasis laid out in rooms.
Boxwoods help define the spaces, brimming with roses, phlox and
sunflowers, while tepees holding tomatoes and green beans provide
added structure. There also are plenty of old-fashioned plants such
as snow-on-the-mountain, a variegated shrub whose green leaves are
edged in white.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to look at in this yard,'' Garcia says.
</P>
<P>
   Hops and ornamental grapevines draw the eye up to the deck,
where they form a canopy over his ``experiment station'' _ a
potting bench lined with cuttings from his travels. In a corner, a
row of antique cloches gives the garden even more of an English
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Like his old watering cans, the bell-shaped glass lids, used for
protecting seedlings, aren't just nostalgic garden ornaments. ``I
actually use them,'' Garcia says.
</P>
<P>
   Who says romance is dead?

 &HT;    COLUMN: Summer holds joyful surprises along with heat
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like imaginative people of talent and consequence, gardens can
surprise. In every season something happens that did not happen the
year before, that might never happen again: an unexpected bloom, a
death, a new arrival that came on its own.
</P>
<P>
   This summer of exceptional heat has been no exception. As the
season steams on, it leaves its legacy in my garden, including the
bad, the good, the beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the nine years I've gardened on Peeples
Street, I did what I had chided friends for doing: I gave too much
license to the heat, allowing it to have its way with my garden.
Yes, I watered and pruned and deadheaded, but not as diligently as
I had in past years, when it was not unusual for me to water daily
_ sometimes twice in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, I've increasingly slacked off on the watering,
getting to the point by August where I've focused almost solely on
container plants, leaving plants in the ground to fend for
themselves as I dashed out at first light and gave the plants a
lick and a promise, fending off mosquitoes, and trying not to
breathe the soggy air.
</P>
<P>
   The result, at times, was bad ugly. Lush became a foreign word
in parts of my garden, as vines, such as the purple clematis and a
creeping raspberry, burned as crisply as saucer magnolia blossoms
in winter's last blast. I lost more plants this summer than in any
previous season, among them a rose I had nurtured in a tub for
almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising, most of the garden lived.
</P>
<P>
   Such willpower.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, I didn't see much of that willpower in
action. Watering time used to be looking time, when I'd get down to
the ground and see what each plant was doing, how it was doing,
what subtle changes it was going through.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I did take that time, I found some unexpected delights,
including two purple surprises.
</P>
<P>
   In late July I noticed that a heather I thought had died in the
winter began putting out tiny new leaves. By the first of August,
it was blooming purple. It was also in July that the wisteria that
refused to bloom in the spring _ again _ produced one strikingly
beautiful purple cluster that was barely visible in the thick
foliage winding up the porch railing.
</P>
<P>
   From where the fragrant phlox volunteered (I noticed it a few
weeks ago), I didn't ask; I simply appreciated an addition amid too
many departures.
</P>
<P>
   A potted Confederate jasmine that I took inside for the winter
languished on the back porch all through spring, its leaves never
getting past a pale yellow. But in July it began blooming, yellow
leaves and all, and hasn't stopped. Nearby, a Florida jasmine
bonsai flowered for the first time in the three years I've had it.
Together, they really light up the back porch, making comings and
goings sweet, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And just when I thought the dry weeks had done in the autumn
clematis living with the Carolina jessamine on the arbor, there it
came, a sprig at the top curling down with sweet white blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Such surprises make me glad I didn't give in completely to the
hellish heat. And now that I can believe it will end someday soon,
I can even find a silver lining in the losses my garden has
suffered: Every plant that died leaves a space for something new.

 &HT;    Swearing has become an everyday way of life for many people and
there seems to be little shame
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News ServiceR
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1939, Rhett Butler scandalized American film audiences when
he told Scarlett O'Hara at the end of ``Gone With the Wind'' that
he didn't ``give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do we anymore when it comes to cursing.
</P>
<P>
   Like a verbal fungus, profanity has seeped into the everyday
fabric of American life. Damn and hell are now common on network
television. And there seems to be no limit to the use of such
language on cable TV, radio and in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Many CDs today are triple X-rated, filled with vile ideas and
sordid language. Sports stars scratch, swear and give the finger
for all to hear and see. And many youngsters use profanity like
grizzled war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sailors now,'' said Jonesboro Police Chief Michael
Montgomery, who has helped implement a city ordinance that makes it
unlawful for a person in his community to curse in front of a child
under 14 years old _ in public or even in the child's home.
</P>
<P>
   But such efforts might be too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   The surface civility of the '40s and '50s _ a time when ``gosh
darn'' still meant you were angry and seemed to fit perfectly with
the white gloves worn by many women _ is a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Jay, professor of psychology at Massachusetts College of
Liberal Arts and author of ``Cursing in America'' (John Benjamins
Publishing Co., $14.95), isn't shocked by profanity, but is struck
by how pervasive such talk has become in American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get off at Penn Station in New York and the stuff I hear on
the street is incredible,'' he says. ``There are no consequences
for swearing in public anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   Court records in Cherokee County show that in 1940, a judge
sentenced a woman to a year in a public work camp ``for using
vulgar, profane and unbecoming language in public.''
</P>
<P>
   If such laws remained in force today, our jails would be filled
with movie stars, professional athletes, politicians and CEOs, the
occasional teacher and minister, and legions of ubiquitous
trash-talking teens.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say students as young as 12 years old routinely curse
in front of them. In a poll published by USA Today last year, 89
percent of high school principals said they face profanity from
students.
</P>
<P>
   Thalia Watson, 41, a teacher at Sequoyah Middle School in
Chamblee, has firsthand knowledge of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a damn what you're going to do to me,'' one
13-year-old student told Watson after the teacher tried to
discipline her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day I couldn't even say `What?' to an adult,'' said
Watson, who grew up in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase, ``in my day,'' comes up a lot when talking with
baby boomers and those who are older. There's a general belief that
people didn't curse as much in the ``good old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, says Jay, who calls that notion ``linguistic
snobbery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think a saloon sounded like in the 1800s?'' he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   He's got a point. Profanity has been around forever.
</P>
<P>
   Take the all-purpose f-word. One professor traced it back to a
1504 English manuscript, ``Flies, Fleas and Friars.'' The f-word
was originally employed as a substitute for ``swiving,'' an old
English term that functioned as a obscene euphemism for sex.
</P>
<P>
   What is different today is that many people no longer feel any
shame about using profanity in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still sensitive to shame, but we've moved it around a
bit,'' said James Twitchell, author of ``Carnival Culture: The
Trashing of Taste in America'' (Columbia University Press, $16.00).
``The word `bitch' has lost its power, but you still don't use the
word `chick' or the n-word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Colbert, a MARTA bus driver, has been able to monitor the
growing acceptance of public profanity from his driver's seat over
the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined MARTA in the mid-'80s, he says, it was mostly
teens in the back of the bus who used profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Now women are the major offenders. ``And they're sitting in the
center of the bus,'' said Colbert, 50.
</P>
<P>
   For Colbert, the focus may be women. But no group is untouched
by the use of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers curse aloud in the mall. Drivers display profane
bumper stickers. Radio talk-show host Howard Stern spews profanity
at his guests and audience, and grows rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Public profanity has even reached our highest office. A cursing
landmark was reached in 1984 when George Bush, at the time a vice
presidential candidate, bragged after a debate with Geraldine
Ferraro that he had ``tried to kick a little ass.'' Bush jovially
denied at a news conference later that he had used the words ``a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay says cursing is a central aspect of human communication and
it's simplistic to say it is wrong. Such words, he says, intensify
emotional communication in ways that other words cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stubbed your toe, saying `Oh pooh-pooh' doesn't do it
like saying, `Oh s---,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like much in life, Twitchell thinks the rise of profanity can be
linked to money. Corporations began to realize the impact of the
youth market, teens and young adults from 15 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   And youngsters, he says, were interested in what kids have
always been interested in _ any behavior, cursing included, that
would shock their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``All swearing is a breaking of a taboo,'' Twitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, in search of blockbuster hits, movie and music
producers, publishers and entertainment CEOs have stretched the
envelope, resulting in ever-increasing amounts of vulgarity in
books, movies and on television.
</P>
<P>
   The family hour on network television has become filled with
sitcoms that exploit sex and violence and create the environment
that allows such shows as ``South Park,'' featuring three profane
third-graders and an animated piece of excrement, to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Critics can lambast this change in public tastes, but they don't
have the consumer clout of America's youth culture, Twitchell
thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This audience is the great piston of American culture,'' he
said. ``They don't just have money, but they also have the most
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people shrug their shoulders at such low-brow humor,
thinking it's just a passing phase and will have little real impact
on society. Stephen Carter isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Author of ``Civility'' (Basic Books, $25), Carter fears we'll
all become losers if we allow one another to use profanity casually
in public. He believes that the ability to hold dialogue is
essential to democracy and that vulgar language doesn't encourage
reasoned responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sparks anger or shame but not dialogue,'' Carter said. ``So
it makes it harder for us to talk to each other, and thus hurts
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay said cursing often makes it easier to talk to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This language has been around a long time,'' Jay said. ``You
can't do away with these words. There are emotions already built
into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ban dirty words, Jay said, and people will adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd make new ones,'' he said.

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The Pakistan government on Friday
condemned the U.S. attack on neighboring Afghanistan, calling it a
violation of the norms of international behavior and saying that it
sets a ``dangerous precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   It also summoned a senior U.S. diplomat to the Foreign Ministry
to hear an official protest by the government, which maintains that
the missiles the United States fired at targets in Afghanistan
crossed Pakistan's air space without permission.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that the United States received permission,
but the Pakistani Foreign Ministry on Friday denied that it had
given permission or even been asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   In another protest, which was later withdrawn, the government
maintained that one cruise missile had gone astray, landing in
Pakistan and killing six people. There is no evidence that anyone
in Pakistan was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government was striving for a balance Friday
between not being too harsh on the United States, an important
ally, but not appearing too soft, lest it fuel the passions of
militant Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of the capital, and in other cities around the
country, condemnation of the U.S. attack was widespread, cutting
across class and political lines. There were small demonstrations
here and in the country's other major cities, but no reported
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior diplomats from countries closely allied with the
United States, sided with the Pakistani version. One said that U.S.
officials had told foreign diplomats in a briefing that the United
States had not sought permission to overfly Pakistan, and that
Pakistan had not been notified of the attack until the missiles
were in the air.
</P>
<P>
   These diplomats also said that Pakistan's protests against the
U.S. attack were not as strong as they appeared to be _ or might
have been. For example, one noted, Pakistan could register a
complaint with the U.N. Security Council over the violation of the
air space. Pakistan has given no indication that it intends to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the Americans, I wouldn't be feeling too sore,'' he
said. ``I'd be thinking they could have hammered us a lot harder
than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The other diplomat said of the Pakistani response, ``I think it
is for domestic consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released to the public, Pakistan's foreign
minister, Sartaj Aziz, said, ``Irrespective of the motives of these
strikes, the act of violation of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of these Islamic countries cannot but be a matter of
grave concern to the people of Pakistan, who justifiably feel
outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Tariq
Altaf, said Friday that Pakistan would continue to cooperate with
the United States in the investigation of the bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two weeks ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the missile attack on Thursday was aimed at
a training complex run by Osama bin Laden, the man that U.S.
officials have charged was behind the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   To many in Pakistan, bin Laden is not a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   It is not because people here are anti-American or approve of
his terrorist connections. It is rather that they know him as a
hero of the Afghan resistance against the Russians in the 1980s.
And they are not convinced he is a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he really involved? I think not,'' said Tanweer Hussain, a
52-year-old medical doctor. ``How could one man do all that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistanis have a good feeling about America, for its
technology, its education,'' Hussain said, standing on a wide
boulevard lined with leafy trees, after coming from Friday prayers;
sweat stained his loose-fitting, long shirt and thin pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it should not be the policeman of the world,'' he added.
And he criticized the attack on Afghanistan because ``there are
certain norms, certain procedures to be followed.'' The United
States should have been ``more patient,'' he said, and worked
through the United Nations or with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find anyone who defended the U.S. action. ``It
was unjust,'' said a woman buying a few items in a shop in
Rawalpindi, a nearby city, as brightly colored minibuses added to
the cacophony on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Although the country's fundamentalist Islamic parties are a
minority and do not do particularly well in elections, they are
well organized and can put tens of thousand of protesters on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs were apparent Friday, with small demonstrations
around the country, most of them after Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
   During prayers at the Lal Mosque, Maulana Mohammed Abdullah told
those gathered, ``You can kill all the Americans around the world,
and those who have helped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the men went into the streets. They mounted a small boy on
a car roof, where he posed with a cap gun and a Pakistani flag.
They burned American flags and an effigy of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During one demonstration Iran was a target of the invective,
along with the United States. Iranians are predominately Shiite
Muslims; Pakistanis are primarily Sunni Muslims. And Iran has been
opposed to the Taliban, which has taken control of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In Peshawar, near the Afghan border, where the fundamentalists
are strongest, there were at least three demonstrations. One group
of several hundred marched on the U.S. consulate there. They were
dispersed by tear gas. The army was deployed to control a
demonstration in Peshawar's university district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to fight with us, bring your forces. But this is a
cowardly way to attack us,'' said Zaz Mohammed, 50, an algebra
teacher with a gray beard. ``What kind of way is this to fight one
man _ Osama bin Laden?''

BANK STOCKS REFLECT GLOBAL TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The week started out with a bang and ended in a
whimper for bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks, which have been battered for a month, posted a nice
rebound earlier this week before economic turmoil in Russia and
concerns about financial instability in Latin America sent the
group reeling.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the stocks of big money center banks were down
4.52 percent as a group, while large regional banks plunged 3.14
percent as a group.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia alone hardly poses an earnings threat to banks, and
a rumored currency devaluation in Venezuela is not disastrous in
itself, investors are backing away from banks because several
hazards are starting to add up.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Southeast Asia's once robust economies are already
severely wounded. Link those woes to the possibility that the
travails in Venezuela and Russia could spill over into the rest of
Latin America and Eastern Europe, and the scale of global economic
problems looms much larger _ and may portend economic troubles in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market capitalization of the banking industry has declined
by $200 billion in the last month,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst
with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``The risks in emerging markets,
year 2000 problems and other factors are getting better reflected
in stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Large U.S. banks that do business overseas _ the money center
banks _ have only $3.5 billion of lending and investment exposure
to Venezuela, spare change by big bank standards. But they have
$25.7 billion in exposure to Brazil, $17.3 billion to Mexico and
$16.2 billion to Argentina, according to Brown Bros. Harriman &AMP; Co.
The exposure is $98.9 billion to Latin America and the Caribbean as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of banks that do a lot of business in Latin America
were punished Friday. Citicorp fell $4.75, or 3.4 percent, to
$134.3125; Chase Manhattan fell $1.625, or 2.5 percent, to $63.50;
J.P. Morgan dropped $3.4375, or 2.8 percent, to $119.375; Bankers
Trust fell $4.9375, or 4.9 percent, to $96.3125, a new 52-week low,
and BankBoston sank $2.4375, or 5.5 percent, to $41.9375.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group has led the market in both directions, and that
behavior is likely to continue,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst
at Brown Bros. Harriman. ``But we do feel that the banks are
oversold based on the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   For big U.S. regional banks, subject to a potential drop-off in
loan growth and heightened credit concerns, also ended on a sour
note Friday. Nationsbank slipped $1.0625, or 1.5 percent, to
$70.3125, and Norwest dropped $1.0625, or 3.2 percent, to $32.0625.
First Union, on the other hand, rose 56.25 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $51.625.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 50 percent of the sell-off is emotional and 50 percent
is fundamental,'' said Edward Furash, a banking consultant with
Furash &AMP; Co. in Washington. ``But it's clear that the banks that
don't have the capacity to cover earnings shortfalls with other
sources of income are going to get hurt.''

ROYALS DIRECTORS BACK PRENTICE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City Royals directors on Thursday all but anointed Miles
Prentice as the next owner of the baseball team _ then announced he
needs more local money to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he still has competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at Kauffman Stadium, directors revealed
that Prentice's $75 million bid to buy the Royals must be composed
of at least 50 percent local money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they declared his the superior bid and once even called it a
successful one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is now challenging the citizens of Kansas City to
step up to the plate and support the Prentice bid,'' said Michael
Herman, the Royals president. The ``citizens'' would have to be
wealthy because Prentice wants investments that are measured in the
millions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Royals did not eliminate other bidders for
the team. That means Prentice's biggest rival, the duo of Chiefs
owner Lamar Hunt and the Topeka utility firm of Western Resources
Inc., could still weigh in with a bid. The Hunt-Western group had
submitted a low bid that was rejected, but the group has been
working behind the scenes to try to boost it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Hunt-Western team said they had agreed among
themselves not to comment on Thursday's developments. A Western
Resources spokeswoman said, ``Our position is, we continue to work
at the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said that he was pleased, on the whole, with the Royals
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they endorsed our group not only as the best bid but
as the group they really think could make this operation a
success,'' said Prentice, a New Yorker and minor league team owner.
``They're encouraging Kansas Citians to join. I think it was a
pretty strong endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't particularly worried about the Royals failure
to eliminate his competitors. ``You can't look over your
shoulder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon meeting with the editorial board of /{The Kansas
City Star/}, Prentice outlined a survival plan for the area's
baseball franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Royals are on pace to lose $10 million this year,
Prentice believes the team can break even. His plan calls for
higher ticket prices, a lower player payroll, and at least 1.5
million fans a year. The team drew 1.5 million last year and is on
pace to draw 1.6 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also would favor about $75 million worth of stadium
improvements that would generate money for the owners. That
presumably would be paid by taxpayers. The Royals have already
outlined a $75 million plan for glassing in the concourse level,
building a pavilion for fans beyond center field, and putting in
bigger concession stands and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice also said he was surprised by the Royals requirement
that he round up 50 percent local money. He said the Royals didn't
tell him that until three weeks ago. Until then, he had been
working toward getting Kansas City investments that equaled
one-third of the total.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Prentice said he hadn't heard until Thursday that
the 50 percent level was a requirement included in the Royals'
articles of incorporation. Herman, the Royals president, revealed
that at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said he had seen those documents but didn't remember
seeing that provision. He said he didn't have a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Prentice said that if the Royals want 50 percent,
he'll work to accumulate 50 percent. He understood that the Royals
want to be comfortable with his bid because he's from out of town
and must overcome the fear that he secretly desires to move the
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've done is changed the rules on him,'' said Jerry
Green, the Kansas City banker who last year tried unsuccessfully to
buy the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Green was in much the same position as Prentice, in that Green's
bid was composed mostly of out-of-town money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere did they say I had to have 50 percent. Never was that
mentioned,'' said Green. ``They knew my investor had most of the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Merritt, a spokesman for the Royals directors, said that
Green didn't know about the 50 percent requirement because his bid
never got far.
</P>
<P>
   He further said that it always had been implied that the board
wanted local ownership in the team. The exact 50 percent amount was
disclosed to bidders in documents they saw in May.
</P>
<P>
   The matter apparently didn't come up again until about three
weeks ago when Prentice and the Royals had entered an intense phase
of negotiations called full disclosure. It apparently was a
misunderstanding; the Royals assumed Prentice knew about the 50
percent requirement.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the 50 percent requirement was an important fact
that should have been explicitly disclosed to all bidders at the
very beginning of the process, Merritt said it should have been
explicit to those bidders who saw the documents in May.  &LR; brk:Time
is a factor  &LR; tx:One reason the Royals made their announcement
Thursday is that time is pressing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals want to straighten out the Prentice bid within a
couple of weeks. That way, they could present the bid to members of
the major league baseball ownership committee in advance of their
meeting Sept. 16. The officials could approve of the ownership
change at that time. That way, the baseball team could be
transferred during the off season. Otherwise, Prentice couldn't get
approval until the next meeting, which isn't until January.
</P>
<P>
   If the Royals miss the September meeting, it's not likely they
could call a special meeting, said Bud Selig, the commissioner of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have quarterly meetings, and unless it's an emergency we do
not meet until then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said that a January approval wouldn't kill his bid
because he and the Royals could work cooperatively for a few
months. But it would complicate matters and decision-making could
bog down.

YELTSIN AND CREW ARE SINKING LIKE THE RUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The man who climbed atop a tank and led Russia out of
communism in 1991 has scarcely been seen in public since his
country's financial markets and currency fell off a cliff last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The big question _ for him and for the reforms he champions _ is
whether Russians any longer care.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, already deeply unpopular,
now seems to have sunk even lower in political and public esteem
than his country's ruble. The Duma, Russia's lower house of
Parliament, voted 245-32 Friday to ask him to resign. Newspapers
are savaging him with headlines like, ``The Devaluation of the
President.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say the week's events all but abort prospects
that Yeltsin, now 67, might seek a third term in 2000. His top
aides, a best-and-brightest crew widely admired abroad, are now so
tarred by failure at home that their own political prospects are
slight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is nobody on Russia's political horizon who
embraces the president's westernized brand of economic policy and
has a chance of winning a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody to continue the reforms,'' said Otto Latsis,
the deputy editor of the newspaper Noviye Izvestia and a highly
regarded political analyst. ``We can only pin our hopes on some
semi-miracle that, in two years, Russia's savior may emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Latsis and others are quick to stress that predicting Russia's
future is a fool's job, and that Yeltsin in particular has risen
from the dead before. Still, the devaluation and debt restructuring
of this week almost certainly will mean inflation, recession and
less government revenue at a time when Russians are clamoring for
stability, growth and billions of rubles in back wages and
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   None of that bodes well for market-style reforms or their
proponents. To the contrary, political experts say the crisis has
strengthened the two left-of-center politicians already regarded as
the early presidential front-runners: Alexander Lebed, the former
general who now governs the vast Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk,
and Yuri Luzhkov, the canny mayor of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are strong-willed, even authoritarian rulers. Though
Lebed can be unpredictable, both lean less toward free markets than
toward centralized control of the economy. Luzhkov has a smooth
political style. Lebed is rougher-edged but trying hard; his aides
are discussing political and economic cramming sessions with
officials at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would be a president even remotely like the mercurial
but steadfastly Western-oriented Yeltsin. Nor would the other
current major contender, Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist who ran
second behind Yeltsin two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two other assumed candidates, Victor Chernomyrdin and Gregory
Yavlinsky, are more reform-minded, but neither has a large
following. Chernomyrdin also suffers because he was Yeltsin's prime
minister during the birth of the policies that led to this month's
economic catastrophe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday, in the first hours of an emergency session on the fiscal
crisis, members of the Duma put aside Yeltsin's demands to overhaul
the country's Gordian tax system and spent several hours flaying
him and his advisers. ``I think it would be a blessing if Yeltsin
and his entourage resigned voluntarily,'' Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko gave no quarter. Warning that
the nation's financial crisis has just begun, he said Yeltsin's
team ``cannot afford the luxury of being a popular government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am criticized on the ground that the government has no
political support _ that is true,'' he said. ``But let us honestly
admit that there is no political force in the country which is
prepared to assume the responsibility for the economy with
elections not far off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko explicitly included the Duma among those forces,
noting that Parliament had refused Yeltsin's pleas to raise taxes
or reorder spending this summer, even though the government's debt
payments alone were running 11 billion rubles a month above its
income.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, on vacation for five weeks now, has struck a strange
pose through all this. Almost a week ago, in Novgorod, he thundered
that the ruble would not be devalued and that he would not cut
short his rest to return to Moscow because that would be viewed as
evidence of a ``disaster.'' Within hours, both events came to pass.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper account of his visit to a Novgorod factory
described Yeltsin as confused, tempestuous and, at one point,
gasping for air. Atop other reports, including his seeming
infirmity at last month's funeral for the long-dead Czar Nicholas
II and a visit to Sweden notable for his misstatements, the weekend
appearance raised new questions about Yeltsin's health and command
of events.
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed generally serene Friday in his only other
recent public appearance, to oversee naval maneuvers off the Arctic
Circle town of Severmorsk. He literally waved away the Duma's
request that he quit, saying the legislators did not appear to
understand that Russia needs a president.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders say that while Yeltsin still holds the reins,
able to veto his aides, he obviously has lost steam. ``It seems
clear that Yeltsin has never been weaker,'' said Rory MacFarquhar,
a political scientist at the Russian European Center for Economic
Policy in Moscow. ``It's clear he's confused. He's not in a
position to throw his weight around.''
</P>
<P>
   For reformers, the problem is that Yeltsin, for all his
problems, remains the weightiest force they have. ``Without his
active support, it's hard to imagine the reformers' making any
serious changes,'' MacFarquhar said.
</P>
<P>
   Change is what they now need. Besides pushing the Duma into
approving a series of tax increases, the Yeltsin government needs,
in Western economists' view, to rein in a banking system controlled
by some of the country's richest and most powerful figures and
supported by parts of the bureaucracy, including the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves could be crucial to the economic course after
devaluation and debt restructuring _ and crucial to public opinion
in the next election. The question is whether a weakened Yeltsin
can or will push them.

ROYALS DIRECTORS BACK PRENTICE BID

   making could bog down.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prentice did not reveal many specifics of his bid, he
did drop tidbits about it during a press conference Thursday
afternoon and the meeting at /{The Star/}.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said he had more than 10 local investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among Prentice's out-of-town investors, two are from Detroit.
One out-of-town investor owns a minor league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   His $75 million bid includes some ``sweat equity'' in which he
gets some ownership stake for no money. But he added that he was
making a significant personal investment.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he's trying to raise more than $75 million _ he'd
like to raise $15 million more _ as a cushion to absorb future
operating losses of the baseball team.  &LR; brk:Prentice says he's
close  &LR; tx:At the news conference on Thursday, Herman said the
Royals were working all but exclusively on the Prentice bid. The
bid has cleared contract negotiations and more or less awaits
signatures. The contracts would be signed as soon as Prentice gets
hits the 50 percent level.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice would not say how close he is to that level, other than
to say he's close.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks he has signed up banker R. Crosby Kemper Jr.;
mortgage banker Jim Nutter Jr.; Julia Irene Kauffman, who is the
daughter of Royals founder Ewing Kauffman and Muriel Kauffman; and
Nancy Kauffman, who is the Kauffmans' daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Herman challenged Kansas Citians to get behind Prentice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people of Kansas City don't want to step up to the
plate, then we'll have to make other decisions. That's what we're
saying,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what other decisions, he said, ``other decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said: ``I'm very disappointed after all this effort
that people of Kansas City have not come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded toward David Glass, the Royals chairman who last year
decided against buying the Royals after fans reacted negatively to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very nice person here who was willing to do
something,'' Herman said. ``For some reason, people didn't like him
to be an owner. A lot of things have gone on here that chase people
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Royals Director Joe McGuff, who as a longtime sports columnist
for /{The Star/} covered the old Kansas City Athletics and later
the Royals, said that with the exception of Royals founder Ewing
Kauffman, no Kansas Citian has been an owner of a Kansas City major
league baseball team. ``That's disappointing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether more Kansas Citians will quickly join Prentice is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said, ``I know the business
leadership of the city is extremely concerned about major-league
permanence and they would in all likelihood want to try to step up
to the plate. However, we ought to look at all kinds of
opportunities for (others) to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Prentice reflected on his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has done a lot to vet me, trying to get comfortable
with me,'' he said. ``I'm still an outsider. I'm still a little bit
of an unknown quantity. They're doing everything they can to make
sure that if they pick me and my group, they're picking the right
people. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wish they'd do it a little faster.''

BOMBINGS ELICIT MIXED REACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appalling. Murderous.
</P>
<P>
   Warranted. Critical.
</P>
<P>
   The response to U.S. attacks on alleged terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan on Thursday could be
described in three ways: swift, emphatic and, above all, mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the United States government for retaliating and
doing anything against terrorism,'' said Surur Puma, a native of
Juba, Sudan, who lives in Kansas City after moving to this country
three years ago to escape persecution. ``We had cried for the
United States to do something, because they killed hundreds of
innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled,'' said Mary K. Meyer of the Shalom Catholic
Worker House in Kansas City, Kan. ``This is about the suffering of
the people. I'm so sad. Here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Retaliating 13 days after the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in
East Africa, U.S. forces committed the attacks, President Clinton
said, to ``counter an immediate threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the decision to attack was based on intelligence
information that pinpointed ``one of the most active terrorist
bases in the world'' and an industrial plant that made agents for
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some counterterrorism experts said the president had no choice
but to order the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain acts that warrant a military response, and
terrorist attacks are among them,'' said Brent Smith, an expert on
terrorism at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. ``We either had
to attack their training and weapons sites, or sit back and accept
whatever wrongs they've dealt out, or will deal out in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who supported the strikes was Kansas City Mayor
Emanuel Cleaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person who believes in peace and pacifism, I've got to
say that I was extremely pleased _ as I believe most Americans will
be _ that we are not going to just take terrorism sitting on our
hands,'' Cleaver said Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said he hoped Americans would not be cynical enough to
view the bombings as an administration attempt to distract
attention from Clinton's personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say, `We'll get the terrorist camps after November,
after Ken Starr finishes his report,' '' Cleaver said. ``You find
who did it, and you hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the attacks were a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudan is not a terrorist state,'' said Kisangani Emizet, a
political science professor at Kansas State University and an
expert on Sudan. ``It is a nation at civil war, not a nation that
seeks to destroy elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it had accurate intelligence, he said, the United States
was wrong in its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot respond to a terrorist bomb with a bomb,'' he said.
``It is never the terrorist leaders who suffer and die in these
explosions. Just as happened in Nairobi, it is the innocent people
who happen to be nearby who suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   A major concern of those interviewed Thursday was that someone
may attempt to retaliate for the U.S. strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on how good our intelligence is and whether we
can intercept these things ahead of time,'' said Mayer Nudell, a
counterterrorism consultant formerly with the State Department.
``But there will be people who will undoubtedly attempt, whether
successfully or otherwise, to do things against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Barbara McCracken, who works in Peace and Justice of the
Department of Parish Ministries for the Archdiocese of Kansas City
in Kansas, said Thursday's actions will only serve to escalate the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never for responding with violence,'' she said. ``This is
such an extreme misuse of our bloated military capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   A better way, McCracken said, is to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorists only act because they see no other way,'' she said.
``We won't negotiate with terrorists; we just retaliate. I find
this an immature response. It's not using our full mental
capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some might generalize about the American military
``bombing Afghanistan and Sudan,'' University of Kansas political
science professor Philip Schrodt says that is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the attacks are occurring on Afghan and Sudanese
soil, the attacks are against terrorist groups and not these
countries,'' said Schrodt, who studies international conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bombing was just the latest violence to hit Giselle
Rafiq's home country of Afghanistan. First, the invasion by the
Soviet Union. Then internal civil strife. Now trouble started by
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Rafiq, who has lived here for about two years, said she is glad
the United States took action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these were terrorists who were bombarded, I hope every one
of them died,'' said Rafiq. ``But I really hope that there were no
innocent people who were hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150 families from Afghanistan live in the Kansas City
area, Rafiq said. Many fled the country after the Soviet invasion
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But many refugees left relatives behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Sultani's siblings, cousins and uncles still live there.
It is nearly impossible to communicate with them by phone or mail,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sultani said he understands the importance of taking action
against terrorists. Still, that doesn't make him worry less about
relatives back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad situation. It used to be such a beautiful
country,'' said Sultani, who lives in Lenexa. ``Of course, everyone
has concerns if they have family or friends there. They are every
minute in my mind.''

TIMING OF EVENTS BECOME ISSUE FOR CLINTON CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON AND RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   to draw public attention from his domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Even close to home, the issue became a hot topic on talk radio,
with even the suggestion that Clinton was ``staging the whole
thing.'' joked about the White House ``staging the whole thing.''
Clinton, he suggested, was ``caught with his pants down and now
he's looking for someone to bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one caller protested that idea: ``You're suggesting he
killed people to cover up his sex scandal. You're sick.'' But
others wondered aloud why Clinton, for example, ``announces the air
strike while Monica is testifying.'' ]
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said that ``if that's a man-on-the-street sentiment,
it's too bad.'' He called the military strikes ``a very serious
response to a dastardly act of terrorism ...and Americans should
approve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess conceded, however, that some Americans might have trouble
embracing Clinton's case for national security, coming as it does
from the same man who Monday told a national audience he ``misled''
the public about his personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has lied to them in the recent past, so he'll need to
work hard on this one,'' Hess said. ``It's a problem that will be
out there on everything the president does from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential scholar Douglas Brinkley of the University of New
Orleans dismissed the timing of Clinton's military moves as
``surreal coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing coming out of a lot of people's mouths was,
`My God, it's `Wag the Dog'!'' Brinkley said. (In fact, all 12
copies of the movie were checked out of a Prairie Village video
store by 7 p.m., rare for a Thursday night, a clerk said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sex scandal; this is not a joke. We're talking
about war,'' said Brinkley. ``I think you'll find near-unanimous
support (for the decision to strike). Ma and Pa America will be 90
percent behind it. When America goes to war, Main Street rallies
around.''
</P>
<P>
   To Brinkley, the notion of using America's war machine for
political convenience ``would be naive, very cynical and very ugly.
It would defy the reality of these kinds of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, such thoughts are not new to American history.
Secretary of State William Seward once suggested to a newly elected
Abraham Lincoln that he pick a fight with the French or the
Mexicans to distract his Southern critics.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln thought better, and the Civil War came to pass.

FORMER KLAN CHIEF CONVICTED IN FATAL 1966 FIREBOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Sam Bowers, an imperial wizard of the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and reputedly the mastermind behind a
widespread campaign of terror across Mississippi three decades ago,
was convicted Friday for a 1966 civil rights murder after three
previous prosecutions had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, who reached his 74th birthday this month, was
immediately sentenced to life imprisonment and led from the
courtroom into custody by three black deputy sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, reached in 3 1/2 hours by a jury composed of six
whites, five blacks and an Asian-American, climaxed a long crusade
to win a conviction in the murder of Vernon Dahmer, leader of the
Hattiesburg chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict was announced, members of the Dahmer family
bowed their heads in blessing and wept quietly in a balcony
overlooking Bowers' defense table. Bowers, who seemed to be
anticipating immediate imprisonment, had begun emptying his pockets
of belongings moments before the jury filed back into the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He was stoic when pronounced guilty, and had no comment before
receiving his mandatory sentence, maintaining a silence he kept
throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, outside the courthouse, the victim's widow, Ellie
Dahmer, said: ``I'm just filled with joy. The tears I'm shedding
are for Vernon, because I know he's watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Dennis Dahmer, who survived the Klan attack with his
mother, brother and sister, spoke for the family: ``Thirty-two
years ago, Mr. Bowers and his fellow Klansmen started something.
Thirty-two years later, we hope to bring some closure to this...I
hope today's verdict reflects that we're living in a new South and
a new Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of charges against Bowers was a joint effort by the
local civil rights community and white prosecutors, and there was
an emotional celebration in the court chambers after Bowers was led
away. Attorney General Mike Moore embraced the members of the
prosecuting team as well as the Dahmer family as they departed the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Helfrich, the assistant district attorney who led the
prosecution, was weeping. ``This is the Dahmers' day,'' he said.
``They waited too long for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers' attorney, Travis Buckley, said he would appeal for a new
trial. ``I can't say I was surprised by the verdict,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was accused of commanding his compatriots to eliminate
Dahmer in the winter of 1996 to stifle Dahmer's civil rights
activity in Forrest County and to send a message to Washington that
the South would violently resist efforts to integrate the society
here.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer died from burns 14 hours after a 2 a.m. firebomb attack
on his farmhouse near here on Jan. 10, 1966. He had been leading a
voter registration drive at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecution witnesses, Bowers ordered his followers
in a tough Klan unit in neighboring Jones County to execute a
``Code 4'' on Dahmer because the Forrest County Klansmen had been
unable to subdue Dahmer. In a Klan structure where Code 1 called
for a cross-burning, Code 2 for a whipping, and Code 3 meant an
arson attack, the extreme penalty was Code 4 _ death.
</P>
<P>
   In his instructions to the jury, Circuit Judge Richard McKenzie
pointed out that a murder conviction was warranted by law if it
could be proved that someone commanded the murder even though not
present at the crime. ``It is as if his own hand committed the
offense,'' McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   The state did not seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, who was arrested along with more than a dozen other
Klansmen shortly after the attack, withstood three trials in state
court in the 1960s. Each ended in a mistrial. However, he was
convicted of conspiracy in federal court in connection with the
murder of three civil rights workers in Neshoba County and spent
six years in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said Bowers was responsible for deploying
teams of bombers and nightriders across the state during a
prolonged period of violence that claimed many lives and
intimidated many citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A clamor to revive the Dahmer case began earlier this decade
after authorities closed in on Byron de la Beckwith, an associate
of Bowers who was finally convicted in 1994 for the assassination
of Mississippi's NAACP leader Medgar Evers 30 years earlier.
Beckwith's two trials in the 1960s had also ended in mistrials.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, local and state prosecutors were able to
produce two new witnesses to augment the testimony of three former
Klansmen who testified against Bowers in the earlier trials.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stringer, a youthful errand boy for Bowers in 1996, came
forward to testify this week that he overheard Bowers and other
Klansmen discussing a ``Code 4'' for Dahmer two or three days
before the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Lucy, the former wife of a Ku Klux Klan leader in Jackson,
also provided new testimony that Bowers appeared at her home
shortly after the murder with a newspaper story of Dahmer's death.
``Did you see what a good job my boys did?'' she reported that
Bowers said, and she described his mood as ``jubilant.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Bowers' attorney, Buckley, claimed that
the case had been ``worked up by political expediency and someone
in the press'' and charged that his client was ``being offered up
on their altar to be sacrified to the media and to private,
political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   After the case languished for three decades, Buckley said,
``along comes an attorney general who seeks political
advancement,'' and he suggested that Bowers was being prosecuted
``to appeal to racial prejudices and the bias of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who loaned personnel from the attorney general's office
to help develop the case against Bowers, is pondering a run next
year for governor in a state where one third of the voters are
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought this case at the request of the Dahmer family,''
Moore said. ``I'm proud we were able to turn up new witnesses and
stronger evidence to see that justice was done.'' Moore called
Buckley a ``Klan lawyer'' and said his remarks about politics ``did
not warrant comment.''

TIMING OF EVENTS BECOME ISSUE FOR CLINTON CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON AND RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington's politicians responded Thursday as they usually do
when a president orders military action. They reminded all the
world that they stand with their commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Yet consider how U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft couched his support,
reminding the nation that while smoke hung over Khartoum Thursday,
there remained ``a cloud over this presidency....''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tragic that momentous decisions must be made under these
circumstances,'' the Missouri Republican said in a press release
alluding to President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the president is entitled to the presumption that his
action is based solely on his judgment of the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   So although neither politicians nor foreign policy experts on
Thursday accused Clinton of launching strikes to distract a country
from talk of Monica Lewinsky, there was wide agreement on his
vulnerability to the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood suggested recently in the movie ``Wag the Dog'' that a
president would try to blast scandal from the public consciousness
with images of bombs and bullets. But that was a farce, experts
point out, and not reason to believe Clinton is now giving in to
political temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting point for this military action started with the
bombing of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya,'' said Robert
Litwak of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juxtaposition of these events, in our post-O.J.
sensational pop culture, will inevitably create accusations that he
is trying to create a distraction from his domestic troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-day evaluations typically noted that the attacks in
Afghanistan and Sudan came with the support of Defense Secretary
William Cohen, a former Senate Republican, and Joint Chiefs of
Staff chairman Gen. Henry Shelton, widely referred to as ``a
soldier's soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These professionals clearly believed it was the best course of
action,'' said Abraham Sofaer, a senior fellow at the conservative
Hoover Institution who served as a legal adviser to the U.S. State
Department during the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never know what's on the president's mind, but I don't
think those people would go through with this just as some sort of
favor to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents engaged in foreign affairs crises while weathering
tough politics at home have long had their motives questioned.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan's decision to invade Grenada in 1983 was
interpreted in some quarters as an effort to divert the nation's
focus from the bombing of a Marine Corps military barracks in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter was accused of trying to shift attention from
double-digit inflation and runaway interest rates when he called
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 the most serious
international event since World War II. He then embargoed grain
sales and led an Olympic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon, under attack for firing special prosecutor
Archibald Cox, stood accused of diversionary tactics when he scaled
up the military's nuclear alert status in response to the Soviet
Union's threat to step into the Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time this argument that presidents stir up foreign
clashes to cover for their other problems is really unfounded,''
said Gaddis Smith, a professor of American diplomatic history at
Yale University. ``The Clinton presidency is an empty shell now, so
you'll hear it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of Clinton's domestic problems showed through in
varying degrees in responses from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is clearly much more we need to learn about this
attack and why it was ordered today, given the president's personal
difficulties this week, it is legitimate to question the timing of
this action,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who is chairman of the
Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs Subcommittee of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said he is satisfied that the timing of the
bombing was valid.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback based his view on a conversation he had after the
bombing Thursday afternoon with a high-ranking State Department
official. Evidence had become clear that those who were targets
were responsible for the American embassy attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the intelligence system gives this kind of information,
you have to quickly respond,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he can understand speculation that Clinton was
trying to divert attention from Lewinsky, especially on the day she
returned to the grand jury for testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing leads people to ask those questions, particularly
now that the president made his statements earlier this week,''
Brownback said. ``I'd hope they didn't take into account a desire
to spin this politically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonsense,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the
ranking Democrat on the House National Security Committee. ``We
found out who the culprits were (in recent bombing attacks) and we
went after them.''
</P>
<P>
   One person not hesitant to challenge the timing of the bombing
was Oliver North, who was on Reagan's National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the administration officials heard from thus far are
accurate, we have apparently long known of Osama bin Laden's role
in several previous terrorist attacks,'' North said in a press
release. ``If that is the case, why didn't the United States strike
/{before/} embassies in Africa were blown up?''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who is laying the groundwork for a presidential bid,
also noted earlier attacks on Americans and said, ``I look forward
to knowing at the proper time why this action wasn't taken
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sudanese television, that nation's information minister,
Ghazi Salah-Eddin, accused Clinton of trying to draw public
attention from his

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ The Albanian secret police, under the
direction of U.S. intelligence operatives, combed this ramshackle
Balkan country Friday for Islamic terrorists suspected of using
charity organizations as a cover for their operations.
</P>
<P>
   A series of raids orchestrated by the CIA this summer against
Islamic militants apparently thwarted a plot to bomb the U.S.
Embassy and broke up a cell of Muslim fundamentalists who were
wanted in Egypt. But many suspected terrorists sought by the
Albanian police apparently have fled this country, where border
controls and internal policing are virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wanted individuals is the director of the Islamic
Revival Foundation. The foundation is one of scores of Islamic
charities, many of them fundamentalist, from Saudi Arabia, Egypt
and other Arab countries that have sprung up here in recent years
as Albania emerged from decades of Stalinist isolation.
</P>
<P>
   At the foundation's headquarters, located behind rust-colored
metal gates in an alley in an eastern district of the city, a
request for an interview was rebuffed. But workers confirmed that
the director was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   An auto mechanic working across the street from the headquarters
recalled a three-hour police raid late in the afternoon of June 28.
He remembered that four Fiat Panda cars carrying plainclothes
policemen arrived, and that the policemen, who carried rifles and
walkie-talkies, took away one Arab foreigner, some computers and
other material. They had also raided a nearby apartment where an
Arab had been living, he said, but the apartment was empty.
</P>
<P>
   CIA analysts suspect that the foundation may be one of many
fronts for the far-flung operations of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
Arabian multi-millionaire and alleged terrorist who is suspected of
organizing the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania from
his base in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Communist Albania officially embraced Islam and became the
only country in Europe to join the Organization of the Islamic
Conference. Islamic charities have built much-needed hospitals and
schools, often in remote villages, under the condition that they
also build mosques. Western intelligence officials believe that
some of those organizations also provided cover for Islamic
terrorists. The intelligence officials are especially interested in
the Kuwait Joint Relief Committee, which they believe channeled
funds into the Islamic Revival Foundation and other Islamic
activities here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three of the Egyptians arrested here and extradited to Cairo
earlier this summer were believed to be linked to the 1997 massacre
of tourists at Luxor, Egypt, in which 62 people were killed,
Albanian Interior Ministry officials said. Two of the men had been
sentenced to death in Cairo for Islamic Jihad activities, including
a 1993 assassination attempt against former Prime Minister Atef
Sedki.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchy has existed in Albania since March 1997, when a wildly
popular financial pyramid scheme collapsed. The collapse forced
much of the population into bankruptcy, and the government
collapsed during the ensuing unrest. The army could not control
widespread looting, including the looting of its own weapons
depots.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry concedes that several provinces in the
mountainous north of the country are outside the sway of the
government and that the only customs control _ and even that is
tenuous _ is at the airport near here. Otherwise, government
officials concede, the borders are wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, a Western diplomat said, Albania has seen a
striking rise in organized crime and become a center for the
smuggling of immigrants from Kurdistan, Pakistan, China, the
Philippines and other impoverished countries. The immigrants gain
easy entry to Albania and then seek passage to Italy on ferries or
small boats. &QL;

WORLD EVENTS CATCH UP WITH MARKETS; DOW DROPS .9% IN VALUE

<P>
   Investors responding to a chain reaction of plunging world
markets forced the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 280
points Friday before it rebounded and ended with a modest loss.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering most of what was lost during hectic trading, the Dow
Jones industrial average, a basket of 30 of the country's premier
stocks, closed at 8533.65, down 77.76 points, or 0.9 percent.
Broader indexes, including the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq
Composite, took similiar roller coaster rides.
</P>
<P>
   US investors were reacting to a day of chaos in stock and
currency markets in emerging markets around the world, analysts
said, amid nervousness that a long-running bull market in this
country may be near its end.
</P>
<P>
   Russian stocks slid for a fifth day, with the main RTS-1 index
tumbling 6.9 percent. European markets responded with sharp
declines _ Germany's DAX stock index was down 5.4 percent, while
Britain's FTSE 100 lost 3.4 percent. The emerging markets panic
spread to Latin America where concerns about Venezuela's currency
caused markets there to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic comeback in the US market Friday afternoon was read
as an indication of investors' faith in this country's stability as
the full force of a widening global economic and banking crises hit
elsewhere. The Dow index has fallen 8.6 percent from its July peak
_ shy of a ``correction,'' or 10 percent decline _ but remains up
7.91 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of political instability in the world,''
said Jack Smiley, vice president of Easton Vance Management in
Boston. ``The US market still offers a great deal of good valuation
but we haven't had a correction like this in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The US bond market benefited most as investors fled unstable
currencies and scurried to put their money in US dollars: The yield
on 30-year Treasury bonds hit a series of record lows before
settling at 5.38 percent, the lowest rate since the government
began regularly selling the securities in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are ``flying to our bond market which is safety with a
capital `S,''' said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Thomson
Global Markets, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide panic was triggered by the panic inside Russia,
where the government Friday called for speedy passage of measures
needed to avert a collapse of the entire financial system. That
came a day after the government agreed to guarantee private bank
accounts. Day after day of bad news caused a 14 percent slide this
week in the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deep problems have been heaped on top of financial
system collapses and economic contractions across Asia over the
past year and concern about the stability of China's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in western Europe, which are closely tied to
Russia, also fell sharply and gave up a portion of the large gains
they have earned since January.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's market was hard hit because its banks are major
lenders to Russian enterprises. Investors jittery about extensive
ties to Latin America, an emerging market that is showing signs of
weakness, drove Spain's market down by 5.8 percent. Austria's
market fell by 4.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to focus just on Russia or Asia or Japan,''
said Peter Sullivan, European equity strategist for Goldman Sachs
International in London. ``The markets that are down the most in
Europe are those that are most exposed to emerging market shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets in South America also weakened Friday amid
speculation that Venezuela's currency is under severe pressure and
may be the next currency to be devalued. Venezuela said Friday it
would allow the bolivar currency to fluctuate more freely and
introduced a bill to speed reforms aimed at boosting confidence in
the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's stock market was the world's worst performer Friday,
losing 8.4 percent. Argentina's stock market lost 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a global currency crisis afoot,'' said Mark Madden,
emerging markets manager for Pioneer. ``Venezuela may be on the
verge of devaluing its currency.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Bolsa index fell by 2.4 percent and Brazil's stock
market was down 2.8 percent, after collapsing by 10 percent earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything particularly positive at the moment that
can offset a series of negatives,'' said Tim Thomas, head of global
equity team for Guinness Flight Investment Mangement Ltd. in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cumulatively there are a lot of things investors don't like,''
Thomas said.

BANKBOSTON TO IMPOSE $1 ATM FEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston Corp. said Friday it would soon charge a $1
``convenience fee'' for people who use its automated teller
machines but are not customers of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes just one week after rival Fleet Financial Group
Inc. said it would charge noncustomers 75 cents each time they used
a Fleet ATM. BankBoston's fee is set to go into effect at its ATMs
in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island over the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts attorney general's office, which criticized
Fleet's decision, also decried BankBoston's plan as
``anti-consumer'' and ``anti-competitive.'' It had supported a bill
to ban so-called ATM surcharges that died in the Legislature last
month.
</P>
<P>
   According to BankBoston, customers of the region's
second-largest bank presently subsidize the use of ATMs by
noncustomers. About 25 percent of the 140 million transactions at
BankBoston's ATM network last year were from noncustomers, and
those transactions cost 50 cents to a dollar each for BankBoston to
process, said bank spokesman Bruce Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   An ATM ``convenience'' fee would force noncustomers to pay their
fair share, and most of the revenues generated would be used to
reduce banking fees paid by BankBoston's customers in
Massachusetts, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Anthony, chief of the public protection bureau at
the AG's office, took a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ATM surcharge,'' she said of the fee. ``Calling it
by a different name is just a gloss. It doesn't change the fact
that this is a double charge to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the surcharge, many noncustomers using Fleet or
BankBoston ATMs will continue to pay a transaction fee to their own
banks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With BankBoston and Fleet, &UR;  &LR; the region's largest bank,
operating about 60 percent of the ATM machines in the commonwealth,
the imposition of an ATM surcharge is likely to induce customers at
small banks to move their accounts to large banks, said Dale
Zelony, director of legislative services at the Community Bank
League of New England, a group that represents small banks.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the surcharge becomes ``a predatory pricing
practice'' against small banks by encouraging customers to switch
their accounts to large banks to avoid the surcharge, said Zelony,
who contends that processing a noncustomer ATM transaction costs a
bank about 27 cents, not the 50 cents to a dollar that BankBoston
claims.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spitzer, large banks in some other states have been
imposing ATM charges on noncustomers for about a decade and there
has been no evidence of ``huge migrations of customers'' from small
banks to large banks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Zelony's group has tried unsuccessfully to persuade
the Massachusetts Legislature to ban ATM surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony said the attorney general's office may ask the
Legislature to revisit the issue of a ban on ATM surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the attorney general's office will monitor the
marketplace to see what effect the ATM surcharges have on consumers
and smaller banks, she said.

RESTRUCTURING OF JAPANESE BANK SIGNALS LIKELY MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, which has come to
symbolize the problems of Japan's banking system and the
government's slowness in addressing them, Friday night announced a
restructuring that paves the way for an injection of public funds
and increases the likelihood of an eventual merger with Sumitomo
Trust &AMP; Banking Co.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring was a clear sign that the government was
hoping to steer the battered Japanese financial system to a
``soft'' landing, rather than the swift overhaul many foreign
investors long for.
</P>
<P>
   Its gradualist approach to one of the worst banking crises the
world has seen, however, may be challenged by those investors, who
have already harshly punished Japan's banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is to have any credibility, the Japanese government must
demonstrate that it is going to allow the market to determine final
outcomes, and if those outcomes suggest losses, it can manage
then,'' said Alicia Ogawa, head of research at Salomon Smith Barney
in Tokyo. ``But what they seem to be demonstrating is that they are
trying to build a wall around the market, and that is just not
going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the government did little to conceal its role in the
rescue effort. On Thursday night, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi met
with Atsushi Takahashi, president of Sumitomo Trust, in his
official residence, where the banker was wooed not only by the
nation's leader but also by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Bill Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
summoning a bank executive to the Oval Office for a late-night
`chat' about his intentions and their opinion of them,'' snapped
one bank analyst, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, however, Takahashi appeared to be keeping his
options open, issuing a brief statement that said little other than
that Sumitomo Trust would study the restructuring plan and continue
pursuing ``highly transparent due diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Obuchi, Miyazawa and numerous other
government officials promised an announcement from Long Term Credit
and revealed the government's intention to shore it up with an
infusion of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The government started laying the groundwork for a taxpayer
rescue of Long Term Credit earlier this week, when Miyazawa and
other officials testified in Parliament that to allow any of
Japan's 19 largest banks to go under would be courting worldwide
financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   They made the statements even though the government had
previously pledged to protect international creditors who in good
faith signed swap agreements and other contracts that keep the
global financial system liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Critics described the rescue operation as too little, too late.
``If they have no plan to strengthen profitability, then anything
else is just a stop-gap measure,'' Ms. Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Stop-gap or not, Friday's announcement called into question the
government's ballyhooed ``bridge bank'' plan _ currently under
discussion in Parliament _ for resolving the problems of failed
banks while keeping credit lines open to worthy lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restructuring proposal, Long Term Credit intends to
write off 750 billion yen ($5.2 billion) in bad debts in exchange
for government assistance. These will include some 520 billion yen
in loans to three of its most beleaguered nonbank affiliates, Japan
Leasing Corp., Japan Landic Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development
Corp. Japan Leasing, which has some 1.9 trillion yen in bad debt,
according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's business daily, will
be ordered to stop financing businesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dozens of other affiliates to which the bank has transferred
portions of its nonperforming loans in an effort to clean up its
own balance sheet will be liquidated, and its president, Katsunobu
Onogi, and two other senior executives will resign to take
responsibility for the bank's straits. A planned reduction of 700
jobs will be accelerated, and managers and others will see their
pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ministry of Finance was coy Friday night about the
extent of the government's assistance to Long Term Credit, earlier
in the day officials said the restructuring will pave the way for
the government's Deposit Insurance Corp. to provide assistance to
the tune of as much as 800 billion yen. Analysts, noting that the
government often provides tax breaks and other sleights of hand
designed to avoid provoking a public outcry, said the actual cost
of the financial cleanup could go much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan is also expected to keep the struggling bank
afloat with uncollateralized loans to support its day-to-day
funding operations in the event that other Japanese and foreign
banks move to limit their exposure. Long Term Credit has been
relying on the interbank lending market less and less, and analysts
believe it has had little or no access to credit lately, although
the bank claims its borrowing patterns have been normal.
</P>
<P>
   Long Term Credit will withdraw from overseas operations, which
will be assumed by Sumitomo Trust, and try to sell its office
building in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, analysts say, may only begin to repair the hole in
the bank's balance sheet caused by bad loans. The bank has
officially put the amount of bad loans against which it does not
have reserves at 690 billion yen, but most analysts agree the true
figure is at least 985 billion yen _ not counting bad loans held by
its nonbank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will extinguish 520 billion yen worth of loan
credits to the three nonbank affiliates, which owe the bank a total
of 2.84 trillion yen. In other words, Long Term Credit will be
writing off just 20 percent of its own bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   That means Sumitomo Trust may be forced to swallow at least 755
billion yen in bad or potentially bad loans, which it has said it
will not do.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo Trust has gone so far as to hire Arthur Andersen to
audit Long Term Credit, an obvious sign it does not trust the audit
being conducted by the new Financial Supervisory Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi has said repeatedly that his bank will not assume any
bad loans in the merger, and, indeed, it can ill afford to. It has
its own debt problems, and its two biggest businesses, pensions and
lending to large corporations, are going elsewhere. And that bodes
ill for the proposed merger, some analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sumitomo Trust and LTCB together is a disaster waiting to
happen,'' said James McGinnis, senior banking analyst at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   While McGinnis and some other bank analysts have no objections
to merging the good operations of bad banks into stronger banks, he
contends that the government lacks the credibility to force such
combinations without insuring acquiring banks against nasty
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, the Japanese government needs to issue a return
policy to acquiring institutions if this kind of thing is to work
at all,'' he said.

WHERE ARE THE DOUBTERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox' season ends five weeks from Sunday. Thirty-seven
games remain. The Sox are 23 games over .500, own the second-best
record in the American League, and have a whopping seven-game lead
over the Orioles for the AL's fourth and final (wild-card) playoff
slot.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the panic? Why aren't we hearing the usual ``sky is
falling'' stuff from citizens of Red Sox Nation and those who cover
the Towne Team? Where are those Calvinist clouds of doubt that are
supposed to swirl around the Fenway light towers this time of year?
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows I've tried to inspire some fear in the fandom. I even
spent this week talking to some ghosts of the past to see if they
can throw a scare into the Red Sox machine.
</P>
<P>
   Former Oriole manager Earl Weaver, recently hospitalized with a
mild heart attack, was back at his Florida home this week and said,
``Are the Red Sox gonna blow it again? I see where the Orioles have
been gaining on 'em. A game a week for six weeks wouldn't be too
much. That's how we always did it.''
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Earl that it's not like that here anymore. It's
not like the 1970s and '80s, when Weaver would come to town, his
Orioles trailing by seven games, and announce, ``We've crawled out
of more coffins than Bela Lugosi. If we win the rest of our games,
the Red Sox have to play .600 ball to stay ahead of us. Know how
hard that is?''
</P>
<P>
   It was irrational _ how were the Orioles supposed to win all
their games? _ but Boston fell for it. In those days, Sox fans were
too often burned by Boston teams that folded in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Mr. Russell Earl ``Bucky'' Dent. Twenty years
after he drove a pipe through the heart of the Red Sox, Dent is a
bench coach for the Texas Rangers. He was in town this week and
said, ``I start getting asked about the home run just about this
time of year whenever the Red Sox are trying to make a run at
winning the division or getting in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if Boston wins the wild card, we might play them in the
playoffs. And there I am again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't that be a sight? If the Sox play Texas, Dent would be
in the visitors' dugout on Friday, Oct. 2, for Game 3 at Fenway
Park _ the 20th anniversary of his shot-heard-round-New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the people from my time will get over it,'' he
said. ``Some of the younger kids that don't know what that game
was, eventually, they'll forget about it. But the people that saw
the game or were here or part of it, I don't think they'll get over
it until they actually win a World Series, and then they can get
rid of the old memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I travel around in the Boston area, there isn't a day
that goes by when I don't have somebody come up to me and tell me I
broke their heart 20 years ago. Everybody kind of remembers that
game and that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent knows the New England mind. In the offseason, he does
public relations work for an Auburn, Mass. company. It brings him
to Greater Boston several times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a couple of years ago, I came up here to play some
golf with some customers at Cape Cod,'' he said. ``There was a bar
out there, and the bartender was a diehard Red Sox fan, and after
the golf game, they told me, `You've got to come over and see this
guy. We're going to bring you in there, sit you down, and see if
this guy recognizes you.' It was the year of the strike, and he was
such a big fan, he had all the baseball hats in his bar covered up
because of the strike. So I walked in and sat down, and he looked
at me and his face kind of dropped. I said, `Hi, I'm Bucky Dent,'
and he said, `I know who you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   We all know who he is. Like Mookie Wilson, Dent is a reminder of
something that went horribly wrong here. Standing in a noisy bar
across the street from Fenway after the Sox' doubleheader sweep of
the Rangers Tuesday, I saw Fox television footage of Dent's homer,
then Wilson's grounder. Back-to-back nightmares. It was too loud to
hear the audio. None was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Ken Burns recounted his Mookie story:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a function with Bob Costas, and Mookie Wilson was
there and I didn't know what to say to him. Finally, I walked up
and blurted out, `My therapist said it's important that I speak to
you.' Mookie looks at me and says, `Red Sox fan, huh?'''
</P>
<P>
   It is the legacy of Sox fans. Weaver, Dent, and Wilson still
haunt the Boston ballyard. But this year feels different. The Red
Sox are not winning games by pounding people with three-run homers.
The Sox are winning with pitching, defense, smart baseball, and
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   If/when the Sox get to the playoffs, we will have to remind you
that Boston has lost 13 consecutive postseason games _ a major
league record. The Sox have not won since Bill Buckner booted
Mookie's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1998 Red Sox don't remind us of those teams that choked.
They've withstood every challenge. And they look like a dangerous
team in any short series. Maybe this explains the curious absence
of panic around here.

U.S. DENIES VISA TO IRISH WOMAN LINKED TO TERROR GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The U.S. Embassy said here Friday that the
State Department has denied a visa request from a prominent
Catholic republican leader who is widely believed to have contacts
with the Real IRA, the terrorist group that killed 28 people in a
car bomb attack in Omagh, Northern Ireland, last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   An embassy official said that Bernadette Sands McKevitt's
application, received last week, was rejected because of her
``terrorist activities.'' The embassy did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Irish and British officials say the U.S. refusal was another
serious setback for the group, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee.
The Committee opposes the new Ireland peace accord and the
participation in the new Northern Ireland Assembly of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. The Committee and
the Real IRA left the IRA after it called a cease-fire in July 1997
that led to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKevitt and her partner, Michael, a former IRA bomb expert,
are leaders of the Committee, which wants the six counties of
Northern Ireland to join the 26-county Irish Republic. They have
been linked publicly by both the Irish and British governments to
the Real IRA, the small paramilitary group that admitted the Omagh
bomb attack, the deadliest in 29 years of sectarian violence in the
mostly Protestant British province of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McKevitt did not apply for a visa. But three other members
of the Committee who did are unlikely to get them. One of the trio,
Francie Mackey, a councilor in Omagh, complained of police
harassment Monday when his son, Shane, was arrested for questioning
on the bomb attack. The younger Mackey was released Thursday; two
men are still being held.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the group's intended visit was to seek funds and
support from radical Irish Americans who, like the Committee,
oppose the new peace agreement, and support, tacitly or openly, the
continuation of Ulster violence that has killed more than 3,200
people since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, Ms. McKevitt said she and Michael had
not been involved in the Omagh attack, which she condemned. But, on
Irish national television, she refused to condemn all political
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKevitt's brother, Bobby Sands, became an IRA hero and
martyr in 1981 when, as a British prisoner, he starved himself to
death.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the McKevitts have been harried in their
hometown, near Dundalk, not far from the border with the North.
Dozens of neighbors held a vigil demanding that they leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, security guards prevented Ms. McKevitt from
entering the shop she runs in a Dundalk shopping center. Her
lawyers said she was considering taking legal action against news
organizations that spread ``false and defamatory'' stories about
her and Mr. McKevitt. Two London newspapers, The Express and The
Daily Telegraph, this week identified Mr. McKevitt as the leader of
the Real IRA and published his photograph on their front pages.

HEARST-ARGYLE ACQUIRES CALIFORNIA STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst-Argyle Television Inc. announced Friday that
it agreed to acquire a KCRA-TV in California's Central Valley from
Kelly Broadcasting Co., and a management .MDSU/.MDNM/interest in
KQCA-TV in a deal valued at $520 million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to
close early next year.
</P>
<P>
   KCRA, an NBC affiliate, and KQCA, an affiliate of the WB
network, serve the Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto market. Under a
time-brokerage agreement with KQCA, the station would remain under
separate ownership but Hearst-Argyle would provide programming and
management operations for the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are especially pleased to announce this particular
transaction,'' said Bob Marbut, chairman and co-chief executive of
Hearst-Argyle. ``Kelly's Sacramento TV operations constitute a
unique opportunity for Hearst-Argyle Television, similar in quality
and strategic benefit to the Pulitzer TV stations that we recently
announced plans to acquire.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle owns or manages 15 network-affiliated stations and
manages two radio station. If approved, the acquisition of the
Kelly and the Pulitzer properties would bring to 26 television and
seven radio stations owned by New York-based Hearst-Argyle.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate transaction, Hearst-Argyle announced an agreement
in principle to acquire Kelly News &AMP; Entertainment, a production
and syndication company, for $10 million. Kelly News &AMP;
Entertainment is the syndicator of ``Rebecca's Garden'' and
``Living Better with Carrie Wiatt,'' two lifestyle programs
produced by Hearst-Argyle Television Productions.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operations would give Hearst-Argyle four stations
in the top 20 television markets and seven in the top 30, said John
G. Conomikes, president and co-chief executive of the company. The
company's television stations will cover 20 states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions will bring Hearst-Argyle's reach to at least
17.6 percent of U.S. television households and will make the
company one of the two largest independent television station
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, KCRA and the KQCA time-brokerage agreement produced
net revenue of more than $65 million. Hearst-Argyle anticipates
1998 net revenue for the stations to increase by about 9 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The television market served by the two stations in California's
Central Valley is the 20th largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The total consideration for the two stations, which at closing
will include $11 million in working capital, is $520 million.

 &HT;    Citadel president cracked down on hazing, stresses leadership
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ After enduring the grueling freshman year as
a ``knob'' on a campus still grappling with the arrival of women,
Mandy Garcia returns to The Citadel with hard-earned advice for the
new crop of females arriving today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you try to be 50 percent better than everyone else
just so you can fit in the middle,'' Garcia said. ``You always want
to make sure you look 10 times better so you can look average.''
</P>
<P>
   Such advice applies as well to male cadets who learned early
that upperclassmen looking to discipline or even harass knobs prey
on those who stick out in the grayish ranks. But for the rising,
though still small number of women at the formerly all-male,
state-supported military college, Garcia's formula has special
implications for coping at The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 580 freshmen are scheduled to arrive for a weekend of
academic orientation, followed by a week of rigorous drill before
upperclassmen return.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, we still stand out,'' said Garcia, one of
the 50 or so women expected to join the approximately 1,700 men on
campus. ``They call it the long gray line, and we want to fit right
in the gray, in the middle, as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy differs markedly from August 1995 when trailblazer
Shannon Faulkner stormed The Citadel in the national spotlight. She
arrived on the fortress-like campus after school officials dropped
their contentious, highly publicized court fight to preserve the
corps of cadets' 150-year-old tradition of males only.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted, poorly conditioned Faulkner faltered just hours
into the first day of ``Hell Week.'' The contrasting images of
Faulkner standing alone against a barrack's wall and upperclassmen
rowdily celebrating her departure portrayed an institution clinging
to the past, despite its decision to admit females.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes have changed among many cadets, alumni and
administrators, spurred by the hiring of former U.S. Marine Corps
Gen. John Grinalds as The Citadel's president. Now in his second
school year, he has cracked down on hazing, eliminated ``Hell
Week'' for knobs, and stressed leadership development among
upperclassmen, who in years past had ruled partly by hazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the philsophy and the procedures in place,'' Grinalds
said. ``The challenge this year is to live through the
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Still hanging over The Citadel is a lawsuit by Jeanie Mentavlos,
one of two women who quit in December 1996 claiming she was hazed
and harassed. The other, Kim Messer, settled her suit in state
court for $33,750, while Mentavlos' suit, which seeks $4 million in
damages, is proceeding in federal court. A trial is possible as
early as January.
</P>
<P>
   Mentavlos and Messer enrolled in August 1996 with two other
women, Nancy Mace and Petra Lovetinska. They did not complain of
abuse and have both excelled, with Mace, who arrived with college
credits, expecting to graduate in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mace will be the first woman to earn The Citadel's ring,
presented to seniors in a history-laced ceremony scheduled for Oct.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a 19-year-old cross-country runner from Fayetteville,
N.C., also earned a spot in history as The Citadel's first female
scholarship athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was one of 20 female freshmen who enrolled a year ago.
Three resigned during the year, including one who was involved in
an incident that administrators described as sexual misconduct with
a male upperclassman, who also quit.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said another four of her female classmates do not plan to
return this year. One of them was Garcia's roommate, who told
Garcia last spring, ``I don't want to do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight fell on Garcia last year as The Citadel's
one-woman cross-country team. Despite favorable national publicity,
she said she felt ``lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating to me,'' said Garcia, who said her male
teammates tried their best to include her in activities when they
took road trips.
</P>
<P>
   On race days, the men competed first, then the women. The
Citadel's runners would fan out along the race course, cheering
Garcia on, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But before and after the meets, Garcia said she missed the
camaraderie that her teammates enjoyed in their locker room.
</P>
<P>
   At the Citadel, Garcia had 36 lockers all to herself. To fill up
the loneliness, she got in the habit of putting her shoes, clothes,
towels and other belongings in several of them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she'll have a half-dozen female teammates. The school
is also sponsoring a new women's volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   As happy as Garcia is to have the camaraderie, she said she's
already treating her freshmen teammates tougher than she treats the
male freshmen who arrived early on athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself doing that,'' she said, ``because I want them to
be good so people won't be able to say, `See, you shouldn't be
here.'''

 &HT;    VOW OF ``OFFENSE'' AGAINST TERRORISTS SUGGESTS MAJOR POLICY
SHIFT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. government officials hinted at a major shift
in American policy on terrorism Friday with a vow to go on the
``offense'' with a ``sustained'' global war against terrorists,
striking them down before they can act.
</P>
<P>
   But experts outside the government cautioned that any such
effort must include more than military strikes. It must be
accompanied by diplomatic steps and legal actions to expose
terrorists as murderers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The hint of a major policy shift came from National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger as he briefed reporters at the White House on
the result of Thursday's U.S. missile strikes at suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly going to do everything we can to defend
ourselves, but we're also going to be on offense as well as on
defense,'' Berger declared. However, in response to subsequent
questions, he declined to elaborate on the opening salvos of a new
war against global terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do what we think is prudent and wise and deliberate
and necessary in each context,'' he said in a brief reply to a
question about policy. ``Each situation is different.''
</P>
<P>
   But his use of the word ``offense'' immediately raised eyebrows
among terrorism experts, many of whom viewed Berger's comments as
marking a new phase in U.S. efforts to wipe out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of that word being used in the past,'' said Lee
Colwell, the former associate director of the FBI who served as
vice president of the White House Task Force on Terrorism during
the Reagan presidency. ``It certainly sounds like the policy is
being redefined or clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also fueled such
speculation with comments to reporters on Capitol Hill following a
briefing for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to understand now that ... the terrorist threat
is a longer-term one, and it's a global one,'' she said. ``And we
will maintain, along with other civilized countries in the world, a
sustained effort to deal with what is an increasing terrorist
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Anderson, an international terrorism expert at Idaho State
University, said Berger's comments suggested the United States is
adopting the Israeli model of ``preemptive counterterrorism'' _
trying to stop terrorists before they act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears we are moving beyond an eye for an eye,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Perlstein, co-author of a 1991 book, ``Perspectives on
Terrorism,'' agreed, but added that, to be successful, any
counterrorism effort must also strive to strip terrorist leaders of
any political legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it won't just be jump in, kill and leave,'' he
said. ``It might be that we go in with a small surgical team, bring
(terrorist leaders) out and arrest them and brand them before the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlstein questioned whether an escalating war on terrorists
could be sustained by the United States without damaging diplomatic
relations with the countries where the terrorists are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diplomatic question becomes: what right do we have to
enter the sovereign territory of another nation when war has not
been declared?'' he said. ``But, of course, the Israelis have done
it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Colwell, ``A government has a right to protect
itself, its property and its citizens without regard to political
boundaries.''

   NEW YORK _ For all the Sturm und Drang endured by stock market
investors in recent months, equities have remained the favored
vehicle. In the race for returns, however, bonds are the hands-down
winners.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 months, a 30-year Treasury bond has produced a
total return of 15.4 percent; the Dow industrials are up 9.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of United States Treasuries rocketed last week as
investors fled troubled overseas markets for them _ the most stable
securities in the world. On Friday heavy buying pushed the yield on
the 30-year bond down 1.4 percent, to 5.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent move up in bond prices, many investors wonder
whether it's time to sell and lock in their gains. After all, no
less an investment guru than Warren E. Buffett recently dumped his
holdings in zero-coupon bonds, a position he had amassed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although bonds may retrace some of their steps when world
markets settle down, their long-term prospects remain excellent,
said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Clough has been a bond bull since 1996 _ one year too early, he
acknowledges. But now, the scenario that he mapped out two years
ago, when he suggested that investors put more of their money in
bonds than stocks, seems to be unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonds will outperform stocks this year and also in 1999,''
Clough said. ``That may be because stocks provide very little
return. Our anticipation is that they trade sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Why will stocks be lackluster as bonds shine? In Clough's view,
it all derives from an expected slowdown in the American economy,
caused by a falloff in capital expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has made the economy so strong has been a boom in
corporate investments,'' he said. ``But that has put a lot of
capacity out there, which is reducing prices.'' As a result, cash
flow after capital expenditures is starting to decline at many
corporations, a sign that we may be near the top of the investment
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   How low could bond yields go? Try 5 percent on the 30-year bond
by year-end, which would give a total return of around 14 percent
for the year, based on recent prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yields could drop even further with a recession _ a distinct
possibility in 1999, in Clough's view. The long bond yield could
fall to 4 percent, bringing returns of nearly 30 percent to someone
buying bonds today.
</P>
<P>
   Gemma Wright, strategist at Fimat USA Inc., a broker-dealer in
New York that specializes in futures and derivatives, concurs that
bonds are a buy, but cites another reason.
</P>
<P>
   She sees more investor dollars chasing fewer Treasury issues. At
the end of August, for example, a five-year Treasury note with
$12.4 billion in face value is maturing, with no five-year issue to
replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the reissuance of a maturing two-year note will raise
$4.5 billion less than the issue it is replacing. That's almost $17
billion looking for a home in just those two issues in just two
weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Treasuries, meanwhile, will come from portfolio
managers investing in mortgage-backed securities. These folks are
lagging behind their benchmarks and will buy Treasuries to make
their bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply side is smaller yet demand will be big,'' Ms.
Wright said. ``For people concerned about global fragility, there's
only one place to be: U.S. Treasuries.'' &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. AIR STRIKES MOVES WAR ON TERROR INTO 'ANOTHER ERA'
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-POLICY-0822.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans braced for possible repercussions for
missile strikes aimed at a suspected terrorist regime in
Afghanistan and Sudan, a question tugged at defense experts: Will
such shows of military might prevent future attacks?
</P>
<P>
   As former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn sees it, the $100-million attack
on key operations of Osama Bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi who has
declared war on Americans, was well worth the price. Nunn, who
served on the Senate Armed Services Committee for most of his 24
years in Congress, is no stranger to the fall-out that will likely
come from the U.S. strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly and unmistakably, we are telling them that they aren't
going to be permitted to do this and get away with it,'' Nunn said
in an interview with the Cox News Service. ``It won't keep it from
happening again, but . . . it sends a signal that it (the regime of
bin Laden) won't be a safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States claimed that its cruise missile strikes
flattened a chemical weapons plant in Sudan, but Pentagon officials
remained uncertain about how much damage was inflicted in
Afghanistan where the target was a suspected meeting of terrorist
leaders organized by Bin Laden. President Clinton ordered
Thursday's missile strikes as an act of retribution for attacks on
U.S. Embassies in East Africa earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a meeting Friday with congressional leaders on
Capitol Hill, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters
that more is yet to come. ``This is unfortunately the war of the
future and we have to understand the importance of sustained
operations here,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   So if, as Nunn and other defense experts said Friday, America is
engaging in ``a long-term struggle'' against terrorist attacks, how
best can it protect itself?
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the nation should be firmly on how to bolster the
nation's intelligence-gathering operations, according to Nunn and
other experts. Without solid intelligence networks, President
Clinton would not have had knowledge that Bin Laden was convening a
group of terrorist leaders at his camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   And that means accepting that the CIA is going to have to have
to hire individuals of a nefarious ilk to penetrate the
organizations of terrorists such as Bin Laden, someone who has
called himself the president of a ``terrorist university.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation wants us to stop this, but . . . when the CIA gets
involved . . . and the operation goes wrong, they are criticized,''
Nunn said. ``We have this notion that we can get good intelligence
by penetrating the good guy organizations, the Boy Scouts. But we
have to penetrate the bad guy organizations and we have to be
willing to make some mistakes to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to prevent terrorist attacks from Bin Laden in the
future is ``a bullet in the head,'' said Dr. Neil C. Livingstone,
who has urged Congress to combat terrorists with military might.
</P>
<P>
   As Livingstone sees it, this is a case where ``might does make
right'' because it is the only language that terrorists seem to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   How effective the American strikes were in stopping Bin Laden
depends on how aggressive the Clinton Administration is in
continuing to attack him and his organization, Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to cripple them. You have to kill them. If you
declare war, you have to win unconditionally,'' Livingstone said.
``It's like running up to a bear with a sharp stick and jabbing it
a few times. If this is part of a series of attacks, it will be
effective. But if we give him time to lick his wounds, these will
be seen as ill-conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that merely creating an ``eye for an eye'' situation,
a situation that gives cause for more violence to break out in a
volatile region of the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``In that region of the world it goes far beyond an eye for an
eye,'' Nunn said. ``It goes to two eyes for an eye or an eye for a
finger. ``
</P>
<P>
   Nunn predicted that future attacks are going to be even more
sporadic and unpredictable than the bombings of the U.S. embassies
in the relatively peaceful countries of Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should believe that this is a conclusive act and that
there will be a quick resolution to this,'' Nunn said. ``We are in
another era now.''

LEONARD BERNSTEIN CHANGED THE WORLD IN HIS OWN WAY  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Classical music is dead, say pundits and books. And
indeed, it's hard to make a case that it's anything better than
deeply dormant.
</P>
<P>
   I think it went to sleep when Leonard Bernstein died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein had something that made Classical music live for
Americans. Bernstein, who would have been 80 on Saturday (Aug. 22)
and whose birthday has been celebrated this summer in performances
and tributes that included a full-length ballet on his life, had
all the obvious requirements for a musician of stature: talent,
knowledge, ambition, training. Yet his sum was greater than the
total of those parts.
</P>
<P>
   What did Bernstein have that no one else had?
</P>
<P>
   Naivete. An endless supply of it.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Bernstein was so naive he thought music could change the
world. He was so naive he thought all he had to do was explain
Beethoven to people and they'd prefer it to the Everly Brothers. He
was naive enough to write musicals and think they'd last; to
conduct the sprawling symphonies of Mahler, believing they'd enjoy
a long-delayed success in America; to champion American music in
the hope that native symphonists would find a place alongside
Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was right. When he explained, like nobody else
could, what made Beethoven or Stravinsky or Puccini great, people
listened who otherwise couldn't have cared less. His first
recording of Mahler's complete symphonies in the early '60s made
Mahler a household name in American homes. His musicals have not
only lasted; they've cried out for successors. ``West Side Story''
is ubiquitous, ``Candide`` is frequently revived and ``On the
Town,'' age 54, is still like a refreshing slap. The American
symphonies Bernstein fought to get into the repertoire _ scores by
Ives and Copland and Harris and many others _ are now there
ensconced.
</P>
<P>
   Did he change the world through music? Not as much, nor for as
long as he wished, but for a while and for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Without his sense that everything was possible, without the
innocence that came with his self-absorption, none of it would have
happened. People who knew him only for the Young People's Concerts
or recordings might have thought Bernstein the ultimate
sophisticate. Those afflicted with the notion that Classical music
must be ``elitist'' perhaps assumed he was a snob.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the real Bernstein, here's a scene-from-the-life,
one I witnessed personally. It's backstage at Avery Fisher Hall in
New York, 1986, and Bernstein is about to go onstage to conduct his
old orchestra, the New York Philharmonic. Is he immersed in the
music? Does he pace the floor or stare at the walls? No. The
conductor laureate of the New York Philharmonic is instead
effusively making the case for the songs of Irving Berlin to a
janitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there were all those great waltz tunes, he could spin
them out one after the next,'' Bernstein tells the amazed janitor.
And Lenny, as he has asked the janitor to call him, starts to sing:
``Remember the night, the night we met, well I forgot to
re-mem-ber!''
</P>
<P>
   Then the puzzled janitor's new buddy walks onstage and conducts
three American ``thirds'' _ the Symphonies No. 3 of Aaron Copland,
Roy Harris and William Schuman _ like nobody else.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the birthday celebrations this year have been
centered on the East Coast, the rest of us at least have ``The
Bernstein Century,'' a re-issue on Sony compact disc of Bernstein's
early recordings for what was then Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The series of several dozen CDs contains many old friends as
well as fresh surprises. Here is the first release on compact disc
of Bernstein's first recording of Copland's Symphony No. 3, of the
celebrated Mahler Fifth Symphony ``Adagietto'' recorded live at the
funeral of Robert F. Kennedy, of the first (and best) version of
Bernstein's own Symphony No. 3, ``Kaddish.``
</P>
<P>
   Like all performing artists, Bernstein was better at some things
than at others, but to all things he brought an insouciance that
made every score at worst a misadventure, at best an unforgettable
journey of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   From this attractively packaged, expertly remastered and
moderately priced series, Bernstein fans will surely want to choose
the Mahler Symphony No. 2, the ``Resurrection'' (SM2K 63159, with
the aforementioned live performance of the ``Adagietto``) because
it was Bernstein's signature symphony. But don't ignore the
overwhelming sense of visceral power Bernstein brought to Mahler's
Symphony No. 6 (SMK60208), which relates in purely instrumental
terms the inevitability of beauty and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   All truly naive artists are dramatists at heart. For Bernstein
as conductor, this meant he could turn himself into the imagined
protagonist of every score he led; he lived the music as he
conducted it. This thespian knack worked at a high level for
Mahler, which might be described as operatic music without scenery,
plot or characters. It also meant that Bernstein's Beethoven did
not always please purists who wanted a more restrained sound than
Bernstein could manage.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein did not lead the works of his contemporaries out of
duty but out of love. Ives and Copland and Schuman and the rest
were his models, mentors and friends. They made up a musical
community and Bernstein was their greatest advocate. In the CD
``American Masters'' (SMK60594), Bernstein shows what it takes to
make the one-movement essay Roy Harris called his Third Symphony
sing and dance. This performance has a fire that has never been
equaled.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein the composer was frequently at odds with Bernstein the
conductor. They vied for time and recognition, and conducting
usually won. But when composing got the lion's share of his
attention, Bernstein mustered a unique voice that uttered things
from deep in some place where all of us live. In scores like the
three symphonies and the ``Mass,'' he was bold enough to speak like
a child, and childlike enough to talk to God.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's ``Mass'' probably received more media attention than
any other Bernstein score, except the musicals. The reason: It was
composed for the 1972 opening of Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.,
an event weighted with political and sentimental baggage. Listening
to it more than a quarter-century later, it is more cohesive _ or
at least less incoherent _ than it seemed at the time. The opening
half-hour of variations-on-a-theme makes for an arresting suite.
But ``Mass'' was intended to be more than that. It was to be a
statement about the relationship of God to man and man to man, with
a little (or a lot of) contemporary liberal '60s stuff thrown in.
The result overflows in several directions. Ultimately, it's still
a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   The real stunner is an earlier Bernstein score that has yet to
be given its due as a major work of the mid-20th century: Symphony
No. 3, ``Kaddish,'' re-released here in its original, 1964 version,
with the narration supplied by his actress-wife, Felicia
Montealegre. On SMK 60595, it's paired with the ``Chichester
Psalms,'' a brief set of choral-orchestral settings of David's
psalms Bernstein composed in 1966 as a sort of postlude to
``Kaddish. ``Chichester'' is the more popular of the two pieces.
Its gentle, sweet ministrations have become fairly standard fare,
while the poetic, dramatic, world-wrenching and (some would say)
religio-bombastic God-questing of ``Kaddish'' (the name comes from
a Jewish prayer) has not caught on.
</P>
<P>
   It would if people listened to this remarkable recording, filled
with the early, undiluted intensity of Bernstein's intentions,
which was nothing less than the proclamation of a religious vision
in musico-dramatic terms. Here, Bernstein's naivete mated with his
ambition and his talent to produce a moment of genius.
</P>
<P>
   Others might blush to write an epic poem addressing God in which
the usual roles of Creator and Created are blurred, so as to make
each entity both Created and Creator. Not Bernstein. Still others
might not see fit to set the completed poem to massive, surging,
embracingly tender, stormily angry music and place the whole
strange package before a public uninterested in new music and bored
by questions of theology. Not Bernstein. Not someone so innocently
in love with his own mind and soul.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Kaddish'' and ``Chichester,'' Bernstein's composing
talent waned. Maybe the naivete wasn't endless, after all. Seeing
that he couldn't change the world for keeps, did Bernstein stop
trying to change it in the fleeting, temporal world of music?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. These recordings can change the universe for us
anytime we choose. &QL;

 &HT;    VOW OF ``OFFENSE'' AGAINST TERRORISTS SUGGESTS MAJOR POLICY
SHIFT
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-RUSSIA-0822; USSTRIKES-SECURITY-0822;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. government officials hinted at a major shift
in American policy on terrorism Friday with a vow to go on the
``offense'' with a ``sustained'' global war against terrorists,
striking them down before they can act.
</P>
<P>
   But experts outside the government cautioned that any such
effort must include more than military strikes. It must be
accompanied by diplomatic steps and legal actions to expose
terrorists as murderers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The hint of a major policy shift came from National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger as he briefed reporters at the White House on
the result of Thursday's U.S. missile strikes at suspected
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly going to do everything we can to defend
ourselves, but we're also going to be on offense as well as on
defense,'' Berger declared. However, in response to subsequent
questions, he declined to elaborate on the opening salvos of a new
war against global terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do what we think is prudent and wise and deliberate
and necessary in each context,'' he said in a brief reply to a
question about policy. ``Each situation is different.''
</P>
<P>
   But his use of the word ``offense'' immediately raised eyebrows
among terrorism experts, many of whom viewed Berger's comments as
marking a new phase in U.S. efforts to wipe out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of that word being used in the past,'' said Lee
Colwell, the former associate director of the FBI who served as
vice president of the White House Task Force on Terrorism during
the Reagan presidency. ``It certainly sounds like the policy is
being redefined or clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also fueled such
speculation with comments to reporters on Capitol Hill following a
briefing for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to understand now that ... the terrorist threat
is a longer-term one, and it's a global one,'' she said. ``And we
will maintain, along with other civilized countries in the world, a
sustained effort to deal with what is an increasing terrorist
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Anderson, an international terrorism expert at Idaho State
University, said Berger's comments suggested the United States is
adopting the Israeli model of ``preemptive counterterrorism'' _
trying to stop terrorists before they act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears we are moving beyond an eye for an eye,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Perlstein, co-author of a 1991 book, ``Perspectives on
Terrorism,'' agreed, but added that, to be successful, any
counterrorism effort must also strive to strip terrorist leaders of
any political legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it won't just be jump in, kill and leave,'' he
said. ``It might be that we go in with a small surgical team, bring
(terrorist leaders) out and arrest them and brand them before the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlstein questioned whether an escalating war on terrorists
could be sustained by the United States without damaging diplomatic
relations with the countries where the terrorists are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diplomatic question becomes: what right do we have to
enter the sovereign territory of another nation when war has not
been declared?'' he said. ``But, of course, the Israelis have done
it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Colwell, ``A government has a right to protect
itself, its property and its citizens without regard to political
boundaries.''

 &HT;    U.S. AIR STRIKES MOVES WAR ON TERROR INTO 'ANOTHER ERA'
 &HT;    With USSTRIKES-POLICY-0822.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans braced for possible repercussions for
missile strikes aimed at a suspected terrorist regime in
Afghanistan and Sudan, a question tugged at defense experts: Will
such shows of military might prevent future attacks?
</P>
<P>
   As former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn sees it, the $100-million attack
on key operations of Osama Bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi who has
declared war on Americans, was well worth the price. Nunn, who
served on the Senate Armed Services Committee for most of his 24
years in Congress, is no stranger to the fall-out that will likely
come from the U.S. strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly and unmistakably, we are telling them that they aren't
going to be permitted to do this and get away with it,'' Nunn said
in an interview with the Cox News Service. ``It won't keep it from
happening again, but . . . it sends a signal that it (the regime of
bin Laden) won't be a safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States claimed that its cruise missile strikes
flattened a chemical weapons plant in Sudan, but Pentagon officials
remained uncertain about how much damage was inflicted in
Afghanistan where the target was a suspected meeting of terrorist
leaders organized by Bin Laden. President Clinton ordered
Thursday's missile strikes as an act of retribution for attacks on
U.S. Embassies in East Africa earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a meeting Friday with congressional leaders on
Capitol Hill, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters
that more is yet to come. ``This is unfortunately the war of the
future and we have to understand the importance of sustained
operations here,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   So if, as Nunn and other defense experts said Friday, America is
engaging in ``a long-term struggle'' against terrorist attacks, how
best can it protect itself?
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the nation should be firmly on how to bolster the
nation's intelligence-gathering operations, according to Nunn and
other experts. Without solid intelligence networks, President
Clinton would not have had knowledge that Bin Laden was convening a
group of terrorist leaders at his camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   And that means accepting that the CIA is going to have to have
to hire individuals of a nefarious ilk to penetrate the
organizations of terrorists such as Bin Laden, someone who has
called himself the president of a ``terrorist university.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation wants us to stop this, but . . . when the CIA gets
involved . . . and the operation goes wrong, they are criticized,''
Nunn said. ``We have this notion that we can get good intelligence
by penetrating the good guy organizations, the Boy Scouts. But we
have to penetrate the bad guy organizations and we have to be
willing to make some mistakes to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to prevent terrorist attacks from Bin Laden in the
future is ``a bullet in the head,'' said Dr. Neil C. Livingstone,
who has urged Congress to combat terrorists with military might.
</P>
<P>
   As Livingstone sees it, this is a case where ``might does make
right'' because it is the only language that terrorists seem to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   How effective the American strikes were in stopping Bin Laden
depends on how aggressive the Clinton Administration is in
continuing to attack him and his organization, Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to cripple them. You have to kill them. If you
declare war, you have to win unconditionally,'' Livingstone said.
``It's like running up to a bear with a sharp stick and jabbing it
a few times. If this is part of a series of attacks, it will be
effective. But if we give him time to lick his wounds, these will
be seen as ill-conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that merely creating an ``eye for an eye'' situation,
a situation that gives cause for more violence to break out in a
volatile region of the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``In that region of the world it goes far beyond an eye for an
eye,'' Nunn said. ``It goes to two eyes for an eye or an eye for a
finger. ``
</P>
<P>
   Nunn predicted that future attacks are going to be even more
sporadic and unpredictable than the bombings of the U.S. embassies
in the relatively peaceful countries of Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should believe that this is a conclusive act and that
there will be a quick resolution to this,'' Nunn said. ``We are in
another era now.''

SEC BALKS AT THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO PASTOR CHUCK

<P>
   The sums were not huge. No famous people or exotic locales were
involved. But investigators call this a swindle with an unusual
angle: It had God on its side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dream that a CNN reporter finally managed to get an
interview with God,'' Charles Groeschel, the head of the
Association of Individual Ministries, used to tell visitors to his
religious group's Internet Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss a thing that goes on down on earth,'' God tells
the reporter, and then launches into a rousing endorsement of the
fund-raising efforts of Groeschel's group. ``Understand this,'' God
said, ``these people can't be stopped! I have empowered them with
my Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever God's opinion of the group, though, federal
law-enforcement officials have a dimmer view, describing it as one
of the more exploitive frauds in recent memory, one that snared
about 2,000 victims nationwide between 1996 and earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be an unusual mix of an investing pitch and
religious hucksterism a la Jim Bakker, Groeschel used the
Association of Individual Ministries as the centerpiece of a
pyramid scheme that promised copious _ and ultimately nonexistent _
financial returns, according to the U.S. attorney's office in New
York, which has filed criminal charges against Groeschel.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission made similar charges in a
civil case filed against Groeschel and the group.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, responsible for policing securities fraud, was involved
because the group's pitch, in spite of its religious trappings, was
basically a promise of a return _ a hefty one _ for investing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Groeschel, who was arrested last month in North Carolina and
released on bail, has returned to his home in Palm Desert, Calif.,
and is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Nehra, an attorney in Muskegon, Mich., who is
representing Groeschel before the SEC, said he would have no
comment until the criminal charges were resolved. Noell Tin, a
Charlotte, N.C., lawyer, said Groeschel intended to hire him to
contest the criminal charges but had yet to do so and therefore he
declined to comment. Tin said Groeschel declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent testimony before the SEC, Groeschel, known to his
followers as ``Pastor Chuck,'' said his organization was a ``group
of people who are working together, seeking to build the church, a
congregation, a ministry,'' and he expressed a desire to expand the
boundaries of his enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a prejudice against the church in America,'' he told
the SEC ``And we want to establish ourselves internationally
because we have a worldwide mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Groeschel's ``church,'' though, appears to exist only in a small
office in Palm Desert. If it has a worldwide mission _ or, in fact,
any physical trappings beyond that office _ there is no evidence of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Groeschel did attend a seminary, according to the SEC, and for a
time in the '70s _ it could not be determined for how long _ he
served as a Baptist minister in Thermal, Calif. But the group's
ties to organized religion seem to end there.
</P>
<P>
   While the sum that Groeschel and the group are suspected of
stealing _ $1.5 million to $2.5 million _ is paltry compared with
many other noteworthy frauds, the nature of the alleged swindle is
hardly run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   The group is charged with masquerading as a nonprofit church
that persuaded people to become ``associate ministers'' by making
weekly ``donations'' to the organization. The ministers,
investigators say, were instructed in company handbooks to emulate
Jesus Christ and recruit at least 12 ``disciples'' who would also
invest and recruit 12 others, and so on and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers at the top of the chain were to receive a portion of
the money paid by disciples on the rungs below them. Disciples were
told that once they had achieved financial independence from what
the religious group derided as the ``world system,'' they would be
free to help spread the association's message of spiritual and
material salvation.
</P>
<P>
   But only a tiny portion of the money put into the organization
by members was returned to them. The bulk of the money was siphoned
away by Groeschel, with some of it landing in off-shore bank
accounts, according to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic pitch was give and ye shall receive, but I hardly
think that when Jesus told his disciples to follow him and put away
all earthly things, they expected to become millionaires,'' said
Dorothy Heyl, an SEC lawyer in New York. ``Unfortunately, that's
what the AIM investors we spoke to expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Groeschel, 66, is described by former associates and some
purported victims as the very model of a conservative religious
leader: well-groomed and handsome, with neatly trimmed, snow-white
hair and a mellifluous voice.
</P>
<P>
   He was also well armed. When federal agents searched his home in
early July, they confiscated four handguns, hundreds of rounds of
ammunition, and ``approximately six long-barreled guns, including
shotguns, rifles, and one that appeared to be an assault-type
weapon,'' according to a search warrant in California.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior members of the Association of Individual Ministries,
a group of 13 people known as ``elders,'' sounded sympathetic
toward Groeschel but said they did not want to say anything on the
record, adding that their lawyers told them not to talk about the
group or Groeschel. Yet some former group members now have a
distinctly unvarnished opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a thief, a crook, a scum and a scam artist,'' said
Richard Clark, a former elder, who said he left the group after he
became disillusioned with it and Groeschel's methods. ``He has
taken the Bible and the word of God and used them deceitfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who lives in New York, said he and about 60 other members
he recruited invested about $18,000 in the group. Clark said that
about $15,000 of that was his own money and that he ended up
getting only about $600 back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what he did to unsuspecting poor folk and Christian
people,'' Clark continued. ``I was sick and tired of this man using
people.''

</P>
<P>
   Financial shenanigans are not uncharted territory for Groeschel.
In 1993 he was convicted in New Mexico on criminal charges of
running an illegal pyramid scheme at Santa Rosa Sales and
Marketing, which he founded in 1981 in Palm Desert.
</P>
<P>
   It evolved in the late 1980s into a phony marketer of silver
coins and operated in several states, according to court records.
Santa Rosa salespeople were told they could earn large commissions
buying and selling the coins and then reap further rewards by
bringing in new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The coins sold by Groeschel to his sales staff were priced well
above their value to collectors, and thousands of people lost
millions of dollars. Santa Rosa was eventually shut down by state
law-enforcement agencies. In New Mexico, Groeschel was sentenced to
18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a nice guy,'' said James Burroughs, a lawyer
in Albuquerque, N.M., who represented Groeschel in the Santa Rosa
affair. ``He sets out to do something and he gets it done. I didn't
find him to be anything of those things he's always accused of
being.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon Kosmicki, a resident of Grand Island, Neb., who
worked with Groeschel at Santa Rosa in the early 1990s until he
quit after Nebraska officials ordered the company to stop doing
business in that state, had this to say: ``He's as crooked as a
dog's hind leg. He's a real good con artist. You better be
handcuffed to him, because that's the only way you can keep track
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Groeschel, investigators say, picked up where he had left off
soon after he was released from prison in 1994. He had originally
incorporated the Association of Independent Ministries in 1992,
even as he was fighting legal challenges to Santa Rosa, but the
religious group did not begin rounding up disciples until 1996. By
1997 the group was in full flower.
</P>
<P>
   The group told prospective members that 66 percent of the money
it collected would be returned to them, investigators say, and told
some of them that if they recruited five new members, and each
recruit recruited five new members, and so forth until 780 other
members had joined, a weekly ``donation'' of $50 by the original
member would, through a complex formula, produce returns to him or
her of $5,875 a week.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal suits filed against Groeschel, his
group actually redistributed only a small amount of the money and
diverted a large chunk of it into Sage Computer Services. Sage,
which is controlled by Groeschel and his wife, Robyn, purportedly
provided clerical and accounting services for the Association of
Individual Ministries, but also provided a healthy stream of income
to Groeschel.
</P>
<P>
   To buttress the aura of religious zeal surrounding it, and to
appeal to the spiritual sensibilities of those being recruited, the
group regularly cited scripture in its marketing materials. In one
``lesson for sharing'' written by Groeschel, he offered the
following observation:
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person joins AIM, they are simply donating or giving to
the financial support of their brothers and sisters in Christ. They
are also receiving from their brothers and sisters in Christ. We do
this in a manner where we see our giving multiplied. Thus, we
receive more than we give, just as Jesus stated in Luke 6:38.''
</P>
<P>
   Groeschel also made abundant use of the Internet, on a site that
recently ceased to exist, toured the country in recruiting
``jubilees,'' and held conference calls on the telephone that he
christened ``faith healings.'' In a tape-recorded message played
for recruits and cited in the U.S. attorney's case, Groeschel said,
``It tells us in 2nd Corinthians that it is God's will that we
become rich, in order that we might be generous, that God might
receive the praise.''
</P>
<P>
   To expand his membership, Groeschel early last year stopped
promising ``ministers'' that the only path to riches lay in
recruiting new disciples. Instead, Groeschel told the membership, a
new ``growth strategy'' he had put in place would produce returns
of 15 percent a week as long as they ``redonated'' checks they had
already received from the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, AIM had no means to pay such a preposterous return,''
the SEC said in its lawsuit against Groeschel and the group. ``AIM
was not itself engaging in any activity that would generate
returns, as Groeschel has admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, membership has dropped from roughly 2,000 to about
500, and those allegedly duped by Groeschel are licking their
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in Pastor Chuck because he was quoting the
scripture and we were all spiritual people,'' said Franki Brownlee,
a 66-year-old New Yorker who said she lost more than $1,100. ``I
thought I could help others and help myself to be free of the world
system.''

   Even as the Internet has given consumers a powerful tool for
learning what things cost, sizable chunks of American business seem
determined to make price comparisons hard, sometimes frustratingly
so.
</P>
<P>

four-pound supplementary vacuum is so powerful that it can pick up
a 16-pound bowling ball.

   But the prices of these marvels are not divulged: The potential
buyer must mail or phone a request for an ``information kit'' to
learn them.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer may also be frustrated when banks post or orally
quote mortgage rates but refuse to actually make agreements on
these terms until he plunks down cash to ``lock in,'' typically
hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sure discourages comparison-shopping,'' contended Stephen
Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America,
which has mounted a campaign against the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is America Online, which was luring new subscribers
with offers of free time but without specifying the costs at the
end of the trial period. The company agreed this spring to explain
its charges more clearly as part of a broad settlement with 44
state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Except in financial services, there are few laws or regulations
requiring sellers to disclose prices to prospective buyers, whether
the item in question is a house or car _ both usually subject to
negotiation anyway _ a box of cereal or even the product widely
considered to serve as the economy's most visible barometer, a
gallon of gasoline. For the most part, the government just polices
advertising to keep it from being false or misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest gets piqued if it's a way to restrain competition
or if there's consumer deception involved,'' said Willard K. Tom,
deputy director of the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade
Commission. (In a recently settled case over competition issues,
the FTC had contended that a group of farm-equipment dealers in
Kentucky and Indiana had withheld advertisements from an industry
journal after it published ads by other dealers featuring prices
lower than those offered by the group members. The FTC had also
contended that the journal later agreed to stop accepting ads that
included prices.)
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason that consumers are often left to guess at
prices is that manufacturers and retailers know that general
American prosperity has reduced the need for many people to watch
how they spend each nickel and dime.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than that, marketing and advertising
specialists say. Generally speaking, marketers say they are finding
an emphasis on price to be a poor, often self-defeating strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to erode consumer perceptions of product quality, and
also eventually loses impact even with shoppers whose primary
consideration is price. That is because the bargain-hunters wait to
buy only during the inevitable sales.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of buying goods at sale prices ``becomes an
entitlement,'' said Tom Lawson, managing partner at Arnold
Communications, an advertising agency in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, others say, is a desire not to unnecessarily
intensify competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers aren't pushing prices because they don't want to get
into wars,'' said Audrey Guskey, professor of marketing at Duquesne
University in Pittsburgh. And manufacturers see little to gain by
parading before Wall Street their current inability to raise prices
in a minimum-inflation climate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his strategy of deferred price disclosure, David
Oreck, the chief executive of the vacuum cleaner company, said it
was a matter of practicality. ``We have several different models
and there's just so much you can say in an ad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, the specialists suggested, the Oreck strategy is to
concentrate on prospects who are motivated enough to request price
information, at the risk of losing some potential customers who
assume that Oreck cleaners are priced beyond their means. The
products, which Oreck calls ``kind of mid-range,'' average $300 to
$400.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, though, that the rapid proliferation of Internet
technology has complicated marketing strategies. ``A whole new
source has emerged for price information that wasn't there
before,'' said Joseph Plummer, director of brand strategy at
McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers, though, avoid electronic commerce ``for fear that
people would go on the Internet and comparison-shop,'' perhaps
unfairly penalizing goods that should command premium prices, said
Frank Torres, a spokesman for Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to a study by researchers at Pennsylvania State
University's Smeal College of Business, consumer sensitivity to
price ``tends to be lower on line'' than in stores, particularly
when the sales pitch describes a product's other attributes, like
nutritional value of a food product.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, of course, the lack of a price tag is pure snob
appeal, its absence intended to suggest that the product ``is for
the kind of people who don't have to worry about the price,'' said
Diane Cook-Tench, director of the Adcenter at Virginia Commonwealth
University.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as has been said about yachts, if you have to ask what one
costs, you can't afford it.

HEARST-ARGYLE TO ACQUIRE CALIFORNIA STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Deletes extraneous word in lede; changes headline)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst-Argyle Television Inc. announced Friday that
it agreed to acquire KCRA-TV in California's Central Valley from
Kelly Broadcasting Co., and a management .MDSU/.MDNM/interest in
KQCA-TV in a deal valued at $520 million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to
close early next year.
</P>
<P>
   KCRA, an NBC affiliate, and KQCA, an affiliate of the WB
network, serve the Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto market. Under a
time-brokerage agreement with KQCA, the station would remain under
separate ownership but Hearst-Argyle would provide programming and
management operations for the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are especially pleased to announce this particular
transaction,'' said Bob Marbut, chairman and co-chief executive of
Hearst-Argyle. ``Kelly's Sacramento TV operations constitute a
unique opportunity for Hearst-Argyle Television, similar in quality
and strategic benefit to the Pulitzer TV stations that we recently
announced plans to acquire.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle owns or manages 15 network-affiliated stations and
manages two radio station. If approved, the acquisition of the
Kelly and the Pulitzer properties would bring to 26 television and
seven radio stations owned by New York-based Hearst-Argyle.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate transaction, Hearst-Argyle announced an agreement
in principle to acquire Kelly News &AMP; Entertainment, a production
and syndication company, for $10 million. Kelly News &AMP;
Entertainment is the syndicator of ``Rebecca's Garden'' and
``Living Better with Carrie Wiatt,'' two lifestyle programs
produced by Hearst-Argyle Television Productions.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operations would give Hearst-Argyle four stations
in the top 20 television markets and seven in the top 30, said John
G. Conomikes, president and co-chief executive of the company. The
company's television stations will cover 20 states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions will bring Hearst-Argyle's reach to at least
17.6 percent of U.S. television households and will make the
company one of the two largest independent television station
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, KCRA and the KQCA time-brokerage agreement produced
net revenue of more than $65 million. Hearst-Argyle anticipates
1998 net revenue for the stations to increase by about 9 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The television market served by the two stations in California's
Central Valley is the 20th largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The total consideration for the two stations, which at closing
will include $11 million in working capital, is $520 million.

THE SUMMER OF '98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 23, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Televisions flickering fitfully at odd hours; each day's
newspapers gathered in sheaves and quickly scanned; arguments among
old friends ending in bitter words: just three times in the last 50
years have there occurred summers like this one, during which much
of the nation has been gripped by a galvanizing political drama
played out in courthouses and hearing rooms: 1954, 1973, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The turning point that was the Army-McCarthy hearings on the
summer of '54 had one set of economic consequences. Watergate in
the summer of '73 another.
</P>
<P>
   What might be the long-term consequences of the summer of '98?
</P>
<P>
   When Senator Joseph McCarthy rose to power in the early 1950s,
the Cold War was at its height. Under the banner of anticommunism,
using a potent combination of official hearings, press releases,
and leaks, the Republican junior senator from Wisconsin attacked
several of the reigning institutions of US society: the State
Department, the universities, the Protestant clergy, the Army.
</P>
<P>
   As McCarthy browbeat witnesses before his Senate Investigations
Sub-Committee on lengthy televised hearings during the summer of
1954, Boston lawyer Joseph Welch turned on him at a crucial moment
(``Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left
no sense of decency?''), President Eisenhower denounced him, the
Senate formally rebuked him in December, and McCarthy died a broken
man in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual of censure had the effect of establishing a broad
consensus about the limits of acceptable political behavior _ a far
more binding constraint than the growth of the money supply. A long
smooth run in the markets was the result.
</P>
<P>
   When the Watergate scandal slowly unfolded after the election of
1972, the effect was the reverse. Aside from the narrow agreement
on the necessity of President Richard Nixon's resignation, the
affair put a a high chop on the political waters. But in the summer
of 1973, the Senate Select Committee's televised hearings _
presided over by Sam Ervin and Howard Baker _ riveted the nation's
attention and, thanks to the disclosure of the existence of the
secret White House tapes, prepared the way to closure.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate indubitably contributed to the Turn to the Right, a
considerable irony, since Nixon was in many ways the last of the
line of ``big government'' presidents who began with Franklin D.
Roosevelt and the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Yet the new consensus took nearly a decade to form, requiring
strong action by a Democrat (Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker)
and the election as president of another Republican (Ronald Reagan)
to take hold. Betweentimes, the Dow Jones industrial average
floundered.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these previous summertime crises were profoundly
inclusive: They invited in all parties and, for the most part,
bound them together. So far, this one appears to be the opposite.
At least among its commentators, it has been deeply divisive, as if
two sets of persons were reading from two completely different
pages.
</P>
<P>
   (But for the emphasis on legal procedure, you could argue that
the nerve-racking summer of '98 bears more of a resemblance the
street warefare of 1968 than to the stately dramas of those other
years.)
</P>
<P>
   One side sees ``the character issue,'' in the form of
Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, hush money to Webster Hubbell,
the campaign contribution scandals of the reelection year. So
tainted is the president, goes the argument, that he must now
resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The other side sees a special prosecutor who, having failed to
document wrongdoing in five or six or seven matters _ having tried
to resign his commission without issuing a report _ finally has
gone to town when the Monica Lewinsky matter was brought to his
attention. According to this view, Clinton's antagonists are
attempting to win through the special prosecutor what they could
not achieve through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the press is a big player. The Wall Street Journal has
been in full throat since Clinton was first elected in 1992. The
big surprise is The New York Times. As Jack Shafer wrote earlier
this summer in the e-zine Slate (where he is deputy editor), The
New York Times and The Washington Post have mysteriously swapped
identities in the course of the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the Old Gray Lady Persona of the Times, wrote
Shafer, is the deviltry that was the Post's franchise in the
Watergate years, complete with ``barrelhouse editorials demanding
action _ such as the resignation of Janet Reno _ that stir
substance and fanfaronade.'' &UR;  &LR; Now it is the Post that exemplifies
even-handed decorum.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the public is not with the press. Clinton's
favorable ratings rise in defiance of the editorialists' screeds.
Newspersons emerged from Watergate as heroes; in the current
controversy they must share the blame with Clinton, Starr, and all
the others who have contributed to the current mess.
</P>
<P>
   As Russell Baker of the Times wrote the other day, ``Taste-free
journalism makes you wince with shame for what used to be an
honorable calling.... Sensitive people will be content to loathe
them all for what they have done to the country, for how they have
debased our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   What next? These conflicts are usually resolved by a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a tide running that would give the Democrats the 11
seats they would require to control the House after the November
elections? The conventional wisdom is no.
</P>
<P>
   But let Kenneth Starr file his report, let Clinton go on ``60
Minutes'' to demonstrate the contrition that he failed to exhibit
last Monday _ and unpack the anger _ and the situation could
change.
</P>
<P>
   My own hunch is that the campaign waged against Clinton all
these years will lead relatively quickly to the resurrection of the
Democratic Party, just as the campaign against Nixon enabled the
Republicans to reclaim power in just six years.
</P>
<P>
   And a good thing too, for long-term economic growth depends on
broad consensus. Such agreement was formed by the New Deal,
reaffirmed during Dwight Eisenhower's first term in office,
reconfigured along slightly different lines by the election of
Ronald Reagan, and embraced in 1992, albeit reluctantly, by William
Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The instability of markets in the summer of '98 is just the
beginning. Only when Kenneth Starr has joined Joe McCarthy among
the shades of memory, and Clinton taken his place in history along
side Nixon, Harry Truman, and Warren Harding, will America again
see the kind of friendly, practical bipartisanship that is the
necessary framework for solid economic growth.

COMMENTARY: ANGRY, WIRED AND DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton called Osama bin Laden's terrorist group ``a
network not sponsored by any state, but as dangerous as any we
face.'' Nothing better summarizes the most immediate threat to
America today. It is not from another hostile superpower. There is
none _ for the moment. It is from super-empowered individuals,
super-empowered angry men.
</P>
<P>
   The super-empowered angry men have no specific ideological
program or demands. Rather, they are driven by a generalized hatred
of the U.S., Israel and other supposed enemies of Islam. Ramzi
Yousef, mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing, was a
super-empowered angry man. Osama bin Laden is another.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization gives them both the added incentive to hate
America and the added power to do something about it. That is,
globalization is in so many ways Americanization: globalization
wears Mickey Mouse ears, it drinks Pepsi and Coke, eats Big Macs,
does its computing on an IBM laptop with Windows 98. Many societies
around the world can't get enough of it, but others see it as a
fundamental threat.
</P>
<P>
   As historian Ronald Steel has pointed out, Americans think of
themselves as having a conservative society. The Russians and
Chinese were supposed to be the ``revolutionaries.'' But America
today is actually THE most revolutionary society in the world,
notes Steel. For the rest of the world, we are wild, crazy
revolutionaries, with rings in our noses and paint on our toes,
overturning cultures and traditions wherever we go. ``We believe
that our institutions must confine all others to the ash heap of
history,'' says Steel. ``We lead an economic system that has
effectively buried every other form of production and distribution
_ leaving great wealth and sometimes great ruin in its wake. The
cultural messages we transmit through Hollywood and McDonald's go
out across the world to capture and also undermine other societies.
We are the apostles of globalization, the enemies of tradition and
hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The American message particularly tells young people around the
world that we have a better way than their fathers. This is why the
Osama bin Ladens constantly speak of ``American arrogance'' and how
America is ``emasculating'' the Muslims. That's why they just want
to kill America. And globalization, through its rapid spread of
technologies, also super-empowers them to do just that. It makes it
much easier to travel, move money or communicate by satellite
phones or Internet. Ramzi Yousef kept track of all his plots on a
Toshiba laptop. Osama bin Laden was running a multinational JOL,
Jihad Online.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? There is much debate on this question, notes
Middle East expert Stephen Cohen: ``Some argue that what we need to
do is just boycott Iran, condemn Egypt for not treating its
Christians right, bomb Iraq, treat Yasser Arafat as no better than
Hamas, treat the Saudis the same as the Afghans. In other words,
make this a war of civilization and treat the Muslims as the
successors to the communists. But that is not how you deal with
this problem. It is how you make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to making the problem better is by a three-pronged
policy: mercilessly attacking anyone, anywhere, who attacks our
citizens or diplomats, embracing those who would be friends by
constantly trying to build a moderate political center,
particularly in the Muslim-Arab world, and always showing a road
map to a better future for those who waver in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time now, the Clinton team has understood how much
of a powder keg the Middle East was,'' argues Cohen, ``but they
have been reluctant to make the hard decisions to defuse that
powder keg _ by confronting Saddam, recreating a moderate political
center to combat fundamentalism, laying out a pathway for those in
Iran who would like to move out of their isolation and insisting on
progress in the Arab-Israeli peace process as a U.S. national
interest. Hopefully that is now changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Thursday's attack the administration has finally
begun to show some resolve. It also deserves credit for reaching
out to Iranian moderates, even though they have yet to respond.
There are even signs that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
may be moving to accept the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Getting these pieces in place should put the U.S. in a stronger
position to face down the most menacing super-empowered angry man,
the one with a super-demoralized country, Saddam Hussein of Iraq.

   Two years ago, the judges at Paris' Concours Bagatelle classic
car show were considering two finalists: One was an obsidian-black
1937 Alfa Romeo 8C2900 B Corto Spider, owned by John Mozart of San
Francisco, that had won the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Its seats were slathered with glove-soft red cowhide. The other
was also an Alfa Spider, belonging to a Mexican businessman, Arturo
Keller, that flaunted luridly blue two-tone upholstery made from
stingrays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judges sniffed disdainfully at the stingrays. One of them,
Uwe Bahnsen, said, ``We decided that we had never seen blue
stingrays.'' Keller is said to have responded indignantly, ``Well,
I have never seen a red cow!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the technicolor charnel house of exotic automotive
leathers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While cowhide is now seen as a luxury, in the early days of the
automobile it was virtually the only choice for seats. The
unpretentious Ford Model T snuffled off the assembly line with
hide-covered benches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 20s and 30s, custom coach builders availed themselves of
a menagerie of hides, from anteater to zebra, to distinguish their
artworks from assembly-line hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could special-order anything you wanted from coach
builders like Hispano-Suiza or Saoutchik.'' said Ken Nemanic, owner
of Vintage Automotive Upholstery in Walnut Creek, Calif., and the
premier needle-and-thread man in the billion-dollar classic car
restoration industry. ``Saoutchik used all kinds of exotic skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemanic recently added brown alligator skins to the seats of a
1938 Bugatti Type 57 SC with a Corsica body. The Bugatti, owned by
Mozart, won the overall best-in-show award at the Pebble Beach
concours last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you'd be interested in cranberry lizard, burgundy frog
or taupe wildebeest? Practically anything that swims, flies or
crawls can be turned into colorful leather to tart up that
plain-jane Duesenberg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. Many vintage race cars used elephant hide,
which is no longer available. In fact, about a quarter of exotic
skins are poached, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback to these rare skins is their size. ``If you're
talking about frogs,'' said Sid Chavers, a renowned hot-rod
upholsterer, ``you need a whole bunch of them.'' &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   The increasing use of leather in automobiles has come even as
some fashion designers have turned away from leather, fur and other
animal products. The designer Kenneth Cole recently introduced a
line of leather-free shoes and belts.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion and celebrity often travel hand in hand. Some music
stars have gone out of their way to resist the ubiquitous use of
leather in luxury vehicles, special-ordering their cars with
prosaic cloth interiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With leather seats, you're sitting on a lot of misery,'' said
Dan Mathews, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. Mathews noted that Paul and Linda McCartney typically
custom-ordered their top-of-the-line Mercedes sedans with cloth
seats, even though they had to wait weeks for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When a longtime animal rights activist, Kate Pierson, singer
with the B-52's pop band, tried to buy a Mercedes ML320 sport
utility last year, she couldn't find one with fabric upholstery and
the premium sound system she wanted. The dealership in New Jersey
told her it would take 10 months to custom-build an ML320 with
cloth seats and the high-line audio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted the options without the leather, and it seems
like you can't do that,'' Ms. Pierson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes is by no means alone. Cloth interiors are either
unavailable or require a special order in top-of-the-line cars from
manufacturers like BMW, Lexus and Jaguar. In lesser models, leather
is grouped with other popular features.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it the `Leather Package,''' Ms. Pierson said. ``Can
you imagine that? What if they had the `Fur Package'?''

MANDELA TO MEET WITH LEADERS IN CONGO CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ As the countries entangled in the civil war
here threatened to turn the nation into a battlefield for divergent
ethnic, political and diplomatic rivalries, President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa on Friday announced plans for weekend talks
with the leaders involved.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to President Laurent Kabila here said they might
participate in the negotiations, and the South African government
announced that heads of the main countries involved in the conflict
had also agreed to meet in Pretoria, South Africa, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after Zimbabwe began openly supplying
Kabila's hard-pressed forces with arms and troops in the region
southwest of here, an effort that may have tipped the scales when
the fall of Kinshasa seemed all but inevitable. Meanwhile, Rwanda
and Uganda, which have steadfastly denied buttressing the rebellion
against Kabila, used unusually harsh words to denounce Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government, which has been pressing for a
peaceful resolution to the conflict and has opposed military
intervention, said that Mandela would meet on Saturday with Kabila
and the presidents of Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda. The next day,
representatives of the 14 nations of the Southern African
Development Community are scheduled to meet to try to agree on a
policy toward the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the organization's biggest members, South Africa and
Zimbabwe, have locked horns on the issue of military involvement.
Uganda and Rwanda do not belong to the organization, which is
chaired by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a turning point,'' said a European ambassador in
this city. ``I think on Saturday, they might try to get the major
players together to iron out their differences before the Sunday
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict has already damaged long-term relations among
countries in this region, he said, adding: ``Relations between
South Africa and Zimbabwe are deteriorating as this goes on.
Clearly, Rwanda and Uganda are unhappy. I think it will be
difficult to see how this will all end.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks will allow Kabila's government to reinforce the point
among the Congolese that outsiders started this civil war. On
Thursday, a leader of the rebellion offered to negotiate a
cease-fire with Kabila's government, which immediately rejected any
talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to negotiate with our real enemies, that is to say,
Rwanda and Uganda,'' Dominique Sakombi Inongo, a senior adviser to
Kabila, said Friday in an interview in his office. ``What we have
realized is that the rebels are just servants. Why would we want to
negotiate with servants? We'll negotiate with their masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, ethnic Tutsi from eastern Congo began an
uprising near the Rwandan border and in the region southwest of
Kinshasa. The Tutsi-led Rwandan government, with its Ugandan ally,
is believed to have encouraged and helped the rebels to try to
overthrow Kabila _ the same man both countries plucked from
obscurity less than two years ago to lead a successful coup against
Congo's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   At first, many top aides in Kabila's government were Rwandan
Tutsi, but he dismissed them as his popularity plummeted. Residents
in Kinshasa and elsewhere in the country openly express their
hatred of the Tutsi and Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   Sakombi said that the government is succeeding in
counter-attacks on the rebel forces in the region near the Atlantic
Ocean by using Angolan jets to bomb rebel troops. Reports that
Angola had also sent troops Friday into that area to help Kabila's
forces could not be confirmed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday night, however, state television in Kinshasa showed
for the first time troops from Zimbabwe arriving at the airport in
Kinshasa. A European diplomat said Friday that soldiers from
Zimbabwe had been coming to Kinshasa for several days now, but that
so far they numbered only in the hundreds. The soldiers are
expected to reinforce government troops being posted west of
Kinshasa as well as to help repel a possible rebel attempt to take
over the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda have strongly denied any involvement in the
rebellion, but Friday they issued statements that appeared to belie
their claims. The Rwandan government condemned Zimbabwe and said it
now reserved the right to enter the Congolese conflict ``in
whatever manner it deems appropriate.'' Uganda issued an equally
strong, though more colorful, warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels will stretch them out in the forests of Congo,''
said Capt. Shaban Bantariza, spokesman for the Ugandan army,
according to Reuters. He added that the fighters from Zimbabwe
``will go home without shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda have emerged as strong allies of Washington.
And in post-Cold-War Africa, American foreign policy-makers have
held up their leaders, especially Uganda's president, Yoweri
Museveni, as new models for Africa, an attitude resented by many
other African nations.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Washington also backed Kabila. But Kabila's membership
in the new leaders' club was withdrawn quickly after he committed a
series of diplomatic mistakes and openly sneered at reports of
human rights abuses in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In a December news conference that marked the beginning of the
end of Washington's support of Kabila, he vowed to arrest his
critics as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stood by his side.
``Long live democracy,'' he said.

QUARTERBACK BASHING PECULIARLY NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There will be a few intriguing sideshows in
the Patriots' fourth exhibition game Saturday night, but the No. 1
show is always Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Land of Naysayers known as New England would anyone
pay much attention to a proven three-time All-Pro veteran
quarterback in preseason. In Dallas, Troy Aikman couldn't care less
about exhibition games. In Green Bay, Brett Favre laughs through
the game. In Miami, Dan Marino isn't yelling at his receivers and
nobody is saying he lacks fire. In Denver, fans don't want John
Elway to exert himself for fear the Broncos may not have him when
it counts.
</P>
<P>
   But in New England, fans fret, ``Geez, Bledsoe just doesn't look
that great.'' Or ``He'll never get to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no plan when I came in,'' said Bledsoe. ``I just try
and improve every year. I am making progress each year, and as long
as I continue to do that, I am accomplishing something. I would
have liked to have won a championship by this time in my career,
but I plan on doing that before I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   For his sake, it would be better to do it sooner rather than
later. Like right now.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to hear about a new system. The Naysayers wanted
Bledsoe to immerse himself in Ernie Zampese's offense and know it
cold immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked how it's going, Bledsoe said, ``I don't know.
Some days it's 90 percent and some days 40 percent. Sometimes you
hit and sometimes you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't appease the Naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   What may be more alarming is that in Week 4 of the preseason,
Bledsoe still doesn't have his entire offense intact. No. 1 draft
pick Robert Edwards will likely be held out again against the
Redskins, even though he has practiced on a limited basis this
week, because the trainers don't believe his groin pull has healed
100 percent. Sedrick Shaw, who played well in Mexico City Monday
against the Cowboys, will start again and get the bulk of the
carries. Harold Shaw and Derrick Cullors are also expected to see
much more action.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is that Bledsoe has yet to connect with Terry
Glenn in three games. Last week Bledsoe had Glenn wide open for a
touchdown but overthrew the speedy receiver. This may be the game
in which the two need to connect right away and begin to form a
bond like the one Aikman and Michael irvin have had for many years
in the old Zampese offense in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't developed that to that extent with any of the guys
in our offense, but hopefully, we can be successful while we try to
get to that point,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and the first offense are expected to play about three
quarters, their most action to this point. He was in for 21 plays
in the first game and 29 in each of the last two. The Patriots
would like for the first unit to get about 35 plays Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That should be plenty of time to determine how the Patriots'
offensive line is holding up against the Redskins' punishing
interior defense led by Dan Wilkinson (6 feet 5 inches, 313 pounds)
and Dana Stubblefield (6-2, 315). Stubblefield, who played for Pete
Carroll at San Francisco when Carroll was defensive coordinator,
was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year last season. He and
Wilkinson should provide center Dave Wohlabaugh and guards Max Lane
and Todd Rucci with quite a workout. If the Patriots are able to
run the ball up the middle, then you know those three are doing a
great job.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Rucci and right tackle Zefross Moss blocked well for
the run, allowing Sedrick Shaw to spring loose for a couple of long
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're progressing with our running game,'' said
Carroll. ``The offensive line has had a better rhythm. They were in
a good mind-set last week, and I think they're understanding the
importance of what we're telling them. I've challenged them from
the start of the minicamps to do the job. In the last five years,
this has never been a team known for its running game, even when
Curtis Martin was here. And we're probably not going to be known
for it now, either, as long as we have Drew Bledsoe's arm. But we
need to have an effective running game where we can go to it when
we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, one of the biggest sideshows will involve the
cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Canty is the probable starter on one side at the moment,
and it doesn't appear that first-round draft pick Tebucky Jones
(hamstring) will play for the second straight week. Jones is
definitely losing ground. The battle for the other corner spot is
being waged by Steve Lofton, Mark Tate, and Kato Serwanga. Lofton,
a veteran, may have the edge because of his experience. With a
young starter like Canty on the other side, experience is
important. But Carroll is taking a long, hard look at Serwanga, who
seemed to leapfrog ahead of Tate, and perhaps Lofton, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also wants to see how the tight end situation pans
out. He's not opposed to keeping all four currently on his roster.
There's no doubt second-round pick Rod Rutledge will make it, and
Lovett Purnell is quite a threat as a receiver. But Carroll still
wants to see a more all-around game from Purnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is giving us something in the passing game,'' said Carroll,
``and he continues to work on blocking, as all of them do. But he's
not a big power blocker that maybe Rod can become. But it's a nice
mix.''
</P>
<P>
   This game will mark the last chance for borderline players to
show something before Monday's cut, when the team will reduce its
squad to 61 (including Devin Wyman, its NFL Europe exemption) from
78. It'll be huge for punt returner Tony Gaiter, defensive lineman
Mike Jones, receivers Anthony Ladd and Dietrich Jells, rookie
center Jason Andersen, fullback/special-teams player Marrio Grier,
and linebackers Vernon Crawford and Bernard Russ.

<P>
   Municipal bonds, often a haven from a turbulent stock market,
are more attractive than they have been for years because of a
narrower gap between their yields and those of Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   High-quality, long-term municipal bonds, which usually yield
nearly 20 percent less than Treasury bonds, are now yielding only
10 percent less. That may not sound very appealing, but after
taxes, that narrowing can become a big positive.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: While interest from Treasuries is subject to federal
income taxes, most muni interest is generally tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   That means that investors in the top federal tax bracket of 39.6
percent would need a return of more than 8 percent on a taxable
investment to have the same after-tax return that they could get on
a municipal bond yielding 5 percent, and the 30-year Treasury bond
is now yielding only 5.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Municipal bonds are not a very exciting investment,'' said Joe
Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, a newsletter
published in New York. But considering the uncertainties of the
stock market, he added, ``maybe you want something where you know
you're going to get your money back.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread between yields on Treasury bonds and municipal bonds
is as narrow as it has been since Steve Forbes undercut the market
with a call for a flat income tax during his presidential campaign
in 1996. A flat tax would have negated the chief appeal of
municipal bonds, their tax-free coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the tightest spreads were seen a decade earlier,
when investors anticipated the tax cut that ultimately came when
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of municipal bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from their yields, have become so attractive to some
professional investors lately that even hedge funds have been
buying munis, although such funds do not pay taxes and, therefore,
enjoy no benefit from the bonds' tax status.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the municipal market gets to levels we're seeing at this
stage of the game, you start to get crossover buyers, and we've
seen that over the last 30 days,'' said Peter Allegrini, who runs
the municipal bond group at Prudential Investments in Newark. Such
buyers, including insurance companies and arbitragers, are seeking
capital gains when the bonds return to their normal relationship to
Treasuries. ``The relationship will get back in sync again,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spreads are tight because demand for municipal bonds is very
light while the supply is surging. Ever since interest rates spiked
in 1994, domestic investors have taken a dim view of bonds, sending
fixed-income securities into their steepest price decline in at
least 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, a mainstay of the market for Treasury bonds,
shun municipal bonds because the tax exemption is worthless to
them.
</P>
<P>
   But the supply of munis is growing, because governments and
agencies are investing heavily again in infrastructure projects _
and issuing bonds to pay for them _ even as they refinance other
bonds that yield 6 percent and more with new debt priced closer to
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think municipals are an extreme opportunity here,'' said
Reid Smith, manager of the Vanguard Municipal High Yield Portfolio
and Vanguard Municipal Insured Long Term Portfolio, pointing to
yields as high as 5.05 percent for a high-quality, 30-year issue.
For someone in the top federal tax bracket, the taxable equivalent
would be 8.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very handsome,'' Smith said, bigger than the yields on
many junk bonds but with much less risk.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that bond refinancings in the first half of this year
totaled $42 billion, or more than twice as much as in the first
half of 1997. Issuance of all municipal bonds was up 50 percent, to
$146 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that more munis are often issued in the second half
of a year, the total for 1998 could exceed the $293 billion in the
record year of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a pace to exceed $300 billion in new issues,'' said
Tom Metzold, manager of several tax-free Eaton Vance funds.
</P>
<P>
   And investors have started to warm to munis, Metzold said.
Nearly $1 million a day is coming into his national and high-yield
municipal bond funds; this time last year, that much was flowing
out. ``It appears the more proactive investor is beginning to
realize there is tremendous value in the municipal bond market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, bonds with the longest maturities and lowest credit
quality pay significantly higher yields than shorter, high-quality
debt. But the spreads are much narrower than usual in today's
tax-free market.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the riskiest investment-grade municipal bonds _
hospital bonds rated BBB _ yielded 90 to 95 basis points more than
high-quality bonds two years ago, but now pay just 40 to 45 basis
points more. (A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.)
</P>
<P>
   Bonds rated BB, the highest junk rating, have seen their usual
175-point premium reduced to 90 points. Meanwhile, 20-year and
30-year municipal bonds are yielding only about 50 basis points
more than those with a duration, or effective maturity, of 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're absolutely not being paid for low quality'' or
long-duration bonds, Smith said. He said the best buys were
high-quality, intermediate-term tax-free bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an investor is wealthy, buying mutual fund shares may be
the best way to hold municipal bonds, Mysak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of admission to the tax-free market is inordinately
high, compared to the stock market,'' he said. The usual minimum is
$5,000 to $10,000 a bond, and to diversify you need at least a
half-dozen of them. ``This is why so few people enjoy tax-free
income,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an important caveat for anyone investing in credit
markets through funds instead of direct ownership: bond owners who
keep their securities until maturity do not lose principal; fund
shareholders do not have this protection.
</P>
<P>
   If a fund sells securities at a gain, it will have to pass on a
capital gain to shareholders, and if it sells at a loss, it passes
on the loss. This surprises some shareholders who think of their
fund as tax exempt, but the exemption applies only to the yields.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the advantages of diversification and security
selection in a fund may well outweigh this disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the overall risks of investing in bonds are not trivial,
even if they are less than those of the equity market. Bond values
will sag if interest rates rise, and, in less turbulent times than
investors are facing today, returns can be expected to lag behind
those of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Breitner, president of Excomp Asset Management in
Manhattan, noted: ``Historically, over the long haul, equities do
much better than tax-free bonds.''

COLLEGE SAVINGS PLANS GROWING IN NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Cryans had to save for college for his older son,
Cameron, now 22 and entering his senior year at the Colorado School
of Mines in Golden, he did it the old-fashioned way: He put aside
about $25,000 in savings bonds and passbook accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Now in a second marriage, Cryans has a 1-year-old son, Connor.
And this time, Cryans has a new range of financial instruments at
his disposal _ a good thing, too, because that $25,000 would barely
cover half the projected cost of a year at a private school by the
time Connor enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having had the opportunity to put one child through college
already, I can appreciate the commitment you have to make to be
prepared,'' said Cryans, who is 47 and a small-business consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he and his wife, Julie, have already started to save for
Connor in one of a growing number of college savings plans run by
state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, amid considerable fanfare, Congress created the
Education IRA, similar to an individual retirement account, in
which parents may save for their children's education. But somewhat
overlooked were steps Congress took to clarify the tax status of
the state-sponsored plans, which permit much larger contributions
than allowed by the Education IRA and are thus likely to attract
much more consumer interest.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Congress allowed the state plans to expand
beyond tuition to cover room and board, effectively doubling the
amount of money that families can save through them. The range
varies from state to state, but many allow total contributions of
as much as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the number of state-sponsored college savings plans
is expected to double this year, to 41, according to the College
Savings Plan Network, a nonprofit organization that tracks and
advises the funds, with almost all the growth coming from a breed
of state plans that resemble mutual funds. Indeed, the New York
metropolitan region is seeing a sprouting of such funds:
Connecticut started its program in January; New Jersey's began
earlier this month, and New York's will commence in September.
</P>
<P>
   Though college savings plans vary from state to state, there are
two basic varieties: the older type, which guarantee returns, and
the newer, which don't. Until this year, most plans came with
guarantees to lock in tuition rates at current prices. In Ohio, for
example, parents of a newborn who paid $3,655 last year can be sure
their investment will cover a year at a state-run college or
university.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, should a child ultimately not attend a public college
in that state, the sum can be transferred to another institution _
in or out of state _ or to a sibling. It can also be refunded,
minus a small penalty fee.
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteed plans are intended to do no more than keep up with
the ``college inflation rate'' _ the rate of increase in tuition,
which is now 6 percent to 7.5 percent. The new savings plans aim to
do better.
</P>
<P>
   These plans, many of them managed by professional investment
powerhouses including Fidelity Investments and TIAA-CREF, typically
take greater risks in hopes of earning higher returns. And like the
bonds and stock mutual funds in which they invest, the new plans
come without safety nets: Thus, investors' nest eggs could sour as
easily as they could soar.
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteed or not, are the state-sponsored plans a smart way to
save?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new tax advantages, most financial planners are cool
toward both concepts. With college inflation running several
percentage points below the 10 percent average annual return on
stocks, guaranteed-plan investors can do better elsewhere, said Ray
Loewe, president of College Money, a financial planning firm in
Marlton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers are also suspicious of the nonguaranteed
plans, pointing out that most are too new to have the track records
they look for. And while these plans deliver tax savings, they also
tack on more fees than popular no-load mutual funds. For example,
to participate in New Hampshire's plan, the Cryans will pay annual
charges of $3 for every $1,000 they have saved.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are also not as flexible as regular mutual funds. For
example, if Connor decides not to go to college or the Cryans need
money for an emergency, the family will owe taxes and a 15 percent
penalty on the account's investment growth. And though financial
aid rules vary from college to college, many count state plans as
scholarships or a child's property _ treatment that can compromise
eligibility for grants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many people, the tax benefits may outweigh these
disadvantages. Gains on investments in regular mutual funds are
taxed at a parent's capital-gains rate, generally 20 percent, but
growth in a state plan is taxed only when used, and then at the
child's tax rate, which is usually 15 percent. Many states also
exempt gains in their plans from state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several new plans use an asset-allocation method that
financial planners favor, investing in portfolios of several stock
and bond funds that grow more conservative as a child ages.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which edged several rivals to win the new plan
business for Delaware, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, sees it as
an important part of college financing's future. Fund companies
cannot sell the plans directly because only states can legally
sponsor them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked at the changes in the tax laws, these programs
represent for most people the best alternative,'' said Stephen
Mitchell, senior vice president at Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Though less popular now, the guaranteed plans would be
revitalized if stocks sank or college inflation accelerated.
Indeed, risk-averse investors seem willing to shed a few percentage
points of gains for the security of a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like we are losing anything,'' said Gwen Martino,
a school librarian in Brookfield, Ohio. By saving $100 a month for
the last six years, she and her husband, Daniel, have amassed
nearly enough to buy Daniel Jeffrey, 9, and Alessandra, 6, a year's
tuition each at an Ohio public college. ``Granted, we could make
more, but isn't that always the gamble with the stock market? You
could make more but you could also lose your shirt,'' Mrs. Martino
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Education IRA, contributions are limited to just $500
annually; its biggest selling point is its tax-free status: All
gains accumulate free of federal taxes, provided the funds are used
for school. That makes it ``the hands-down winner in terms of tax
advantage'' among college financing alternatives, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents thinking about investing in both a state-sponsored plan
and an Education IRA should think again. You cannot contribute to
both, at least in the same year.

FOR CLINTON, QUESTIONS NO MATTER WHAT THE MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was a week like no other in the Clinton presidency, perhaps
in any presidency. But President Clinton's unprecedented grand jury
testimony, his extraordinary national acknowledgement of a sexual
affair, and then his decision to strike against terrorist centers
halfway around the world all conspired to underscore the
president's weaknesses at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At home, his credibility is under assault in the wake of
admissions that he misled the nation about his relationship with
the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, for seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, the air strikes reinforce the difficulty facing the
world's only superpower, with its nuclear weapons and vast
conventional forces, as it struggles to deal with terrorist cells
and lone extremists determined to find America's vulnerable spots.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this awkward, painful, unsettling and wrenching week
underlined a new handicap that besets Clinton: His motives will be
questioned, at least initially, no matter what he does, no matter
how he does it, no matter when he does it, in spheres domestic or
foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Most responsible American politicians and commentators agreed
that the president's antiterrorist offensive was justifiable and
prudent. Even some of his most habitual and vocal Republican
critics, such as the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman,
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, swiftly lined up behind Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But constrained by an independent counsel investigation and
hobbled in the traditional lame-duck period of any two-term
presidency, Clinton no longer has the automatic benefit of the
doubt that Americans customarily grant their president.
</P>
<P>
   When Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican who sits on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said this week that there was ``a
dark cloud of doubt hanging over every further action,'' he was
referring specifically to the president's decision to launch air
strikes against the terrorist targets. Coats, who is no hothead,
might as easily _ and more accurately _ have been speaking about
any action the president takes at any time in the next few weeks
and months in any area of politics and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to send cruise missiles flying encapsulated
Clinton's principal challenge in the wake of his grand jury
testimony and his admission. He acted to show credibility,
redeeming his vow that ``no matter how long it takes or where it
takes us, we will pursue terorists until the cases are solved and
justice is done.'' But in seeking to display his credibility, he
only underlined his credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made good on his threat, an undercurrent of
suspicion ran cold and deep through the nation, at least in the
first hours after the attacks. The missile strikes came at the end
of the worst week Clinton has had as president, amid doubts about
his veracity, calls for his resignation, assessments of his power.
</P>
<P>
   There was, to be sure, an explanation for all of it _ for the
timing of the raids, for the targets, for the reassertion of
presidential and national force.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents often have to explain their actions in foreign and
military affairs, but seldom are called on to explain their
motives. In this case, the administration had to argue that
political life, in the form of a terrorist threat, had not come to
imitate theatrical art, in the form of the movie ``Wag the Dog''
or, in an Elizabethan context, the Shakespearean gambit of a leader
giddying the public's minds with foreign wars.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a time, as Shakespeare wrote, when ``oaths are
straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,'' in part because of the
president's own deceptions. For that reason, Clinton who misled the
nation, his staff, his political allies, his friends, and his
family about events in his own home, is reaping what he sowed.
</P>
<P>
   So now a president reared in a time of the ``credibility gap''
of Lyndon B. Johnson _ indeed, drawn into politics in that era _
faces a veracity gulch of his own. The suspicions that swirl around
Clinton now are palpable _ and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now faces the sort of multi-front combat that ordinarily
challenges only wartime presidents. He must deal with the
likelihood of a damaging report from independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr; the possibility of impeachment hearings in the House;
uncertainties in foreign affairs, where terrorist threats have
created an eerie instability; and in the economy, where there are
mounting signs that the boom may be winding down.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges are particularly difficult in the struggle
against terrorism, which, unlike conventional national-security
threats, do not involve massing armies or traditional
nation-states. Terrorism is conducted by small groups, operating in
stealth, often without the overt assistance of nations. Massive
conventional acts of retaliation can be ineffective and only stoke
the passions of the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his wife have long argued that they are adept
in placing their concerns in ``little boxes,'' a notion the
president's mother taught them. This allows them to keep their
thoughts and their feelings about subjects as disparate as their
marriage, their emotions, their political ambitions and issues such
as US trade policy and welfare completely separate.
</P>
<P>
   But now the president is in a box simply because the items in
all the little boxes seem to demand urgent attention all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the grand jury are examining ambiguities or even
outright omissions and obfuscations in the president's testimony,
terrorists are testing his resolve, Clinton's political opponents
are testing his strength, and his actions and deceptions are
testing his marriage and his sense of trust with the people he
serves.
</P>
<P>
   In all these boxes the critical element is the same _ not
resiliency, of which the president the master; not toughness, of
which the president has a surfeit; and not intelligence, with which
the president is gifted; but credibility, which is the ultimate
power of the presidency and which is this president's greatest and
gravest challenge.

CLINTON RESUMES ISLAND VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Just one day after President Clinton
announced retaliatory strikes against terrorists and departed
suddenly from Martha's Vineyard, the president returned Friday to
the island to resume his family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plane touched down at Martha's Vinyard Regional
Airport just before 6:15 p.m. &UR;  &LR; The presidential motorcade, which
passed by a group of about 20 people waving handmade signs and
trying for a souvenir snapshot, went directly to the Oyster Pond
estate where the first family is staying.
</P>
<P>
   The president's quick return comes as the United States
continues to assess the damage done by its missile attacks on
suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan. Asked in
Washington whether the president would be accompanied by his
foreign policy team, National Security Adviser Samuel Berger
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones work very well Martha's Vineyard, including the
secure phones....If there's a need for someone else to go up there,
they will.'' He added, ``If, obviously, there were a need for the
president to come back down here, he would.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are scheduled to stay on the island until August
30. Each summer, the Clinton's have made fewer and fewer forays to
island special events, though last year First Lady Hilary Rodham
Clinton attended a birthday party for Dorothy West, The last
surviving member of the 1920 Harlem Renaissance. Today, many
islanders will mark a memorial service for West, who lived in Oak
Bluffs and died this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton's last year also attended the annual agricultural
fair, which this year lasts through Sunday. But otherwise their
summer vacations have consisted mainly of private parties at the
homes of friends and liesurely days at private beaches or the golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is such an unusual time for the Clinton family,
White House aides do not want to speculate on how much socializing
the Clintons will do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they were hard-pressed to tell the press what the first
lady gave her husband for a birthday gift. Last year, the press was
told that Mrs. Clinton had given her husband a piece of American
Indian artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the Boston Pops will perform at the Tabernacle in
Oak Bluffs, and it seems islanders were more interested in seeing
Conductor Keith Lockhart than Bill Clinton.

FOR CLINTON, QUESTIONS NO MATTER WHAT THE MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was a week like no other in the Clinton presidency, perhaps
in any presidency. But President Clinton's unprecedented grand jury
testimony, his extraordinary national acknowledgement of a sexual
affair, and then his decision to strike against terrorist centers
halfway around the world all conspired to underscore the
president's weaknesses at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At home, his credibility is under assault in the wake of
admissions that he misled the nation about his relationship with
the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, for seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, the air strikes reinforce the difficulty facing the
world's only superpower, with its nuclear weapons and vast
conventional forces, as it struggles to deal with terrorist cells
and lone extremists determined to find America's vulnerable spots.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this awkward, painful, unsettling and wrenching week
underlined a new handicap that besets Clinton: His motives will be
questioned, at least initially, no matter what he does, no matter
how he does it, no matter when he does it, in spheres domestic or
foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Most responsible American politicians and commentators agreed
that the president's antiterrorist offensive was justifiable and
prudent. Even some of his most habitual and vocal Republican
critics, such as the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman,
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, swiftly lined up behind Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But constrained by an independent counsel investigation and
hobbled in the traditional lame-duck period of any two-term
presidency, Clinton no longer has the automatic benefit of the
doubt that Americans customarily grant their president.
</P>
<P>
   When Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican who sits on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said this week that there was ``a
dark cloud of doubt hanging over every further action,'' he was
referring specifically to the president's decision to launch air
strikes against the terrorist targets. Coats, who is no hothead,
might as easily _ and more accurately _ have been speaking about
any action the president takes at any time in the next few weeks
and months in any area of politics and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to send cruise missiles flying encapsulated
Clinton's principal challenge in the wake of his grand jury
testimony and his admission. He acted to show credibility,
redeeming his vow that ``no matter how long it takes or where it
takes us, we will pursue terorists until the cases are solved and
justice is done.'' But in seeking to display his credibility, he
only underlined his credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made good on his threat, an undercurrent of
suspicion ran cold and deep through the nation, at least in the
first hours after the attacks. The missile strikes came at the end
of the worst week Clinton has had as president, amid doubts about
his veracity, calls for his resignation, assessments of his power.
</P>
<P>
   There was, to be sure, an explanation for all of it _ for the
timing of the raids, for the targets, for the reassertion of
presidential and national force.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents often have to explain their actions in foreign and
military affairs, but seldom are called on to explain their
motives. In this case, the administration had to argue that
political life, in the form of a terrorist threat, had not come to
imitate theatrical art, in the form of the movie ``Wag the Dog''
or, in an Elizabethan context, the Shakespearean gambit of a leader
giddying the public's minds with foreign wars.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a time, as Shakespeare wrote, when ``oaths are
straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,'' in part because of the
president's own deceptions. For that reason, Clinton who misled the
nation, his staff, his political allies, his friends, and his
family about events in his own home, is reaping what he sowed.
</P>
<P>
   So now a president reared in a time of the ``credibility gap''
of Lyndon B. Johnson _ indeed, drawn into politics in that era _
faces a veracity gulch of his own. The suspicions that swirl around
Clinton now are palpable _ and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now faces the sort of multi-front combat that ordinarily
challenges only wartime presidents. He must deal with the
likelihood of a damaging report from independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr; the possibility of impeachment hearings in the House;
uncertainties in foreign affairs, where terrorist threats have
created an eerie instability; and in the economy, where there are
mounting signs that the boom may be winding down.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges are particularly difficult in the struggle
against terrorism, which, unlike conventional national-security
threats, do not involve massing armies or traditional
nation-states. Terrorism is conducted by small groups, operating in
stealth, often without the overt assistance of nations. Massive
conventional acts of retaliation can be ineffective and only stoke
the passions of the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his wife have long argued that they are adept
in placing their concerns in ``little boxes,'' a notion the
president's mother taught them. This allows them to keep their
thoughts and their feelings about subjects as disparate as their
marriage, their emotions, their political ambitions and issues such
as US trade policy and welfare completely separate.
</P>
<P>
   But now the president is in a box simply because the items in
all the little boxes seem to demand urgent attention all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the grand jury are examining ambiguities or even
outright omissions and obfuscations in the president's testimony,
terrorists are testing his resolve, Clinton's political opponents
are testing his strength, and his actions and deceptions are
testing his marriage and his sense of trust with the people he
serves.
</P>
<P>
   In all these boxes the critical element is the same _ not
resiliency, of which the president the master; not toughness, of
which the president has a surfeit; and not intelligence, with which
the president is gifted; but credibility, which is the ultimate
power of the presidency and which is this president's greatest and
gravest challenge.

MUTUAL FUND HOLDERS UNFAZED BY MARKET SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worries about a spate of global economic, political, and
currency crises that pushed world markets down Friday did not
appear to jolt mutual fund investors, who in a summer of swings
again resisted panic selling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On a volatile day in which the Dow Jones industrial average
dipped 283 points, or nearly 3.3 percent, before trimming the loss
to close down 0.90 percent at 8533.65, individual fund shareholders
seemed unruffled. Major fund firms reported only slight increases
in the number of phone calls from concerned shareholders and said
stockbrokers were unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   Some fund firms said shareholders were shifting assets out of
equity funds into ultra-safe money market funds. Others said
investors simply put new cash into money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear to me individual fund shareholders aren't
driving this market,'' said John A. Rekenthaler, research director
at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund tracker, ``It's almost
certainly big institutional pulls and hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling came as investors fretted about the United States' raids
Thursday on Sudan and Afghanistan and Moscow's escalating debt and
ruble crises. Wall Street shook on renewed fears about Asia's
effect on US corporate earnings, while across Europe, markets
slipped from 3 to nearly 6 percent on Russia fears. In Latin
America, markets shuddered at pressured emerging debt prices and
the prospects for Venezuela's battered currency.
</P>
<P>
   Because US mutual funds of all types hold 19 percent of all US
stocks, or $5.1 trillion in assets, industry watchers like to know
what happens at fund firms when markets wobble. Individual
investors _ as opposed to institutional investors, such as
corporations, insurers, and pension funds _ are a favored
barometer, since they account for two thirds of all fund holdings,
according to the Investment Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments of Boston, the nation's largest fund firm,
reported only a slight increase in phone calls from investors. Some
money had been transferred out of stock funds and into conservative
funds, but overall there were net positive flows into funds across
the complex. ``Investors generally favored more conservative
investments, like money market and bonds funds,'' said spokeswoman
Jessica S. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. Inc., the nation's largest discount
broker, phone traffic was below average, perhaps because investors
were on vacation. ``Maybe people are just getting used to these
swings,'' spokeswoman Tracy Gordon said. Phone calls from
individual investors were up 5-10 percent on usual levels at Putnam
Investments. Most investors asked about account balances, spokesman
Matthew Keenan said, and did not sell. T. Rowe Price said clients
pulled some money out of international funds but that net flows
into all other funds were positive.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow down 8.6 percent since its July 17 high and again
near the 10 percent drop deemed a correction, analysts wonder if
fund investors think the party is over. Investors have poured cash
into mutual funds this decade, pushing the stock market up.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of some optimism, investors put $2.67 billion into
domestic stock funds in the week ended Aug. 19, AMG Data Services
of Arcata, Calif said. That is the most since the Dow's high a
month ago, but far below year-ago inflows, which topped $6.47
billion. Investors also continued to hedge bets by putting cash
into money market funds _ $7.78 billion last week, after $19.49
billion in the previous week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton continues to draw high ratings from the U.S.
public for his job performance, but his acknowledgment of a
relationship with a former White House intern has produced signs of
a darkening public view of both the president's moral character and
his overall personal image, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is now viewed more approvingly by the
U.S. public than her husband, according to the survey, which was
conducted on Wednesday and Thursday. Overwhelmingly, respondents
said they admired how Mrs. Clinton had stood by her husband since
he admitted his relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ even as most
people said they did not believe the first lady's claim that she
first learned of her husband's infidelity last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted in the midst of what has surely been the
most tumultuous week of Clinton's political career, and suggested
once again America's profound ambivalence about this president.
</P>
<P>
   By varying measures, respondents said they were bothered that
Clinton had an an affair and lied about it, and were narrowly
inclined to believe he had encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie about it
at a grand jury. They also were inclined to believe he had sexually
harassed Paula Jones, his denials notwithstanding. And the number
of Americans who say that Clinton does not share their moral values
is as high now as it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rising concerns about Clinton's conduct and character do not
seem to have tarnished the public view of his performance as
president. The percentage of Americans who applaud Clinton's
handling of foreign policy, 68 percent, and of the economy, 70
percent, is statistically as high as it has been at any point in
his presidency. His overall approval rating is at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton does not appear to have been particularly
hurt among the group of Americans who have been among his strongest
supporters: women. The polls found that men and women generally
view Clinton and the scandal similarly, and what differences there
were tended to be small, with women slightly more supportive of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News survey spanned Clinton's announcement that he
had ordered the bombing attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan, allowing
at least a preliminary measure of how events overseas might affect
Clinton's political standing during a difficult time. Americans
overwhelmingly approved of the attack, although they were less
certain on the question of whether it would discourage terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The military action did not appear to produce any immediate
changes in the nation's measure of Clinton, with perhaps one
exception: The number of respondents who said that Clinton could be
``trusted to keep his word as president'' increased, from 49
percent to 57 percent, from before to after the bombing. Overall,
the respondents said by a two-to-one margin that they believed
Clinton had acted out of genuine military concerns, rather than
executing a so-called ``Wag the Dog'' strategy to shift public
attention away from his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 944 adults nationwide has a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poll included a number of findings that should
cheer Clinton and his supporters as they assess his prospects of
emerging from his immediate difficulties, it nonetheless was
sprinkled with evidence of the enormity of the political task
Clinton faces in trying to salvage the final 28 months of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two out of three respondents said they agreed that the
scandal ``will have a serious impact on President Clinton's
administration'' for the next two years. One in two said that
Clinton, rather than his enemies, were to blame for the president's
predicament, a definite shift in the public's view of who was at
fault here. Nearly 60 percent say that Clinton does not share the
moral values of most Americans.

FIFTY YEARS OF SID AND MARTY GO ON THE BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the past half century, Sid and Marty Krofft
have created Elvis puppets and Saddam Hussein puppets, bug-eyed
Carol Channing puppets and hirsute Whoopi Goldberg puppets.
</P>
<P>
   But the brothers claim they owe their success mainly to a cadre
of adults-only puppets made for the Seattle World's Fair in the
1960s. ``Les Poupees de Paris,'' an elaborate fantasy of a risque
Paris nightclub that included a 36-piece puppet orchestra, became
an overnight sensation _ thanks to the fair's ribbon-cutting guest
of honor, the Rev. Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Graham refused to go backstage because the `women'
didn't have bras on,'' Sid, 69, recalled recently. ``So, that night
he had an enormous rally, and he announced to 100,000 people,
`Don't go see this!' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We credit him (Graham) with our careers,'' said Marty,
chuckling at the memory of the subsequent media fallout and the
overflow audiences it generated.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote is vintage Sid and Marty Krofft _ wry, old-school
entertainers whose most enduring accomplishments probably are the
handful of quirky, sophisticated, semi-Freudian Saturday morning
children's TV shows they created in the 1970s: ``The Bugaloos,''
``Sigmund and the Sea Monsters,'' ``Land of the Lost'' and, of
course, ``H.R. Pufnstuf.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, several original costumes from those shows, along
with drawings, posters, memorabilia and about 20 of the Kroffts'
startlingly realistic life-size celebrity puppets will go on the
auction block at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most recognizable items will be the bright yellow
Pufnstuf costume, complete with the white cowboy boots and
orange-crested head that made the happy-go-lucky character look
like a country-western Komodo dragon.
</P>
<P>
   While the brothers say one of their primary purposes was ``to
share this stuff with our friends,'' they also view the auction as
marking the end of a phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't empty out our warehouse, but it is time to get on
with our lives,'' said Marty, 60.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Kroffts have been standing still. Since their
whimsical cartoon heyday ended, they've produced hit prime-time
variety shows such as ``Donny and Marie'' (1976-79), ``Barbara
Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters'' (1980-82) and ``D.C. Follies''
(1987-89).
</P>
<P>
   They're also scoping out feature film versions of ``Pufnstuf,''
``Land of the Lost'' and the popular '60s sitcom ``Family Affair''
that ran on CBS from 1966 to 1971, to which the Kroffts own the
rights.
</P>
<P>
   They also served for many years as creative consultants to the
Six Flags theme parks. Recently, they set up shop again in the San
Fernando Valley, in Sherman Oaks _ a homecoming of sorts, given
that they started out in Sun Valley in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their careers, the brothers often have found ways to
bend TV's creative conventions. That wasn't easy in the 1960s, when
TV was far more conservative than today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that to network executives, our shows were so bizarre
that they left us alone,'' Marty said. ``It was only when we
started doing `The Donny and Marie Show' that they started getting
into our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sid, ``When we created our shows, we wanted Mom and Dad to
sit in front of the television set and have as good a time as their
kids. We did not put the child down. When parents see those shows
now, they get even more out of them than they did then.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Montreal-born brothers have come a long way since
they started out working in vaudeville and circuses, their old
show-biz instincts still serve them well. Often, they sound like a
comedy team, with Sid playing straight-man and Marty getting the
best of the one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Marty,'' Sid asks, ``didn't our dad always say, `If you
drop your pants on stage to get a laugh, that's not a laugh. That's
an easy laugh. That's not a proper laugh. So we never dropped our
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least not on stage,'' Marty shoots back with perfect
timing.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of their patter holds true when it comes to naming
their all-time favorite character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pufnstuf,'' Sid said unhesitatingly. ``They always say the
first child is the most popular, and Pufnstuf is our first child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite character,'' his brother retorted, ``is Sid.''

 UNDATED: most Americans.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And 40 percent of those questioned said they had an unfavorable
opinion of Clinton, which is close to the president's worst score
on that question. By contrast, 48 percent of those questioned said
they had a favorable rating. ( A 20-point drop in Clinton's
favorability rating reported by the Gallup Poll on Tuesday was
later discovered to have been largely caused by a change in the
wording of the question.)
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a brief period earlier this year, Clinton
has never in the course of his public life broken the 50 percent
favorability rating in the Times/CBS News poll, even when Americans
were giving him strong ratings on his performance in office. The
only time Clinton's favorable rating rose above 50 percent was in
February _ at the height of the disclosures about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approve of what he has done up to this point, but I don't
find him trustworthy,'' said one respondent, Lisa Wolynski, 35, a
day-care business owner from Highland Ranch, Co., who was
re-interviewed after the poll, in a remark that neatly captured the
conflict many Americans are feeling about this president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like the guy I don't want my daughter to go out with,''
she said. ``At first I felt that who he sleeps with is his
business. But then as I began explaining this to my kids, it's
begun to bother me.'' She said the president was like ``a little
boy who got his hand caught in the cookie jar and I don't think he
was all that sorry for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most intriguing findings in the poll regarded Mrs.
Clinton. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they thought
well of Mrs. Clinton for voicing support for her husband during
this crisis. Of those, 63 percent said they admired her for
standing by her husband, for being a good wife, and for keeping her
marriage together.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is now viewed favorably by 50 percent of
respondents, compared to 25 percent who view her unfavorably, which
matches her previous record-high standing of last February, when
she was at the forefront of defending Clinton on these charges.
``It's her stamina really,'' said Edward Sullivan, 52, an engineer
from Norwood, Mass. ``She's quite smart and durable. I suppose I
admire her for putting up with all this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolynski said Mrs. Clinton was ``in a very difficult
situation and she's handling it very well. If I was her, I would
have given him the boot many years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the depth of support for Mrs. Clinton these days
suggests that the first lady might be helping her husband yet again
_ that her own popularity might be providing Clinton with something
of a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the public rallied behind Mrs. Clinton, it seemed not
entirely believing of what she said: Two in three people said they
believed that she had in fact known of her husband's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky before last weekend, a public statement by her
office not withstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Clinton seemed to fare as well among women as
he did among men. For example, 73 percent of women, compared to 64
percent of men, said they wanted Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, to drop the investigation. There was, though, one subject
on which women took a sterner view of Clinton: Thirty percent said
they were bothered a lot by the very fact of Clinton's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, compared to 22 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news _ if only relatively _for Clinton in
the poll, as it relates specifically to the scandal. About half the
respondents said they were satisfied with the speech Clinton gave
to the nation on Monday night, though the approval of Clinton's
performance has been slipping throughout the week, amid a wave of
negative commentary.
</P>
<P>
   About half of those questioned said it was understandable that
Clinton had lied to the public about the nature of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky when asked about the allegations last January.
And about two out of three respondents think that the investigation
should be dropped. Nearly 40 percent of the respondents said the
issue is of ``very little importance'' to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr continues to suffer from his public exposure: only 19
percent view him favorably, compared to 43 percent who do not.
Starr might find some solace in Ms. Lewinsky's position: only five
percent of Americans view her favorably this week, compared to to
54 percent who view her unfavorably. &QL;

HANDS HOLD CLUES TO SEXUAL TRAITS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study from England gives new meaning to the expression
hand signal.
</P>
<P>
   Simply looking at whether the length of fingers on a man's left
hand match the length on his right, for instance, can signal his
sperm count. Less match, less sperm and less active sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, if the research holds up, is its comparison of the
relative length of fingers on the same hand. A man whose ring
finger is much longer than his index finger tends to have higher
levels of the male hormone testosterone and be more fertile. For
women, it's the other way around: A longer index finger signals
higher levels of the hormone estrogen and more fertility.
</P>
<P>
   As bizarre as it sounds, there is a scientific basis to the
claims, insists John Manning, an evolutionary biologist at the
University of Liverpool who is presenting his findings this weekend
in British Columbia at a meeting of human behavior experts.
Experiments on mice, he says, show that the same set of ``Hox''
genes control the development of fingers and toes as well as
ovaries and testes.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues wanted to see whether there was a similar
linkage of traits in humans, so they measured the fingers of men
and women at a fertility clinic. What emerged was a clear pattern
linking digit length with fertility traits, a pattern that
researchers say is set in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview from Canada Friday, Manning warned:
``Certainly people shouldn't look at their digits and think, `I'm
not going to have children.' We're looking at a trait like any
biological trait with variation in it. It's like looking at some
people who are tall and some who are short and some in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this isn't plunging people into despair,'' he said.
``It must not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   What do his scientific colleagues think of the findings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dumbfounded by the whole thing because it's so
complicated,'' said Dr. Merle J. Berger, an
obstetrician/gynecologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
``If there were some truth to this and it is validated, it would be
very subtle differences in length that would have to be accurately
measured. It would not just be the way it looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides,'' Berger added, ``those things aren't terribly
important any more whether man has sperm counts a little lower or a
woman's estrogen levels are a little lower. We deal quite easily
with low counts of sperm and nobody even looks at estrogen, it's
not a fertility factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janis Fox, who runs the egg-donation program at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, is skeptical yet intrigued: ``It's not
unfathomable that there could be some relationship, but the
validity of this data certainly is questionable until someone has a
chance to critically review this study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would ever eliminate the need for a doctor to
do a further workup,'' Fox said. ``We wouldn't just say, `Pick up
your hands. OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are ``certain phenotypic appearances that are associated
with fertility problems,'' Fox added, including ``excessive hair
growth, or if you have a certain body fat distribution, or if you
have acne. Those things might give you a clue that there's some
underlying endocrine problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning said he was as skeptical as the US doctors, which is why
he and his associates ran three separate tests on three sets of
English subjects. The first involved 100 men and women at a
fertility clinic; the second zeroed in on 10 healthy young men;
while the third involved 300 men and women who have children.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he tested fertility directly by measuring sperm,
testosterone, and estrogen; other times he tried to gauge it
afterward by the size of families that people had. But the linkage
always was there between finger size and sex traits. And the
implication, he adds, is that ``there might literally be a rule of
thumb _ or of the fourth digit _ of fertility.''
</P>
<P>
   Further studies are under way in Poland, Jamaica, Spain, and
Uganda to determine whether the pattern exists in cultures
elsewhere. And Manning says his study, which was reported in this
week's New Scientist magazine, already has been accepted for
publication in two scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever additional studies might show, ``Mystic Rosa,'' a palm
reader, says there is nothing new about the notion that human hands
offer clues to human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell the past, present and future, and answer their
questions, and give them advice'' just by taking a careful reading
of a person's hands, explains Rosa, who plies her trade in Harvard
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yes, I can tell how many children they're going to have,''
Rosa adds, although she insists her ability to do that and more has
``nothing to do with science.''

ATTACKS PUT US IN ISRAELI LEAGUE ON TERRORISM, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN AND ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American missile attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan follow the
Israeli model of a quick, tough response to terrorism _ a shift in
US strategy that experts praised Friday for finally putting
militants on notice that they'll pay a high price if they continue
their aggression.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they agreed that if Washington's new behavior
becomes ongoing policy, it carries a potentially huge cost of its
own: thrusting this country into a cycle of violence of a kind that
Israel has experienced for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something in these operations which very much
resembles what has been Israeli policy,'' said Shai Feldman, head
of the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University.
``And I think it is the result of a realization that you can't let
people around the world just keep blowing up American embassies and
killing Americans ... and the United States will not react and the
perpetrators will go unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman added a caution, however. ``The United States will have
to start living with the fact,'' he said, ``that such operations
will cause some unpleasant reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it appeared Friday that a strike-counterstrike
escalation may already be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of each other, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
said in Washington that more US assaults are being planned and may
be executed, and the editor of a London-based Arab newspaper
transmitted a threat from Osama bin Laden _ whose alleged terrorist
activities instigated Thursday's US bombings _ to retaliate with
additional attacks against American targets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts with strong ties to the National Security Council said
they understood that the Defense Department has already plotted the
next American strikes. They said that the intent was not only to
damage terrorists' infrastructures before they could strike again,
but also to reverse an international perception of the United
States as a tough talker in areas from Bosnia to North Korea to
Iraq, but that's one unwilling to back its words with action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only the beginning. There are going to be more strikes,
because it's a message, not just about counterterrorism but about
American authority,'' said Bill Taylor, director of the
political-military program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. ``This week's hits were not a
whim. They were a signal: Look out, here we come.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli counter-terrorism specialists saw another similarity
between the American attacks and their own country's approach to
terrorism; that is, the underlying notion of both is to hit before
getting hit. US officials said the bombings in Afghanistan
essentially were conducted for self-defense reasons, to destroy the
terrorists' potential to carry out additional actions that they'd
already planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get information about active bases where plans are
being designed, you bomb, you don't wait for them to do it first,''
said Yigal Carmon, who was the adviser on terrorism to Prime
Ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli attacks on terrorists, some of which have never been
publicly acknowledged, have proved costly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for example, an Israeli helicopter rocketed a car
carrying a leader of the radical group Hezbollah, Abbas Musawi,
killing him, his wife, and their infant child. A month later, a
bomb believed to have been planted by Hezbollah ripped through the
Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 30 people.
</P>
<P>
   And in February 1996, Hamas bomb-maker Yehiya Ayyash was killed
by a booby-trapped cellular phone in the Gaza Strip. Militants
blamed Israel for his death, which was followed by four suicide
bombings that killed 58 people in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course in some cases there is retaliation, but what is the
answer, to keep quiet and act like a lamb and don't fight the
terrorists and let them strengthen themselves and develop?'' asked
Carmon.
</P>
<P>
   The counterterrorism experts said the United States must take
into account in pursuing its current tactics that any attack is
likely to boost the targeted group's motivation to retaliate. But
they added that the attack also could cut the group's operational
abilities, something US officials say was done to bin Laden's
organizations this week.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some assaults can succeed in the long term. For
instance, after the leader of the militant Palestinian organization
Islamic Jihad was assassinated in Malta in 1995, presumably by
Israeli agents, the group never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Politically and militarily, the calculation for the United
States clearly is different than it is for Israel, which stands at
the center of a region rife with hostility and whose people solidly
support military responses to perceived or real threats.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the skepticism of many Americans that President
Clinton acted this week to distract attention from his domestic
woes, the climate in this country may be shifting as a result of
the bombings in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center in New
York. There was little criticism, experts pointed out, of the
American attacks for having risked innocent lives or even for
not-so-covertly targeting bin Laden, even though US law forbids
deliberate assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some political analysts said that if this week's
attacks turn out to be a one-shot deal rather than a sustained
policy, Clinton risks looking like he really was recreating the
script of the movie ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet the store ... that this is the start of a new
phase in our foreign policy,'' said Richard Shultz, head of the
International Security Studies program at the Fletcher School of
Diplomacy. ``And it does have a positive lesson from Israeli, that
by being offensive ... you put the terrorists on the defensive, and
give those who direct terrorism against us currently don't have to
worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and others added that there are downsides, in addition to
the possibility of creating a cycle of violence. Those include
questions about whether democracies like the United States should
engage in essentially undeclared wars, and whether such actions
will end terrorism or just fuel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the embassy bombings in East Africa represent how the game
is going to be played, we're really up against it,'' said Shultz.
``There's nothing you can do defensively about things like that.
You just can't build enough walls. It's a scary thing.''

JUSTICE DELAYED BUT NOT DENIED: EX-KKK CHIEF CONVICTED IN '66
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Vernon Dahmer Jr. covered his face and wept
into his hands. His brother, Dennis, gently pounded a railing in
the old courthouse balcony. And their mother, the elderly Ellie
Dahmer, shut her eyes and steepled her fingers, thanking God for
the jury's verdict that, almost 33 years after the crime, found an
old, stooped klansman guilty of ordering her husband killed.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of six blacks, five whites and one Asian convicted Samuel
Bowers, a former Imperial Wizard of the Mississippi White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, of murder in the Jan. 10, 1966 firebombing
that mortally injured Vernon Dahmer Sr., who was marked for death
because he helped register blacks to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard McKenzie immediately sentenced Bowers, 73, to life
in prison, and slammed down his gavel to close the courtroom as an
old black woman in the back row of the courtroom clapped her hands,
twice, in a celebration that has been on hold for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than justice for the Dahmer family, who have been
frustrated after after four previous trials _ including two state
murder trials in the 1960s _ let Bowers stroll free after all-white
juries deadlocked. The verdict proved, said Vernon Dahmer Jr., that
the society his father died to help create is alive here in
south-central Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my dad's life was about,'' he said, motioning to
the jury box that had seated a racially diverse cross-section of
the community, not an all-white, all-male jury from which blacks
were traditionally denied justice.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer Sr., a respected storekeeper, farmer and local official
with the NAACP, was singled out by the Klan because he allowed his
store to be used as a place for blacks to pay the $2 poll tax that
was required for voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Juries were selected from voting lists, and the Klan did
everything in its power, from cross burnings to whippings, from
church burnings to murder, to thwart the power that a vote can
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Klan members knew, Dahmer Jr. said, that their world could only
exist if blacks could be held back from using their numbers to
elect change, could fill jury boxes and public offices with people
of varying color.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working to make sure this day would come,'' said Dahmer
Jr. of his father. ``This,'' he said of the diverse jury,
``represents America. This represents our community. The system has
now worked for us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As one of the younger members of the Dahmer family, a man in his
late teens or early twenties, moved through the crowded courtroom,
an older white man gripped his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw history here, son,'' the older man said.
</P>
<P>
   The case was history-making, for several reasons. While it was
only the second high-profile case in the past few years in which a
white supremacist was convicted of killing a civil rights leader _
Byron De La Beckwith was convicted in 1994 in Jackson, Miss., of
the 1963 murder of Medgar Evers _ this case was different.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith, a onetime salesman who had been a virtual nobody in
the ranks of white supremacists, murdered a nationally recognized
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer had not been nationally known, just a merchant and farmer
in Forrest County, outside Hattiesburg. But Bowers, a businessman
in Laurel, Miss., was a powerful Klan figure _ the only klansman
who had the authority to order a man's death, former Klan members
testified in the trial this week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who have been convicted in civil
rights-related killings have been foot soldiers, the ones who
actually threw the bombs, not the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, whose organization was tied to church burnings, murders
and other terrorism throughout the 1960s, has served only six years
_ for his role in the infamous Neshoba County murders of Andrew
Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney. That was a federal
conviction. No Mississippi jury, Bowers once bragged to another
klansman, would convict a white man of killing a black man in the
state of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, who had shown little emotion during the trial and showed
none at the verdict, answered no when the judge asked him if he had
anything to say before sentencing. But when his defense lawyer,
Travis Buckley, asked the judge to poll the jury, Bowers turned to
stare at them, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Once, that look might have struck fear in people who lived at
the mercy of Klan nightriders, but now it was just an old man
watching time catch up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the jury came out, he started emptying his pockets,
took off his watch in anticipation of what was going to happen,''
said Forrest County District Attorney Lindsay Carter. Prisoners are
not allowed to take such things insider Parchman Prison, where he
will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew what was coming,'' said Carter.

</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1965-66, Jones County, north of Hattiesburg,
was regarded as one of the meanest in Mississippi for Klan
activity. It was where Bowers made his base.
</P>
<P>
   In a farmhouse just to the south, outside Hattiesburg in Forest
County, Bowers summoned Klan members there in the months before
Dahmer's murder and asked them why ``something hadn't been done''
about Dahmer, former klansmen testified. Bowers planned Dahmer's
death, and on a cold January night, sent two carloads of Klansmen
south with 12 gallons of gasoline and shotguns. One way or the
other, Vernon Dahmer Sr. would be a dead man.
</P>
<P>
   The men hurled the gallons of gasoline into the house, where
Dahmer Sr., his wife and three of his children slept.
</P>
<P>
   He was burned so badly that the skin came loose from his arms,
but while his body was in flames, he fired his shotgun over and
over at the shapes darting through his yard, giving his wife and
children time to escape through the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   A former klansman turned government informant who took part in
that raid, Billy Roy Pitts, testified in this trial that he heard a
man ``cry out in distress'' from inside the burning house.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Robert Helfrich, the prosecutor who
handled the case, evoked that image for the jury. ``A man's voice
in distress,'' said Helfrich. ``And yes, he was a man. A man's
voice is still in distress, because Sam Bowers is still walking the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice delayed,'' he added, ``is not justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer was still standing that night as the Klansmen, so
surprised at the fury of his reaction to their attack that they
shot out the headlights of one of their own cars in confusion,
rumbled away. But his lungs were so badly seared by the flames that
he died in a hospital bed 12 hours later, in his wife's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tears that I am shedding, I am shedding for Vernon,''
said Mrs. Dahmer, standing later in the hot sun outside the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter, Bettie, 10 years old at the time of her father's
murder, was handed out a window of the house from her father to her
mother, and was already burned on her arms and forehead. After the
verdict she said she was not able to talk, and stood with tears in
her eyes as her brothers thanked prosecutors for bring Bowers back
to court.
</P>
<P>
   Citing new evidence, and under renewed pressure by the Dahmer
family and others to reopen the case, prosecutors here _ backed by
state Attorney General Mike Moore _ dusted off an old indictment of
Bowers and two other klansmen, Deavours Nix and Charles Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Nix testified from a wheelchair for a variety of health
problems, although a Jackson newspaper photographer had snapped his
picture playing golf a few months ago. Nix testified as a defense
witness Thursday that he had never heard Bowers use a racial slur,
let alone order a killing, and that the Klan was not a violent
organization. He said he joined because he had heard the Klan was a
benevolent organization that passed out fruit baskets to the poor
at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nix is charged with arson and Noble with murder and arson in the
Dahmer case. They are expected to go to trial later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dahmer family said they did not want to worry about that
now. They would celebrate this victory, quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts had testified earlier that Bowers' lawyer, Travis Buckley,
once attended Klan meetings himself. Friday, Buckley's efforts to
portray a government conspiracy against Bowers fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client was sacrificed to the Moore's political
ambitions and compared his client's prosecution to Hitler's
persecution of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley's witnesses did little to refute a parade of other
witnesses who painted a more ominous picture of Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses Thursday had testified that they saw a jubilant
Bowers boast about the killing days after it. ``Look at what my
boys did to that Dahmer'' Bowers had said, testified former
klansman Robert Earl Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, he said, was holding up a newspaper at the time, with
the story of Dahmer's death on the page. &QL;

WORLD EVENTS CATCH UP WITH MARKETS; DOW DROPS .9% IN VALUE

   Investors responding to a chain reaction of plunging world
markets forced the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 280
points Friday before it rebounded and ended with a modest loss.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering most of what was lost during hectic trading, the Dow
Jones industrial average, a basket of 30 of the country's premier
stocks, closed at 8533.65, down 77.76 points, or 0.9 percent.
Broader indexes, including the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq
Composite, took similiar roller coaster rides.
</P>
<P>
   US investors were reacting to a day of chaos in stock and
currency markets in emerging markets around the world, analysts
said, amid nervousness that a long-running bull market in this
country may be near its end.
</P>
<P>
   Russian stocks slid for a fifth day, with the main RTS-1 index
tumbling 6.9 percent. European markets responded with sharp
declines _ Germany's DAX stock index was down 5.4 percent, while
Britain's FTSE 100 lost 3.4 percent. The emerging markets panic
spread to Latin America where concerns about Venezuela's currency
caused markets there to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic comeback in the US market Friday afternoon was read
as an indication of investors' faith in this country's stability as
the full force of a widening global economic and banking crises hit
elsewhere. The Dow index has fallen 8.6 percent from its July peak
_ shy of a ``correction,'' or 10 percent decline _ but remains up
7.91 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of political instability in the world,''
said Jack Smiley, vice president of Easton Vance Management in
Boston. ``The US market still offers a great deal of good valuation
but we haven't had a correction like this in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The US bond market benefited most as investors fled unstable
currencies and scurried to put their money in US dollars: The yield
on 30-year Treasury bonds hit a series of record lows before
settling at 5.38 percent, the lowest rate since the government
began regularly selling the securities in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are ``flying to our bond market which is safety with a
capital `S,''' said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Thomson
Global Markets, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide panic was triggered by the panic inside Russia,
where the government Friday called for speedy passage of measures
needed to avert a collapse of the entire financial system. That
came a day after the government agreed to guarantee private bank
accounts. Day after day of bad news caused a 14 percent slide this
week in the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deep problems have been heaped on top of financial
system collapses and economic contractions across Asia over the
past year and concern about the stability of China's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in western Europe, which are closely tied to
Russia, also fell sharply and gave up a portion of the large gains
they have earned since January.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's market was hard hit because its banks are major
lenders to Russian enterprises. Investors jittery about extensive
ties to Latin America, an emerging market that is showing signs of
weakness, drove Spain's market down by 5.8 percent. Austria's
market fell by 4.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to focus just on Russia or Asia or Japan,''
said Peter Sullivan, European equity strategist for Goldman Sachs
International in London. ``The markets that are down the most in
Europe are those that are most exposed to emerging market shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets in South America also weakened Friday amid
speculation that Venezuela's currency is under severe pressure and
may be the next currency to be devalued. Venezuela said Friday it
would allow the bolivar currency to fluctuate more freely and
introduced a bill to speed reforms aimed at boosting confidence in
the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's stock market was the world's worst performer Friday,
losing 8.4 percent. Argentina's stock market lost 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a global currency crisis afoot,'' said Mark Madden,
emerging markets manager for Pioneer. ``Venezuela may be on the
verge of devaluing its currency.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Bolsa index fell by 2.4 percent and Brazil's stock
market was down 2.8 percent, after collapsing by 10 percent earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything particularly positive at the moment that
can offset a series of negatives,'' said Tim Thomas, head of global
equity team for Guinness Flight Investment Mangement Ltd. in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cumulatively there are a lot of things investors don't like,''
Thomas said.

CLINTON DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TERRORISTS AND MUSLIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   In explaining the decision to strike targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan on Thursday, the Clinton administration has been careful to
say that the United States was aiming at terrorist organizations
and their bases, not at a religion with adherents worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the world to understand that our actions today were not
aimed against Islam,'' President Clinton said Thursday, in remarks
that were unusual in a speech on national security for their
recognition of the broad importance of a religious faith, and for
declaring that faith to lie beyond any goals of U.S. foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton carefully distinguished between Muslims _
followers of what he called ``a great religion'' _ and radical
groups that hold to ``a horrible distortion of their religion to
justify the murder of innocents.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if, after a Cold War that obscured forces like
religion, ethnicity and national culture within a global struggle
between democracy and communism, Clinton was saying that his
administration did not want to see the struggle revived as a
confrontation between the West and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is remarkable to me,'' said John L. Esposito, director of
the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at the Georgetown
University School of Foreign Service, ``is that both the president
and the secretary of state went out of their way to say this is not
about religion.''
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton ``and his team were prepared to draw those
distinctions'' _ proclaiming disinterest toward Islam and a
determination to respond with force to violent groups that claim to
act in its name _ is ``important in terms of U.S. relations with so
many Muslim countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Esposito added that the United States still risks
accusations of a double standard with regard to the Muslim world.
``Will a comparable action be taken against the Serbs in Kosovo?''
he asked, citing a region of Serbia where a largely Muslim
population has come under siege from a Serbian army battling
guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   David Little, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace in
Washington, said he also thought that the administration's remarks
on Islam were necessary. ``I think the president needed to go out
of his way to emphasize this isn't an anti-Islamic campaign, but
was against terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Little added, ``I think there is now, among policy people, a
deep awareness that Islam-bashing is imprudent and incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a senior official said the administration
has been trying to show that it does not confuse Islam with the
actions of radical groups like that of Osama bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi businessman whom the administration has accused of
masterminding the recent bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a growing disdain for the rhetoric these
terrorists use in trying to wrap their actions in some religious
cause,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``We wanted to make a point we draw a distinction and it's
important.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said Clinton's speech was written before two American Muslim
organizations phoned the White House to ask that any remarks by the
president distinguish between individual terrorists and the vast
majority of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for one of those organizations, the
Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington, said, ``We're
pleased that he added the portions that this wasn't a war against
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious faith should be left out of it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Atif Harden, executive director of the American Muslim Council,
in Washington, said that among U.S. Muslims, a group estimated at
anywhere between 2 million and 6 million people, many were relieved
by Clinton's warnings, after the bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City in 1995, that Americans should not ``rush to
judgment'' in deciding who was responsible. Until the police
announced that they had arrested a former soldier, Timothy McVeigh,
in the case, some media reports, particularly on television, gave
free reign to the suspicion that Middle Eastern radicals might be
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But not all American Islamic groups viewed Clinton's speech
favorably. Aslam Abdullah, editor of The Minaret, a Los
Angeles-based magazine, said he considered the speech cynical and
wondered if the president was not in fact trying to call a negative
attention to Islam, despite his choice of words.

JUDGE DENIES OCEAN SPRAY REQUEST FOR INJUNCTION AGAINST PEPSI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal court has denied a request by Ocean Spray
Cranberries Inc. for a preliminary injunction that would prevent
PepsiCo Inc. from distributing some Tropicana juice products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has decided that it's more appropriate to deal with
this (issue) in a trial,'' an Ocean Spray spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray has a distribution agreement with Pepsi. But Pepsi
recently announced plans to acquire Ocean Spray rival Tropicana.
Presumably, once the acquisition was completed, Pepsi would
distribute single-serve Tropicana juices through the same channels
that it distributes single-serve Ocean Spray juices.
</P>
<P>
   Alleging that such a development would be a breach of its
contract, Ocean Spray, of Lakevill, Mass., filed suit against
Pepsi, of Purchase. N.Y., in US District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi claims Ocean Spray's suit is without merit, and Friday a
spokesman for the world's No. 2 soft-drink company said, ``We are
obviously pleased with the judge's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray said it has appealed that decision and that it
expects a ruling on the appeal some time next week.

CLINTON'S GIFTS TO LEWINSKY EXCEED EARLIER DISCLOSURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-POLL) 
(js) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During their final White House meeting on Dec. 28,
President Clinton gave Monica Lewinsky more than a half-dozen
``going-away'' presents, including an Alaskan stone carving and a
decorative pin, said several lawyers familiar with Clinton's
grand-jury testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The president met in the Oval Office for 20 minutes early that
December morning with Ms. Lewinsky, who was under subpoena to
testify in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against
Clinton, the lawyers said Friday. At the time, the former White
House intern was preparing to leave Washington for a job in New
York that Clinton's close friend, Vernon Jordan Jr., was helping
her try to secure.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts that Ms. Lewinsky received from Clinton _ the list was
even more extensive than previously disclosed _ had also been
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. They included such items as a
signed copy of a State of the Union address and a souvenir from
Radio City Music Hall, where Clinton celebrated his 50th birthday
at a fund-raising party in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the original interest in the gifts was aimed at
determining the degree of intimacy of their relationship. But on
Monday, both in his grand jury testimony and in his speech to the
nation, Clinton acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, how Clinton dealt with the gifts remains part of
his most serious problem as Starr investigates whether he committed
perjury and obstructed justice in the Jones case. In questions
posed this week to both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky before a grand
jury, prosecutors have tried to determine whether the president
sought to conceal the relationship from the Jones lawyers by
instructing Ms. Lewinsky to turn the gifts over to his secretary,
Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential aides argued that Clinton's willingness to
give Ms. Lewinsky new gifts in December after the subpoena had been
issued demonstrates he was not trying to obstruct justice. He had
earlier given Ms. Lewinsky a book of poetry and a dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was so worried about the gifts and told her to get them,
why would he turn around and get her more gifts?'' said one adviser
to the president, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said the president did not view the gifts to Ms.
Lewinsky as signifying anything serious because he routinely gives
keepsake items as mementos to many people. That adviser, who also
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that none of the gifts
were especially valuable or personal.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors pursued a vigorous line of questioning on this
issue in sessions this week with both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky,
said two lawyers with knowledge of the testimony. Prosecutors were
asking whether the president's gifts were part of an attempt to
keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet about the relationship. In December and
January, Jordan helped Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's testimony said that she
told Clinton that the Jones subpoena had demanded the gifts he had
given her. They talked about it, and Clinton told her that she
could not turn over the gifts if they were not in her possession,
Ms. Lewinsky was said to have testified.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Ms. Lewinsky received a phone call from Ms.
Currie, who said, ``I hear you have something for me,'' Ms.
Lewinsky told the grand jury, the lawyers said. And later that day,
they said Ms. Lewinsky testified, Ms. Currie went to her apartment
to retrieve the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But the president in his testimony on Monday adamantly denied
telling Ms. Currie or anyone else to retrieve the gifts, said a
lawyer familiar with the testimony. In fact, the president said he
did not know that Ms. Lewinsky had given the gifts to Ms. Currie
until after Starr's inquiry became public on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their 18-month relationship, Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky
exchanged numerous gifts. He gave her a T-shirt, a book of poetry,
a brooch, a hat pin and a stuffed animal. She gave him six ties and
several books, including the novel Vox, by Nicholson Baker.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in the Oval Office, Ms. Lewinsky also discussed
her plans to find a job in New York. They ended the meeting with a
kiss, Ms. Lewinsky has told friends.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prosecutors were preparing Friday to present further
testimony to the grand jury next week. They may call back Ms.
Currie and Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee who surreptitiously
tape-recorded Ms. Lewinsky for 20 hours as she discussed her
relationship with the president. &QL;

UTAH'S NATIONAL PARKS ARE NO LESS MARVELOUS THAN YELLOWSTONE, GRAND
CANYON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAYLN WILKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYCE CANYON, Utah _ Your hiking boots are barely out of the
box. Grizzled sideburns leak out from under a new cap. You are
obviously high on expectations and low on fitness. So what else
would you deserve and expect from a Utah park ranger?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' she says with an impatient sigh, ``all our trails are
strenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she agrees that on a sunny fall morning we should see
Bryce Canyon _ and see it afoot, not from a car safely parked on an
asphalt road. That means breaking in the new hiking boots on a
trail with switchbacks, trudging over landscape described by a
surveyor 125 years ago as ``a masterful work of giant hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Each member of our foursome is approaching or past the
nothing-more-strenuous-than-a-waltz age of 60. Yet we feel
reluctant to abandon high adventure, no matter the physical cost.
Not all that long ago, we navigated the deep blue of the eastern
Caribbean on a 45-foot sailboat without spilling a drop of rum or
inciting a mutiny. Another time, we went skiing and suffered but a
single knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Now we feel eager to challenge the natural masterworks of Utah _
Bryce Canyon, Zion National Park, Cedar Breaks and (listen to this,
Ms. Park Ranger) some 10,000-foot-high mountain bike trails.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Canyon is where we choose to begin. We park our rented car
at its rim, arm-wrestle the straps of day packs into place, and,
taking deep breaths, start down. Geologists would say we are really
starting back, for in these lands marked by fire, wind and water,
it is possible to see rocks formed in the Jurassic period. We
aren't the only fossils in Bryce Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Moving as briskly as new boots and old legs allow, we realize we
might survive this hike when, 45 minutes into our trek, we pass a
family of three hikers. Their youngest member is sleeping soundly
in a baby carriage. Later, we pass a group of French tourists. The
eldest looks to be from the Jurassic period and is managing quite
well walking in what appear to be house slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Survival anxiety somewhat alleviated, our concern turns to
another topic. It could be possible, we wonder, that if you've seen
one canyon, you've seen them all. Since we are veteran visitors to
the Grand Canyon, what if Bryce Canyon seems like a minor-league
ditch in comparison?
</P>
<P>
   Again, we have no cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Canyon isn't a ditch. It's a staggering 56-square-mile
configuration of rock steeples, walls, caves and, from the rims,
colorful views to what seems like forever and beyond. A century
ago, it was Ebenezer Bryce's ranch. To look into its wondrous maze
is to understand what old Ebenzer meant when he remarked, ``It's a
hell of a place to lose a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly a place to grow cattle or wheat or Wal-Marts. No
wonder it became a national park.
</P>
<P>
   ZIONWARD: The next day we find an even easier trail in Zion
National Park, which is less than two hours' drive southeast of
Bryce Canyon. This trail, I'm almost embarrassed to admit, is paved
and as smooth as a drag strip. It is as scenic as the baby-stroller
pathway at Bryce; this trail leads past a lagoon and under a
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Zion is another example of what erosion can accomplish, given
enough time. To the Mormon pioneers, the park's towers and cliffs,
stained with the hues of the ages, resembled temples. Hence the
park's name. Once there, you feel like humming ``Rock of Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail we take leads to the Narrows, where the Virgin River
enters a gorge that eventually shrinks to the size of an NFL
lineman. Here, the hiker's freeway ends and, to continue, you must
carry two things _ a permit from the park rangers and an acute
awareness of canyon meteorology.

WHITE HOUSE CALLS MISSILE ATTACKS SUCCESSFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration made measured claims of
success Friday for the cruise-missile attacks in the Sudan and
Afghanistan on Thursday, saying the attack on a mountain redoubt in
Afghanistan would disrupt training and, possibly, future attacks by
terrorists sponsored by Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy weather and haze obscured satellite photographs of what
the administration has described as a sprawling terrorist training
camp near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, hampering efforts to
learn the extent of the damage done when cruise missiles fired from
four Navy warships and one submarine pummeled the area.
</P>
<P>
   But senior administration officials said preliminary
assessments, based in part on sources other than spy satellites,
indicated the missiles destroyed or damaged many of the buildings
spread throughout the remote complex about 90 miles south of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of bin Laden sought to play down the extent of the
damage and said the Saudi-born millionaire was still alive and
ready to retaliate. The widely varying claims of damage and
casualties from both sides were impossible to verify independently.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the strike was
``successful in the sense that we destroyed a number of
facilities'' at the camp, known as Zhawar Kili Al-Badr. At the
White House, the president's national security adviser, Samuel
Berger, said, ``The attacks have significantly disrupted the
capability to use these camps as terrorist training facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, while circumspect in their choice of
words, left open the possibility that the United States was
prepared to strike at bin Laden's network again if necessary. ``We
have contingency plans that we are developing, and there may be
more in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration opened a new front in its
fight against bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the United States has
accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks, including the bombings of
the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two weeks ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed an executive order that, effective
Friday, placed bin Laden on the Treasury Department's list of
terrorists and their sponsors, clearing the way for officials to
identify and seize any of bin Laden's financial assets in the
United States, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in this context, money matters,'' Berger said
Friday, suggesting that the action could undercut bin Laden's
sponsorship of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not immediately clear whether bin Laden, whose
fortune is estimated between $200 million and $300 million dollars,
has any assets here. It was also unclear why bin Laden had not been
placed on the department's list earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO diplomat said Friday that the administration had begun
asking allies in Europe to help in the effort to freeze bin Laden's
assets and those of terrorist groups associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Thursday's strikes nor this latest step appeared to have
tempered bin Laden, who has vowed to wage war against the United
States. A man claiming to be a spokesman for bin Laden told the
editor of an Arabic newspaper in London, al-Quds al-Arabi, that bin
Laden had survived the missile attack and was vowing to avenge it
with attacks on American targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle has not yet started,'' the editor, Abdel-Bari
Atwan, quoted the spokesman as saying.

FAA BACKUP COMPUTER ALMOST UNAVAILABLE DURING OUTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Federal Aviation Administration officials Friday
tried to determine what caused a mainframe computer malfunction
that left some 75 air traffic controllers scrambling to keep 340
airplanes safely separated Wednesday evening, controllers said only
luck prevented a potential catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   When the mainframe computer crashed at 6:52 p.m., a backup
computer, known as DARC, kicked in at the Boston Center, which
handles most flights in New England and New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Even though controllers worked frantically to restore vital
information on their radar screens when the backup came on, parts
of it almost did not come on at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has learned that technicians who repair the system had
asked FAA managers on Wednesday to let them conduct training on the
DARC system. The managers refused. When technicians asked again,
the managers said they could use the system at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent out a message saying that DARC would be released to
maintenance at (7 p.m.),'' said William Johannes, local president
of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``Had this
failure occurred eight minutes later ... there would not even have
been blips on the radar screens. It would have been like looking at
a TV with the power off.''
</P>
<P>
   However, FAA spokesman Jim Peters emphasized that even if DARC
had been down for repairs, it could have been activated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   DARC ``is never unavailable for coverage and I cannot stress
that enough,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that if the technicians had been using it for training,
only six of the 25 sectors in the Boston Center would have been
affected and training could have been stopped quickly and the six
sectors could have been activated.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Johannes said, controllers had to write notes by hand
and pass them on to other controllers _ a process that is
considered the final backup with radar coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Had the DARC system not been available, controllers would have
had to use radios to direct airplanes to fly precise routes and
increase by 75 miles the separation between aircraft.

KENYANS HOLD SECOND SUSPECT IN EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Kenyan authorities are holding a second man in
connection with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the FBI
confirmed Friday. The FBI declined to comment on a local newspaper
report that witnesses had picked the suspect out in a line-up as
the man who threw a grenade at security guards outside the embassy
seconds before the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, FBI agents on Thursday afternoon raided
the premises in Nairobi of Mercy Relief International, an Islamic
charity active in Kenya and Somalia. It was not clear whether the
charity has any link to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire
identified by the Clinton administration as the main suspect in the
Aug. 7 bombings that killed more than 250 people in Nairobi and in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden controls dozens of Islamic businesses and charities
throughout North Africa and the Arab world, according to U.S.
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents confiscated a fax machine, several business ledgers,
assorted documents, about $4,000 in cash and a handful of
videotapes, said an official of the charity, Abdullah Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed also said the director of the organization, Mohammed
Abdulla, who is Sudanese, had been missing for at least three
weeks. Another employee of the charity, Saban Hassan, was taken
into custody by the agents, employees said.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspect detained in the bombing was identified by The
Nation newspaper as Khalid Mohammed. No other details were given.
Quoting unnamed officials, the Nation said a security guard and a
civilian employee of the embassy had positively identified him as
the attacker who had thrown the grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Horan, the special agent in charge of the FBI
investigation, acknowledged that the authorities had a second
suspect in custody, but declined to give details about the line-up
or the person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the main suspect, Mohammed Siddique Odeh, still
had not admitted to U.S. authorities that he took part in the Aug.
7 bombings. Neither has he implicated other people, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, agents also raided a house in Malindi, a coastal
town about 75 miles north of the port of Mombassa, and detained the
owner, identified as Hassan Omar Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   That has become commonplace here in recent days. More than 40
people, most of them of Middle Eastern ancestry, have been rounded
up and detained indefinitely by Kenyan police. The detainees
include some witnesses who appear to have little to do with the
bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, police arrested Jamil Hassan Abdi, a Kenyan man of
Yemeni parentage, in the town of Mandera on Thursday. The only
reason given to reporters was that Abdi had stayed at the Hilltop
Hotel in Nairobi between Aug. 4 and Aug. 7, when investigators
believe the bombing conspirators were staying at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said before leaving Nairobi for
Washington on Friday that the FBI had not detained anyone in
connection with the bombing. His statement rested on a narrow
technicality, however, since the Kenyans have arrested dozens of
suspects for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators' move on Mercy Relief International raises
interesting questions about the direction of the inquiry. The
charity assists mostly Somali nationals and has offices in
Mogadishu and other Somali towns.
</P>
<P>
   In Somalia, bin Laden has channeled financial support to certain
militia leaders, including Hussein Aidid, the head of Hebr Gedr
militia that controls part of the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has also funneled money to Al-Itihad, a radical
Islamic organization in Somalia that has been fighting the
Ethiopian government in the Ogaden region of that country.
</P>
<P>
   The main suspect, Odeh, who also goes by the last name Howaida,
is known to have lived for some time on Kenya's coast and,
according to local newspapers, married a Kenyan woman.
</P>
<P>
   On the coast, he would have been well-positioned to take
advantage of the shadowy world of gun-runners, drug dealers,
smugglers, bandits and mercenaries who cross and recross the
relatively lawless border between Somalia and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In part because Somalia has lacked a central government since
1991, the border is porous and customs controls are almost
non-existence. Gun traders have an easy time moving weapons, Kenyan
police say. Explosives would have been easy to smuggle across the
border as well.

BRYCE CANYON, Utah: canyon meteorology. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We wade into the river, ankle-deep, and look up. The rock walls
leap 2,500 feet into the blue sky. Obviously, they have not and
will never yield to a flash flood. This is impressive, because a
note in the park hiking guide warns that when nature's dams burst,
water in the gorge can rise 100 feet in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Canyons of Color,'' Caroline Wilson recounts a
childhood memory of a flash flood that nearly swept away her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were heading up North Walsh and all of a sudden my mother
leaned out the (car) window and said, `What's that noise? Sounds
like thunder.' My dad stuck his head out the window and muttered,
`Oh, my God.' He whipped the car over a shrub and onto the nearest
bank above the wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tumbled out of the Chevrolet and stared. Twenty yards
upstream, there came a froth of foam and flotsam the color of a
chocolate milkshake. A ton of muddy water was right behind that
foam. We were stuck there for the night. The flood picked up trees
and rocks and swept them downstream with great force. The roar was
like a busy freeway, and the ground shook beneath us all night.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder native guides refused to take early explorers and
surveyors into the Narrows. Today, the trail there is 16 miles long
and, properly equipped, hikers can obtain a permit to walk it all.
But we stopped where the native guides stopped, happy with just
enough rushing water to cool our toes.
</P>
<P>
   ROAMING ROOM: Zion can seem remote, since it is 2 1/2 hours
north of Las Vegas and 3 1/2 hours south of Salt Lake City. Yet it
has the same tourist pressures and problems as Yosemite or the
Grand Canyon. Plans are being made to banish automobiles at Zion in
two years and ferry visitors in and out of the park by shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   However you finally get there, once inside the Utah parks there
is room to roam _ 61 trail miles in Bryce and 55 in Zion. Despite
our experiences, rangers warn that most of these miles are beyond
the range of strollers and elderly French tourists.
</P>
<P>
   If the American masses _ as well as the French and even a
busload of visitors from China with whom we shared a trail in Bryce
_ still want to get out and walk, there is another option. Cedar
Breaks National Monument is a virtual secret, though it is just 35
miles east of Utah's Interstate 15.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Breaks, too, has fascinating trails. We try one that
meanders through a forest and around a lake. Another one _ and on
the same day, too! _ follows along a ridge that offers views over a
2,500-foot-deep canyon and across the Utah plains beyond. We walked
these paths in near-seclusion, except for the company of mountain
larks and occasional meetings with beavers.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north of Cedar Breaks, I wander timidly into a
mountain bike rental shop at Brian Head. I figure the kid behind
the counter will card me _ ``Sorry, Mister, nobody over 21
admitted.'' Instead, he sends me and my fellow travelers along new
trails on 21-speed steeds, adding helpfully that the Log Cabin
Trail might be the easiest.
</P>
<P>
   This trail does take us through meadows, across creeks, past a
pioneer cabin and, two hours later, back to civilization. It was
all pretty country, but at an elevation of 10,000 feet it is lung-
and thigh-busting to bike around it. Fortunately, Brian Head is
sophisticated enough for hot tub plumbing (and two video rental
shops, but no gas stations), so we have recovered enough by
midafternoon to try a wheeled descent from the 11,000-foot-high
perch of the town itself.
</P>
<P>
   Flying down the switchbacks in high gear, I find myself agreeing
with the kid in the bike shop. A healthy tourist can handle these
trails at almost any age. But no, when we return the bikes he
doesn't offer a senior citizen discount.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a week, we have also hiked the Mountain of
Mystery, Weeping Rock, the Queen's Throne and Angel Landing. We
have seen mule deer, antelope and elk. It's all nice country, and
we are able to think of it this way: In all of it, only the rocks
of ages are really old.

ROME, MY DEAR WATSON, WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The mystery of the disappearing Nobel Peace
Prize is about to be solved, my dear Watson, almost 10 years after
that check for $339,000 first appeared to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   The check was last seen briefly at a ceremony in the hall of
Oslo University, in Norway, on the wet and chilly morning of Dec.
10, 1988, when Javier Perez de Cuellar, then the U.N.
secretary-general, stuffed it into his breast pocket after formally
accepting that year's Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the 10,500
blue-helmeted peacekeeping soldiers his organization had sent to
keep order in trouble spots around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was cashed and deposited. But then the money itself simply
seemed to vanish from view. For almost a decade, the United Nations
uttered not a word about what it had done, or planned to do, with
the money. That was decidedly odd for an organization perennially
strapped for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally some suspected a fiendish purloining of funds. But the
truth is far more prosaic. Put 5,000 international civil servants
from 185 countries into a 38-story skyscraper and what do you get?
A recipe for indecision. The United Nations simply could not make
up its mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Marrack Goulding, the warden of St. Anthony's College at
Oxford University, who was in charge of U.N. peacekeeping when the
Nobel Prize was awarded, said the secretary-general wanted to use
the money for a high-profile essay competition that would encourage
young people to take an interest in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an idea I was sympathetic towards myself,'' Sir Marrack
said. But it fell victim to the curse of Babel, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   If the essays were to be written in English, Anglophones would
enjoy an unfair advantage. But if all languages were allowed, the
cost of translation would be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders of peacekeeping forces naturally wanted the money
spent on a shiny new medal for their soldiers to wear. But once
again the United Nations' passion for evenhandedness thwarted
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it would be unfair to give such a medal only to present
and future peacekeeping soldiers. But the United Nations doubted
that it could track down all those who had served under its flag in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the money was still unresolved when Boutros
Boutros-Ghali took over as secretary-general in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He favored using the check to build a wall-like monument to
those killed on peacekeeping duty, similar to the Vietnam War
Memorial in Washington. But who exactly would be commemorated?
Would peacekeepers killed in drunken-driving accidents be eligible,
or those who died of natural causes? And what about civilian staff
members, like secretaries, cooks and interpreters? Once again
indecision carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later when Kofi Annan became secretary-general, he
embarked on another quest for a good cause to spend the money on.
And now his officials believe they finally have one.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Security Council entered the picture by
adopting Resolution 1121, which created a Dag Hammarskjold Medal,
named after the organization's most famous secretary-general, to be
awarded to the families of the more than 1,500 people, civilian and
military, who have died on peacekeeping missions, no matter what
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   So on Oct. 6, when the United Nations celebrates the 50th
anniversary of its first peacekeeping operation _ organized in 1948
to oversee the truce ending the first Arab-Israeli war _ the
secretary-general plans to announce a double initiative.
</P>
<P>
   First the United Nations will issue Dag Hammarskjold Medals to
the relatives of all slain peacekeepers, paid for out of its own
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Nobel Peace Prize check will be spent on a memorial at
the U.N. headquarters in New York commemorating those fallen
peacekeepers, as well as any who may die in the years ahead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the Dag Hammarskjold Medal will go to civilians as well as
soldiers, the secretary-general has chosen an egg-shaped crystal
object designed by the New York firm of Louis Nelson Associates
that could be displayed, say, in a living room. It will carry the
dead peacekeeper's name, the U.N. logo and the words, in English
and French, ``In the Service of Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interpreting the word `medal' loosely,'' said Shashi
Tharoor, the secretary-general's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the first recipient will be the family of
Hammarskjold, who died in a mysterious plane crash in 1967 while
trying to restore peace in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations has not chosen a design for the
peacekeeping memorial, so it remains uncertain when, and indeed
whether, that Nobel Prize check is finally going to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the good news is that the $339,000 that Perez de
Cuellar pocketed almost a decade ago has grown to about $700,000
today, thanks to the miracle of compound interest. Indecision, my
dear Watson, has its own rewards. Now where did I put my violin?

A 20,000 PERCENT BOUNCE: NOW THAT'S VOLATILITY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky., Ohio, Ill., Conn., N.Y., Mass., Ga.)  (af) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As president of the Enron Corp., which trades more
electricity than anyone else, Jeffrey S. Skilling presumably knows
all the risks. But he is the first to acknowledge that he is still
learning just how this most volatile of all commodity markets
bounces. And he has 14 mathematicians with doctorates to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps explain why companies with less expertise in trading
electricity and futures are taking huge hits, while Enron made
modest, though undisclosed, profits. Just a few weeks ago, the LG&AMP;E
Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky., announced losses of $225 million _
about $315 million before taxes _ from trading electricity and then
shutting most of its trading operations.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares fell $3, or 10.9 percent, in four weeks, to $24.5625;
it closed on Friday at $26.4375. Other companies, including First
Energy of Akron, Ohio, and Illinova of Decatur, Ill., also said
their earnings had been dented as a result of volatile prices,
although not so much.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout continues. Just last week, Power Company of America
LP, a privately held electricity trading company in Greenwich,
Conn., which had defaulted on some contracts, filed for bankruptcy
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder investors might also be at a loss in assessing the
risks companies are taking. The deregulation of electricity and the
birth of trading in it have multiplied the perils for the utilities
and their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies disclose enough to allow even full-time analysts
to say who is trying to learn this new form of poker by playing at
the high-stakes tables.
</P>
<P>
   There are some ways, however, to tell the difference between the
Enrons and the LG&AMP;E's. First, scorekeepers should understand that
electricity is nearly impossible to store, with demand soaring in
unpredictable stretches of hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's power grid has so many bottlenecks that regional
squeezes can become severe. That means prices can go wild, more
than for any other commonly traded commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in late June, power temporarily traded at wholesale for as
much as $7,500 a megawatt-hour, more than 200 times the normal
level. If utilities could pass this cost on to customers, the owner
of even a modest home would pay about $400 a day in
air-conditioning bills.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't. So companies like LG&AMP;E, which had contracted to
supply power to other utilities over the long term at fixed prices,
had to buy at high short-term prices. It was not unlike the fix
that savings and loans got themselves into by lending long-term and
borrowing short-term.
</P>
<P>
   Steven A. Parla, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
therefore favors companies that are already experienced in trading
natural gas, which was deregulated years before electricity. ``The
players who have spent the last 10 years trading what has been the
most volatile widely traded commodity on earth, which is natural
gas, will be the most successful at trading what will become the
most volatile widely traded commodity on earth over the next 10
years, which is electricity,'' Parla said.
</P>
<P>
   In this category, he and several other analysts and industry
executives put not only Enron, but also Duke Energy and Dynergy,
which recently changed its name from the NGC Corp. Duke Energy has
gained its expertise through buying Panhandle Eastern and Louis
Dreyfus Natural Gas. Dynergy, like Enron, has long been occupied
primarily with natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike LG&AMP;E, these companies are all large enough to withstand a
few jolts. ``LG&AMP;E is among the bigger companies in power trading,
but among the smaller utilities,'' said Barry Abramson, an analyst
at Paine Webber. ``So when things go bad, it has a very big
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts advise investors to try to determine whether companies
trading electricity are betting on the direction of prices. It can
be hard for outsiders to know. But LG&AMP;E had disclosed that it had
long-term, fixed-price sales contracts, implying a bet that cheaper
electricity would allow it to fulfill those contracts profitably.
</P>
<P>
   Enron aims to supply electricity, financing, risk management and
other services while limiting its own exposure to price movements.
It is a complicated task, requiring computer systems, statisticians
and financial controls sufficient for constant assessment of the
combined effects of a company's generating capacity, sales and
purchase agreements and financial instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is the ability to stay on top of the game. ``Being a
winner in electricity does not mean being on the right side of the
market,'' said Kurt Launer, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``Being a winner in electricity means being able to
provide a service to customers in a deregulated environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all companies trading electricity, say they have
sufficient controls, as did LG&AMP;E, although it acknowledged in two
previous quarters that its electricity trading had left it with
unspecified losses.
</P>
<P>
   John R. McCall, an executive vice president, said that though
prices might never return to $7,500, they would remain volatile
enough to harm other utilities that are still trading.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, however, companies trading electricity
appear to be able to hide some of their mistakes behind accounting
standards better suited to the stable, plodding electricity
providers of yore than to today's gunslingers.
</P>
<P>
   Few follow Enron's example of reporting the current market value
of its positions every quarter; instead, most utilities report
gains or losses only after they close out their futures positions
and long-range contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of risk is when a utility lacks enough generating
capacity to supply its own customers and to fulfill its contracted
commitments to other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   When the city of Springfield, Mass., defaulted on a contract to
supply power to LG&AMP;E, the utility was forced to pay high spot
market rates for enough power to deliver to the Oglethorpe Power
Co. of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Enron executives, sometimes accused by analysts of taking
untoward risks, try to reassure investors. But in recent weeks,
they have found themselves denying rumors not of losses but of
electricity trading gains of as much as $750 million.

TOO MANY BOATS DEPLETING MAINE COD FISHERY, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years after overfishing caused the collapse of the
once-vast cod population on Georges Bank, scientists say cod
fishermen have moved north and are on the verge of depleting
another important fishing ground, this time in the Gulf of Maine
that extends as far south as Cape Ann in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service say their
finding that the cod population in the Gulf of Maine is near
collapse, the 13th New England fish population that is officially
``overfished,'' illustrates a central fact in the continuing
crisis: There are too many fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The federal officials say that Gulf of Maine cod, economically
vital to hundreds of small boat fishermen from Gloucester to
Eastport, Maine, have faced intense fishing pressure since 1994 as
former Georges Bank fishermen moved in and local fishermen
increased their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have too many boats,'' said National Marine Fisheries
Service Deputy Director Andrew Rosenberg, who estimates that
eventually the New England codfishing fleet will have to be cut
roughly in half. ``You can't continue to exert the kind of pressure
that we did in the past, even if the fisheries recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearing Gulf of Maine cod are part of a growing string
of troubled fisheries in New England from lobster to monkfish to
scallops. Only eight of the region's 33 commercial fish stocks are
harvested within safe limits, according to a National Marine
Fisheries Service report.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, overfishing continues as fishermen try to offset declining
catches by working harder to satisfy a consumer demand for seafood
that has not declined with the fishing grounds. For instance,
steady demand for dwindling cod has pushed up prices, giving
fishermen incentive to catch more despite warnings that the
population is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite waves of fishing restrictions from the New England
Fishery Management Council, relatively few fishermen are getting
out of the business. Only 39 fishermen gave up permits to catch cod
and other groundfish last year out of 1,810 permit holders, despite
a federal effort to buy fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen say they already sacrifice heavily in the name of
conservation. The fishermen's assistance center in Gloucester alone
has retrained and found jobs for 250 fishing industry employees and
their families since 1995, and those who remain face a bewildering
array of limits on their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, fishermen are fighting the National Marine
Fisheries Service call for a clampdown on cod fishing in the Gulf
of Maine, calling it unfair and unnecessary. They say a recently
adopted 400-pound limit on daily cod catch should be enough, while
allowing some fishermen to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying allow some of us to survive, at least the roots,
so that later the tree can grow. They are ... totally getting rid
of the roots,'' said Angela Sanfilippo of the Gloucester
Fishermen's Wives. She said closure of the cod fishery would force
at least some of the 214 small boat fishermen on Cape Ann to find
other work.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the fishing crisis in New England, a microcosm of
a global dilemma, is an industry that has become too good at what
it does. Sophisticated electronic equipment allows fishermen to
precisely track their quarry, while 200-foot-wide drag nets
virtually vacuum the fish out of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the US government encouraged the industry to
grow after the 1976 Magnuson Act gave the United States exclusive
control over fishing within 200 miles of the coast, subsidizing an
explosion of the fleet that finally exhausted the famed Georges
Bank fishing ground in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   National Marine Fisheries Service biologists say the rapid
decline of cod in the Gulf of Maine mirrors the Georges Bank
collapse. Fishermen catch nearly half of all the cod in the gulf
each year, far outstripping nature's ability to replace them, just
as they did on Georges Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists' advice for the Gulf of Maine is just as
stark as it was for Georges Bank, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishing rate ought to be cut to as close to zero as
possible,'' said National Marine Fisheries Service biologist Steve
Murawski, whose recommendation will be taken up at an August 27
emergency meeting of the fishery management council.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Georges Bank, however, much of the cod catch in the Gulf
of Maine is made by small boats that can't make the 50 miles-plus
trip out to Georges Bank, and many of those small boat owners blame
regulators for the gulf's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They closed down Georges Bank and there's a huge amount of
horsepower which was diverted into the Gulf of Maine,'' said Dean
Tsonas, a fisherman in Hampton, N.H. ``It is totally unconscionable
that they allowed this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Hopkins, an attorney with the Environmental Defense
Fund and a member of the New England Fishery Management Council,
says the near-shore can't blame the problem only on interlopers
from Georges Bank. He said it is ``crystal clear'' that the small
boats were landing too many fish also.
</P>
<P>
   ``As painful as it is, and as much as there will be an impact
(on fishermen), there aren't many other options'' to closing the
Gulf of Maine to codfishing, said Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   To date, restrictions on fishing have had some positive effects,
especially in closed areas of Georges Bank where cod populations
have begun to rebound. But fishermen have also undercut the
restrictions by fishing harder and using new technologies that
increase their catch.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oversized fishing fleet keeps constant pressure on
regulators to relax rules or re-open fishing grounds at the first
sign of improvement. On Georges Bank, for example, the National
Marine Fisheries Service is studying whether to reopen parts of
Georges Bank to scallopers amid signs that some scallopers were
dredging there illegally anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Murawski of the National Marine Fisheries Service says his
agency won't allow scalloping unless it's proven the scallopers
won't also catch cod or other groundfish. But some observers view
the scallop study as a cave-in to industry pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a vocal constituency contacting Congress saying
regulations are hurting us and you need to get the council to go
slower,'' said Hopkins of the council, noting that even Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci had recently written to council members
urging them to ``take it easy on the scallopers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate solution for the scallopers as well as other
fisheries is less fishing, said Rosenberg of the National Marine
Fisheries Service. He supports a scallop fleet of 100 to 120 boats
instead of the current 211, and he believes the number of permits
for groundfishing should be halved as well. But he says such goals
are difficult to reach quickly and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government tried to cut the number of boats in 1995
and 1996, buying 69 highly productive boats under a $25 million
buy-out program. WHile the buy-out eliminated about 8 percent of
the groundfishing fleet, it did not address the hundreds of
fishermen who aren't fishing for cod now, but easily could return
if fishing improves.
</P>
<P>
   Until this ``latent'' fishing power is eliminated, Rosenberg
said, it will be difficult to permanently protect the cod.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Anderson, a New Hampshire fisherman on the New England
Fishery Management Council, believes the fisheries service is too
gloomy, and that his industry will recover. But, if government is
determined to reduce the fleet, he has some advice: Do it openly,
and pay fishermen for their loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an unstated mandate that you're going to reduce this
down to a few people who can be managed quite easily, then please
come out and say it ... then people can plan appropriately,'' said
Anderson.

JEFF GORDON A CHEATIN' DAWG? NAW, HE'S JUST GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He cheats.
</P>
<P>
   That's the latest rumor making the rounds among the huge segment
of NASCAR's fandom that loves to loath the sport's poster boy, Jeff
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that's it. That's why Wonder Boy has won a record-tying
four consecutive races, and why he'll probably break the record
with a victory tonight in Bristol, Tenn. And that's why he's on
track to become just the fifth driver to win three championships.
</P>
<P>
   He's a no-good, cheatin' dawg.
</P>
<P>
   And get this. Those NASCAR people not only know about it,
they're in on it. You ever notice how he gets a yellow flag just
when he needs one?
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as that
earlier rumor that NASCAR officials let Dale Earnhardt cheat to win
the Daytona 500 this year.
</P>
<P>
   That one, at least, sort of made sense. Why not reward ol' Dale
for everything he has done for stock-car racing? Kind of like a
lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon? Preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Why would NASCAR, with it's well-documented penchant for
legislating parity, want to help a driver? Especially a young
whipper-snapper like Gordon, who really isn't ``one of us'' anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rumor that the legions of Gordon haters _ the bitter
souls who boo his every move and cheer when he wrecks _ desperately
want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry guys and gals, it just ain't so.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it's hard to understand the depth of feeling that
Gordon evokes.
</P>
<P>
   He's young, handsome, well-spoken. He's talented. He's humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how I got here,'' he said last week after
winning in Michigan, his fourth consecutive victory. ``I have to
pinch myself. I don't believe it. Mark Martin deserved this win. He
should be the guy who's here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a man of faith, and while there might be rumors about
cheating, there's not a hint out there of drinking, drugs or
carousing.
</P>
<P>
   He's everything, in short, America should be looking for in a
hero.
</P>
<P>
   He should be cheered. Instead, he's jeered.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think it's because he's the antithesis of
the stereotypical good old boy stock-car racer and fan. He was born
on the West Coast and raised in the Midwest, far from the sport's
deep-fried Southern roots.
</P>
<P>
   It's somehow unsettling to think it's because he's too good,
he's too talented, his smile too bright, his wife too pretty, his
checks too big. If that's the case, it doesn't speak very highly of
our society.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because people are simply tired of seeing Gordon win
all the time. If so, that would make him a lot like Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gordon is a lot like Jordan in another way.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, second in the points race to Gordon last year and
third this year, recently invoked Jordan's name in discussing his
rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop Michael Jordan from scoring points or setting
records, can you?'' Jarrett said. ``Well, going up against Jeff is
sort of like the same thing. You know it's going to happen. You
just hope you can stop him from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Gordon so good? Why is Gordon, at the still tender age of
27, going after a record tonight? Not because he cheats, but
because he's like Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jordon, he has been blessed with an immense amount of
talent. Even someone like Rusty Wallace, who isn't exactly Gordon's
biggest fan, admits the boy racer already is one of NASCAR's
all-time top 10.
</P>
<P>
   But like Jordan, that isn't enough. Jordan wins championships
because of an outstanding supporting cast. Gordon wins races and
championships because his crew chief, Ray Evernham, is the best in
the business, because he has an outstanding pit crew and because he
is bankrolled by the deep pockets of Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon goes for a modern-era record tonight when he lines up for
the Goody's Headache Powder 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Being humble, he doesn't expect to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't thinking a lot about four in a row, so it's hard
for us to think about five in a row,'' he said. ``We've got to look
at the big picture and the championship, so we'd be happy with a
top-five finish.''
</P>
<P>
   There's so many variables at Bristol it'll be hard to do. Even a
driver having a great ride easily can get caught up in a wreck on
the .533-mile, high-banked oval and have his race ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can have a bad race at Bristol,'' said Mark Martin,
second in the points. ``It takes more than just a good car to win
there. You have to have luck on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't be wise to bet against Gordon. Not because he
cheats, and not because of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's that good.

MOBSTER FELT BETRAYED BY FBI AFTER HIS ARREST IN 1995 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sitting in his jail cell, week after week, Stephen
Flemmi felt abandoned, double-crossed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the bargain had held. He and his criminal partner
James ``Whitey'' Bulger fed the bureau information on their rivals
in the Mafia. In turn, the FBI tipped them off to investigations,
warned them away from fellow criminals whose phones were tapped,
bought them Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   They were protected and prized. Until they were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest in January 1995 on extortion and racketeering
charges, Flemmi waited for the FBI to say the words that would free
him, to reveal the Faustian bargain it had made in its zeal to
dismantle the Mob.
</P>
<P>
   But the words never came, only silent betrayal from the agents
he'd funneled information to for 30 years, particularly John
Connolly, the one who'd courted him and Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be up here testifying on our behalf,'' Flemmi
testified Friday, trying to convince a federal judge to drop the
charges because the FBI had promised not to prosecute him or
Bulger. ``I feel we've been adandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was first arrested at gunpoint outside a downtown
restaurant, Flemmi expected that Bulger would straighten things
out. ``I believed that Jim Bulger would contact the people who
would be able to help us...I expected someone to offer assistance,
namely John Connolly.''
</P>
<P>
   The help never came. After being denied bail twice, Flemmi said
he asked Bulger associate Kevin Weeks to get in touch with
Connolly. ``I waited in jail for 27 months for John Connolly to
intervene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has refused to testify about his dealings with Bulger
and Flemmi without a grant of immunity. But he has publicly
criticized the FBI for going back on its word, saying Bulger and
Flemmi had been given permission to continue their gambling and
loansharking operations while acting as informants.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi insisted that his silence on the deal he claimed to have
with the FBI was caused by the bureau's refusal to do the right
thing. He said he was also concerned that exposing his and Bulger's
longtime roles as informants would endanger Bulger, who fled before
the 1995 indictments and remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   But the government sees its differently. Under cross-examination
Friday in US District Court, Assistant US Attorney Fred M. Wyshak
Jr. suggested that Flemmi concocted the story about having been
granted immunity from the FBI as a last-minute defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexplicable why he sat in jail for 2 1/2 years without
saying anything,'' Wyshak said, addressing US District Court Judge
Mark L. Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak also cast doubt on Flemmi's claim that he and Bulger were
tipped off to the indictments by former FBI supervisor John Morris
a week before they were handed down. Given that Bulger believed
Morris had confirmed Bulger's role as an FBI informant to the
Boston Globe Spotlight team in the fall of 1988 -- angering Bulger
and perhaps endangering his life -- Wyshak suggested it was
implausible that Morris would tip off Bulger more than six years
later, when he no longer even worked for the Boston FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can prove that that's absolutely not true,'' Wyshak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who testified earlier this spring under a grant of
immunity, denied alerting Bulger and Flemmi to the 1995 indictment
and recounted a threatening phone call he got from Bulger after
he'd been on the run for nine months. During the call, a ``menacing
and vengeful'' Bulger accused Morris of making him a ``marked man''
for outing him as an informant but said nothing about the FBI
reneging on its immunity deal, Morris testified.
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak tried to show that Flemmi was closely tracking the grand
jury that would indict him and that he fled to Montreal in the fall
of 1994 in anticipation of charges being brought.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is holding pretrial hearings to decide whether Flemmi's
immunity claim is valid and if so whether charges against him
should be dropped. Since the 1995 indictments allege a decades-long
criminal conspiracy between Bulger and Flemmi's Winter Hill Gang
and the Mafia, dismissing the charges against Flemmi would imperil
the case against his co-defendants as well, including New England
Mafia boss Francis P. ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, mob soldier
Robert DeLuca and Winter Hill gangster John Martorano.
</P>
<P>
   During Wyshak's questioning, Flemmi invoked his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination more than two dozen times,
refusing to answer questions about discussions he and Bulger may
have had about fleeing in the months before they were indicted.
Flemmi was also vague about the time he spent in Montreal and the
landlord who rented him an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to answer questions about Bulger leaving for the
West Coast with his girlfriend in September 1994 and refused to say
if he'd seen Bulger since then or spoken to him.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi has testified that he remained in contact with Connolly
even after Connolly retired from the bureau in December 1990,
mainly providing information on the activities of Salemme. Flemmi
said he and Connolly often discussed the ongoing grand jury
investigation targeting him and Bulger, but he said he never
considered asking Connolly to intercede with the US Attorney's
office to block his prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a position to keep us from being prosecuted, that's
why I wasn't too concerned,'' Flemmi said.

   BERLIN _ European leaders on Friday generally supported
President Clinton's bombing raids in Sudan and Afghanistan, and
even those who appeared uneasy defended the right of a country to
counterattack terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a friend of Clinton and one
of the United States' most consistent allies, was among the
president's effusive supporters on Friday. The German government
``supports all measures to combat terrorism,'' he said, adding that
governments must be united on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from most other Western European nations, among them
Britain, Spain and Austria, characterized the U.S. attacks as a
fully justifiable defense and appeared ready to believe the Clinton
administration's assertions that the strikes were a response to
overwhelming evidence it had amassed of planned terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the French government, which has quarreled repeatedly with
the United States over the threat of military action against Iraq,
seemed ready to support the White House. Though the French Foreign
Ministry issued a somewhat chilly statement Friday morning that it
had ``taken note'' of the missile attack, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin was more explicitly supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever terrorism is launched from, we must respond with a
decisive and firm answer,'' Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair, the British prime minister, praised the United
States. ``I hope that everyone will understand that the U.S.A. must
have the right to defend itself against terrorism,'' he said while
on vacation Friday in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Schuessel, foreign minister of Austria and a leading
foreign-policy adviser to the European Union, said, ``I presume
that the United States can justify its attacks against the targets
in Afghanistan and Sudan with incontrovertible evidence.'' He
called for international collaboration against terrorism in order
to prevent a ``spiral of violence and counterviolence.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Friday night whether the United States had
given its European allies any notice of its plans. Kohl said he had
been informed about the action in a timely fashion, and few
political leaders complained about being left out.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's opponents in the Social Democratic Party were also
supportive of the United States. Rudolf Scharping, the head of the
party in Parliament, said the attack was justified.

SECURITY BEEFED UP AT US-LINKED INSTALLATIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fears that terrorists could retaliate against the
United States by striking on American soil or targeting Americans
abroad have prompted heightened security across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While airport workers searched through suspicious bags, and US
corporations with foreign operations took added measures to protect
employees, the federal government adopted security precautions
taken during the Persian Gulf War. The moves follows Thursday's
missile strikes of terrorist operations in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Tightened security was visible in the nation's capital: Metal
barriers were up at entrances to the Justice Department, police
cars ringed entrances to the State Department, and National Park
Police fanned out across Washington to beef up protection at
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the new face of terrorism,'' said Harvey Kushner, a
specialist on domestic terrorism. ``This ratchets up the risk to
both Americans in the US and abroad, whether they are tourists,
businessmen or diplomats. This is a big-time threat, and it isn't
going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration banned travel by US citizens
or individuals holding US-issued tickets to _ or over _ Afghanistan
and Sudan, but did not recommend additional measures to aviation
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has closed several embassies around the
world, evacuated nonemergency personnel in others, and strengthened
its most recent travel advisory by issuing a ``worldwide caution''
to US nationals working or vacationing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The warning tells travelers to exercise ``much greater caution''
than normal and to keep in touch with the nearest embassy or
consulate for up-to-date information on security. It does not
advise people to cancel or cut short their trips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI issued a general security warning to all law
enforcement agencies, and the Justice Department warned its 117,000
employees to take precautions against possible terrorist
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a position to tell other agencies what to do to
enhance their security, but we told them they should have a
heightened awareness,'' said Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also moved from ``Threatcom Normal'' to ``Threatcon
Alpha,'' explained as ``a general threat of possible terrorist
activity against installations, building locations and/or
personnel, the nature of which are unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN poll showed only 10 percent of Americans fear a terrorist
attack. Specialists, however, warned against complacency, pointing
out retaliatory action against US installations or individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Pan Am 103 was payback for US attacks on Libya,
according to Kushner. And the more recent killing of two Americans
working in Pakistan was in response to the conviction of a Muslim
fundamentalist for his role in killing CIA workers outside the
agency's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrorist network built in Afghanistan exists here in the
US,'' Kushner said. ``Most of the people involved in the World
Trade Center bombing had links to the terror network we're trying
to take out, but they are here. We're fighting a loosely knit
network of fanatical radical terrorists who are nameless and
faceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents contacted Friday did not see a significant drop or
change in travel plans, and airlines did not comment on whether
ticketing has been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to take this in stride,'' said Evvy Harris, a
travel agent at Austin Travel in New York specializing in
international travel. ``Frankly, people here are more afraid of
going in the subway tunnels.''
</P>
<P>
   There is usually a lag time of a few weeks after an incident
before bookings trail off, said Richard D'Ambrosio, public affairs
director for American Express travel services.
</P>
<P>
   But corporations are concerned about the safety of their
personnel. William J. Daly, a former FBI counterintelligence agent
and managing director at Kroll Associates, an international
security firm based in New York, said he had been receiving calls
from corporations with multinational operations all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any one time, there are several million Americans outside
the US on business, and they have a security exposure. Businesses
literally fly American flags and represent our way of life,'' Daly
said. ``But people are still naive about protecting themselves
against terrorist attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses need a highly detailed plan to evacuate employees and
respond to bomb threats, as well as heightened awareness of their
physical safety in their work area, said Leonard C. Cross, a former
FBI counterterrorism specialist who investigated the World Trade
bombing as well as other Middle East bombings. Garages and any
entrance point should be monitored, and individuals should keep a
low profile and be aware of being watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``US businesses with large buildings in manufacturing areas or
with prominent signs advertising their company are very soft
targets, and many don't have adequate security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, we take adequate measures to protect our
personnel abroad,'' said Dave Shea, spokesman for Raytheon Co., a
defense contractor. Shea refused to explain measures taken for
security reasons. So did Matt Miller of Gillette Co., although he
said ``security was always a concern'' and that the company was
``monitoring the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Airports in Boston, Los Angeles and San Fransisco increased
security by searching any suspicious bag and towing unidentified
cars, while cities such as New York had police encircling some
government buildings.

MUSLIMS VOICE FURY OVER U.S. STRIKES

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In mosques, on streetcorners, and from some
government ministries, many Muslims voiced fury Friday over the
U.S. missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan and predicted that
the assault would beget more violence.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation came from around the Islamic world, and were
issued by clerics, officials, and ordinary citizens. U.S. flags
were burned in Libya, Pakistan and on the West Bank, and on this
Islamic holy day, calls to prayer even in the heart of Jerusalem
were followed by angry inveighing against what was being called
``aggression on our Muslim brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask God to foil the Americans' evil plans,'' Youssef Abu
Sneinah, an imam of the historic Al Aksa Mosque, declared in a
Friday address to some 30,000 worshipers at midday services inside
the walled old city.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, most Arab and Muslim governments remained silent
or equivocal about their views on the missile strikes. Jordan said
it had reserved judgment about the operation; Egypt, the United
States' most important Arab ally in the region, issued a statement
that made no mention of the U.S. attack but called instead on the
U.N. Security Council ``to take the appropriate decision against
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   But along with Iraq and Libya, Palestinian politicians on the
West Bank joined in denouncing the attacks as examples of U.S.
arrogance. And any Arab or Muslim leader who might have sympathized
with the U.S. action was bound to have had second thoughts Friday
after hearing outrage from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stupid Americans; they should find a peaceful way to
solve the problem of terror,'' said Ahmed Makram, an Egypt Air
steward in Cairo, Egypt, voicing the kind of complaint that could
be heard around the Islamic world. ``What they are doing now is
just pouring oil on the fire, and of course, more wars and terror
attacks are ahead as long as they do not change their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The most violent response to the U.S. raids was reported in
Sudan, where a suspected chemical weapons factory on the outskirts
of the capital, Khartoum, was the target of one set of Thursday's
missile strikes. An angry mob in Khartoum retaliated Friday by
stoning the deserted U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Loud protests also echoed outside a U.S. Information Service
center in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. In the Libyan capital,
Tripoli, a U.S. flag was burned at a rally. Among those taking part
in the protest was the country's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who
was himself the target of a U.S. air attack in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, cries of ``Death to America'' rose up from morning
prayers at Tehran University, where a senior Iranian cleric,
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, accused Washington of ``waging a war
against Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Palestinian-ruled areas of Gaza and the West Bank,
demonstrations organized to commemorate an attack nearly three
decades ago on the Al Aksa Mosque suddenly assumed a more urgent
focus.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the
militant Islamic group Hamas, told a rally that ``the one who sows,
reaps, and America will reap the harvest of its aggression.'' And
in the West Bank town of Nablus, more angry protests were kindled
by a particularly fiery Friday prayer sermon in a local mosque. At
least 500 people who gathered outside cheered two masked youths who
burned U.S. flags, jeered President Clinton and chanted praise for
Osama bin Laden, whose alleged terrorist network was the target of
the American missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, be patient, or bin Laden will dig your grave!'' they
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Middle East, the leaders of other militant
Islamic groups issued similar warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, a spokesman for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
predicted that the strikes would incite more attacks on U.S.
interests around the world. And that sentiment was echoed from
Egypt, where Mustafa Mashour, the leader of the outlawed but
influential Muslim Brotherhood, said the effect of the U.S.
operation would be to ``cause more hatred against America and
ignite the flame and instability in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements were particularly stark against the backdrop of
silence from so many Arab governments, including most of those that
took part in an emergency anti-terrorism summit meeting that
President Clinton convened after a rash of suicide bombings in
Israel in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and the
Palestinians, along with senior officials from Saudi Arabia and
other parts of the Arab world, joined Clinton and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in a joint declaration in which all
vowed to work together in battling terrorism around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those Arab governments have since been outspoken in condemning
acts of terrorism around the world, whoever the target. Many have
long employed ruthless tactics in their own struggles against
terrorism. But most have also kept a careful ear to public opinion,
and they have remained wary, at least in public, about endorsing
harsh action by the United States or Israel when it might be seen
as un-Islamic.

MORE U.S. STRIKES POSSIBLE, COHEN SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen raised the
possibility of more U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist facilities
Friday as the administration began assessing the damage done a day
earlier in strikes against targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a briefing with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Cohen
told reporters that ``contingency plans'' for more military
assaults on Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden's network and other
terrorist cells are being developed and ``there may be more in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as an associate of bin Laden _ whose terrorist
training camps in Afghanistan were struck by dozens of U.S.
Tomahawk cruise missiles _ contacted a London-based Arab-language
newspaper to threaten revenge attacks on American interests and
citizens. In a statement to the paper, the bin Laden representative
said: ``The battle has not yet started. The response will be with
action and not words.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments Thursday on the missile strikes, Clinton blamed
the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania on bin Laden's
network and described him as the ``pre-eminent'' merchant of
terrorism in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he ordered the missile attacks because of
intelligence information indicating that more terrorist acts on
U.S. embassies and other interests were imminent. He also suggested
that the strikes were aimed at killing terrorist leaders who were
supposed to be meeting at the bin Laden camps Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said they
could not confirm whether the meeting had actually taken place, or
how many people may have been killed. Taliban sources in
Afghanistan said 21 people died as a result of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met Friday morning with Berger and the rest of his
national security team to get a damage assessment on the strikes
that hit the complex in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum, Sudan, suspected of producing agents used in the
production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was believed to have strong ties to the plant, and
Berger insisted there was no doubt that the facility was producing
agents for chemical weapons, despite claims by the Sudanese
government that it was ``a medicine factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger told reporters that the Khartoum plant had been
``functionally destroyed'' with limited casualties while ``moderate
to severe damage'' had been inflicted on bin Laden's bases in
eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said, however, that the full extent of the damage to the
three sites hit in Afghanistan won't be known until cloud cover
over the area clears, allowing U.S. satellites a better view.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were still uncertain of bin
Laden's whereabouts, and denied again that the missile attacks were
intended to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Berger warned bin Laden not to rebuild his damaged
facilities in Afghanistan or anywhere else, noting ``that would not
be a terribly wise decision for them to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who resumed his vacation Friday afternoon on Martha's
Vineyard, continued making phone calls to world leaders in an
effort to explain the U.S. action. Most voiced their support, with
the exception of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who condemned the
unilateral action and complained that he was not informed
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton dispatched Cohen, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Hugh
Shelton and CIA Director George Tenet to brief lawmakers on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After the briefing, Albright underscored Cohen's comments that
further military action may be necessary to damage terrorist cells
that threaten U.S. lives and interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are involved here in a long-term struggle,'' Albright said.
``This is, unfortunately, the war of the future, and we have to
understand the importance of sustained operations.''
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed that despite the absence of better damage
assessments on the strikes, they were still ``very successful in
having made clear that the United States will not be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the missile attacks, federal authorities took
steps to tighten security at U.S. facilities abroad and at home,
particularly in Washington around federal buildings. At the same
time, the FBI issued a nationwide alert to all U.S. law enforcement
officials requesting that they be on guard against any suspicious
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines and airports were also asked to implement heightened
security measures. At major international facilities like Los
Angeles International and O'Hare in Chicago, extra baggage searches
were the rule, and some passengers were asked to turn on and
operate any electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   The state department also issued an advisory warning Americans
traveling or living abroad to be watchful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be targeted,'' Berger told reporters, in response to
questions about whether the missile strikes could prompt other
terrorist activity. ``But we're also going to be on offense as well
as defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to take military action in the wake of the
embassy bombings in Africa drew support from two-thirds of the
American people, according to several public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the surveys also indicated that up to a third of the country
remains suspicious about the timing, coming as it did just three
days after Clinton acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., reiterated an earlier call
for Clinton to resign, charging that he had ordered the attacks to
divert attention away from his personal problems. But Cohen told
reporters that Coats had backed away from that position after being
presented with the intelligence information on which Clinton had
based his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Following the briefings on Capitol Hill, lawmakers generally
praised Clinton's action. But some said it was too early to claim
it a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on whether the strikes had a major
impact on the terrorist training camps,'' said Rep. Peter Goss,
R-Fla. ``Tents and obstacle courses can be rebuilt or relocated.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Almost nostalgically, it seemed, Russia reopened its
Cold War phrase book Friday to denounce the United States for its
cruise-missile attacks on Afghanistan and the Sudan. But in almost
the same breath, it declared that the differences would have no
effect on President Clinton's trip to Moscow in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   On Russia's far-north Kola Peninsula, where he was witnessing
naval exercises, President Boris Yeltsin said he was ``outraged''
by news of the U.S. attacks and in particular by Clinton's failure
to warn of them in advance. Afghanistan is on the southern border
of the fraternity of former Soviet republics now called the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is indeed negative, as it would be to any act of
terrorism, military interference, failure to solve a problem
through talks,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Yeltsin spokesman seemed to play down those
remarks later by stressing Russia's agreement with the United
States that terrorism is an international threat.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko called the attacks unacceptable,
but added that ``international acts of terrorism cannot go
unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-led lower house of Parliament called the U.S.
strikes acts of aggression, said they were contrary to
international law and predicted that they would provoke terrorists
to still more radical measures.
</P>
<P>
   And former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told the Interfax
news service in Moscow that the U.S. actions were not ``legitimate
or balanced.'' He said, ``The international community, the United
Nations Security Council and the United Nations secretary general
should have been notified.''
</P>
<P>
   He said terrorism is an international threat and that world
governments should combine forces against it, rather than working
alone and in secret. ``The entire international community was just
placed before an already accomplished act,'' Gorbachev said. ``The
United Nations Secretary General was told about the missile strikes
40 minutes after they had been carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev added, however, that Russia's criticism should not
prevent Clinton and Yeltsin from meeting as planned Sept. 1.
Interfax later quoted high-level Russian sources as saying the
summit meeting would be unaffected by what they called Yeltsin's
``irritation'' over Clinton's decision.

Alpha,'' explained as ``a general threat of possible terrorist
activity against installations, building locations and/or
personnel, the nature of which are unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN poll showed only 10 percent of Americans fear a terrorist
attack. Specialists, however, warned against complacency, pointing
out retaliatory action against US installations or individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Pan Am 103 was payback for US attacks on Libya,
according to Kushner. And the more recent killing of two Americans
working in Pakistan was in response to the conviction of a Muslim
fundamentalist for his role in killing CIA workers outside the
agency's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrorist network built in Afghanistan exists here in the
US,'' Kushner said. ``Most of the people involved in the World
Trade Center bombing had links to the terror network we're trying
to take out, but they are here. We're fighting a loosely knit
network of fanatical radical terrorists who are nameless and
faceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents contacted Friday did not see a significant drop or
change in travel plans, and airlines did not comment on whether
ticketing has been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to take this in stride,'' said Evvy Harris, a
travel agent at Austin Travel in New York specializing in
international travel. ``Frankly, people here are more afraid of
going in the subway tunnels.''
</P>
<P>
   There is usually a lag time of a few weeks after an incident
before bookings trail off, said Richard D'Ambrosio, public affairs
director for American Express travel services.
</P>
<P>
   But corporations are concerned about the safety of their
personnel. William J. Daly, a former FBI counterintelligence agent
and managing director at Kroll Associates, an international
security firm based in New York, said he had been receiving calls
from corporations with multinational operations all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any one time, there are several million Americans outside
the US on business, and they have a security exposure. Businesses
literally fly American flags and represent our way of life,'' Daly
said. ``But people are still naive about protecting themselves
against terrorist attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses need a highly detailed plan to evacuate employees and
respond to bomb threats, as well as heightened awareness of their
physical safety in their work area, said Leonard C. Cross, a former
FBI counterterrorism specialist who investigated the World Trade
bombing as well as other Middle East bombings. Garages and any
entrance point should be monitored, and individuals should keep a
low profile and be aware of being watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``US businesses with large buildings in manufacturing areas or
with prominent signs advertising their company are very soft
targets, and many don't have adequate security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, we take adequate measures to protect our
personnel abroad,'' said Dave Shea, spokesman for Raytheon Co., a
defense contractor. Shea refused to explain measures taken for
security reasons. So did Matt Miller of Gillette Co., although he
said ``security was always a concern'' and that the company was
``monitoring the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Airports in Boston, Los Angeles and San Fransisco increased
security by searching any suspicious bag and towing unidentified
cars, while cities such as New York had police encircling some
government buildings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In retrospect, the only public hint of the assault
to come _ the only moment when President Clinton's intense,
parallel preparations for his political survival and for a strike
against terrorists might have crossed _ came on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After he grimly admitted his intimate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the president tried to turn the nation's attention to
more noble subjects, to ``important work to do'' including ``real
security matters to face.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. The president did not mention his meeting that
afternoon in the White House solarium to discuss Thursday's
counter-terrorist missile strikes, even as prosecutors were
arriving downstairs to grill him under oath about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention that, before he went to face the prosecutors,
he ordered Samuel Berger, his national security adviser, to convene
the government's top security officials Tuesday for one more
run-through of the mission. That meeting came just before the
president left on what the world and even most of his aides
expected to be a 12-day vacation, spent mostly in seclusion with
his wife, daughter and dog.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, from his borrowed Martha's Vineyard estate, Clinton
interspersed telephone conversations to outside political advisers
to discuss the dismal reaction to his speech with calls to his
security aides about the mission. On Wednesday night, the president
and his family went out to celebrate his 52nd birthday. He returned
at 11:30 p.m. to more telephone calls, including to Vice President
Al Gore to chew over a last, troubling question about the targets.
</P>
<P>
   He made up his mind about the targeting, then gave his final
go-ahead in a talk with Berger at 3 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Never has Clinton's fabled ability to compartmentalize his life
been more starkly demonstrated than in the last two weeks. As the
one man in the world who held all the information, he walled off
meetings with his lawyers to prepare for his testimony from
meetings with his national security advisers to plan one of the
largest military operations of his presidency, simultaneous strikes
seas apart by about 75 cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the last two weeks _ from the embassy bombings in East
Africa until the president's Oval Office address on Thursday
evening _ look in retrospect like a trick mirror version,
compressed and exaggerated, of the split presidency Bill Clinton
has had for more than five years now: Fierce damage control and
political strategizing on the one hand, studied policy debate on
the other. And connected to each hand, standing in the middle and
alone, was the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security advisers have repeatedly
scorned the slightest suggestion that politics played a role in the
assault. Several said that the recommendation for the attack was
based on very strong intelligence and was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating accusations of political manipulation, the national
security team took pains to avoid any appearance of political
meddling. Berger, who chaired the meetings to plan the mission, was
said by one senior official to be very concerned about any
appearance ``that there were any factors other than the merits.''
He kept the operation a secret until the middle of this week from
all but two of the president's top political advisers, Erskine
Bowles, the chief of staff, and his deputy, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's lawyers were said by White House aides to
have complained last week that they were not getting enough time
with him to prepare. They learned the reason why only when the rest
of the world did, as the president appeared at 1:55 p.m. before
reporters gathered in an elementary school gymnasium on Martha's
Vineyard and announced: ``Today we have struck back.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a possible mission began on Friday, Aug. 7, after
powerful bombs exploded outside American Embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Twelve Americans and nearly 300
Africans were killed. The senior officials who would ultimately
plan the strike held their first meeting. Sketchy intelligence
reports already pointed at a culprit, Osama bin Laden, an exiled
Saudi millionaire living in Afghanistan who had declared a
terrorist war on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also began what would be a series of briefings
for Speaker Newt Gingrich on the intelligence findings about the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, in a rare piece of good news for Clinton, a
federal judge found that Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor,
may have violated legal rules prohibiting leaks of grand jury
material. Leaving it to his advisers to praise the decision,
Clinton devoted his own public statements to deploring the bombings
and promising retribution.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, Clinton departed on a political fund-raising
trip to California, with White House officials insisting he was
going about business as usual despite his approaching date with
prosecutors. Aides who accompanied the president described his as
cheerful as ever, playing hearts and swapping political strategy
with Democratic candidates he met.
</P>
<P>
   But the president cut short his trip to fly back to the White
House on Tuesday night, arriving after dawn. Some political
commentators surmised that Clinton was returning to prepare his
defense. In fact, his stated reason was the real reason: He wanted
to meet with his national security team.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted for an hour in the Situation Room in the
White House basement, beginning after 10:30, for a briefing on the
investigation into the bombings and diplomacy with Africa. Then top
White House, Pentagon, State Department and CIA officials _ what
came to be called the ``small group'' _ moved up to the Oval Office
with the president for a 45-minute talk about retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Further intelligence had confirmed links between bin Laden and
the bombings, officials said, and suggested that a group of
high-level terrorists would be gathering on August 20 at a large
compound in Afghanistan that was associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
had already prepared a proposed missile assault on directions from
Berger. The general had worked up a set of the Pentagon's flip
charts, showing the concept for the operation, the potential
targets, the possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   The president starting firing off questions. His security
advisers described his as clear-headed and focused at every
meeting. He never referred to his political or legal troubles, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, according to one senior official who was
present, the president pressed hard about the mission's risks. ``He
said, when we get back together on Friday, I want you to tell me
all of the down sides,'' the official said. He wanted to know more
about collateral damage, possible terrorist retaliation, the
expected response of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton focused on one of the targets, a factory in Khartoum
that intelligence showed was used to manufacture the building
blocks of deadly VX gas. The building blocks were inert. But what,
the president asked Shelton, if the factory also stored a great
deal of the completed gas itself? What would an explosion do to the
surrounding population?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave permission to begin moving ships into position in
the Red and Arabian Seas for an attack to begin in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Thursday, the president wept silently at Andrews
Air Force Base as ten flag-draped coffins arrived from Nairobi;
meanwhile, some of his closest advisers told reporters from The New
York Times that, contrary to his previous denials, Clinton was
preparing to tell the grand jury that he had an intimate
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at a meeting in the Oval Office, Clinton got the
answers he had requested two days before. Shelton described a
so-called ``plume analysis,'' which showed that because of the
location of the factory, the casualties would not be high. Tenet
presented intelligence that he said clearly tied bin Laden's
network to the attacks in East Africa. Clinton gave the green light
for the mission on Thursday, and Shelton informed him that he had
until 6 a.m. that day to call it off.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, David Kendall, the president's private lawyer,
practically moved into the White House. He met for hours with
Clinton in the residence, on the second floor. Saturday morning,
the president delivered his radio address about receiving the
bodies at Andrews. ``Our administration will remain committed to
the fight against terror,'' he said, with no elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard weekend for the president. His advisers said that
he spent much of it trying to prepare his wife, his daughter and
himself for the admission Monday of a liaison with Ms. Lewinsky.
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, had a long talk by telephone with Clinton
on Sunday afternoon, and found him deeply concerned about his
family. ``I think he recognized that this was going to be publicly
humiliating, but because of his actions he had to do it,'' Harkin
said.

FORMER RAMSEY FRIENDS SEEK SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN JONBENET CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three former friends of the parents of JonBenet Ramsey have
asked for a special prosecutor to take over the stalled
20-month-old investigation into the slaying of JonBenet, the
6-year-old Colorado beauty princess.
</P>
<P>
   The three former friends, all residents of Boulder, have broken
off their friendships with John and Patsy Ramsey, parents of the
slain child. In two separate letters, they accuse Boulder District
Attorney Alex Hunter of unwarranted delays in prosecuting the case
and of being overly accommodating to the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter ``has provided evidence to Ramsey defense attorneys at
their request'' but denied requests by other witnesses for
transcripts of their own statements to the police, wrote Fleet and
Priscilla White, a couple who had the Ramsey family to their home
for dinner on Dec. 25, 1996, a few hours before JonBenet was found
dead. ``He has thoroughly alienated police detectives and key
witnesses whose cooperation is vital to the investigation and
prosecution,'' the Whites wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the dinner, White and Ramsey were searching
the basement of the Ramsey house when Ramsey emerged from a room
with his daughter's battered body. In a brief interview on
Thursday, White, an oil and gas entrepreneur, described himself as
``a frustrated witness in a horrible murder case.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by the Boulder police as suspects and eventually
cleared, the Whites became estranged from the Ramseys, who moved to
Atlanta a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In their 15-page letter, released on Wednesday ``to the people
of Colorado,'' the Whites alleged that ``Alex Hunter and those
advising him have no intention of seeking indictment from a grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple faulted prosecutors for allowing a ``chummy''
atmosphere to build with Ramsey lawyers and charged that
prosecutors and police leaders deliberately delayed the case by
``killing time'' with well-publicized busy work and ``task lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to their former friends, the Whites concluded, ``We must
be mindful, however, of the first cause of the investigation's
failure _ the refusal of John and Patsy Ramsey to cooperate fully
and genuinely with those officials charged with the responsibility
of investigating the death of their daughter, JonBenet.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by this letter, Judith Phillips, a photographer who
had taken pictures of the Ramsey family, wrote an open letter on
Thursday calling for a special prosecutor and charging that Hunter
was ``willing to obstruct the justice he swore to uphold.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither letter gave an opinion about the possibility of the
Ramseys' involvement in the death.
</P>
<P>
   These calls for a special prosecutor come two weeks after
similar calls from a former police detective in the case and from
Denver's two daily newspapers, The Rocky Mountain News and The
Denver Post. In response to these calls, Hunter cut short a
vacation in Alaska, returned to Colorado, met with Gov. Roy Romer
and announced that he would take the case to a grand jury soon,
probably next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has declined to respond to the charges against him,
saying a response could prejudice the case. Romer has stood fast in
face of the new calls that he take the case away from Hunter and
appoint a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is going to the grand jury,'' Jim Carpenter, the
governor's spokesman, said on Thursday. Referring to the Whites'
letter, he added, ``There was nothing in the letter that has
changed that view.''
</P>
<P>
   One legal analyst found it interesting that both the Whites and
Steve Thomas, the former police detective, had warned publicly that
a grand jury would not indict. ``This is the second time that
people have said this grand jury is going to be a fix,'' said the
analyst, Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who is now a
defense lawyer. ``It's unusual to hear stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, both Denver newspapers published articles that
appeared to open a window on the Ramsey household in the early
morning of Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to these reports, Mrs. Ramsey failed to hang up the
telephone for a few moments after calling 911 to say that she had
discovered a ransom note on her back stairs. A California
laboratory reportedly digitally enhanced snippets of conversation
picked up at 5:52 a.m. from the Ramsey kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   According to these newspaper accounts, Mrs. Ramsey can be heard
screaming, and JonBenet's brother, Burke, then 10, can be heard
asking what she had found. Ramsey can be heard telling his son to
go back to bed. The Ramseys have said their son was asleep in bed
when Mrs. Ramsey found the note and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Haddon, the Ramseys' lead lawyer, broke his general silence
about the case to issue a statement denouncing the news articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vicious leak is one more example of the pattern of
official misconduct which has characterized this investigation,''
Haddon said. ``Police sources leak what they claim is critical
evidence and spin it against the Ramseys. The Ramseys are helpless
to reply because they do not have access to the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have denied any involvement in their daughter's
death. Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner has said they are under an
``umbrella of suspicion.'' &QL;

TIME FOR US TO ACT ON OTHER TROUBLE SPOTS, SOME SAY

 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By moving forcefully against suspected terrorists,
President Clinton won praise even from critics of his foreign
policy. Now, some foreign policy specialists say, the president
should act with equal resolve to manage another set of overseas
problems that could be even more important to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has suspended its cooperation with United Nations weapons
inspectors. North Korea shows new signs of building nuclear arms.
Mideast peace talks have stalled. And Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic is forcibly pushing ethnic Albanians out of the province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In some of these cases, the United States warned there would be
stern consequences for bucking US policy. But the president has
followed those warnings with little action, his critics say _ at
least not much that can be seen publicly.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's strike against terrorists this week was welcome,
``regrettably, that credibility and resolve have been lacking from
other critical foreign policy challenges,'' Senator John McCain,
Republican of Arizona, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign policy analysts called the anti-terrorist
strikes on Thursday proper but limited. They said Clinton put few
US lives and little political capital at risk in ordering the
missile attacks _ launched from faraway ships _ on people who are
universally unpopular in the United States for their alleged ties
to the US embassy bombings two weeks ago in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very strong statement about our willingness to use
force, and I don't think it would change the resolve of Saddam
Hussein (of Iraq) or Milosevic in Kosovo,'' said Michael O'Hanlon,
a Brookings Institution fellow, about the missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The missile attacks, in fact, have diverted public attention
from more important foreign problems, said Edward Luttwak, a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Events like the Aug. 7 embassy bombings ``are unimportant,
almost trivial,'' Luttwak said. ``It's sad that people got killed
there, but that has the importance of a car crash ... Compare that
to the Russian economic crisis, with its potential for bursting
Russia and having maybe 25,000 nuclear weapons spill out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But President Clinton has not been available to deal
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the administration are also waiting for a public
response to news that US spy satellites recently detected a large
facility in North Korea that could be part of a new nuclear weapons
program. If so, North Korea may be in violation of a four-year-old
agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return for
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's foreign policy team also stands accused of failing to
solve problems at home. The administration has said repeatedly that
the International Monetary Fund needs a cash infusion so it can
make new loans to ease the economic crisis in Asia and Russia. But
the president so far has been unable to force Congress to set aside
new money for the international lending agency. Moreover, Clinton's
push for special ``fast track'' powers to negotiate trade treaties
has stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics blame the Monica S. Lewinsky sex scandal and other
domestic problems for the inaction on foreign matters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Luttwak said, warnings by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that Israel must speed up the peace process have
proven to be empty. Clinton has been unwilling to rebuke Israel, he
said, for fear of angering pro-Israeli lawmakers who he may need
later as the Lewinsky scandal comes before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, at this point Madeleine Albright is incapacitated,''
Luttwak said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan research
group created by Congress, research director Patrick Cronin said US
leaders ``haven't followed through as they should'' on some of the
most pressing foreign policy problems. But he said those problems
are more complex than some critics acknowledge, and the United
States is trying to find new ways to manage some of them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, threats of force against Iraq now produce
``diminishing returns,'' and the United States needs a new
strategy. And US officials are properly alarmed by the possible
resumption of a nuclear arms program in North Korea, even if that
is not publicly apparent, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's focus on foreign policy ``clearly
could be better, but it's not as bleak as the critics portray it,''
he said.

BOOKS THE GROUP GRADED `INCOMPLETE'  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JANE GROSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tide of books about women, work and motherhood has reached the
shelves of the nation's bookstores in the last year. At the request
of Money and Business, the women in a Brooklyn book group, all of
them mothers, read a broad sampling and discussed their reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, these readers tried: ``Not Guilty: The Good News
About Working Mothers'' by Betty Holcombe (Scribner), ``When
Mothers Work'' by Joan Peters (Addison Wesley), ``A Mother's
Place'' by Susan Chira (HarperCollins) and ``When Work Doesn't Work
Anymore'' by Elizabeth Perle McKenna (Delacorte).
</P>
<P>
   The women were unanimous in saying that they found the books
dull, tendentious and largely irrelevant to lives in which the
decisions they make are more often idiosyncratic than ideological.
</P>
<P>
   The reading was a departure from their usual diet of fiction and
memoir; indeed, some of them said that other books they had read,
like ``Rosie'' by Anne Lamott or ``Angela's Ashes'' by Frank
McCourt, offered richer insight into motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the women complained that the books read like
extended magazine articles but were vastly more expensive and
time-consuming _ an important issue when they had neither money nor
hours to spare.
</P>
<P>
   (Money and Business provided the copies that the book group's
members read.)
</P>
<P>
   Observations like these, publishing experts said, could account
for the slow sales of these books and others on the topic of
mothers and work, despite favorable reviews and abundant interest
in the issues they address.
</P>
<P>
   To date, none of these titles are showing up in the weekly sales
reports that booksellers make to The New York Times for purposes of
compiling the newspaper's best-seller list, Deborah Hofmann, the
editor of the list, said Friday.

   PUERTO ASIS, Colombia _ As he stripped shiny green leaves from
the branches of waist-high coca shrubs, Pedro Aldemar hardly broke
a sweat. He could afford to relax: There were no police
crop-dusters in sight.

<P>
   Here in southern Putumayo state near the Ecuadorean border, vast
swaths of coca _ the raw material for cocaine _ are beyond the
reach of government spray planes that target coca and opium
poppies. The state is a virtual free zone for coca growers, and it
attracts thousands of migrant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers will go wherever they are not fumigating,'' said
Aldemar, who grows about three acres of coca on the outskirts of
Puerto Asis, a bustling center of the cocaine trade 335 miles
southwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The police aerial eradication program is the largest in the
world and the centerpiece of U.S.-sponsored anti-drug operations in
Colombia. Since the program began in 1994, pilots have destroyed an
increasing amount of coca each year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these high-flying aces, some of whom are retired U.S.
military pilots, can't keep up with low-tech peasants. To avoid the
air raids, farmers have simply pushed deeper into the jungle _
planting more coca than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the country's farmers cultivated nearly 200,000 acres
of coca, double the amount of four years earlier. About 78,000
Colombian families earn a living from coca, according to U.N.
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials predict that the spraying will eventually pay off
by making the crop too risky for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that forced eradication won't work, unless
peasants at the bottom rung of the drug trade receive technical
support to help them plant something else. The fumigation program,
they say, has turned many farmers against the government and pushed
them farther into areas controlled by leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can spray your way out of this mess,'' said
Klaus Nyholm, head of the U.N. Drug Control Program in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be permanently fumigating the countryside,''
Colombian Environmental Minister Juan Mayr told the Bogota daily El
Tiempo.
</P>
<P>
   Mayr said coca cultivation has increased, ``which shows that
fumigation hasn't worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The spraying has sparked violent peasant protests as well as
attacks by guerrillas, who have been waging war against Colombia's
government for 34 years. Earlier this month, about 800 rebels
overran a key police anti-narcotics base in southern Guaviare
state, killing, wounding or capturing nearly all of the base's 190
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Another casualty of the fumigation program, critics say, is the
environment. Peasants fleeing police planes often move into virgin
areas, chopping down tracts of rain forest. The soil is thin, and
planters use large quantities of fertilizers and pesticides to
assure high yields.
</P>
<P>
   The clouds of herbicide dropped by crop-dusters pollute
groundwater and kill legal crops, critics of the program complain.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a shortage of police spray planes and support
helicopters, 15 percent to 25 percent of Colombia's coca crop
currently sits outside the program's flying radius, according to a
senior U.S. State Department official. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For now, that leaves Putumayo state in a de facto no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   Coca growers have taken advantage of the situation. The amount
of land devoted to coca cultivation in Putumayo has increased from
47,000 acres to 98,000 acres in the past year, according to Gov.
Jorge Devia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just over that hill there is coca,'' said Lt. Luis Benavides,
an anti-narcotics police agent, as he stared out the window of his
office in Puerto Asis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultivation and sale of coca is viewed as a normal thing
here,'' said a Roman Catholic priest, who did now want his name to
be used. ``Coca has created towns. Towns have risen out of
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug money, residents say, fuels business in Puerto Asis.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of raucous cantinas and seedy houses of
prostitution to relieve farmers of their coca profits. The main
hotel was once owned by the late Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, an
infamous cocaine baron who often flew in on a chartered plane,
bringing along his own orchestra for fiestas.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief regional oil boom in the 1970s, the Colombian
government invested heavily in Putumayo. But when the wells began
to run dry, so did state coffers. Today, there are no paved
highways in the entire state, much of which is controlled by
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Getting legal crops to market can take days. By contrast, drug
dealers go door to door, buying tons of coca paste that farmers
cook in rustic jungle kitchens from a mix of coca leaves, cement,
gasoline and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Putumayo, coca has replaced rice, yucca and
plantains, which are now imported from Ecuador, as crops. A
state-owned rice warehouse in Puerto Asis sits empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become so extreme that people have to bring plantains
from the city to the countryside,'' said Diego Orozco, director of
a federal program that encourages farmers to grow food instead of
coca.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption and poor management have plagued many alternative
crop projects.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government persuaded about 120 Putumayo farmers
to grow hearts of palm for export to Europe. But the canning plant
in Puerto Asis is only half-built, and few Colombians eat hearts of
palm. Farmers were stuck with a worthless crop, and several went
gone back to coca.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is providing more than $100 million to
Colombia's police and military for anti-drug operations this year.
But the U.S. government has shunned crop-substitution programs, in
part, to avoid showering money on areas under heavy guerrilla
influence.
</P>
<P>
   That policy could change. Colombian President Andres Pastrana,
who was sworn in Aug. 7, has called for a ``Marshall Plan'' to wean
farmers off coca. When Pastrana visited the White House last month,
Clinton administration officials agreed to back alternative farm
programs on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has not been opposed to alternative development,''
said the senior State Department official. But such programs only
work, the official said, ``if the government has control of the
area and if the peasants believe there is a penalty for continuing
to grow coca.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's largest guerrilla group _ the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC _ is especially strong in the
coca-growing zones of southern Colombia. Both the FARC and the
National Liberation Army, known as the ELN, earn millions of
dollars annually by protecting drug traffickers. Both rebel groups
have shot down low-flying crop-dusters and support helicopters,
killing dozens of Colombian pilots as well as three U.S. fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the State Department official insisted that the drug war
requires a big-stick approach.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the United States requires Colombia and other
countries to show progress in the war against drugs in order to
avert economic sanctions. Colombia was blacklisted as an unreliable
partner in the drug war in 1996 and 1997, but the Clinton
administration waived sanctions against the country this year.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official said the drug war in South America
has been a modest success, with coca cultivation in Peru, Bolivia
and Colombia dropping from 528,000 acres in 1995 to 479,000 acres
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Peru, he said, began to replace coca with other crops
only after U.S. electronic surveillance and Peruvian air force
patrols disrupted drug flights, making coca less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, however, farmers continue to harvest bumper coca
crops. Most analysts say that long-term progress in the drug war is
impossible here, unless the government and the rebels sign a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crop-dusters keep flying.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian police have already destroyed more than 100,000 acres
of coca this year. According to Lt. Benavides, authorities hope
that spray planes will be swooping over coca fields in Putumayo
within the year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``As long as you don't control the territory, there are not
many other things you can do,'' said Nyholm, the U.N.
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only option is to come in with your airplanes, drop your
poison and get out again.''

   NEW YORK _ To work or not to work?
</P>
<P>
   That question, posed as an ideological, either-or choice in
numerous new books and on the covers of women's magazines, seems
beside the point to Betsy Laganis, a Brooklyn mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laganis, a consultant to social welfare agencies, has tried
both ways and every permutation in between. But her choices have
never been based on politics or philosophy. They have been
seat-of-the-pants decisions, made and revised from one day to the
next in the maelstrom of family life, often for ridiculously
mundane reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Like head lice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laganis, working in a city agency after the birth of her
third child, was barely keeping it together as her maternal
responsibilities seemed to increase exponentially. Two of the
children were often ill, and there had been a baby-sitter disaster.
Then all three youngsters came home from their various schools one
day with head lice, just as the city, trying to trim its work
force, offered employees a generous severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing this serendipitous moment several years ago, Ms. Laganis
quit her job and began her fourth stint _ the first that wasn't a
maternity leave _ as a stay-at-home mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole combination came together, and I saw this wasn't
working for me or my family,'' she said. ``But it's so personal and
so circumstantial. I hate this thing of `you stay home or you
work.' Why do you have to be on one track or the other? Why can't
you feel it out as you go along?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laganis told her story to the accompaniment of knowing
laughter from a group of neighborhood friends _ all of them
mothers, some who are in the workplace and some who stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   They were gathered in the high-ceilinged living room of a
rambling house in Flatbush, at the monthly meeting of their reading
group. At the request of Money and Business, each of the eight
women had read one of four recent books about the quandary of
working mothers as a jumping-off point for a discussion of their
own conflicted lives.
</P>
<P>
   While the books did not delight _ one woman said guiltily that
she read hers in a single gulp in the hours before the meeting and
another said she only ``got to page 122'' _ they did spur hours of
animated conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On a muggy evening, with the fans in Coco Wilde's home doing
little but pushing around the heavy air, the eight women talked
from 8 p.m. past midnight and at the end had not yet exhausted what
for them is an all-consuming subject.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the women seemed free of ambivalence. Ms. Wilde, 41,
the mother of one child, 5-year-old Vanessa, feels compelled to be
at home; Ellen Winner, 52, a lawyer who had two children in her
mid-40s, feels compelled to work. Were the two not friends, each
would doubtless feel that the other was judging her harshly.
Instead, they can say to each other, ``I can't imagine being you,''
and it does not feel like a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   They did just that at the reading group. ``Your life is scary to
me,'' Ms. Winner said to her friend. ``I don't know how you do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She characterized herself as someone who would wither without
her profession. ``I would be a terrible person if I didn't work,''
she said, adding with no shame that she could not abide spending
her time playing video games with her sons, Samuel, 10, and Joel,
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my kids to be happy and comfortable,'' she added. ``But
a competent woman putting all her energies into a 10-year-old? I
can't see it.'' She turned to Ms. Wilde. ``Do you think I'm
rejecting your choices?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Ms. Wilde said. But, determined not to miss a minute of her
daughter's childhood, she feels no need to apologize for her life
and has no plans to return to teaching. Unlike some of the other
women, she said she was never lonely or bored. Indeed, she called
the time she was spending at home her ``eternity leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so free,'' she said. ``That's the word I'd use to
describe myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Wilde feels the opprobrium of professional women when
she meets them at parties with her husband, a lawyer. ``I can see
their eyes glaze over,'' she said. ``It's like they feel we're
slackers. They say things like, `What do you do all day?' I feel
dismissed, and I resent that. These women have done what's right
for them. But I'd be nuts to do the same thing, because my soul
belongs with my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in casual conversation among friends, there can be tense
moments. Referring to an anecdote in one of the books _ ``Not
Guilty: The Good News About Working Mothers'' by Betty Holcombe _
Zane Treimanis, a teacher and sculptor, used the phrase ``sitting
at home'' to describe the nonworking women whose labors made
possible their husbands' unobstructed advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting at home?'' Ms. Wilde asked, her voice italicizing the
phrase. Their eyes met, and Ms. Treimanis dipped her head in mute
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The women's conversation was especially enlightening because of
the diversity of the group, which includes both black and white
women, some with graduate degrees and others with only high school
diplomas. They range in age from 41 to 56 and among them have 23
children, from 5 to 37 years old. Nancy Russell, with six children
from two marriages, has the largest family; Ms. Wilde, with a
single child, has the smallest.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the women are full-time mothers, four work at home or
have tailored their jobs to their children's schedules and two work
in offices in relatively inflexible 9-to-5 situations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women feel pulled in both directions, often wishing
that they were home when they are working or working when they are
home.
</P>
<P>
   Their methods of balancing work and family are as varied as
their resumes, but all have given up something, at home or at the
office, to keep from tumbling off the tightrope of their lives. Ms.
Winner left a litigation firm to open a solo legal practice with a
less stressful caseload, largely in trusts and estates. Robin
Factor, a mother of three, moved her career in publishing from the
canyons of Manhattan to a home office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laganis has switched, many times over, from being a
stay-at-home mom to working schedules of anywhere from two to five
days a week. These days, she is a freelance consultant to the same
city agencies for which she once worked full-time, and for
nonprofit organizations, too.
</P>
<P>
   When she is working, she misses seeing her children's Halloween
trick-or-treating or having the time for her own piano lessons,
afternoon movies and leisurely visits with friends. When at home,
she misses the intellectual stimulation of the office and the
chemistry of men and women working side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Women who work outside the home and those who don't can often
offend each other inadvertently. Noting the veiled _ and not so
veiled _ divisions among women, Ms. Factor said that during one of
her maternity leaves: ``I used to get glares in the supermarket
after 6 o'clock. It was like, `What are you doing here now clogging
up the line when you have all day to shop?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The working mothers, in different ways, also feel judged. They
are angered by a television commercial for AT&AMP;T cellular service in
which a small child says that she wishes she were ``an important
client'' so her mother would spend time with her. They quake at
recent court decisions giving custody to fathers because divorced
mothers had demanding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two African-American women in the group, Ms. Wilde and Mary
Crouthers, have a vastly different perspective on working women.
When they were growing up _ Ms. Wilde in Philadelphia, Ms.
Crouthers in Brooklyn _ their mothers had jobs, as did their aunts,
neighbors and other women they knew.
</P>
<P>
   When she hears women wax eloquent about careers, Ms. Wilde said,
she feels like she comes ``from a completely different America,''
one where work is not about satisfaction or identity but about
buying food. And for their mothers, the rise of feminism in the
1970s was a subject of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought white women had gone completely crazy,'' Ms.
Wilde said, gesturing dismissively at the books scattered on the
coffee table and discarded on the rug.
</P>
<P>
   The working women in the group all said their incomes were
essential to their families' well-being; except for Ms. Winner, all
said they worked in equal measure because they wanted to and
because they had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hardly know anyone who has the luxury of staying home,'' Ms.
Factor said, irritated that the books seemed to dismiss in a few
paragraphs the plight of working-class women.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Wilde and Doris Grady, 51 and a mother of two who was
educated through high school, challenged their friends' definition
of how much money a family needed. Ms. Wilde said that if her
husband were a television repairman instead of a lawyer, she would
scale down her life style so that she could still be at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grady said that if a family were willing to spend summer
weekends in the backyard instead of the Hamptons, it could manage
on one salary, as hers does on that of her husband, a bank branch
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are running, running, running,'' said Ms. Grady, who
conceded that she might find work more appealing if she had better
career prospects. ``But I'm not dying for money, so what's the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Treimanis, a shy woman with a whispery voice that her
friends strained to hear, an important issue is not her family's
life style but her own sense of independence. ``When I'm working
and I have money, I feel like I have power,'' she said. It isn't
that her husband grills her about her spending when she does not
have a job; it's her delight in knowing, when she works, that he
has no grounds for inquiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to ask my husband,'' she said. ``I can buy what I
want, go where I want.''
</P>
<P>
   The working women in the group had found differing levels of
support from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crouthers, sitting straight-backed in a wing chair, told a
heartwarming story about a former boss, at a Woolworth's store
where she had worked as a cashier while her children were small. At
the time, her son was in school half-days, and her male supervisor
allowed her to bring the boy to the store in the afternoon, where
he entertained himself in the toy department or at the soda
fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laganis, from her relaxed pose on the floor, commented that
every boss in her working life had helped her create a manageable
schedule even if it was not congruent with policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Factor, by contrast, described a female boss at a publishing
house who would make no adjustments to her schedule, even small
ones like letting her come in an hour later and adding the time at
the end of the day. When one of her children was sick, Ms. Factor
said, she always lied and said she was ill in order to be able to
stay home.
</P>
<P>
   It was inflexibility like this that prompted Ms. Factor to begin
her own home-based work in publishing.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Winner said it was her experience trying to cram a full
week's work into a four-day week at her old job _ ``a bad deal,''
she termed it _ that led her to set up her own law practice.
</P>
<P>
   Pacing with pent-up energy, she said she struggles with her lost
dreams. ``I'm never going to be on the 50-most-important-lawyers
list,'' Ms. Winner told her friends. ``And it's hard to unhinge
from that. I still find it very disappointing that this is my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more uniformity in the women's experiences with
spouses. All but one said that while their husbands expressed
willingness to help with the children and the house, the men rarely
lifted a finger unless they were specifically asked and given
detailed instructions about the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The husbands were also philosophically in favor of men and women
alternating primary responsibility for child care, yet none offered
to shift to part-time work.
</P>
<P>
   It is realities like these, the group agreed, that seem to be
persuading more young women these days that having it all is a
myth. It grieves them to hear nieces, for instance, saying they
must choose a career or children and not dare to have both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the second generation of women juggling like this,'' Ms.
Factor said. ``I'd like to see people attacking this on a policy
level.''
</P>
<P>
   By now the women were sounding much like the books they had
dismissed as boring _ highlighting the same conflicts, asking the
same frustrated questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't do this to fathers, do they?'' said Ms. Grady,
peeved that women are asked to choose between career and family
when men, it often seems, are not.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight had come and gone, and the coffee table was littered
with the debris of the evening _ half-filled wine glasses, plates
empty but for cake crumbs, grape stems stripped of their fruit. The
women were left neither here nor there, exhilarated by the
conversation but depressed by the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to what everybody wants from us,'' Ms. Factor
said, ``you come away thinking that you should be a successful
professional who is home with your family.''

EX-COLUMNIST GRANTED LEAVES FROM TV COMMITMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fallout from Mike Barnicle's resignation Wednesday from
The Globe continued Friday when the former columnist was granted
90-day unpaid leaves of absence by two of his television employers.
</P>
<P>
   WCVB-Channel 5, where Barnicle has worked for 15 years, said it
was giving him an opportunity to ``address the issues raised about
his work at The Boston Globe'' and that his role as a ```Chronicle'
contributor'' would be assessed after the absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly reassessing ourselves,'' said WCVB director
of programming and communications Liz Cheng. ``To say Michael has
been the subject of meetings is not incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another media outlet that employs Barnicle, cable news network
MSNBC, also said Friday it was granting him a 90-day unpaid leave
at his request. ``We will wait ... to see how the facts lay out,''
said MSNBC spokeswoman Kyle Kaino.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lott, communications director for PBS's ``NewsHour with
Jim Lehrer,'' where Barnicle was on a panel of regional
commentators, said Friday that Barnicle has withdrawn from that
panel and will no longer participate on the program. &UR;  &LR; Lott
explained that all the regional commentators work for daily
newspapers, and Barnicle no longer qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   And the board of the Maine Press Association is reconsidering
its invitation for Barnicle to speak at its fall conference Sept.
11. ``I feel it is inappropriate for him to speak at an event when
we are trying to recognize the highest standards of journalism,''
association director Doug Kneeland told the Associated Press
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe could not reach Barnicle for comment Friday, but the
AP reported this statement from him: ``This morning I called both
MSNBC and Ch. 5 to request a 90-day leave of absence. I explained
to them that I need this time in order to clear my name and remove
the cloud that has been placed over my career.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Wednesday, WCVB's intention was to retain
Barnicle. ``Our point of view is that in the 15 years that Mike has
been on our air, we have found one 3-second transgression,'' Cheng
said then, referring to his endorsement of comedian George Carlin's
book ``BrainDroppings'' without having read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have so far is the 3 seconds,'' said Cheng Friday,
explaining that the station will not be reviewing Barnicle's past
on-air work. ``We wouldn't know where to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   At WCVB, the Barnicle matter is clearly a hot topic. David
Ropeik, WCVB reporter and author of a weekly science
question-and-answer column in the Globe, said, ``Opinions were
mixed as to his apparent ethical lapses. There was a lot of deep
concern over whether his continued appearance on our air might
taint the credibility of Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the details ... the appearance becomes the
reality, and people make associations. The idea is to sort it
through, and protect the credibility of the station in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, who had been serving a two-month suspension without
pay at the Globe, resigned from the paper Wednesday after being
unable to verify the details contained in an Oct. 8, 1995, column
about two children being treated for cancer at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In resigning from the Globe, Barnicle attributed his decision to
a ``feeding frenzy'' over his work that ``has disrupted this
paper.'' He also said he believed the information in his October
1995 column to be true and was attempting to verify it.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top national security advisers
began on Friday to show a small group of lawmakers the evidence
they had to justify the missile attacks on terrorist targets.
Although they would not reveal details, the lawmakers said they
agreed that the case against Osama bin Laden is as compelling as
the administration contends.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, an Oregon Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, and Sen. Chuck Robb, a Virginia Democrat on the Select
Committee on Intelligence, said the administration officials laid
out ``irrefutable'' evidence from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The sources include satellite photographs, eavesdropping
intercepts and statements from Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was
arrested in Pakistan and sent to Kenya for interrogation by
Americans about the twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania two weeks ago. Odeh has told Pakistani investigators that
the bombings were the work of bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the information from Odeh was crucial: ``This person
corroborated a lot of other pieces. It tied the bow. This was a
person who brought the ends of string into a good knot.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides
attended the classified briefing that lasted more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they shared with us made it crystal clear that terrorism
had escalated against us,'' Smith said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enemies who don't want to kill a few of us. They want
to kill a lot of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said: ``It was the most compelling briefing I've had in 10
years in the Senate. They had such a solid, unequivocal story to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither senator would describe in detail the briefing from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Secretary of Defense William
Cohen; Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff; and George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Smith characterized the briefing as a ``chronology of crimes
past and crimes in the planning.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, the senators said, conclusively tied bin Laden to
the embassy bombings of Aug. 7 as well as to strikes planned
against other U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence linked bin Laden both to the bombings in Africa,
as well as to the prospect of additional violence,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators declined to identify the specific embassies. But
the government in recent days has removed nonessential personnel
from vulnerable embassies in Albania, Pakistan and Eritrea. The
embassies in Malaysia, Uganda, Egypt and Yemen have also been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the cruise missile attacks was driven largely by
the extraordinary meeting of the terrorist leaders at the training
camps in Afghanistan _ ``a gathering of the hornets'' as Robb put
it.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. intelligence had known of the terrorist camps, the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa ``substantially upped the
ante,'' said Smith. ``This is not just an action-reaction,'' Smith
said. ``Clearly, what I heard today indicated a great escalation on
the war against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, the head of the FBI said that his agents still have
a long way to go before putting together a conspiracy case that
will hold up in a U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in a fairly preliminary stage,'' the director,
Louis Freeh, said at a news conference just before boarding a plane
to Washington.

   South Carolina reopens Capitol today
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: FREELANCE MATERIAL _ not for NYT wires.)
</P>
<P>
   By Lyn Riddle
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TO THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ South Carolina's State House has weathered
General Sherman's torches and cannons, a major earthquake, some
tornadoes and a brief skirmish with Hurricane Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the classical-style center of government has come
through yet another milestone: a three-year, $48 million renovation
that required digging underneath 10-foot-thick granite walls to
install earthquake protection, knocking down walls and rewiring,
reroofing and general repairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building is clearly the most symbolic in South
Carolina,'' said University of South Carolina art history professor
John Bryan, whose book on the history of the State House is due out
this fall. ``It is utterly unique, irreplaceable and it's been in
hazardous condition for a quarter of a century. I am exceedingly
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The State House will reopen to public tours today after a
ribbon-cutting at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Located on 23 acres in the heart of this city at the center of
the state, the State House is actually South Carolina's third
Capitol. The first was in Charleston and the second was burned when
Sherman's troops marched through Columbia in 1865. The existing
building was under construction at that time. Except for a few
still-visible cannonball scars, it was undamaged by the flames that
devastated Columbia. In researching his book, Bryan uncovered
evidence that the building was meant to be a monument to states'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous symbols remain in the building to show state leaders'
intense drive to keep the federal government out of the state's
business, especially with regard to slaveholding. Underneath the
cornerstone was placed a copy of former Vice President John C.
Calhoun's speech in which he declared ``let us secede peacefully or
we will respond with force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the state constitution or the U.S. Constitution, it
was Calhoun's last speech that was laid underneath,'' said Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   (Coincidentally, as workmen moved Calhoun's statue back into the
State House on Wednesday, a crane dropped its 5,500-pound granite
base, causing it to careen down the outside steps, almost knocking
over a statue of George Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said planners in the 1860s also had intended to decorate
the massive columns outside the State House with statues
representing slaves working the fields. The statues had been
completed and stored on the State House grounds when Sherman burned
the city, destroying them and the marble intended for the inside of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said he was ``tremendously heartened to see how far we
have come since then, how much broader and genuinely democratic our
vision is.''
</P>
<P>
   The building was begun in 1851, and construction continued over
50 years. With the new work, Bryan said, it looks much as it did
when it was completed in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and the governor moved out of the building in 1995
so the work could begin. Three sessions of the General Assembly
have taken place in a renovated hotel across the street from the
State House.
</P>
<P>
   By the book, the renovation looks as daunting: 4 million pounds
of granite and four tons of debris removed, 2,300 gallons of paint
used and 80 miles of electrical conduits installed. The slate roof
was replaced with slate from the same company that supplied it in
the 1800s. Plus, the imposing dome now glistens copper in the
sunlight, not green as the old top did. It will take about 15
years, planners said, for the copper to weather.
</P>
<P>
   But even as legislators relish their new desks and high-tech
computers and audiovisual equipment, some state leaders are having
to adjust. The building actually has 40 percent less office space
than before, sending numerous folks used to working in the historic
digs to office complexes scattered around the Capitol complex.
</P>
<P>
   One controversial legacy remains. When Gov. David Beasley cuts
the ribbon to reopen the building, flying high above the sparkling
copper dome will be the Confederate battle flag, long a source of
contention between some blacks and some whites over whether a
symbol of the Civil War should remain atop a government building.

 &HT;    Archbishop Tutu in Atlanta for a year as professor
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While condemning attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu Friday stopped short
of embracing American military retaliation aimed at terrorist camps
in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not myself too comfortable with, `We hit them.''' Tutu
said Friday after arriving at Emory University, where he will spend
a year as a visiting professor of theology. ``Are we sure that the
targets are accurate?''
</P>
<P>
   Awarded the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
campaign in South Africa, Tutu said no one should ``ever have truck
with terror wherever it may happen.'' The difficulty, he said, is
how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it will be OK to try and find the people who are
the ringleaders who are responsible for giving the orders,'' said
Tutu, 66. ``We've got to be very careful that we don't, in trying
to counteract, find that we are ourselves eroding the very
structures of the law. I mean, there is international law, and
one's obviously concerned that it seems that in retaliating in the
fashion that appeared to have happened, international law, morality
_ that all of those are put in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearied by his daylong trip from Cape Town, Tutu made the first
appearance connected with his arrival at Emory to teach two courses
in the spring. He wore khaki pants, a blue blazer and a
wine-colored shirt as he spoke for 20 minutes before campus staff
drove him away in a Saturn station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said he looked forward to unwinding after two years of
chairing South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which
is investigating crimes committed during the country's period of
white rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who will attend a faculty retreat this weekend, arrived on
campus the day a judge fined and sentenced former apartheid
president P.W. Botha for ignoring a summons from Tutu's commission.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he supported a jail sentence for Botha, Tutu said, ``Of
course not. We are not blood thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The TRC does not seek to gloat, does not want to find the
truth in order to humiliate or belittle people or embarrass
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in failing health, Botha led the country during some of the
bloodiest days of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in his worst nightmare did he ever think that he would sit
in a court presided over by a black magistrate,'' Tutu said. ``I
think there is an appropriateness in demonstrating that this is a
moral universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral symmetry, a moral appreciation in what has
taken place. He has been found guilty in an open court where he had
the opportunity of being defended by lawyers of his own choice _
something he did not allow opponents at the time he was state
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate matter, Tutu revealed the TRC uncovered letters
that may document South Africa and other countries plotted to kill
U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold in 1961. Hammarskjold and
15 others died in a plane crash while working on a peace agreement
between Congo and a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   The documents referred to aircraft sabotage and include
correspondence among the South African military, the CIA and Great
Britain, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported. At Emory, Tutu
conceded the letters may be disinformation planted during an era
when the Soviet Union favored such ruses.
</P>
<P>
   But, Tutu added, ``It isn't something that is so bizarre. Things
of that sort have happened in the past. That is why you can't
dismiss it as totally, totally incredible.''

GALAXY TO TEST REVOLUTION RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Robin Fraser is dispelling doubts about the
Los Angeles Galaxy's motivation in Saturday's Major League Soccer
game against the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to play for,'' said Fraser, the Galaxy's
defensive leader and a US national team member. ``We still need 9
points to clinch first place in our group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy own the best record in MLS (55 points in 25 games),
have scored the most goals (71), and have the top goal differential
(plus-35). They have clinched a Western Conference playoff berth
with more than a month remaining in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are in a much different situation. They have
earned 20 points, fewest in the league, and only 10 points since
May 10. They are 6 points behind the Miami Fusion in the race for
the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shame in losing to a team that potentially is
better than us,'' Revolution coach Thomas Rongen said Friday. ``But
we are in a precarious situation. And I firmly believe that
regardless of who we are playing, we have a chance to win. Will it
be a tough task? Absolutely. We are playing against a very good
team. We almost have to win, and I feel we can.''
</P>
<P>
   A New England victory or a Miami defeat in Kansas City Sunday
would set up a Fusion-Revolution showdown in Miami next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution appeared to be out of contention after enduring
an MLS-record eight-game home losing streak, then falling, 6-1, at
Columbus two weeks ago. But they were rejuvenated by the recovery
of midfielder Jair, the move of David Nakhid to an attacking
midfield position, and the goalkeeping of Ian Feuer against Tampa
Bay last week. The game finished tied, 1-1, in regulation time, but
the Revolutuion, who won the post-match shootout, displayed enough
of an attacking threat to salvage some hope for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Galaxy should be a difficult test, with striker Carlos
Hermosillo, former Revolution forward Welton and Cobi Jones on the
wings, and Salvadoran midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a well-balanced team,'' Rongen said. ``With D.C.
United, they are the upper echelon of the league. They have so many
good pros and they have acquired a winner's mentality. They have
put the pressure on themselves that they expect to win.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Los Angeles Dodgers
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Today at 4:05 p.m., Sunday at 8:05 p.m, Monday at 1:10
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: FOX will telecast today, ESPN will telecast Sunday
and TBS will telecast Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Today, LHP Denny Neagle (11-11,
3.57; 7-5, 2.11 lifetime vs. Dodgers) vs. RHP Darren Dreifort
(6-11, 3.72; 0-3, 6.23 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday, RHP Greg
Maddux (16-6, 1.65; 8-3, 2.24 lifetime vs. Dodgers) vs. LHP Carlos
Perez (7-12, 3.82; 2-4, 3.47 lifetime vs. Braves). Monday, LHP Tom
Glavine (16-5, 2.53; 13-14, 3.90 lifetime vs. Dodgers) vs. LHP
Brian Bohanon (6-8, 2.85; 0-1, 5.73 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 232-301 but
is 29-12 at home against the Dodgers since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves were 5-0 this season and had taken
eight in a row from L.A. until the Dodgers' 1-0 victory Sunday.
Atlanta swept a three-game series at home May 4-6 and then took two
of three at Dodger Stadium last weekend. The Dodgers are batting
.212 against the Braves this year, but second baseman Eric Young
has hit two of his four homers this season against Atlanta pitching
within his last seven at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers leaders: Avg. _ Trenidad Hubbard (.327); HRs _ Raul
Mondesi (27); RBIs _ Gary Sheffield (77); SBs_ Eric Young (36).
Wins _ Chan Ho Park (10); ERA _ Jeff Shaw (1.31). Saves _ Shaw
(37). Strikeouts _ Darren Dreifort (152).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Dodgers went into Friday night's game in Florida
with a 6-12 record this month, blowing their playoff chances before
any possible stretch run. Before beating Florida on Thursday, L.A.
had dropped five road games in a row. . . . The arrival of Charles
Johnson has done little for the offense. He is hitting .183 in road
games. But behind the plate, he has helped to lower the club ERA
from 4.11 when Mike Piazza was traded to its current 3.76. . . .
Offense, not pitching, is the pressing concern. The Dodgers' team
average of .252 is 14th in the league, and their on-base percentage
(.309) is the lowest in either league. The team has been held to
two or fewer runs eight times in its last 14 games. . . . The
Braves see a rarity this weekend: back-to-back starts by Dodgers
left-handers. L.A. had not had two lefties in the regular rotation
since 1987, Rick Honeycutt and Fernando Valenzuela. . . . Today's
game is a pitching rematch of Sunday, when Dreifort threw seven
shutout innings, Neagle allowed a Eric Young homer in the eighth
and L.A. won 1-0. The game marked the third time this year Dreifort
had a scoreless performance, but never against the Braves. In his
previous 10 1/3 career innings against Atlanta, he had given up 12
runs. . . . 3B Bobby Bonilla has been in and out of the lineup
because of a tender left wrist that had required surgery. He had a
five-game hit streak entering Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the DL: OF Todd Hollandsworth (left shoulder surgery), INF
Adam Riggs (torn right labrum), RHP Ramon Martinez (right rotator
cuff surgery), INF Jose Vizcaino (sprained left ankle), RHP Ismael
Valdes (sprained left ankle), INF Tripp Cromer (right quadricep
pull), RHP Darren Hall (torn right rotator cuff).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: 2B Eric Young took an 11-game hitting streak into
Friday night. RHP Jeff Shaw has not allowed a run in 51 of his 58
appearances this season. SS Mark Grudzielanek is hitting .326 since
the Dodgers acquired him from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: OF Raul Mondesi had two hits in his first 13 at-bats
of the road trip. Gary Sheffield's home run Thursday night snapped
a 4-for-28 slide. OF Matt Luke is batting .139 since the 4th of
July.

 &HT;    On the verge of stardom
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ It became a clubhouse joke. But as the July
31 non-waiver trade deadline neared, the laughter became more
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Trade anxiety usually is confined to a big-league clubhouse. But
not this year. Not on the Greenville Braves, a minor-league team
with three of baseball's best major-league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Atlanta general manager John Schuerholz tried to make a
deal for bullpen help, three names almost always came up _ Bruce
Chen, Odaliz Perez and George Lombard. Other general managers
thought the Braves might be just desperate enough to sacrifice part
of their future for a closer that could help them win a World
Series this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the phone rang in the clubhouse, someone would joke
that one of us had been traded,'' Lombard recalled. ``That's all a
lot of people were talking about. We'd kid each other about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all out to get to the big leagues as quick as we can,
but none of us wanted to be traded. We all wanted to make it in
Atlanta with the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Lombard, an Atlanta native who turned down a chance
for college football stardom at the University of Georgia to sign a
baseball-only deal with the Braves in 1994 after graduating from
the Lovett School. The $425,000 deal was a record for a
second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Until this season, it seemed that the Braves and Lombard might
have made a mistake. A .238 lifetime hitter entering the season,
the 22-year-old outfielder is having a breakout year in the Class
AA Southern League.
</P>
<P>
   After a torrid first two months, Lombard's hot hitting has
cooled after missing two weeks with a strained left shoulder. But
the left-hander still is batting .301 with 20 homers, 60 RBIs and
31 stolen bases in 35 attempts. He is the first G-Brave to have at
least 20 homers and 30 steals in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a lot of fun when you are doing well,'' Lombard
said. ``When you're not, it isn't. I thought I was making progress,
but I hadn't really put up the numbers. Now I'm starting to, and it
feels good. I've come a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part of baseball is all the ups and downs. It's
not like football. Baseball is like a roller-coaster and you have
to not worry about a bad day or a bad at-bat. You've got to have a
little bit of cockiness when you're on the field. I've struggled to
have that in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed about missing college life and frustrated by his
lack of baseball success, Lombard thought about quitting several
times his first few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time,'' he said, ``I went through about a three-week phase
of, if I struck out, then I would say to myself, `I'm through with
this. I'm going to go back and play football.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That would have made Georgia football fans happy, but Lombard
didn't want to be labeled a quitter. Right decision or wrong, he
was determined to make himself into a baseball player, no matter
how many barking Bulldogs fans he heard in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a while, but I think people are finally seeing me
as a baseball player first, not a football player learning to play
baseball,'' Lombard said. ``I'm not thinking and worrying about
everything now.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer does the 6-foot, 200-pounder look out of place at bat
or in the outfield. He still strikes out too much and his arm is
not the best, but Lombard has the combination of speed and power
that makes baseball officials drool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just explodes off his bat when he hits it,''
Greenville manager Randy Ingle said. ``You put that with his speed
and you know he's got a chance to be a heck of a major-league
player. It takes time, but George is willing to put in the work to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a good winter in the Australian League, Lombard went to
major-league spring training with the Braves for the first time
this year and hopes to make his major league debut after rosters
are expanded Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and Perez were moved up to AAA Richmond earlier this month
and also could be in Atlanta soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team I talked to asked about three players from our
system,'' Schuerholz said. ``I never say that anyone is
untouchable, but our action (in not making a trade) shows how
highly they are held (by the Braves).''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks of July, it wasn't uncommon for scouts
from 12 to 15 teams to attend a Greenville game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the minors a while, and I'd never seen that
many before,'' Ingle said.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the deadline passed, most of the scouts were gone.
Now with Chen and Perez promoted, Lombard has the attention all to
himself in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Most minor leaguers get little or no mail from fans; Lombard is
an exception. He is flooded with autograph requests, especially on
baseball cards. Collectors know a future star when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's kind of nice,'' Lombard said. ``It shows someone
thinks you are going to make it to the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lombard, who will play in the Arizona Fall League, hopes to be
at Turner Field by September. ``It will be a great story when he
makes it,'' Schuerholz said. ``He took a risk to give up football.
He has worked very hard to make it pay off. He is on the verge.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer are afternoons at Sanford Stadium on Lombard's mind,
although he attends at least one game each season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more years that pass,'' he said, ``the less I think about
football.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors hoping for a languid summer day of stock
trading were treated instead to a wild ride Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After sharp drops on markets in Asia and Europe, the Dow Jones
industrial average acted like a bungee-jumper. The Dow plunged 280
points just before noon, then bounced back to end the day at
8,533.65, a loss of only 77.76 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 34.84, or 1.9 percent, to 1,797.61.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks were again caught in a global downdraft, as there
was no bad domestic news Friday. The U.S. economy remains robust by
almost all measures, and consumer confidence is still high. The
housing market is strong, auto sales are expected to do well as
General Motors recovers from two plant strikes and personal income
is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``A confluence of events overseas is overwhelming what I believe
to be very good fundamentals for the U.S. economy,'' said Timothy
J. Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, for example, that Asia has not yet righted itself.
Adding to fears that Japan's economy is worsening, Okura &AMP; Co., a
Tokyo trading concern, sought protection from creditors Friday, the
nation's third-largest corporate bankruptcy this year. Investors
were also disappointed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's reluctance
to reduce the crippling 5 percent consumption tax. The yen lost
ground again to the dollar, falling 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial crisis shows no signs of abating, and its
stock market dropped 5.6 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A newer worry on the international scene is Latin America.
Inflation rates are rising in the emerging market nations of
Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, and their currencies are sinking.
As a result, there is increased concern that their troubles will
have an impact on U.S. exports. Roughly 20 percent of U.S. exports
go to Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts think the selloff in emerging markets
signaled the realization among investors that the backstops of the
International Monetary Fund and the group of seven leading
industrial nations may no longer be there.
</P>
<P>
   John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that
even if the IMF were to try another bailout, such a move would no
longer be reassuring to investors because it has not proved to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness that the crisis management is in crisis adds to
investor uncertainty and market volatility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some investors are beginning to question whether
U.S. stocks can be a port in a worldwide economic storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks to the U.S. are rising,'' said Bill Dudley,
economist at Goldman, Sachs. ``The International Monetary Fund is
out of money and out of credibility. The pressures on
emerging-market countries are real. And the U.S. economy is more
fragile because of its dependence on the stock market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investors seem to be bracing themselves for the second wave of
Asia troubles. The first stage in the crisis was an expected
decline in exports, evidenced in the June trade figures. Of the $10
billion slide in the last six months, $8 billion of it was a
collapse in exports. The second stage is a flood of cheap imports
into this country, which has not yet happened. If it does, U.S.
corporations will find their margins squeezed as they are forced to
compete with these lower-priced goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry among economists is that the capital spending boom
that has kept the U.S. economy perking is about to end. ``You do
have tantalizing signs that the capital spending boom is finally
over,'' said M. Cary Leahey, chief economist at High Frequency
Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ``The classic economic problem now is
firms are preparing for a party in 1999 and maybe nobody's going to
show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahey argues that U.S. corporations have prepared for an
economy growing at 5 percent annually _ built plants, added
capacity, hired employees _ and they are going to end up with an
economy growing at maybe half that rate.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch
said that a slowdown in capital investment would put a drag on
economic growth. ``Investment is just running too fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If investment were to slow, so would the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with markets around the world, U.S. stocks held up
well. European markets were down Friday: Germany's Dax index lost
5.4 percent of its value, and Spain's IBEX fell 5.81 percent.
Mexico's chief index fell almost 2.5 percent. The Brazilian stock
market lost 2.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking some calm in the worldwide storm, investors fled to
Treasury securities. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.43
percent, its lowest level in decades At midday, when stocks were at
their lows, long-term Treasury yields, which move in the opposite
direction from their prices, touched 5.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's trading, shares of banks, semiconductor makers and
computer manufacturers were particularly hard hit. J.P. Morgan lost
14 percent of its value, Hewlett-Packard fell 4.6 percent. Bucking
the trend were drug stocks and consumer packaged goods makers.
Johnson &AMP; Johnson gained 4.38 percent, and Procter &AMP; Gamble rose
2.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The market started to rebound shortly after noon. One trader
speculated that investors thought that declining Treasury yields
would make stocks more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Even after this summer's downdrafts, stocks are still trading at
high prices historically, which makes them very vulnerable to
external shocks. ``The market is faced with a manifold set of
issues that cannot be resolved quickly,'' said Marshall Acuff,
equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.

 &HT;    Religion finally has a place in clubhouse
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Religion and baseball didn't mix when former
Atlanta Braves pitchers Jose Alvarez and Marty Clary were in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams didn't want Bibles in the clubhouse,'' Alvarez said.
``Managers thought religion made you soft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was considered a sign of weakness,'' Clary said. ``If you
weren't cussing or throwing things when you lost, people thought
you didn't care. Christians got a bad name.''
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere in baseball has changed. Baseball Chapel,
begun more than 30 years ago, is now active on all major-league
teams and all but a few minor-league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   With Alvarez, 42, or Clary, 38, leading the chapel services, the
Greenville Braves' weekly sessions often attract more than half the
team. The players usually meet in the bullpen for about 20 minutes
on Saturdays after batting practice. Chapel services also are
conducted for the visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get more players than on any other team I've played with,''
outfielder George Lombard said. ``It means a lot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The players know we experienced some of the same things they
are going through,'' Clary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the minors is a time of great uncertainty and
longing,'' Alvarez said. ``Young players need to know that God's
love is unconditional and that we are all saved by God's grace. To
be a complete person, you need to be strong physically, mentally
and spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez and Clary were active in Baseball Chapel services while
they were Atlanta Braves in the late 1980s. Neither is a minister,
but Alvarez is active as a Christian speaker. Both are members of
Greenville-area Baptist churches _ Alvarez at Southside and Clary
at Siloam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Christian doesn't mean being passive,'' Alvarez said.
``Jesus Christ certainly wasn't. ... But just because you are a
Christian doesn't mean you are going to win the game or hit a home
run. You can't use your faith as a crutch.''
</P>
<P>
   Clary said, ``Christianity isn't a good-luck charm.''

 &HT;    Yukon Denali reaches its peaks
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the original Denali is the 6 million-acre national
park in Alaska, what does that make the GMC Yukon Denali? It's a
thinly, but sumptuously, disguised Chevrolet Tahoe, soon to be
similarly reworked and rebadged to appear as the Cadillac Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   The Denali park is home to one of the world's highest peaks,
Mount McKinley, while the GMC Denali is for those willing to pay
the lofty base price of $42,855 (the option-free test vehicle
totaled $43,495 after delivery charge was added). Pricey? Yes, but
as Consumer Guide _ like other publications _ notes, the Denali
``matches luxury features with any rival and beats most in power
and refinement.''
</P>
<P>
   Such praise is almost as good as hearing ``ka-ching'' for GMC
execs, who were outflanked by the Lincoln Navigator, a similarly
reworked version of the Ford Expedition. Ford/Lincoln beat the GM
crowd to the super-luxury sport-utility market, but the playing
field is being leveled.
</P>
<P>
   The Denali may lack the traditional cachet of a Lincoln, but
it's equally imposing, from its color-keyed luggage rack to its
color-keyed running boards. With its large rectangular grille
flanked by headlamp clusters seemingly large enough to light up
football fields, the Denali is 201.2 inches long, 79 inches tall,
78.8 inches wide and has a curb weight of nearly 6,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   GMC has further enhanced the brawny appearance of the Denali
with squared-off body cladding above the 16-inch wheels, which are
gleaming six-spokers. The Denali is a mass of sheet metal and glass
that justifies dropping a 5.7-liter V-8 into an engine bay only
slightly smaller than an efficiency apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly quiet V-8 pounds out 255 horsepower at 4,600
rpm and begins generating its peak 330 feet-pounds of torque at a
utilitarian 2,800 rpm. Channel that power through an idiot-proof
two-/four-wheel drive system smooth enough to make barely
noticeable upshifts and the driving, hauling and towing is a
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The test Denali's out-of-balance wheels created some annoying
vibration in the floor at expressway speeds (the Cadillac version
will have more insulation), but the ride remained soft. Body
movement is well-controlled, but mild off-road venturing proved
that while capable of sport-utility trekking, the Denali is not for
the timid. A three-ton vehicle isn't for throwing about by anyone
lacking self-confidence as a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Far better to keep the Denali on paved surfaces and wallow in
its luxury. The power front seats seem built to NFL standards, and
the interior boasts leather, Zebrano wood and such a multiplicity
of features that there's a six-disc CD changer in the chest-size
center console and a one-disc player in the dash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its interior space (ample seating for five), the
Denali's controls are well within a driver's reach, and good
outside mirrors help with staying in touch with the outside world.
Parking the Denali in lined spaces or even at curbs is a bit of a
guessing game, but overall visibility is quite good.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the occupant security and roominess stemming from
the Denali's bulk does, of course, continue after the purchase. The
EPA figures of 12 mpg in the city and 16 on the highway are
marginal, at best, but at least regular unleaded gas can be used.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be enough gas to get through the sprawling Denali
National Park and Preserve, but the Yukon Denali is large enough to
feel at home there and its appointments will make roughing it a
foreign phrase.

MEXICO REAFFIRMS STANCE ON ENCOURAGING BORDER CROSSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The recent deaths of 10 Mexicans found in the
California desert have drawn attention to Mexico's longstanding
position of not discouraging its citizens from undertaking the
illegal _ and increasingly dangerous _ journey across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Solis Camara, who heads Mexico's migration service,
surprised officials on both sides of the border with the answer he
gave a Mexican reporter who asked what the government was doing to
protect those who try to emigrate in the savage heat of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time will we take any action that could discourage
Mexicans from emigrating to the United States,'' said Solis. ``That
is because these are people who leave their families and their
homes with the legitimate goal of bettering their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 Mexicans trying to emigrate illegally have been
found dead in the California desert near the border so far this
year, according to Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Solis' unusually blunt statements reopened one of the country's
most sensitive diplomatic quandaries. Millions of illegal border
crossings are virtually unimpeded on the Mexican side while the
U.S. Border Patrol continues to put more money and personnel into
securing the border.
</P>
<P>
   Solis was not available to explain his statements, made last
week, but at a recent bill-signing ceremony in Mexico City, his
superior, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, minister of the powerful
Interior Department, found himself having to explain what Solis
really meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he says that immigration is not going to be impeded, it
simply means that no one is going to limit the freedom of those who
seek to improve their lives by migrating to another country,''
Labastida said. ``This doesn't mean that we are not bothered by
what is happening or that we are not undertaking efforts to avoid
and reduce the human cost of this migration.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mexico's consul general in Los Angeles, Jose Angel Pescador, has
been put in the difficult spot of having to explain Mexico's
position to the relatives of those who died, as well as to U.S.
officials and California residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his office, Pescador said that
Article 11 of the Mexican constitution guarantees all Mexicans
freedom of movement and the right to go where they want, which the
government interprets as including the right to illegally cross the
U.S. border without being stopped by Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the constitution, in Article 4, also guarantees
every Mexican's right to safety and good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides,'' Pescador said, ``here in the U.S., there also
are laws that give the Border Patrol the responsibility to prevent
people without documents from entering the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of two of the Mexicans who were found dead under a
cedar tree on the U.S. side of the border early this month have
asked the consul to investigate the increasing dangers on the
border and to identify the smugglers responsible for leaving the
illegal migrants to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death of even one Mexican crossing the border should weigh
on the conscience of both countries,'' Pescador said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the United States and Mexico agreed to cooperate in a
campaign to warn Mexicans, and their families in the United States,
about the dangers of crossing the border, especially if they use
the ``polleros'' or smugglers who are suspected of abandoning
people in the desert once they have received their payment.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador Zamora, a Border Patrol agent in San Diego, said that
100 new signs clearly stating the danger of trying to cross the
inhospitable areas along the border are being erected on the U.S.
side now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth it,'' the signs say in Spanish, along with
drawings to represent the intense heat and desert conditions in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora said radio and television announcements will be played in
U.S. cities, as well as in Mexico, to warn people that conditions
have changed and that crossing the border is now more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Recent efforts to tighten the border around Tijuana have been
successful, Zamora said, but they have forced smugglers to try to
cross at other, more difficult, places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the ease of transportation out of the hands of
smugglers has worked,'' he said. ``But we never intended to have
people die.''

THE GORDON RULES: HOW FAR CAN HE GO?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A victory tonight in the Goody's 500 at Bristol (Tenn.) Motor
Speedway would give Jeff Gordon five consecutive victories in
NASCAR Winston Cup races, a record for the modern era, which began
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon leads the points race and has eight victories and six
poles this year. He has won four times at Bristol, including this
year's spring race.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of The Streak, staff writer Len Hayward answers 10
questions about Gordon, why he is hot now and how far he can go: &QL; 
1. WHY IS GORDON WINNING NOW? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has won in any kind of car he has driven _
quarter-midgets, sprint cars, championship dirt cars, the Busch
Grand National Series and Winston Cup stock cars. He started
driving a car with a big engine when he was 13. He has the talent
and now has a team behind him that his worthy of his talent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, people forget that Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham have
been together throughout Gordon's Cup career, which began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the team cheats. But when a driver wins
often, wild rumors surface about whether the team is on the
up-and-up.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates, who owns the car Dale Jarrett drives, believes
that a key to Gordon's midseason charge has been his team figuring
out the new Chevy engine better than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good and smart,'' Yates said. &QL; 
2. HOW FAR CAN GORDON GO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has the potential to win as many Winston Cup
championships as he wants, but whether he breaks Richard Petty's
and Dale Earnhardt's record of seven titles is another question. A
recurring rumor has Gordon leaving NASCAR to drive Formula One
cars. Or Gordon could be the next Fred Lorenzen, who won 26 races
before he turned 33. Lorenzen left the sport in 1967 for various
reasons. He returned in 1970 at age 36, but never was as
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon stays in Winston Cup, he will win a lot, but he has
little chance to catch Petty's 200 career victories. Gordon would
have to win at least 10 races for the next 17 years to have a
chance. &QL; 
3. WHERE DOES CREW CHIEF RAY EVERNHAM FACTOR INTO THE QUESTION? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among NASCAR crew chiefs, Evernham is one of the best _ if not
the best. He continually makes the right adjustments to the car
during a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray and the crew just never give up,'' Gordon said after
coming from well behind to win at Michigan on Sunday. ``We don't
ever give up until the checkered flag drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham's attention to detail might be as important to the
team's success as Gordon's driving. After each race, Evernham
compiles his notes and notes from the chief mechanic, the engine
tuner, the tire specialist and the team engineer into a document of
three or four pages describing the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On race day, before the car is rolled to the starting line, it
has been through a checklist with a name signed to every item. &QL; 
4. IS GORDON THE BEST DRIVER EVER? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. Gordon is talented, but Richard Petty
won on dirt tracks, short tracks and big tracks at a time when the
cars were not as safe, weighed more and did not have power
steering. But it is like comparing apples to oranges because Petty
was at his prime in a different era. &QL; 
5. WHY AREN'T MORE CHEVROLET TEAMS WINNING? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because there always seems to be a lead-dog team outperforming
every other team. Five years ago, that Chevy team was Dale
Earnhardt's. Gordon's team seems to have everything figured out
about the new SB2 engine. &QL; 
6. WHY DO MANY STOCK-CAR FANS DESPISE GORDON? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The group of fans that most despise him are 18- to 35-year-old
Southern males, typically Earnhardt fans. Gordon is young,
good-looking and does not come from the South. He is cheered more
in the Midwest and West than he is in the South or on the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Bristol last August, the public-address
announcer could not even finish Gordon's name during a driver
introduction before a majority of the crowd began to boo.
</P>
<P>
   But at Indianapolis and Sears Point, he was cheered for
victories in both of those races this season. &QL; 
7. CAN HE BEAT RICHARD PETTY'S RECORD OF WINNING 10 CONSECUTIVE
RACES? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is set up in a way that he can. Whether he will is
another story. He has been winning so much that if someone, such as
Rusty Wallace or Dale Earnhardt, is close to him at the end of the
race, Gordon is likely to end up in the wall. Remember the bumping
between Gordon and Jeff Burton last season in the Southern 500,
with Burton admitting that he tried to put Gordon in the wall?
</P>
<P>
   If he can win tonight, Gordon would have victory No. 38, moving
him past the late Bobby Isaac into sole possession of 15th place in
career victories. The next two races are in Loudon, N.H., and
Darlington, S.C., and Gordon has impressive credentials at both
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   At Darlington, considered the toughest track on the circuit,
Gordon has won the granddaddy of stock-car races _ the Southern 500
_ three years in a row. On Labor Day weekend, he will try to make
it four.
</P>
<P>
   That would make seven consecutive victories and move him closer
to Petty's record of 10 in a row _ set in the pioneer era when
NASCAR staged about 50 races per season. &QL; 
8. DOES NASCAR NEED JEFF GORDON? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Gordon represents a new generation of drivers, whom race
fans essentially watched grow up on television. He is young,
good-looking and has a beautiful wife. Why would NASCAR, a sport
that is attempting to sell itself to Wall Street and not only to
its typical Southern constituency, not want him?
</P>
<P>
   And consider this: Chicago-based Burns Sports Celebrity Service
conducted a survey to determine which athletes were most desirable
to advertising decision-makers. Time magazine reported the results
reveal Gordon trailed only ``basketball deity Michael Jordan and
golfers Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer.'' &QL; 
9. WHAT MAKES GORDON SUCH A GREAT DRIVER? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greer Smith of the ``Southern Motoracing'' newspaper in
Winston-Salem, N.C., who has been covering the sport since the
1970s, said there are three drivers he has seen do things no other
driver would even try _ the late Tim Richmond, Dale Earnhardt and
Jeff Gordon. &QL; 
10. COULD ANYONE WIN IN THE NO. 24 CAR? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but not as often as Gordon. No. 24 is owned by Rick
Hendrick, who is one of the most powerful and richest men in
motorsports. He will give his teams the best that can be bought, so
if Jeff Burton were in that car he would win, but not as often as
Gordon.

 &HT;    Bowden as excited as ever to embark on new season
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ You'd figure after 368 games as a head
football coach _ 281 of them wins _ one loss wouldn't keep a guy up
late at night. But it does if you're Florida State's Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who has won more games than any active Division I coach
but Penn State's Joe Paterno, is still having nightmares over last
season's 32-29 loss to Florida in the regular-season finale. For it
proved to be as costly as any regular-season defeat that Bowden has
had in 22 years at FSU.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, ranked No. 1 in the coaches' poll coming into the
game, led the Gators 29-25 after kicking a field goal with 2:38
remaining. But on Florida's very next play, FSU's vaunted defense
broke down and gave up a 63-yard pass from Doug Johnson to Jacquez
Green. That set up the Gators' winning touchdown with 1:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   The loss not only knocked the Seminoles out of the No. 1
ranking, but it denied them a matchup with undefeated Nebraska in
the Orange Bowl. As talented as Nebraska was, Bowden was convinced
his team had enough speed to beat the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, always upbeat in public, was privately devastated.
Another shot at a national championship _ and a good one at that _
had gone by the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy didn't sleep much at all for a long time after that (the
Florida game),'' said Bowden's son Terry, head coach at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who is about to enter his 30th season as a head coach,
agrees that the Florida loss of 1997 rates as one of the toughest
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held on to that one longer than any one I can remember,''
said Bowden, who turns 69 in November. ``The year before when they
beat us in (52-20 in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship)
that didn't bother me. We just weren't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it's (three) points. And to lose like that ... man,
that hurt. And it hurt a long time. Especially when it's against
your 'favorite' team.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a strange way _ maybe in a way that only another football
coach could understand _ Bobby Bowden has taken some comfort in the
pain. Because to feel pain after so many years means you still
care. And if you still care you can summon the energy necessary to
go through the physical grind of another season. At an age where
most men are cooling their heels in retirement, this grandfather of
23 will jump back into what should be another white-hot race for
the national championship in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm getting older but the drive to win has always been
there,'' said Bowden, whose teams have won a gaudy 118 games over
11 seasons. ``I'm just as excited about this season as I've ever
been about any one I've coached.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Bowden's success over those 11 seasons, and the goals that
still lay ahead, the desire to go to work every day shouldn't wane
anytime soon. The numbers are by now familiar but bear repeating:
</P>
<P>
   _ Since 1987, Bowden's teams have won 10 or more games every
year, an NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   _ For 11 straight years, FSU has finished in the final top four
of the Associated Press poll. Florida is second on that list with
three.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bowden is 12-1 in his last 13 bowl games, including a streak
of 11 straight snapped by the Sugar Bowl loss to Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ His teams are 47-1 in ACC play since joining the conference in
1992. This fall the Seminoles will be going for their seventh
straight ACC title.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative to be found in all those numbers is the number
one. That's how many national championships Bowden's troops have
been able to win during this remarkable string. Bowden's critics _
and they are out there _ insist that Florida State should have more
titles given the incredible talent that has passed through
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden does not disagree but neither does he dwell on what might
have or should have been. To survive in this business, the focus
must always be on the next team and on the next game. It is the
only way to stay sane in what is a crazy profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look ahead at what this team could do and I'll tell
you, if we could put it together, we could be in the hunt,'' said
Bowden. ``The good thing for us is we've go the pieces out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve starters return and Florida State has all its ``tough''
games _ Southern Cal, North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida _ at
home. The Seminoles have a 26-year-old quarterback in Chris Weinke
and two of the most talented offensive players around in tailback
Travis Minor and wide receiver Pete Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Seminoles are even faster than a year ago when
they finished third in the nation (241.4 ypg). At 281 victories,
Bowden could reach the magical 300 mark some time in 1999. He needs
42 wins to catch Alabama's Bear Bryant on the all-time list for
Division I coaches. To Bowden, who grew up in Birmingham and was a
long-time Alabama fan, that would be something special.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says he has no idea when he might retire. But he has set
up a few personal ground rules that will tell him when it's time to
go:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``If I wake up one morning and I don't want to go to work,
that's it. I'm history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he admired the decision of Dean Smith, North
Carolina's legendary basketball coach, who suddenly retired last
October. ``Maybe that's the way to go. Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When his health can no longer hold up. _ When he can no longer
look a recruit in the eye and promise him that he'll be at FSU the
whole time the recruit is there.
</P>
<P>
   _ If he starts losing. ``I'm not going through that again. That
ain't no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past 11 years are any indication, Florida State and Bobby
Bowden still have a lot of fun days ahead.

 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By moving forcefully against suspected terrorists,
President Clinton won praise even from critics of his foreign
policy. Now, some foreign policy specialists say, the president
should act with equal resolve to manage another set of overseas
problems that could be even more important to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has suspended its cooperation with United Nations weapons
inspectors. North Korea shows new signs of building nuclear arms.
Mideast peace talks have stalled. And Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic is forcibly pushing ethnic Albanians out of the province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In some of these cases, the United States warned there would be
stern consequences for bucking US policy. But the president has
followed those warnings with little action, his critics say _ at
least not much that can be seen publicly.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's strike against terrorists this week was welcome,
``regrettably, that credibility and resolve have been lacking from
other critical foreign policy challenges,'' Senator John McCain,
Republican of Arizona, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign policy analysts called the anti-terrorist
strikes on Thursday proper but limited. They said Clinton put few
US lives and little political capital at risk in ordering the
missile attacks _ launched from faraway ships _ on people who are
universally unpopular in the United States for their alleged ties
to the US embassy bombings two weeks ago in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very strong statement about our willingness to use
force, and I don't think it would change the resolve of Saddam
Hussein (of Iraq) or Milosevic in Kosovo,'' said Michael O'Hanlon,
a Brookings Institution fellow, about the missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The missile attacks, in fact, have diverted public attention
from more important foreign problems, said Edward Luttwak, a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Events like the Aug. 7 embassy bombings ``are unimportant,
almost trivial,'' Luttwak said. ``It's sad that people got killed
there, but that has the importance of a car crash ... Compare that
to the Russian economic crisis, with its potential for bursting
Russia and having maybe 25,000 nuclear weapons spill out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But President Clinton has not been available to deal
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the administration are also waiting for a public
response to news that US spy satellites recently detected a large
facility in North Korea that could be part of a new nuclear weapons
program. If so, North Korea may be in violation of a four-year-old
agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return for
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's foreign policy team also stands accused of failing to
solve problems at home. The administration has said repeatedly that
the International Monetary Fund needs a cash infusion so it can
make new loans to ease the economic crisis in Asia and Russia. But
the president so far has been unable to force Congress to set aside
new money for the international lending agency. Moreover, Clinton's
push for special ``fast track'' powers to negotiate trade treaties
has stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics blame the Monica S. Lewinsky sex scandal and other
domestic problems for the inaction on foreign matters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Luttwak said, warnings by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that Israel must speed up the peace process have
proven to be empty. Clinton has been unwilling to rebuke Israel, he
said, for fear of angering pro-Israeli lawmakers who he may need
later as the Lewinsky scandal comes before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, at this point Madeleine Albright is incapacitated,''
Luttwak said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan research
group created by Congress, research director Patrick Cronin said US
leaders ``haven't followed through as they should'' on some of the
most pressing foreign policy problems. But he said those problems
are more complex than some critics acknowledge, and the United
States is trying to find new ways to manage some of them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, threats of force against Iraq now produce
``diminishing returns,'' and the United States needs a new
strategy. And US officials are properly alarmed by the possible
resumption of a nuclear arms program in North Korea, even if that
is not publicly apparent, Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's focus on foreign policy ``clearly
could be better, but it's not as bleak as the critics portray it,''
he said.

 &HT;    History in his sights
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Jeff Gordon will make his run at NASCAR history
tonight in the Goody's 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon wins, he will become the first driver in modern-era
history to win five-consecutive Winston Cup races. NASCAR's modern
era began in 1972, when the race schedule was trimmed to 30 events.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said the key will be to negotiate Bristol's .533-mile
high-banked oval, where the field runs nose to bumper under the
lights for 500 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, if I could pick and choose where we were going to try to
do this thing, I'd probably say Sears Point or some place like
that,'' Gordon said, tongue in cheek. ``Maybe Pocono. Yeah, Pocono
would be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is trying to play down the moment as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just saying we're going to Bristol to race, and we know
what a dogfight that could be and how difficult this place is,''
Gordon said. ``This is a Russian-roulette track. The bomb can go
off, and it's an explosion. This place is simple: You have to be in
the right place at the right time. You've got to have the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has had a steady hand on the wheel, meshing with crew
chief Ray Evernham for comeback victories at Rockingham, Charlotte
and Michigan. He hasn't finished out of the top five since Rusty
Wallace put him into the wall at Richmond nine races ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's 15 or 20 laps to go, and you can put the leaders
in his sight, he's got a sight like a jet fighter,'' Evernham said.
``He can pick it up a little. Put that with a pretty awesome pit
crew and you've got something.''
</P>
<P>
   And his peers have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the best ever in the sport,'' said former racer
Harry Gant, who won four-straight in 1991. ``He's done more in less
time than any driver in history. If you look at where he is now,
he's further along than Richard Petty or Dale Earnhardt or any
other great driver at this point in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he's doing has his closest pursuers shaking their heads
in wonder. Dale Jarrett is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got everybody going his way right now, and it just
doesn't seem anything Mark or I can do is going to make a
difference,'' Jarrett said. ``We're doing everything we can, and
nothing's working. It's a little frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that before with different people,'' Gordon
teammate Terry Labonte said. ``They've just got things figured out.
They've got a good combination, and they are communicating well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got the right setups in the car, and they unload with
the right stuff. They're never chasing it. They're right when they
get to the track until the time to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why they're winning.

SPORTS COLUMN: FASSEL MADE RIGHT CALL ON SEHORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the ligaments in the right knee of New York Giants
cornerback Jason Sehorn were torn apart while he returned a kickoff
against the Jets on Thursday night, it did not take long for the
second-guessing of coach Jim Fassel to begin. As word of Sehorn's
injury spread among the players during the game, some mumbled to
each other on the sideline about why one of the best athletes in
football was being ``wasted'' on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward, players said, defensive teammates
huddled in various corners of the room, some crying, praying for
Sehorn while wondering why he was returning kickoffs to begin with,
especially in the preseason. The next morning, reeling from the
knowledge that Sehorn was lost for the year because of torn
anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments, some in the
Giants organization wondered whether it had been necessary to
expose Sehorn to the madness that is special teams.
</P>
<P>
   It is at times like this when a head coach is truly alone.
Fassel made the decision, so he will take the heat, which is now a
raging fire. But where were all of the second-guessers before
Sehorn was injured? Making a decision after the fact is always
easy. If Sehorn had broken his return for a touchdown, fans and
news media types would be calling Fassel a genius.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if emotion and hindsight are put aside, it is not
difficult to see that Fassel's decision to use Sehorn was the right
one. In fact, it was a smart one.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Giants' kick-return team was among the worst in
the league, failing to score a touchdown. Consistently starting
deep in its own territory can cripple an offense and cost a team
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's decision: use one of the fastest, most fluid athletes
in all of pro sports as a return man so he can break a game wide
open with a jaw-dropping runback. At first, the decision seemed
foolhardy. Why risk your future Pro Bowler for a few extra return
yards, or, at most, two touchdowns a season?
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: very few kick returners get hurt. The top
11 return men in the game last season missed a total of four games
to injuries related to returning kicks. In all, they had some 571
returns, and the only players hurt were Aaron Bailey from
Indianapolis (he missed three games) and Desmond Howard from
Oakland (he missed one). That is a stunningly low ratio of
performance to injury. The only safer job in the National Football
League is kicking field goals.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to Sehorn was a freakish accident.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if fans truly want to find a culprit, they need look no
further than the salary cap. Because of it, teams can no longer
keep players who only return kicks. Too expensive. These days, it
is almost impossible to find an NFL team that does not have a
starting wide receiver, a key defensive back or a top running back
pulling overtime as a kick or punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the salary cap, many top coaches would use some of
their best players on special teams. Dallas special-teams coach Joe
Avezzano, one of the best in the business, always has key starters
on his unit. Deion Sanders has returned punts and kicks for years.
Pro Bowl fullback Daryl Johnston has been on field goal and punt
protection units. Darren Woodson is used on kickoff coverage, the
football equivalent of bumper cars, and he is perhaps the best
safety in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Carter, Kansas City's four-time Pro Bowl cornerback, who is
better than Sehorn, is one of the top punt returners in Chiefs
history. Jets coach Bill Parcells puts some of his top players on
special teams as well, including cornerback Aaron Glenn, who
doubles as a kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, who is in the Hall
of Fame, often used his best athlete, cornerback Darrell Green, to
return punts. That is much more dangerous than returning kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   What most people who are criticizing Fassel feel is a sense of
frustration at losing Sehorn in such a meaningless game, and, of
course, Fassel feels that as well. But Fassel should not change his
way of thinking. He is an aggressive, talented, forward-thinking
coach, and those qualities are what make him a winner. If he
becomes shy because of what happened to Sehorn, it would be a major
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll quit coaching,'' he said, ``the day I stop trying to put
our players in the best position to help win football games.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Maloney leaps past Moceanu
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Kristen Maloney doesn't mind if people spell her
first name ``Kristen,'' as it is listed at the U.S. Gymnastics
Championships, or ``Kristin,'' as it's spelled in the media guide.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no two ways about who was the most consistent
gymnast Thursday night in the women's all-around preliminaries and
individual event finals before 4,801 at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to win anything. I'm just trying to go out
there and do the best that I can do,'' said Maloney, 17, of Pen
Argyl, Pa., who scored 38.162 points to stay ahead of 1996 gold
medalist Dominique Moceanu (37.437), who won two events to
Maloney's none.
</P>
<P>
   The scores carry over to Saturday night's finals. Maloney, who
was second on balance beam and fourth in the other three events,
was fourth last year and has excelled this year despite a stress
fracture in her right tibia.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, competing with a heavily taped left knee and against
doctor's advice, won balance beam and vault. Her first
individual-event gold medals were more remarkable considering she
hadn't trained for two weeks because of the injury. However, she
wouldn't receive funding from the national federation if she had
failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to be back out there and fighting to the end,''
said Moceanu, of Houston, who won the Goodwill Games last month.
She is the only member of Atlanta's Magnificent Seven competing
here, but Kerri Strug is working in the NBC truck and Shannon
Miller, Amanda Borden and Jaycie Phelps were in the stands.
Dominique Dawes qualified for the event, but chose not to attend
and Amy Chow is in school at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Defending national champion Vanessa Atler, 16, of Canyon
Country, Calif., fell twice on the uneven bars _ an event she
dislikes _ and scored a dismal 8.225 to land in sixth place.
However, she won the floor exercise with a 9.85, the highest score
of the night in any event.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Zmeskal, the 1991 world champ on the comeback trail at age
22, is in ninth place but was angry at herself for mistakes on the
uneven bars, the last of her four events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she proved she could hold her own with the teenagers even
if the start values of her routines were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new to me again,'' said Zmeskal, who was tied for
third after three rotations and said she felt calm and in control.
``I have it in my body to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bow to the past, Zmeskal did essentially the same balance
beam routine as Barcelona, where a fall 10 seconds into her
Olympics doomed her.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray of Columbia, Md., who was a junior last year, won the
uneven bars and is in fourth place behind Jennie Thompson of
Cincinnati, a former national junior champion.

 &HT;    Nascar notes: Goody's 500
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Rusty Wallace was up to his old habits Friday,
winning poles at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace put his Ford Taurus up front again Thursday for
tonight's Goody's 500 with a speed of 123.530 miles per hour. It
was his fifth career pole at Bristol, and back-to-back this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner was second fastest, 123.523. He now has started in
the top 10 in seven of his last nine races here.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Jeff Gordon ran 123.039 mph and starts
from the fourth row, the deepest he's started since Texas 15 races
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My main concern this week is to get in here and just win this
race,'' Wallace said. ''I'll do what I have to do and Jeff can do
what he has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton take
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hamilton's take on Bristol. ''You get behind a guy . . .
and pop him a little on the rear end. He gets mad and won't let you
by or lets you by and then takes a wack at you. Then you get mad,
and next thing you know, everybody's mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave for Spencer
</P>
<P>
   With Jimmy Spencer sidelined with injuries suffered at the
Brickyard, Ted Musgrave will fill in for him in tonight's Goody's
500. ''I could have driven the car, but the doctors tell me it
wouldn't be wise,'' said Spencer, who added his status will be
evaluated week-to-week.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine on the mound
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Bodine takes a taste of the fastest growing sport to the
national pastime Monday when he throws out the first pitch at
Yankee Stadium prior to the Yankees-California game. Fans will be
given a baseball card featuring a picture of Bodine and his racing
statistics. During the seventh inning stretch, Bodine's sponsor,
Phillips, will give away seven baseballs autographed by the last
two pitchers to toss perfect games, David Wells and Don Larson.
</P>
<P>
   They said it
</P>
<P>
   ''Trust me when I tell you I know exactly how Jeff Gordon feels
when he is booed. Heck, at driver introductions in the '80s, there
was a time when I would step up to the mike and say, ''Boo, if you
love DW.'' Now that's the way to quite 'em up.'' - Darrell Waltrip
on vocal race fans

(af) 
 By PETER TRUELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred G. Osbourne got right to the point recently in urging
stock ownership on a group of African-American health care workers
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, inflation is going to eat your assets alive,''
Osbourne, a broker for the financial services group of the American
Express Co., warned an audience clad in white coats and scuffed
sneakers at the Morrisania Health Center in the South Bronx. To pay
for children's college educations and build a retirement nest egg,
he said, ``you need to have some money in the equity market; mutual
funds are one of the nice ways to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new there. But the reaction was illuminating. Most of
the more than 50 people who attended two of Osbourne's workshops
filled out forms requesting private consultations with him, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne says he often sees such reaction these days when he
speaks to blacks about investing. Moreover, he says, roughly two
out of five of the people he sits down with set up a stock-buying
plan and ``follow through and stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A momentous shift is taking place in the investment practices of
black Americans. Abandoning the conservative habits of their
parents and grandparents, rising numbers are putting their savings
into stocks rather than real estate, insurance policies and
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, blacks have shied away from stocks _ partly out
of mistrust of Wall Street, partly because Wall Street showed
little interest in their money and partly out of ignorance as to
how the stock market worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents didn't even have a checking account,'' said George
M. Daniels, who grew up in St. Louis and who has helped run an
African-American investment club in Manhattan for 15 years. ``We
aren't taught a lot about these things. We didn't know. The main
thing then was insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the black middle class has mushroomed in recent years and
black buying power has surged _ to more than $500 billion this year
from just over $300 billion in 1990 _ blacks are being wooed by
brokers as never before and are increasingly jumping on the
stock-market bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, in the African-American community, the vast
majority of the family's assets was in the house, with the rest in
the automobile, with virtually no money invested in the equity
market,'' said J. Eugene Grigsby, a public policy specialist at the
University of California at Los Angeles. Until the late 1970s, most
middle-class African-Americans worked in the public sector. But as
more blacks took jobs in the private sector, especially at big
corporations, they became more familiar with investment concepts
like ``stock options, financial statements and returns on
investment,'' Grigsby said, and the allure of stocks grew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 57 percent of black households with annual incomes of
more than $50,000 have money in the stock market, according to a
survey conducted by Yankelovich Partners for Ariel Mutual Funds, an
investment company in Chicago that is run by blacks, and Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co., the big discount brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no comparable survey figures for past years,
brokers and investment bankers said the percentage represented a
huge increase from the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the proportion of whites in the same income bracket
who own stocks is much higher _ 81 percent _ according to the
study, but specialists say the gap appears to be closing. Anecdotal
evidence shows that the number of predominantly black investment
clubs has proliferated, though the National Association of
Investors Corp. in Madison Heights, Mich., the country's main
investment club organization, says it does not track their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent survey by Target Market News, a Chicago research
firm that monitors habits of black consumers, shows that the number
of black investors has been growing rapidly since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rush to catch up is the driving force,'' said Ken Smikle,
the president of Target. ``There is a need to rush, frankly,
because the market has been ignored for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Fred Acree, 38, a mortgage loan originator with a
minority-owned firm in Winston-Salem, N.C., illustrates the trend.
When he was growing up in Augusta, Ga., his family ``had the house,
and we had the insurance,'' Acree said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else, we weren't really aware of,'' he added. ``There
wasn't really anyone to make us aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending college, Acree spent years putting all his spare
cash into a savings account, waiting until just a few years ago to
funnel some of the money into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to deal with a black stockbroker _ ``the only
one I know of in that office'' _ also gave him ``a little bit more
of a sense of pride,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His broker, Duane Davis, who works for First Union Brokerage
Services in Winston-Salem, recently founded the Coalition of Black
Investors, a national organization that is holding seminars across
the country to address what it perceives as a lack of knowledge
among black Americans about finance and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the largest emerging market in the world is
the minority market in this country,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said
this summer at a New York conference intended to attract capital to
minority groups. ``African-Americans and Latinos control more than
$700 billion a year in buying power. That's more than all of
Mexico, all of India, all of Switzerland, all of Indonesia and all
of South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also has been putting pressure on investment banks to
hire more blacks and other minority-group members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big retail banks, long the main point of contact for blacks with
the financial services industry, have for the last 20 years been
taking steps to improve corporate diversity efforts and in
marketing to ethnic groups. Only lately, though, has the brokerage
industry awakened to the potentially lucrative market. And it has
done so with a rush of activity, even as the bull market is
starting to look a bit long in the tooth.

US ASSESSES MISSILE DAMAGE, PLOTS NEXT MOVE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US forces inflicted ``moderate to severe'' damage
to a sprawling terrorist camp in Afghanistan during Thursday's
missile strikes, administration officials said Friday, as President
Clinton and his advisers tried to gauge the next move in what
increasingly appears to be an uneasy war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence officials, hampered by heavy clouds over
Afghanistan, were uncertain of the number of suspected terrorists
killed in the attack, but Taliban Radio reported 27 killed and 50
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was timed to occur as a large group of terrorists
from across the Middle East gathered at a training camp that serves
as the operations base for Osama bin Laden, the multimillionaire
exile who is the main suspect in the deadly African embassy
bombings on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, believing bin Laden survived, offered him a
warning Friday. ``Bin Laden, like any other terrorist, should not
rest easy,'' said Samuel R. Berger, national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   As assessments seeped in through the CIA and the military,
President Clinton made a round of telephone calls to world leaders,
and his senior national security officials descended on Capitol
Hill to brief senators and House members and rally their support.
Meanwhile, across the nation, law enforcement agencies went on a
heightened state of alert, on guard for a possible retaliatory
terrorist strike on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior aides explicitly warned that Thursday's attack
_ as many as 75 Tomahawk missiles launched from ships on the
Arabian Sea and the Red Sea _ marked just another round in what
will become an increasingly pitched battle with terrorist forces
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strike itself brought the United States into largely
unchartered territory. While one of the most significant attacks
launched by Clinton in his 5 1/2 years in office, it was also
targeted at an elusive underworld figure rather than a specific
government or state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are involved here in a long-term struggle,'' said Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright, after briefing congressional
leaders on Capitol Hill. ``This is unfortunately the war of the
future, and we have to understand the importance of sustained
operations here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials stressed that the attack was both retaliatory and
defensive, in one fell swoop. Even as the United States sought
retribution for the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,
intelligence officials also believe bin Laden was plotting similar
attacks, possibly against US diplomats in Pakistan and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee that something like this will prevent
further attacks on the United States, but I am absolutely certain
that had we not done this, we would have been the victim of other
terrorist attacks in the not too distant future,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger added: ``We're also going to be on offense as well as on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, after talking with advisers and world leaders
from the Oval Office for much of the day, boarded Air Force One at
Andrews Air Force Base just after 5 p.m. and flew back to Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. to resume his vacation. White House officials said
he would receive regular briefings on the impact of the military
action and its aftermath on a secure telephone line in his borrowed
vacation compound.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Clinton's actions garnered an increasing level
of support, and lawmakers who only the day before questioned the
timing of the strikes, coming as they did just a few days after
Clinton's unprecedented federal grand jury testimony, were now
offering their strong backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just simply saying, whatever the president's other
shortcomings may be, in this instance I believe he acted
appropriately, and as a Republican, I take my hat off to him,''
said Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Said Senator Rod Grams, a Minnesota Republican: ``It was a very
measured response,''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent our military intelligence people can make these
judgments at this point, their conclusion is that the camps which
comprise the Khost complex have sustained moderate to severe
damage,'' said Berger. ``The attacks have significantly disrupted
the capability to use these camps as terrorist training
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, public opinion polls indicated widespread
support for the strikes, along with lingering questions over
Clinton's motives. In a CNN poll, 66 percent of the respondents
approved the strikes, compared to 19 percent who registered
disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in that same poll whether Clinton was trying to divert
attention away from his extramarital affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and the allegations that he obstructed
justice, 58 percent of the respondents said no, while 36 percent
answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, the damage inflicted by
half a dozen US missiles was obvious. A pharmaceutical company
which US officials believed was a front for a bin Laden-financed
chemical company was flattened, as well as some of the surrounding
buildings in the industrial district in which it stood. The
casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear. The governor
of Khartoum said several people were killed and injured in the
strike. Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being
treated, for injuries, including four in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the so-called pharmaceutical company in Sudan was
functionally destroyed,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hills of Afghanistan, at the sprawling training camp and
terrorist operations base, damage was more difficult to measure,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles carried small bombs and lethal projectiles meant to
kill the terrorists who were supposedly gathered at the facility
for a round of meetings.

   Mic Alexander, who works in her family's commercial-printing
business in Charlotte, N.C., said she now receives an average of
five investment pitches a week from investment firms, even though
``lack of time and lack of interest'' have largely kept her away
from the stock market. Nevertheless, she said, her mother's
interest has been piqued.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Chapelle, publisher of Securities Pro, a newsletter that
reports on African-Americans in the securities industry, said there
was ``a realization among the more progressive firms that blacks
have money and they represent the new boom market.''
</P>
<P>
   At American Express, Thomas V. Nicolosi, a group vice president
and Osbourne's boss, said that it was in the early 1990s, after his
company completed a diversity study, that he fully realized that
financial services firms were not adequately serving some ethnic
groups. And it has been only in the last two or three years, he
said, that American Express has created nationwide teams to offer
financial education to potential black clients.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its aggressive courting of black investors, American
Express this year began using Tiger Woods, the champion golfer of
African-Asian parentage, and his father, Earl, who is black, as a
key part of its marketing strategy in print and television
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Merrill Lynch started several stock investment
programs aimed at minority-group investors after taking a close
look at recent census data and calculating their growing economic
power, according to Dan Haughton, a senior director for marketing
services at the firm. Merrill Lynch has also been hiring more black
stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients, our shareholders are demanding more and more that
our employees look like them,'' said Westina Matthews, Merrill
Lynch's first vice president and senior director, who earlier this
year was given the responsibility of promoting diversity at the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are still just a handful of African-Americans in
the upper echelons of Wall Street, they include E. Stanley O'Neal,
the chief financial officer of Merrill Lynch, probably the
second-most-prominent black after Kenneth I. Chenault, president
and chief operating officer of American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Black-owned investment firms are also getting the message out.
Ariel, one of the biggest, with more than $2.5 billion in funds
under management, has set an ambitious goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to make the stock market a subject of dinner
conversation in every black home in America,'' said Mellody Hobson,
Ariel's senior vice president for marketing, when her company and
Schwab released the recent survey. Schwab said it joined Ariel in
sponsoring the survey because it wanted more information on what it
saw as an underserved market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding their budding love affair with stocks, blacks
have a long way to go to catch up with other investors.
</P>
<P>
   While middle- and upper-class Americans of all races have been
stampeding into equities, racking up average gains of 20 percent a
year for most of the last decade, the figures for the overall
population indicate that this has brought more benefits to the
white majority. According to 1994 census data, the latest
available, only 6.2 percent of African-Americans owned equities,
compared with 23 percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that is that more affluent blacks in this country
generally save less than their white counterparts. The Ariel-Schwab
survey, for example, showed that black households with annual
incomes of $50,000 or more saved an average of $267 a month, versus
$488 for similar white households. (That comparison, however, is
skewed somewhat by the fact that the black families surveyed had
lower average incomes than the whites _ $75,800, compared with
$82,100.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the lower rates of stock ownership and savings,
the black households in the survey had accumulated much smaller
average retirement nest eggs than white families: $42,000, compared
with $88,000.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, blacks ``have had less capital to invest, and the
capital they did have, they took a more conservative strategy than
they should have done,'' said Christopher J. Williams, an
African-American Wall Streeter who left Lehman Brothers a few years
ago to start his own bond business, the Williams Capital Group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, many African-Americans until recently
``did not have longstanding employment with companies to get into
401(k) plans.'' Such plans, which typically allow an employee to
invest automatically in a range of mutual funds, are the path to
first-time equity investments for as many as a quarter of all
investors, according to the Ariel-Schwab poll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As more blacks are tempted by stocks, they face a nerve-jangling
quandary: whether to jump in now as the seven-year bull market
shows signs of sputtering, or to hold back and possibly fall even
further behind. Some black investors fear that they may be the last
people to join the party and the first to suffer a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting on board a train that is already moving,'' said
Edgar J. Hicks, 50, an African-American grain broker in Omaha. ``My
contention is that when this thing does back off, we may be the
ones that get hurt the most, because we are investing late in the
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has joined an investment club that grew out of the
African-American congregation at the Salem Baptist Church in north
Omaha. Now in its third year, the 20-member club has had so-so
results in its stock market investments, despite the market's huge
run-up during the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing OK, but part of our problem is we've bought the
popular stocks,'' Hicks said, meaning shares in companies that
already had seen the best of their gains or that simply were
familiar to the group because of their big local operations. Lucent
Technologies was a winner but Calenergy and Union Pacific have been
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real pressures on us out here, when the market is
running this good,'' he said. ``If we aren't participating in this,
we are losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he first struggled to understand the ins and outs of
the stock market in the 1960s, when he was growing up in
Shreveport, La., the son of a physician. As a young man, he made a
disastrous first investment in the Penn Central Transportation Co.,
the debt-ridden railroad that ultimately collapsed in the late
1970s.

 UNDATED: late 1970s.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He said he was drawn to Penn Central because he was ``always
interested in the grain market, the railroad, and the outside.''
But these vague instincts were no substitute for the tough research
that might have provided the young investor with some inkling of
the troubles brewing at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I had was, who could give you pointers on how to
do it?'' Hicks said in an interview from his office at DHV Inc. in
Omaha. Such information wasn't easy to come by for a black man;
even in the 1970s, he recalled, he was practically turned away at
the entrance of the local office of Merrill Lynch. ``You weren't
well-received when you went in there,'' he said, describing how the
office manager would hurry to meet him at the door and block his
way.
</P>
<P>
   (James Wiggins, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, said, ``If he was
offended in any way, we'd want to apologize for that, because it's
certainly not our policy to treat anyone badly who comes into our
offices.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even after 25 years in his business, Hicks said, he still
occasionally feels that some whites look on him as a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it a real struggle,'' Hicks said. ``People are
inquisitive about a black person being in finance, trading in
grain.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics of financial services companies say they still have a
long way to go in their dealings with minority populations.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Bailey, a Jamaican-born economist who surveyed 700 fellow
members of St. Paul's Community Baptist Church on Hendrix Street in
Brooklyn about their financial circumstances and habits, faulted
local financial firms for failing to offer the community he
surveyed a broad-enough array of services and products, from
business loans to retirement investments.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks like Chase Manhattan and Citibank were the dominant
providers of financial services for the people he polled, he said,
but they mostly sold mortgages and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne, the American Express broker, says he is trying to
change such patterns. Churches like Bailey's, he said, are ideal
places to promote his products. ``I do a tremendous amount of work
with the churches _ that's my target market,'' Osbourne said in an
interview at his office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne, who says he advises 540 clients, half of them black,
recently sponsored a brunch at Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem for
55 pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the old resistance can die hard. ``There is a mistrust of
Wall Street'' in the black community, said Chapelle, the newsletter
publisher. He recalled how his own father, a lawyer who grew up in
the shadow of the Great Depression, said he ``would rather play the
horses than invest in the stock market,'' because of his fears
about the potential for market manipulation by big Wall Street
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street may conjure images of opportunity and shared
prosperity for white Americans, but black Americans have generally
seen Wall Street as somewhere that is suspicious,'' Chapelle said.
``For the most part, Wall Street has never been a place that has
been trying to make investments in black America.''
</P>
<P>
   A result, he said, is that ``African-Americans are still about
10 years behind the Money magazine, baby-boomer generation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true of the group, a growing number of
individuals investing for the longer term _ especially
college-educated blacks _ are keeping up with the pack. Consider
Charles Hicks, a safety engineer with the Ford Motor Co. in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he first became interested in investing after
college. He and some of his contemporaries decided to start an
investment club, which is still going strong 18 years later and
which he says has achieved compound annual average returns of close
to 30 percent a year. The group has even bought into radio
stations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider 15 Fund Inc., an investment club in New York City
that was created in 1983 by friends who decided to give up Lotto
and try their luck in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to pool our money to buy lottery tickets,'' said
Daniels, a founder of the club, whose members at the time were
mainly church workers. ``We didn't win anything. So we said we'll
do better if we get into the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The friends started putting in $25 a month each, said Daniels,
who is now retired from his job as a journalist with the United
Methodist Church in Manhattan; some have since raised their
contributions to $50 or $100. The club has invested in blue-chip
stocks like Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling company, as well as
Home Depot and Lucent, to earn average annual returns of 15 percent
to 16 percent over the last decade, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the club, which now has 14 members and belongs to
the National Association of Investment Clubs, is to earn returns of
10 percent to 15 percent on each stock and to double its money
every five years.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who never bought stocks until he became involved in the
club, said black investors' caution about the stock market was
understandable. ``Anything that you don't know much about, you're
scared about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But African-Americans have become more sophisticated about
stocks in recent years, he said _ especially the younger
generation. Daniels has bought his 7-year-old grandson some stock
in McDonald's, he said, and likes to tell him that ``that's one of
your hamburgers you're eating'' when they visit the local outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it later with Disney,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   American drivers have had their flings with vinyl, their
dalliances with synthetics and crushed velour. Now, they seem to
have developed a fetish for leather.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers tripled their use of leather from 1982 to 1992,
according to a trade group, Leather Industries of America. Demand
doubled again in the next five years, and the trend is
accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   American tanneries serving the auto industry buy 20 percent of
the 36 million hides produced domestically. At roughly 45 square
feet per cow, that's 58 square miles _ enough to upholster
Manhattan two and a half times, with enough skin left over for
headrests.
</P>
<P>
   Once the schmaltzy offering of a few luxury import brands like
Rolls-Royce and Jaguar, leather is now tres ordinaire on midpriced
sedans like the Toyota Camry and even economy cars like the
Chevrolet Cavalier, and practically de rigueur on high-end sport
utilities and top-line pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the 60s might have been in love with synthetics,''
says Philip D. Kaltenbacher, 60, chairman and chief executive of
the Seaton Co., a big supplier of leather seats to car makers.
``The buyers' generation of today have this profound love of
natural materials, like cotton, wood, stone and particularly
leather.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, less than 2 percent of Honda Accords were sold
with leather trim; currently, about 35 percent have leather.
Roughly half of the Ford Explorers and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold
last year had leather interiors, along with nearly all the Lincoln
Navigators and Mountaineers, the Lexus LX 470s and RX 300s, the
Mitsubishi Monteros and GMC Denalis.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer acreage, sport utilities account for most of the
increased demand. ``SUVs use two to three times more leather than
the average car,'' said Drew Winter, an analyst with Ward's
Automotive Reports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even proletarian pickup trucks are filled with the heady scent
of leather. About 10 percent of pickups have leather interiors,
which may not sound like much until you consider that full-size
pickups ``are the highest-volume vehicles in the market,'' Winter
said, with annual sales of almost two million. ``That's a lot of
leather.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also a lot of money. Big trucks and sport utilities _ the
industry's cash cows, if you will _ have taken a drubbing over
environmental issues, and leather executives are eager to seem
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is people thinking we're burning down
rain forests for cattle just to put leather in big sport-utes,''
said Jeffery Bonello, a spokesman for the Eagle Ottawa Leather Co.
of Grand Haven, Mich., the largest supplier of leather to
automakers. In fact, most of the world's $2 billion supply of auto
leather comes from North America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tanneries have their own bad press to live down. Anders
Segerdahl, president and chief executive of Eagle Ottawa, remembers
when the chromium-laced effluent from one of his plants turned the
hulls of white fishing boats shades of red. But his company, with
annual sales of about $500 million, is now recognized a pioneer in
environmentally friendly tanning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has done as much to clean up the leather-making
process,'' said Charlie Myers, president of the leather industries
group. In 1991, Eagle Ottawa's Grand Haven tannery was the first to
convert from solvent-based to water-based finishing processes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the company completed its on-site waste-water treatment
plant. For his efforts, Segerdahl received the Theodore Roosevelt
Conservation Award in 1992 from President George Bush. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, Eagle Ottawa is promoting its recyclable Phoenix
leather, the first American automotive leather to be made without
chromium. It is tanned with a vegetable extract made of Peruvian
berries (the exact kind is a closely held trade secret). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix leather made its debut on the 1998 Volkswagen Passat,
and though it is more expensive and trickier to process _
vegetable-tanned leathers tend to crack and discolor when subjected
intense sun, heat and cold _ it already exceeds vehicle recycling
regulations anticipated in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Segerdahl, 74, learned his trade in the Old World, sorting hides
in a 300-year-old tannery in Sweden, where his family products
included leather for buggy whips and Ford Model T's. He is also a
footnote in the realm of kitsch culture, having coined ``rich
Corinthian leather,'' the catch phrase Ricardo Montalban trilled in
the 1970s in commercials for the Chrysler Cordoba. ``It was just a
name we picked,'' Segerdahl said with a chuckle. ``We thought it
was funny when Montalban made it so famous.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Montalban's seductive salesmanship lent an exotic touch to what
was, in fact, a rather mundane type of embossed leather. Indeed,
the Cordoba's interior wouldn't make the grade in today's
marketplace of high-grade skins.
</P>
<P>
   And while consumer expectations have soared, prices have
remained relatively stable because of slackening demand in the
domestic leather goods industry. In 20 years, for example, shoe
production has fallen from 400 million pairs a year to 139 million.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of hides are available. While consumption of red meat _
the prime factor in the hide supply _ has declined in the United
States and Europe, it has increased in Asia and the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a slew of moderately priced cars can be had with
newly affordable leather options. A leather package adds $895 to
the sticker of a 1999 Mercury Cougar V6, or $795 to the Mercury
Tracer LS Sport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers can offer leather at the low end by making their
cowhides go farther. ``If you look at the fine print on the
sticker,'' said Myers of the leather industry group, ``it may be a
leather seating surface, but the entire interior of the car is not
leather. Often the seat surrounds and backs are vinyl.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The leasing boom has also raised demand. Winter said, ``When the
salesman says, you know, for 10 bucks more a month you can have
leather, people go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the lease is up, leather often holds more of its
original value than other add-ons. ``When you consider usage and
convenience it virtually pays for itself,'' said Tim Hippo, sales
manager of Sir Walter Chevrolet in Raleigh, N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such a statement might astound anyone who has tried to salvage
the leather-lined insides of an old British sports car. Older
leathers did not have much protective coating, and while they were
softer, more aromatic and developed a lustrous patina through long
use, they didn't look new for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, people want leather to wear like vinyl,'' said Don
Brown, national product planning manager for Toyota. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have mostly overcome the durability issue, but one
problem remains. ``Leather can be kind of boring, I guess,'' Brown
said. ``Designers are always looking for ways to add interest.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of high-tech leather attempts to
re-capture the feel of natural leather. These products can be
coated, textured, perforated or embossed with a natural grain, or
infused with a fragrance.
</P>
<P>

US ASSESSES MISSILE DAMAGE, PLOTS NEXT MOVE

   WASHINGTON _ US forces inflicted ``moderate to severe'' damage
to a sprawling terrorist camp in Afghanistan during Thursday's
missile strikes, administration officials said Friday, as President
Clinton and his advisers tried to gauge the next move in what
increasingly appears to be an uneasy war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence officials, hampered by heavy clouds over
Afghanistan, were uncertain of the number of suspected terrorists
killed in the attack, but Taliban Radio reported 27 killed and 50
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was timed to occur as a large group of terrorists
from across the Middle East gathered at a training camp that serves
as the operations base for Osama bin Laden, the multimillionaire
exile who is the main suspect in the deadly African embassy
bombings on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, believing bin Laden survived, offered him a
warning Friday. ``Bin Laden, like any other terrorist, should not
rest easy,'' said Samuel R. Berger, national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   As assessments seeped in through the CIA and the military,
President Clinton made a round of telephone calls to world leaders,
and his senior national security officials descended on Capitol
Hill to brief senators and House members and rally their support.
Meanwhile, across the nation, law enforcement agencies went on a
heightened state of alert, on guard for a possible retaliatory
terrorist strike on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior aides explicitly warned that Thursday's attack
_ as many as 75 Tomahawk missiles launched from ships on the
Arabian Sea and the Red Sea _ marked just another round in what
will become an increasingly pitched battle with terrorist forces
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strike itself brought the United States into largely
unchartered territory. While one of the most significant attacks
launched by Clinton in his 5 1/2 years in office, it was also
targeted at an elusive underworld figure rather than a specific
government or state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are involved here in a long-term struggle,'' said Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright, after briefing congressional
leaders on Capitol Hill. ``This is unfortunately the war of the
future, and we have to understand the importance of sustained
operations here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials stressed that the attack was both retaliatory and
defensive, in one fell swoop. Even as the United States sought
retribution for the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,
intelligence officials also believe bin Laden was plotting similar
attacks, possibly against US diplomats in Pakistan and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee that something like this will prevent
further attacks on the United States, but I am absolutely certain
that had we not done this, we would have been the victim of other
terrorist attacks in the not too distant future,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger added: ``We're also going to be on offense as well as on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, after talking with advisers and world leaders
from the Oval Office for much of the day, boarded Air Force One at
Andrews Air Force Base just after 5 p.m. and flew back to Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. to resume his vacation. White House officials said
he would receive regular briefings on the impact of the military
action and its aftermath on a secure telephone line in his borrowed
vacation compound.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Clinton's actions garnered an increasing level
of support, and lawmakers who only the day before questioned the
timing of the strikes, coming as they did just a few days after
Clinton's unprecedented federal grand jury testimony, were now
offering their strong backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just simply saying, whatever the president's other
shortcomings may be, in this instance I believe he acted
appropriately, and as a Republican, I take my hat off to him,''
said Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Said Senator Rod Grams, a Minnesota Republican: ``It was a very
measured response,''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent our military intelligence people can make these
judgments at this point, their conclusion is that the camps which
comprise the Khost complex have sustained moderate to severe
damage,'' said Berger. ``The attacks have significantly disrupted
the capability to use these camps as terrorist training
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, public opinion polls indicated widespread
support for the strikes, along with lingering questions over
Clinton's motives. In a CNN poll, 66 percent of the respondents
approved the strikes, compared to 19 percent who registered
disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in that same poll whether Clinton was trying to divert
attention away from his extramarital affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and the allegations that he obstructed
justice, 58 percent of the respondents said no, while 36 percent
answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, the damage inflicted by
half a dozen US missiles was obvious. A pharmaceutical company
which US officials believed was a front for a bin Laden-financed
chemical company was flattened, as well as some of the surrounding
buildings in the industrial district in which it stood. The
casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear. The governor
of Khartoum said several people were killed and injured in the
strike. Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being
treated, for injuries, including four in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the so-called pharmaceutical company in Sudan was
functionally destroyed,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hills of Afghanistan, at the sprawling training camp and
terrorist operations base, damage was more difficult to measure,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles carried small bombs and lethal projectiles meant to
kill the terrorists who were supposedly gathered at the facility
for a round of meetings.

   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TANGLEWOOD-FESTIVAL (Lenox, Mass.) _ Tanglewood is, to be sure,
many things: first and foremost, a festival and retreat of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra here in the idyllic Berkshire Hills. So
when several respected teachers at the orchestra's venerable
training institute, the Tanglewood Music Center, loudly and angrily
resigned late last year in response to a redirection of the
center's activities by Seiji Ozawa, the longtime music director of
the Boston Symphony, it was not clear how much the average
festivalgoer's experience would be affected, if at all. By James R.
Oestreich. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SALZBURG-FESTIVAL (Salzburg, Austria) _ To international music
lovers, the name Salzburg Festival evokes the musical legacy of the
conductor Herbert von Karajan, who from the 1960s until his death
in 1989 dominated the festival with concerts and traditional
productions of star-studded operas. But the program of events of
the festival's 1998 season presents a slightly different picture of
this ``music festival.'' The first eight listings are not musical
at all but works of straight theater. By Anne Midgette. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STUPID-KIDS-THEATER (New York) _ Written by John C. Russell, who
died of AIDS in 1994 at the age of 31, ``Stupid Kids'' opened Off
Broadway in June to a shaky start at the WPA Theater, where it
received several mixed reviews, with some critics complaining of a
thin story. Still, the 80-minute play, directed by Michael Mayer,
seemed to be finding its legs just as it closed in July. Now it has
been given another chance. It begins a commercial run on Tuesday at
the Century Theater with a gilt-edged pack of producers behind it.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TEA-WITH-MUSSOLINI-FILM (Rome) _ ``Tea with Mussolini,'' which
is being directed by Franco Zeffirelli this summer in Rome and
Florence, is based on his memories of wartime and the years just
before, when he was an illegitimate, motherless young Florentine.
It's a homage to a group of eccentric English ladies who
essentially adopted him, and who tried to preserve their own
civility and Florence's treasures as war closed in around them. By
Alessandra Stanley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-CRITICS (Undated) _ For better and worse, critics find
themselves integral to the process of promoting movies, and there
are times when we gratefully seize that opportunity. Consider
``Western,'' a beguiling, offbeat French film that I adore. By
Janet Maslin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INVISIBLE-WINGS-DANCE (San Francisco) _ The aboriginal people of
Australia believe that the natural features of the land are the
traces of ancestors who dreamed the earth into being. The San
Francisco choreographer Joanna Haigood would understand. Her mythic
landscapes include historic cemeteries, old warehouses, abandoned
gyms and rotting piers. For Ms. Haigood, architecture harbors
ancestral memories; buildings and spaces have stories to tell, and
she means to find out what they are. Her latest and largest
investigation is titled ``Invisible Wings,'' a work inspired by a
building on the rambling grounds of the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in Becket, Mass. By Rita Felciano. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-PLACE (Undated) _ If home is indeed where the heart is,
then the repertory in which a musician feels most at home may have
more to do with aptitude and sympathy than with where that musician
was born or lives. Yet sometimes a relationship between geography
and music holds true, and two new piano recordings, by Stephen
Hough and Leif Ove Andsnes, make a persuasive case for the power of
place. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RAKE'S-PROGRESS-OPERA (Undated) _ Igor Stravinsky was a slow
worker. He produced, on average, one major composition, or an
equivalent number of smaller ones, per year. Of course, he lived
many years, from 1882 to 1971, and produced many works, about 100,
though only a handful run longer than a half-hour. The longest by
far is his only full-length opera, ``The Rake's Progress.'' Each of
its three acts took a year to compose. By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GRAHAM-MUSIC (Undated) _ The title of Susan Graham's new
recording of Hahn songs, ``La Belle Epoque'' (Sony Classical ASK
60168), accurately indicates that the music is the expression of a
particular period in history. But Ms. Graham approaches this past
in the spirit of the present, bringing an element of robustness to
an inherently dainty table: a happy illustration of the best that
can happen when an American singer interprets European music. By
Anne Midgette. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ELLIOTT-SMITH-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Everybody's dying just to get
the disease,'' sang Elliott Smith about the perils of fame in
``Pictures of Me,'' one of the most memorable pop songs of last
year. It appeared on ``Either/Or,'' Smith's third album, and it was
a startlingly advanced report of dissaffection sung in a high voice
by a slouchy 27-year-old Beatles fan from Portland, Ore., with a
pallid, wounded demeanor. By Ben Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LAURYN-HILL-MUSIC (Undated) _ On her solo debut album, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' the rapper, singer and visionary
artist Lauryn Hill imagines herself as part of a very old story. It
transcends her own 23-year-old life, as stimulating as that may be
with the success of her hip-hop group, the Fugees, her highly
promising career as a musician and producer and her personal
happiness mothering a baby boy. By Ann Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRINCESS'S-PEOPLE-TV (Undated) _ With Britain bracing itself for
a relentless barrage of Princess-Diana-related television
programming in the next few weeks, it is not surprising that ``The
Princess's People,'' one of the shows on offer, has generated a bit
of unflattering advance publicity. Maybe because it shows, among
other things, Londoners swearing at the television set during the
broadcast of the Princess of Wales's funeral last year. By Sarah
Lyall. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  MIND-TRAVELER-TV (Undated) _ A four-part PBS series called
``Oliver Sacks: The Mind Traveler,'' begins Tuesday at 8 p.m. _
stories of people with autism or total color-blindness or Usher's
syndrome, another rare genetic condition, in which a person is born
deaf and then gradually goes blind in young adulthood. By Natalie
Angier. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DAILY-SHOW-TV (Undated) _ ``The Daily Show,'' is America's most
perfect rendering of comedy post-modernism. Running, well, nightly
at 11 p.m. on cable's Comedy Central, ``The Daily Show'' is what
happens when you give the kids who used to make fun of you their
own television show. By Jeff MacGregor. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ACKLEY-ART (Boston) _ For ``PhotoImage,'' at the Museum of Fine
Arts through Sept. 27, the curator Clifford Ackley has turned his
galleries into an eloquent montage of images that all make use, in
various ways, of photographs. Luscious lipsticked lips; a grid of
glass eyes; a face printed so delicately that it almost disappears;
hazy stills from the Zapruder film: they are disparate images,
often ugly or banal or frightening, transformed into art. By
Deborah Weisgall. (Moved). Photo.
 &UR;  &LR;  BAY-BRIDGE-ARCHITECTURE (San Francisco) _ When it comes to bridge
designers practicing in the world today, there's the Spanish
architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava and there's everyone
else. Isn't that awful? This fact has certainly lent an air of
independence, if not futility, to San Francisco's search for a new
design for the Bay Bridge. Why should Bay area residents settle for
genius and deprive themselves of the freedom to choose something
second rate? By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

 DESTROYED FACTORY BECOMES STAGE FOR DEMONSTRATIONS  (See also:(jw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise
missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this
capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over
the site Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the
entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made
pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for
the making of chemical weapons. Deep puddles of water on the muddy
ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of
assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used
these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a
well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were
urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the
plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United
States of being a ``terrorist'' state.
</P>
<P>
   At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his
mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as
the ultimate mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would
remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is
the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the
ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday. American
intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin
Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind
of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left
hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist
government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for
Turabi's silence. Bashir said that he would prove that the
pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover
for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed. ``We
have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for
pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial
medicines, he said. International companies that had provided
equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him
up, he added. The general did not name them.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had
given key financial help for the plant that was part of the
``Sudanese military industrial complex.'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan
from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited
international terrorists to train at camps here.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided
that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too
costly. After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to
win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including
economic aid, but failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation,
government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese
businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still
billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible
to tell what was made there. In the rubble at the front of the
compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant
and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a
widely used pain reliever. Trays of small empty brown bottles,
apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the
plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about
six missiles during the attack. At first, he thought the nearby
power station had been struck, he said. Then he thought a plane had
crashed. Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the
leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war
for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the
factory employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30
varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary
medicines. A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded
from the strike were admitted to the wards. Four of them were
critically hurt, he said. The plant does not operate at night and
there were apparently few workers around during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in
Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the
plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons. He said
that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical
weapons. He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have
gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist
regime. But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why
American should send cruise missiles here.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was
a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. ``Most people here,
even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular
factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he
believed the Americans knew what they were doing. ``Bin Laden has
never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.
``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.'' &QL;

extraordinary personal attention to customers _ he sometimes flys

 &HT;    Gingrich goes to middle-America to hear farmers' concerns
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ He delivered his complaint softly and
politely, this Iowa farmer, dressed in the unofficial uniform of
his trade, jeans and a ball cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have these prices for long, there will be a lot of
farmers going out of business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a still day at the Iowa State Fair Friday, the humidity
worthy of Atlanta, this farmer, who blended into the crowd without
identifying himself, put his finger on the one issue that seems
capable of exciting the Midwest electorate in an otherwise sleepy
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices for corn, soybeans and other products, a result of
Asian and Russian economic troubles, are making this year a tough
one for many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich came to the fair Friday for a town hall
meeting at the start of a seven-state trip that will focus raising
campaign money in the some of the most hotly contested districts in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich promised two actions when Congress returns from its
summer vacation next month that would help farmers. He said he
expects Congress to approve additional funds for the International
Monetary Fund, which would pump some of that money into the
troubled economies.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he also will bring to a vote ``fast track'' trade
authority for the president, which would maximize the president's
flexibility in negotiating trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, are extremely contentious. Members of his own
party strenuously object to sending more money to the IMF, which
some Republicans believe is at best inefficient and at worst
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats failed to rally behind the fast track issue when it
was last raised in the fall because the proposal did not require
new trade treaties to have child labor and worker safety
provisions. They think Gingrich is bringing the issue back now,
just before the elections, to drive a wedge between Midwestern
Democratic candidates and voters.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at the State Fairgrounds was a ragged rendition of
the crisp productions that are the hallmark of Gingrich's traveling
road show. Empty seats and faulty microphones combined with the
oppressive humidity.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gingrich learned that not even the ``third ranking
constitutional officer of the United States,'' as he and his staff
sometimes call Gingrich, can compete with public milking
demonstrations, the appearance of the Hereford queen and the Butter
Cow.
</P>
<P>
   While repeated public announcements could not fill the seats for
the speaker, a steady stream of visitors passed by the display
featuring a life-size cow, replete with udders, made of butter. Of
course, it was also cooler in there.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich crisscrossed the state Friday, campaigning for
gubernatorial candidate Jim Ross Lightfoot, a former congressman,
in Sioux City, Rep. Tim Nussle and congressional candidate Larry
McKibben.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa visit, at least his third this year, drew the
inevitable suggestions that Gingrich has a presidential campaign in
mind. But Gingrich did not address the topic or, for that matter,
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event at the fair urged questioners to confine
their comments to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In Ames, Iowa, Gingrich spoke at a fund-raising breakfast for
McKibben, whom Republicans consider one of their top chances to add
to their majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   McKibben, a lawyer and state senator, faces freshman Democrat
Leonard Boswell, who won with just 49 percent of the vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich accused Boswell, who said he would vote for fast-track
authority if it had a child-labor clause, of siding with ``the
unions in the East'' over Iowa farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iowa Farm Bureau has designated Boswell ``a friend of
agriculture.'' Boswell is also a farmer.

 WASHINGTON: Harkin said.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington to return to his vacation in Martha's
Vineyard Friday night, Clinton met with his national security
advisers for about an hour and telephoned Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan.
Pakistan has vigorously protested the attack, which sent dozens of
cruise missiles soaring over its territory. In the morning,
Pakistan's government issued an angry statement saying an errant
American cruise missile had in fact exploded in Pakistani
territory, killing five or six people. But the government later
retracted the claim, though not before the report dominated
Clinton's conversation with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior aides also sought to rally support for the
attacks on Capitol Hill, where some critics on Thursday had
questioned the attacks, or at least the timing of them, given the
furor over Clinton's admission of an intimate relationship with
Monica Lewinsky on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Cohen, joined by Gen.
Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met in a
classified briefing with a dozen Republican and Democratic
lawmakers Friday afternoon. The lawmakers emerged sounding
persuaded by the administration's justification for the strikes,
citing what some called ``irrefutable evidence'' that satellite
photographs, intercepts of telephone conversations and statements
by a suspect in the embassy bombings who is now being held in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they shared with us made it crystal clear that terrorism
had escalated against us,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the strikes, which involved roughly 75 cruise
missiles fired from undisclosed positions in the Arabian and Red
seas, the administration warned that retaliatory attacks against
American targets were a grave possibility. The FBI reiterated a
security alert first issued in the hours after Thursday's strikes,
and public buildings, airports and military bases in the United
States and abroad beefed up security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, the administration defended the strikes,
citing the nation's right, as defined in the U.N. charter, to
defend itself. Berger said the administration considered the camp
outside the remote Afghan town of Khowst ``to be a military
target.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, the under secretary of state for
political affairs, Thomas Pickering, declared that the United
States could not sit idly just because it was not clear missile
strikes alone would not stop future terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not simply batten down the hatches and wait for the
next attack to hit us,'' he said. ``We had to act decisively. We do
not expect that these strikes will in themselves end the threat,
but they are important because they clearly show that we are in
this for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, the strikes sparked official denunciations and street
protests in the Sudan and Afghanistan. There were also angry
demonstrations in Pakistan. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, protests
converged on the U.S. Embassy. In Kabul, two U.N. workers were shot
in separate attacks that appeared to be related to anger over the
American strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The day swirled with confusion over the success of the strikes
and uncertainty over what might happen next. The Pentagon's
reticence to confirm publicly even the most fundamental details of
the strikes _ including the names of the Navy ships involved or
even the exact number of missiles fired _ compounded the
uncertainty, as did Cohen's vague assertions that additional
American attacks could be in the offing. The poor weather in
Afghanistan also disappointed officials in Washington who hoped to
learn how effective the strikes had been.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strike in the Sudan seemed to have accomplished its
mission. Stark television images broadcast from the Sudan confirmed
the strike heavily damaged a pharmaceutical factory that
administration officials described as a manufacturer of building
blocks for chemical weapons. Berger declared it ``functionally
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's state-run television said 10 people had been injured,
but none, evidently, were killed. Sudan's president, Omar Hassan
al-Bashir, was quoted by Reuters saying the factory, Al Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was a benign commercial venture that
produced half of the nation's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the strike in Afghanistan was less clear. In
Kabul, the Taliban faction that rules the country announced that 21
people had died in the attack on the base, while 30 others were
injured, but the spokesman for bin Laden put the dead at 28 in his
remarks to the editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, officials said they had no way of knowing
who died, and the Pentagon received conflicting, unverifiable
intelligence reports. Some said bin Laden was dead; others said he
was alive, according to one senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   The United States timed the attack to what they believed to be a
gathering of terrorists at the camp, but today Cohen said it was
not clear that the assembly had in fact taken place. Regardless,
Cohen said the attack did not target individuals as much as the
barracks, ammunition stockpiles and other facilities spread over
six separate sites within the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Striking the facilities in themselves is a worthy goal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With only one chance a day for spy satellites to photograph the
area, a full assessment will take at least another day, perhaps
longer, depending on the weather. There were early indications that
while some missiles hit their targets, others missed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the facilities have been destroyed completely,'' a
senior Pentagon official said. ``Some have been damaged heavily.
Some have been damaged lightly. And some have been missed
entirely.''

NRC PLANS TO DISTRIBUTE POTASSIUM IODIDE TO STATES WITH NUCLEAR
PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Maine, Ala., Tenn., Ohio)  (lh) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ After years of resistance, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission is preparing to distribute to states with
nuclear power plants a drug that would block a type of radiation
that causes thyroid cancer. Already, people in Connecticut and
other states are clamoring for the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The move was spurred, in part, by new evidence about thyroid
cancer in the wake of the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and
the lower incidence of the disease in areas where the drug,
potassium iodide, was widely used.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change also comes at a time when the NRC is
revisiting many regulations and addressing what many critics of the
nuclear power industry say were the agency's weakest policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government had previously argued that the
drug might cause dangerous side effects and give people a false
sense of security during a nuclear accident, some critics had
accused the agency of declining to offer potassium iodide out of a
concern that it would promote fears of a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Alabama and Tennessee have started stockpiling the
pills at evacuation centers, while Maine and Ohio are moving toward
requesting a supply from the federal government. New York is
reconsidering its refusal to provide the medicine to the public,
and Kristine Smith, a state Health Department spokeswoman, said
that only last month, a departmental advisory committee of
physicians concluded that access to potassium iodide in a nuclear
accident would benefit public health.
</P>
<P>
   In Waterford, Conn., on Thursday night, only a few miles from
the Millstone nuclear power station, residents told a state nuclear
policy panel that they wanted the pills. ``I want it in my purse,''
said Billie Staub of Niantic. ``I want my children and
grandchildren to have it at the ready.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the evening, the Nuclear Energy Advisory
Commission had voted 9-2, with one abstention, to recommend that
the state distribute the pills to residents living within five
miles of the Millstone plant, which until last month had been shut
down for more than two years because of safety concerns. The
Connecticut Health Department, in conjunction with other state
agencies, is considering the recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The use of potassium iodide to block radiation is not new. It
has been used in other countries, like Poland, for a number of
years, and Peter G. Crane, an NRC staff lawyer who has lobbied as a
private citizen to change the agency's policy, said it was first
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use in
this country in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is available over the counter at many pharmacies, with
a prescription, at a cost of about 7 cents a pill, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power regulators, physicians and government health
officials emphasized Friday that potassium iodide should not be
viewed as a cure-all for radioactivity from a nuclear power
accident. It blocks only one of many isotopes _ radioactive iodine
_ that may be emitted from a leak or meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if no action is taken, radioactive iodine is absorbed
into the thyroid, where it can lead to thyroid cancer and other
thyroid disorders. A 130-milligram pill of potassium iodide can
prevent the radioactive iodine from entering the thyroid for
several days, if it is taken within a few hours of exposure to the
iodine, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about its effectiveness,'' said Jacob
Robbins, former president of the American Thyroid Association and a
scientist emeritus at the National Institute of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some emergency preparedness and public health officials
harbor doubts about whether it is a good idea. They said that
people may misunderstand what the pill does and fail to evacuate
when officials order them to do so. And it is not clear how state
officials will make sure that everyone who needs the pills will get
them.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Maurer, a spokesman for the New York Emergency Management
Office, said that the justification for the state's present
position not to distribute the pills to the public is
straightforward. ``The bottom line is that we intend to have people
out of harm's way before they would need potassium iodide,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a question of liability, if people who take the
pills suffer side effects. Connecticut and other states are
considering requiring people to sign release forms before they are
given the pills.
</P>
<P>
   And Mary Lou Fleissner, the Connecticut health department's
director of environmental epidemiology said that potassium iodide
had side effects, such as risk of cardiac arrest for people who
already have high levels of potassium.
</P>
<P>
   But Crane, who has thryroid cancer and has lobbied for 10 years
to make the pill more available, disputed such an assessment and
noted that its use after the Chernobyl accident provided strong
evidence of its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said that while there was a high incidence of thyroid
cancer _ as many as 1,200 cases _ in Ukraine and other former
Soviet republics that did not use potassium iodide, the number was
much smaller in Poland, where the drug was distributed to about 10
million people immiediately after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were very few cases of any kind of trouble, because of
potassium iodide,'' Robbins noted, referring to side effects. Older
people do tend to have more problems with the drug than younger
people, but they also are less suceptible to thryorid cancer, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The pill has a half-life of eight days, meaning that half of it
would disappear from the body during that span, Dr. Fleissner said.
The pill has a shelf-life of five years, before it must be
replaced, she added.

AMP REJECTS $10 BILLION OFFER FROM ALLIED SIGNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of AMP Inc., a leading making of electronics
equipment, rejected a $10 billion bid from Allied Signal Inc. on
Friday, igniting a rare hostile takeover battle in a market that
has grown accustomed to friendly mergers.
</P>
<P>
   AMP, which dismissed Allied Signal's all-cash tender offer as
too low, overhauled its top management Friday and appointed Robert
Ripp, formerly executive vice president, as chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Harrisburg, Pa., has enacted ``poison
pill'' defenses against hostile bids and vowed to shed divisions,
close plants and lay off more workers to make itself more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no synergies between our companies, and we are not
interested in a combination,'' Ripp said in an interview on his
first day as AMP chief. ``We absolutely believe that we have far
greater value than the offer they put on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal, based in Morristown, N.J., makes aerospace and
automotive products. It said it would seek to wrest control of AMP
by appealing to shareholders and fighting the company's board in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Bossidy, Allied's chief executive, heatedly denounced
the rejection of his company's offer. He described Ripp, a former
IBM executive and chief financial officer of AMP, as having
``neither the experience or track record'' to improve AMP's
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is puzzling that a company in dire operating straits would
appoint as CEO someone who had no operating experience prior to
this year,'' Bossidy said in a statement that observed few of the
usual corporate courtesies. ``AMP's manufacturing and
administrative structures are antiquated, its margins are lower
than its competitors' and its market share is eroding, resulting in
plummeting profits and a bleak future.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the 1980s, when companies routinely tried to
resist corporate takeovers, most mergers and acquisitions are now
amiable, because stock prices have been inflated by a long bull
market. Allied Signal is a good example: The company has made a
string of acquisitions of smaller companies in recent years, deals
designed to keep its earnings growth strong. All its purchases have
been friendly, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Allied Signal decided to make a hostile bid for ailing AMP,
which declined to negotiate a sale despite overtures from Allied
Signal that began a year ago. AMP officials argue that Allied
Signal has sought to buy its shares at a steep discount from their
proven value.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just trying to buy us on the cheap,'' Ripp said.
</P>
<P>
   AMP's results have suffered this year as sales growth has
dwindled and profit margins have contracted. Ripp blamed Asia's
economic crisis _ the company sells 20 percent of its
interconnection devices there _ for most of its sales slump.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price has plunged by half in 10 months. It
hit a low of $28 on Aug. 3 of this year, the day before Allied
Signal made its tender offer at $44.50 a share. Allied Signal
argues that the offer is a 55 percent premium on its share price on
the date the offer was made. AMP says the offer is a 20 percent
discount on its peak price and called the bid ``opportunistic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   AMP's board chose Ripp, 57, to replace James Marley as chairman
and William Hudson as chief executive. Marley will retire and
Hudson will become vice chairman. Ripp told analysts Friday that he
would speed up a restructuring plan first announced in July. That
includes shutting several production plants and firing 3,500
workers, about 7.5 percent of the company's total.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy dismissed that revamp as too little, too late. ``AMP has
had ample opportunity to restructure and fix the company,'' he
said. ``But its ability to change on its own is at best
improbable.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal has sued to test the legality of AMP's measures to
thwart a hostile takeover. Pennsylvania law has strong
anti-takeover provisions that tend to favor the board of a target
company. The laws recently helped Mellon Bank of Philadelphia to
defend itself against an unsolicited bid from Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal has also appealed to AMP shareholders to tender
their shares despite the board's rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will have an opportunity to overrule the board and
accept Allied Signal's offer beginning Oct. 15.

FORMER PREMIER DEFENDS 2 ALLIES IN SPANISH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez on Friday
formally joined the defense team of two senior officials who served
in his government in the 1980s and are appealing 10-year sentences
for their roles in the kidnapping of a suspected Basque separatist.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 56, acting as a lawyer for the first time in nearly 20
years, co-signed appeals to the Constitutional Court, Spain's
highest tribunal, for his interior minister, Jose Barrionuevo, and
his director of state security, Rafael Vera.
</P>
<P>
   They are seeking to overturn a Supreme Court conviction on July
29 for their roles in the December 1983 kidnapping. The court also
convicted 10 lower-ranking officials who served under Gonzalez, but
he is helping just the top two aides, the only defendants who
maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a Socialist, led Spain from 1982 to 1996, when he lost
an election to the conservative Popular Party. He insists that the
kidnapping trial was motivated by his political adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is now being talked about to head the European Union's
Executive Commission in 2000, but he has been dogged by questions,
revived at the trial, that his government ran a ``dirty war'' using
a shadowy organization called the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups.
It is blamed for killing 27 suspected Basque separatists from 1983
to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The 1983 kidnapping was the first action publicly claimed by the
organization. But the victim turned out to be a French furniture
dealer, Segundo Marey, not a Basque terrorist. He was released 10
days after being abducted from his home in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Basque underground group ETA _ whose initials
in the Basque language stand for ``Basque Homeland and Liberty'' _
used southern France as a sanctuary. Spanish authorities blame ETA
for about 800 deaths in its 30-year-old struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that there was insufficient
evidence to charge Gonzalez in the kidnapping case. &QL;

   The Hong Kong government ended a weeklong buying spree to prop
up the slumping stock market and let the free market take over,
causing stocks to plunge. The Hang Seng index of 33 leading stocks
declined 214.9 points, or 2.8 percent, to 7,523.61. Hang Seng index
futures plunged 2.8 percent in the final five minutes of trading,
as brokers who had been buying for the Government stopped,
prompting a flood of last-minute sales.

   The Indonesian government closed three banks and seized
ownership of four others in its most comprehensive effort yet to
restore order to the devastated financial system. Among the banks
were institutions owned by some of the most powerful business

PHILADELPHIA SHAKEN BY COLLAPSE OF HEALTH-CARE GIANT

 By PETER T. KILBORN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This venerable city with some of the United
States' oldest hospitals and medical schools is reeling from the
collapse of an institution that swooped into town a decade ago and
shook up every aspect of health care here.
</P>
<P>
   That institution, the Allegheny Health, Education and Research
Foundation, is the largest health-care provider in Pennsylvania and
one of the largest nonprofit providers in the country, owning 13
hospitals _ four in Pittsburgh and nine in and around Philadelphia
_ and nearly 600 physicians' practices in the two cities. Its goal
was to build an integrated health-care network that would treat
patients from diagnosis to discharge, and from cradle to grave.
</P>
<P>
   But a month ago, with debts of $1.3 billion and losses recently
of $1 million a day, Allegheny filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law. Moody's Investors
Service says the nation's last big hospital-system failure, in
California six years ago, was a third the size of Allegheny's.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has since dismissed its chief executive, whose
bold ideas about managing health care drove its wave of
acquisitions and consolidations. Allegheny's strategy of rapid
expansion is now widely seen as having been risky from the start,
the foundation moving too far and too fast,
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very high-flying warning flag to others who are trying
to do these things,'' said Richard Wade, spokesman for the American
Hospital Association. ``It was created too quickly to manage.
Allegheny is a model you don't want to replicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage from Allegheny's failure is leaching through the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of creditors, from big health-maintenance
organizations and drug companies to plumbers and office suppliers,
stand to lose most of the $497 million that they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy could also bring the closing of more Allegheny
hospitals here _ the foundation shut one last year _ since by all
accounts Philadelphia has far more hospital capacity than it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all the hospitals survive, jobs are in doubt. Allegheny
laid off 1,200 workers last fall _ aides, technicians, billing
clerks _ but many of the 16,000 who remain in its Philadelphia
operation have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Few tears are shed here over the 25 percent pay cuts that
Allegheny imposed in May on a handful of superstar
physician-professors who had been lured aboard with $1 million
salaries to bring in patients. But the contracts and
Allegheny-owned practices of $150,000-a-year neighborhood doctors
are in limbo too.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are those the only issues.
</P>
<P>
   No one, for instance, appears to know what has become of much of
the more than $100 million in endowments and restricted gifts that
benefactors left to Philadelphia hospitals or affiliated medical
schools acquired by Allegheny.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has not challenged reports in The Philadelphia
Inquirer that some of that money was used to keep the hospitals
afloat instead of going to the purpose for which a given endowment
was created, like research or teaching. State Attorney General
Michael Fisher has stepped in to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say the Allegheny failure is an example, however
extreme, of the kind of turmoil that could afflict the hospital
industry far more broadly as it struggles to cope with changes in
public policy and the continued expansion of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allegheny blames government policy changes in part for
its problems. For one thing, the Balanced Budget Act adopted last
year has reduced Medicare payments to hospitals. At the same time,
the federal government is encouraging elderly Medicare recipients
to join managed-care plans, which seek to save money in large part
by reducing hospital stays, while states including Pennsylvania are
ordering indigent Medicaid recipients into such plans.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the spread of managed care is leaving the typical
hospital with just 60 percent to 65 percent of its beds filled on
any given day.
</P>
<P>
   ``For managed care to work, you have to underutilize hospitals,
so it's a Catch-22,'' Dr. Clarence Martin said of the prospects
that had faced both the foundation and the physicians it employed.
(Until several months ago, he was one of them.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Allegheny clearly contributed to its own demise, rapidly
assuming the enormous debt of troubled hospitals that it acquired
and then failing to generate enough revenue to bring that debt
under control.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was brought down by ``a combination of factors,''
including, ``quite candidly, what pundits have labeled a very
aggressive expansion strategy'' in the Philadelphia area, said its
spokesman, Thomas Chakurda.
</P>
<P>
   Allegheny's leading strategist was its chief executive, Sharif
Abdelhak, who, until the board deposed him in June, earned $1.2
million a year. Little has been seen of Abdelhak since his
departure, and repeated efforts to reach him for comment were
unavailing.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhak, now 52, left his native Egypt at the age of 25, earned
a business degree at the University of Pittsburgh and worked his
way up from food-service management to chief executive at Allegheny
General Hospital in Pittsburgh, which became the flagship for his
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he came up with an idea that was novel at the time but
has since been widely adopted: capturing patients by building a
tightly integrated network of hospitals, medical schools and
physicians' practices.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired the century-and-a-half-old Medical College of
Pennsylvania here in Philadelphia, later added the equally
venerable Hahnemann University and merged the two to create the
nation's largest private medical school, Allegheny University of
the Health Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhak's goal of providing managed care was achieved primarily
by contracting with HMOs. He expected to manage their members' care
for less than the HMOs could, and to pocket the difference. But the
costs were more than he had anticipated. Instead of getting
payments from this region's two big HMOs _ Independence Blue Cross
and Aetna U.S. Healthcare _ Allegheny now owes them tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of buying family-physician practices also failed.
Most of them wound up losing money, Allegheny says. One reason was
that doctors employed by the foundation often routed those in their
care to hospitals other than Allegheny's when they felt it best
suited the patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Being prodded not to send his patients to non-network hospitals
was hardly Clarence Martin's only problem with Allegheny.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 47, had a successful solo practice in the Chestnut
Hill-Mount Airy section of town, with 2,500 middle-class patients.
In early 1996, he says, Allegheny offered him a deal: Sell us your
practice and become an employee. We'll pay you $150,000 a year,
about what you have been earning, and provide for a bonus equal to
40 percent of office revenue that exceeds expenses. Martin will not
say what he sold for, but typically doctors received around
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then odd things happened. Allegheny dismissed his office
manager, who was vital to the rhythms of his practice, and assigned
her work to a regional, circuit-riding manager. The message on his
answering machine purged his name. ``Stenton Avenue Medical
Practice,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, after the end of the fiscal year, ``I looked at my
books and thought I should get a nice little bonus.'' His revenue
exceeded expenses by $24,000, so he calculated that he would get
$9,600.
</P>
<P>
   When the bonus did not arrive, he began calling. ``I got an
answer in early October,'' he said. ``They told me, `We looked at
everything, and you're not getting a bonus.'''
</P>
<P>
   He went back to his books and realized that Allegheny had been
charging him for visits of various consultants _ one to survey the
flow of patient traffic, others to survey his office exit signs and
his handicapped-parking spaces. He swears he was charged $180 by
one to change a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Martin negotiated a termination of his contract and by January
was on his own again.
</P>
<P>
   Under its bankruptcy plan, Allegheny would keep the hospitals in
Pittsburgh and put the entire Philadelphia operation up for sale.
Since the filing, two for-profit hospital-management companies _
Tenet Healthcare Corp. of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Vanguard
Health Systems of Nashville, Tenn. _ have begun bidding on the
spoils. But both are offering less than $500 million, well below
Allegheny's debt.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, with Allegheny's losses mounting,
Abdelhak visited Mayor Edward Rendell and stunned him with a
proposal to buy the city-owned six-square-block site of an
abandoned naval hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to build a brand-new medical campus for multiple
hundreds of millions of dollars,'' Rendell said. ``They had picked
out a developer. They were going to tear it down and build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal never went through, ``it's an example,'' the
mayor said, ``of how Alice in Wonderland this all was.''

 DESTROYED FACTORY BECOMES STAGE FOR DEMONSTRATIONS  (EDS: This
article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a
story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(jw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise
missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this
capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over
the site Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the
entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made
pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for
the making of chemical weapons. Deep puddles on the muddy ground
attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of
assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used
these fiery remnants as a backdrop for a well organized
anti-American demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were
urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the
plant, where leading figures accused the United States of being a
``terrorist'' state.
</P>
<P>
   At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his
mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as
the ultimate mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan al Turabi, speaker of Parliament and the ideological
power behind the ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent
Friday. American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close
comrade of bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of being
the mastermind bombings of two American embassies leaving hundreds
dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, said he
would prove that the destroyed factory was not used for making
terrorist supplies. ``We have undeniable proof,'' he said.
International companies that had provided equipment for the plant
that opened two years ago would back him up, he added. The general
did not name them.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin
Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of
the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.''

 By MARILYN BERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She wrote no symphonies, played on no concert stages,
conducted no orchestras, but Wanda Toscanini Horowitz, who died
Friday at her Manhattan home at the age of 90, played a unique part
in this century's music world.
</P>
<P>
   For almost all of her life she was at the center of a world that
lionized her father, Arturo Toscanini, and adored her husband,
Vladimir Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the daughter of Toscanini, I didn't have any merit
because I could have been born to anybody,'' she once told an
interviewer. ``But to be the wife of Horowitz, in that I take a
little bit of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   She was married to Mr. Horowitz for 55 years, a period in which
he was hailed as perhaps the greatest pianist ever and in which he
withdrew and refused to play in public.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Horowitz died on Nov. 5, 1989, Leonard Bernstein paid
tribute to Mrs. Horowitz. ``I send you loving sympathy, but let me
add my admiration for you and your long years of devotion to this
amazing man,'' he wrote. ``He was not only a super-pianist but a
super-musician with all the mental fallibilities such geniuses
have. You cared for him and guarded him through a series of
neurotic crises the world may never know nor understand; and you
returned him to us time and again, refreshed, renewed and ever
greater.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before Mr. Horowitz's death, Mrs.
Horowitz said: ``I went with him through very difficult times. For
12 years he was not playing and for 12 years I heard, `I will never
play again,' and I kept silence. I never said, `Oh, yes, you have
to play.' I never prompted him, pushed him to play.''
</P>
<P>
   She wore a permanent scowl and was famous for her fiery temper.
Once she exploded at a reporter who asked about her life with
Toscanini and Horowitz: ``Don't talk to me about them. My father
made me neurotic and my husband made me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But she rejected the thought that she had lived in the shadow of
the great musicians. ``No, not in the shadow, because still people
know me,'' she said, just weeks before Horowitz died. ``I have my
own personality. But now, at this point in life, I wish I would
have done something for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me what I would have liked to do,'' she added. ``I
had a lovely, small voice. I can act, because I have a very severe
face but I can be very funny. I have a great sense of humor. And I
used to dance very well. So what more do you want? I was not
bad-looking. I was thinner then than I am now. I could have done a
little bit of dancing or singing, to be, you know, an operetta
singer. That was my aim.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a teen-ager when she gave up her hopes to be a
performer, although she was the most musically talented of the
Toscanini children. She took piano lessons and singing lessons and
was fairly good at both. But ``fairly good'' was not good enough in
the Toscanini family. ``I remember I used to play an upright
piano,'' she recalled. ``On top there was a photograph of my
father. Young. Dark hair. Dark mustache. Dark eyes. I couldn't look
at him.'' She was afraid to practice when he was home. ``A mistake
was like a stab in his stomach,'' she once said.
</P>
<P>
   With ambition behind her, she took up the position of assistant
to her mother, who was in charge of organizing the maestro's
affairs for his concert tours. ``I was taught to listen,'' she said
simply.
</P>
<P>
   When she married Mr. Horowitz in 1933 she followed her mother's
example and began to serve her husband _ to pack his bags and see
to it that he had every comfort of home on the road, from the
proper curtains and bedding in his hotel room tothe filet of sole
and asparagus he favored in his later years. She screened telephone
calls, fought with managers and saw that record jackets _ and the
recordings inside them _ were just so.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Milan, Italy, on Dec. 5, 1907, the youngest of
four children, and was christened Wanda Giorgina.
</P>
<P>
   She was 25 when she met Mr. Horowitz and was smitten. ``In the
first place he was good-looking,'' she recalled. ``And his playing!
I heard him play in a house after a concert. He played a Chopin
mazurka and I remember I went home and said, `I never heard anybody
play a mazurka of Chopin like this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The music world was stunned by the liaison and saw Mr. Horowitz,
who had shown little or no interest in women, seeking to add luster
to his name by establishing a link to Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in Milan on Dec. 21, 1933, and left on their
honeymoon _ a trans-Atlantic voyage on the liner Rex _ accompanied
by the groom's concert agent and musical contemporaries (Yehudi
Menuhin and Gregor Piatigorsky), as well as the bride's father,
mother and cousin. ``I didn't feel that I left my family,'' she
said years later.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage was stormy. There was a separation in 1949, and
then, Mrs. Horowitz recalled, in 1951 she started to accompany her
husband on his concert tours. When they arrived in New York he
would go to a hotel and she would go home.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1953, he got sick. ``So I took him back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Horowitzes had a daughter, Sonia, a troubled girl who was
seriously injured in a motorcycle accident from which she never
fully recovered. She died in 1974 at 40. No immediate family
members survive.
</P>
<P>
   In her daughter's memory, Mrs. Horowitz sold the emerald her
husband had given her when the child was born and contributed the
money to provide guide dogs for the blind.
</P>
<P>
   The Horowitzes collected fine Impressionist paintings, but sold
most of them. ``When my husband didn't play for 12 years,'' Mrs.
Horowitz said, ``that's when we started to sell, as we say, for the
grocery store _ to live.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Mrs. Horowitz and her family gave Toscanini's papers,
valued at about $2 million, to the New York Public Library. Mrs.
Horowitz also gave the library 38 letters written to her parents by
composer Giacomo Puccini, along with $100,000 to help catalog and
preserve the collection.
</P>
<P>
   For relaxation, Mrs. Horowitz played cards, mostly canasta,
occasionally to the piano accompaniment of her husband. But in her
last years, she played little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you something,'' she said when she was almost 82.
``At one moment, I could have 5 tables of 4 _ 20 people. Today, I
cannot make 4. They're all underground. You know, to get old is not
easy, because all your friends go. I cannot go through my telephone
book because half of them are not here anymore. That's life.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Assistant GM talks to L.A.
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dean Taylor, the first man John Schuerholz hired as
his chief assistant after coming to Atlanta in 1990, has
interviewed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the general manager's
job.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 46, met with Dodgers president Dan Graziano, team
chairman of the board Pete O'Malley and their staff Thursday in Los
Angeles. Though the Dodgers are in the early stages of finding a
permanent replacement for interim GM Tommy Lasorda, Taylor is on a
short list of six executives that interest the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be considered for one of the best jobs in
baseball,'' Taylor said. ``I'm just going to leave it at that. The
interest came from them. They went through all the proper
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Also under consideration are Florida GM Dave Dombrowski, ex-New
York Yankees GM Bob Watson, Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden, Baltimore
assistant GM (and former Montreal GM) Kevin Malone and New York
Mets assistant GM Omar Minaya. Dombrowski and Bowden are considered
front-runners. The Dodgers are hopeful of filling the job before
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who worked under Schuerholz for 10 years in Kansas City
before working a season in the commissioner's office, has overseen
the administrative and operations side of the Braves front office
and has handled contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hard working and deserving and he's competent and
capable. He'll be a good general manager,'' Schuerholz said. ``Now,
it goes without saying he's been my right arm and leg and right
brain for 18 years. So I would miss him terribly, but I think he's
a very deserving guy and I hope he gets the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer returns
</P>
<P>
   The Braves activated right-handed reliever Russ Springer before
Friday's game and returned left-handed rookie Adam Butler to Class
AAA Richmond. Springer received a cortisone treatment Aug. 6 for a
bone spur in his right elbow, a problem the club was aware of when
it acquired him from Arizona for Alan Embree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's brand new,'' Springer said, ``but it's
been as good as it's felt since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Springer will not throw his split-fingered pitch again
this season, due to the stress it causes. Instead, he will use his
change-up.
</P>
<P>
   Butler had thrown two scoreless innings (no hits, one walk,
three strikeouts) in Springer's place, a turnaround from his first
tour with the club when he allowed four runs in 1 1/3 innings in
early April.
</P>
<P>
   Re-deal
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies have returned right-handed pitcher David
Cortes, claiming the reliever had an injured shoulder when Atlanta
shipped him in the Greg Colbrunn trade. The Braves took him back in
exchange for a player to be named later. Though Cortes had spent
some time on the Richmond DL due to a sore shoulder in late spring,
the Rockies became concerned after seeing Cortes pitch six times.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Braves were at no obligation to take him back Cortes
is still held in high regard by Atlanta's scouting office, sore arm
or not. He had accumulated 44 saves in 92 minor league appearances
since signing him out of a try-out camp in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the Rockies) are wrong,'' said Schuerholz said. ``The
doctor looked at him and he was cleared to pitch. He threw the ball
95 mph.''

MEXICO-POTTERY-1COX, 8-21 -- Nieto Real works on a black pottery
vessel in his studio. Using ancient methods and the same clay as
his ancestors, he and other potters in this community spin vessels.
The dull gray clay is harvested from the hills and turns black when
fired. ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real says. (Sergio

IN WORLD OF WOMEN'S HOOPS, WNBA'S COOPER UNEQUALED
</HEADLINE>

By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask Cynthia Cooper about talk of her being the best player in
women's basketball, and she might shy away from such discussions
for fear of it becoming a bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   But others who have seen the Houston Comets' guard light up the
basket are not so indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that right now Cooper's the best player in
the country,'' longtime University of Texas coach Jody Conradt
said. ``I haven't seen all of the other players in the world, but
I'd put her up against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Yolanda Griffith and Long Beach's Natalie Williams are
the top players in the American Basketball League. Tennessee's
Chamique Holdsclaw and Tamika Catchings are college basketball's
most prolific players. And Russia's Elana Baranova _ she also plays
for the Women's NBA's Utah Starzz _ was chosen the most valuable
player of last spring's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The world's other top players are Lisa Leslie of the WNBA's Los
Angeles Sparks, Teresa Edwards and Dawn Staley of the ABL's
Philadelphia Rage, Houston's Sheryl Swoopes, and Jennifer Gillom of
the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cooper is the person many followers of women's
basketball say is the game's most distinguished player. She hopes
to drive home that point this afternoon against the Charlotte Sting
as the Comets open defense of their WNBA title when they play Game
1 of their best-of-three series at 3 p.m. in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Comets' success will hinge on how Cooper performs
on the playoff stage. And if Cooper's past performances are any
indication, the Comets will be crowned WNBA champions again
sometimes late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who averages 22.7 points, 4.4 assists and 3.7 rebounds,
has a knack for taking over games the way Chicago Bulls superstar
Michael Jordan does. She plays with a flair for the dramatics, and
has the ability to take it to the basket, or pull up and drop in a
feathery jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Michael Jordan and I see all of the things that he
brings to the Chicago Bulls,'' Comets point guard Kim Perrot said.
``He's an all-around player, and he enjoys the game. Cynthia is
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has taken the WNBA to another level, especially
without them recognizing her as a marquee player.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Cooper won the WNBA's MVP award, and she's the leading
candidate to win it again this year after winning the scoring title
for the second consecutive season and guiding the Comets to a
Bulls-like 27-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's second-best player is Gillom, who finished second in
scoring behind Cooper with 20.8 points per game. Comets coach Van
Chancellor coached Gillom at the University of Mississippi, and
added that ``it's just a landslide'' as to who is the WNBA's best
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jennifer Gillom is a great player, and there are a lot
of great players out there,'' Chancellor said. ``But not everybody
can do what (Cooper) does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynthia can score, but she's as good as I've ever seen at
getting other players a shot and getting them easy baskets. What
separates Cynthia Cooper from a lot of players is the fact that she
can create so many opportunities for other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Even David Letterman confirmed Cooper's stature in the game when
she made an appearance on ``The Late Show With David Letterman''
last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're great for the world of basketball,'' Letterman told
Cooper. ``You're great for the world in general.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gillom, other players have also been superb in
handling their basketball craft. Tracey Williams, the ABL vice
president for player personnel and basketball operations, told
Chicago Condors coach Jim Cleamons that the 6-4 Griffith is
``Scottie Pippen with a dress'' because of her versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told coach Cleamons that, he looked at me really
funny,'' Williams continued. ``But Griffith's definitely got big
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Griffith finished first in the ABL in steals (3.1),
second in rebounds (11.2), second in blocks (1.3) and fourth in
scoring (18.8). She wound up second in the league's MVP race behind
Natalie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future of women's pro basketball, Conradt believes
that marquee college players such as Holdsclaw and Catchings will
hold the sport together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Holdsclaw has the potential to be another Cynthia
Cooper type of player,'' Conradt said. ``You're impressed with her,
because she blends in with her team. But when it gets down to the
critical parts of the game, she always steps it up.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, no one steps it up better than Cooper.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration made measured claims of
success for the cruise-missile attacks in the Sudan and Afghanistan
on Thursday, saying the attack on a mountain redoubt in Afghanistan
would disrupt training and, possibly, future attacks by terrorists
sponsored by Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy weather and haze obscured satellite photographs of what
the administration has described as a sprawling terrorist training
camp near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, hampering efforts to
learn the extent of the damage done when missiles fired from four
Navy warships and one submarine pummeled the area.
</P>
<P>
   But senior administration officials said preliminary
assessments, based in part on sources other than spy satellites,
indicated that the missiles destroyed or damaged many of the
buildings spread throughout the remote complex about 90 miles south
of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of bin Laden sought to play down the extent of the
damage but spoke of 20 or more deaths. They said the Saudi-born
millionaire was still alive and ready to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the strike was
``successful in the sense that we destroyed a number of
facilities'' at the camp, known as Zhawar Kili Al-Badr. At the
White House, the president's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, said, ``The attacks have significantly disrupted the
capability to use these camps as terrorist training facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, while circumspect in their choice of
words, left open the possibility that the United States would
strike bin Laden's network again if necessary. ``We have
contingency plans that we are developing, and there may be more in
the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration opened a new front in its
fight against bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the United States has
accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks, including the bombings of
the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two weeks ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed an executive order that, effective
Friday, placed bin Laden on the Treasury Department's list of
terrorists and their sponsors, clearing the way for officials to
identify and seize any of bin Laden's financial assets in the
United States, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in this context, money matters,'' Berger said,
suggesting that the action could undercut bin Laden's sponsorship
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not immediately clear whether bin Laden, whose
fortune is estimated between $200 million and $300 million, has any
assets in the United States. It was also unclear why bin Laden had
not been placed on the department's list earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO diplomat said Friday that the administration had begun
asking allies in Europe to help in the effort to freeze bin Laden's
assets and those of terrorist groups associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the strikes on Thursday nor this latest step appeared to
have tempered bin Laden, who has vowed to wage war against the
United States. A man claiming to be a spokesman for bin Laden told
the editor of an Arabic newspaper in London, al-Quds al-Arabi, that
bin Laden had survived the missile attack and was vowing to avenge
them with attacks on American targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle has not yet started,'' the editor, Abdel-Bari
Atwan, quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington to return to his vacation in Martha's
Vineyard on Friday night, Clinton met with his national security
advisers for about an hour and telephoned Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan.
Pakistan has vigorously protested the attack, which sent dozens of
cruise missiles soaring over its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's senior aides also sought to rally support for the
attacks on Capitol Hill, where some critics on Thursday had
questioned the strikes, or at least their timing, given the furor
over Clinton's admission on Monday night that he had had an
intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, joined by Gen.
Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met in a
classified briefing with a dozen Republican and Democratic
lawmakers Friday afternoon. The lawmakers emerged sounding
persuaded by the administration's justification for the strikes,
citing what some called ``irrefutable evidence'' from satellite
photographs, intercepts of telephone conversations and statements
by a suspect in the embassy bombings who is now being held in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they shared with us made it crystal clear that terrorism
had escalated against us,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers said they found persuasive the information
gleaned from the suspect who has begun to cooperate with the
authorities, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh. When he was arrested by the
Pakistani authorities on Aug. 7, the day of the embassy bombings,
he said that he was a follower of bin Laden's. Odeh also told them
he helped to build the Nairobi bomb, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials declined to make public
specific evidence that led to such swift and surprising attacks on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the strikes, which involved roughly 75 cruise
missiles fired from undisclosed positions in the Arabian and Red
seas, the administration warned that retaliatory attacks against
American targets were a grave possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reiterated a security alert first issued in the hours
after Thursday's strikes, and public buildings, airports and
military bases in the United States and abroad beefed up security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, the administration defended the strikes,
citing the nation's right, as defined in the U.N. charter, to
defend itself. Berger said the administration considered the camp
outside the remote Afghan town of Khost ``to be a military
target.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of
state for political affairs, declared that the United States could
not sit idly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not simply batten down the hatches and wait for the
next attack to hit us,'' he said. ``We had to act decisively. We do
not expect that these strikes will in themselves end the threat,
but they are important because they clearly show that we are in
this for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, the strikes generated official denunciations and street
protests in the Sudan and Afghanistan. There were also angry
demonstrations in Pakistan. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, protests
converged on the U.S. Embassy. In Kabul, two U.N. workers were shot
in separate attacks that appeared to be related to anger over the
American strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's reticence to confirm publicly even the most
fundamental details of the strikes _ including the names of the
Navy ships involved or even the exact number of missiles fired _
compounded the uncertainty that prevailed Friday, as did Cohen's
vague assertions that additional American attacks could be in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strike in the Sudan seemed to have accomplished its
mission. Stark television images confirmed that the strike heavily
damaged a factory that officials described as a manufacturer of
building blocks for chemical weapons. Berger declared it
``functionally destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's state-run television said 10 people had been injured,
but none, evidently, were killed. Sudan's president, Omar Hassan
al-Bashir, was quoted by Reuters as saying the factory, Al Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co., was a benign commercial venture that
produced half the nation's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the strike in Afghanistan was less clear. In
Kabul, the Taliban faction that rules the country announced that 21
people had died in the attack on the base, while 30 others were
injured, but the spokesman for bin Laden put the dead at 28 in his
remarks to the editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi. He said the dead
included six Arab militants, 15 Pakistanis and seven Afghans.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, officials said they had no way of knowing
who died, and the Pentagon received conflicting, unverifiable
intelligence reports. Some said bin Laden was dead; others said he
was alive, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States timed the attack to what they believed to be a
gathering of terrorists at the camp, but Cohen saif Friday that it
was not clear that the assembly had in fact taken place.
Regardless, Cohen said the attack was aimed less at individuals
than at the barracks and ammunition stockpiles spread over the
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Striking the facilities in themselves is a worthy goal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With only one chance a day for spy satellites to photograph the
area, a full assessment will take at least another day, perhaps
longer, depending on the weather. There were early indications that
while some missiles hit their targets, others missed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the facilities have been destroyed completely,'' a
senior Pentagon official said. ``Some have been damaged heavily.
Some have been damaged lightly. And some have been missed
entirely.'' &QL;

COWBOYS SAY THEY ARE READY TO GET UP AND GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ No more excuses. No more justifications.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's hoped, no more three-and-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to a man, the Cowboys, who have struggled for much of the
preseason with coach Chan Gailey's new offense, say the time has
come to show progress in tonight's preseason game against the St.
Louis Rams at the TransWorld Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely reason for concern,'' quarterback Troy
Aikman said. ``If we pay more attention to detail and be more
consistent, then we can have a good offensive football team. If we
don't, we won't be much improved over last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the starters slated to log their most extensive amount
of work to date, the Cowboys said they must improve on the maladies
that have led to an 0-3 preseason record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to step up and play better,'' Cowboys receiver Michael
Irvin said. ``It's getting close to the season, and we got to start
honing in on everything. It's definitely time. There is no question
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The season opener against the Arizona Cardinals is two weeks
away, and the first-team offense has netted just 40 yards and two
first downs in the past two outings, 16-3 and 21-3 losses to the
Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' lackluster efforts have also included poor
offensive-line play, mental miscues, dropped passes and the
inability to mount a pass rush, especially from starting defensive
ends Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who initially preached patience regarding the his team's
poor performances, now seems a little worried about his players'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to win, and they want to look good,'' Gailey said.
``Who doesn't? You don't want your players to start thinking that
nothing is going right. I hope that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's disappointed in his team's play, Gailey said he's
far from discouraged. He said he knew it would be a struggle early
_ especially considering that limiting starters' playing time,
installing an offense and evaluating players were his focus in the
first three games.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey also said the Cowboys have been pointing to the St. Louis
game since the start of training camp as a prime opportunity for a
long look at their starters. And with the first team expected to
play the entire first half, Gailey said he expects better results.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first-team offense has played only 68 snaps through
three preseason games and two scrimmages, netting just two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing together for a half gives them continuity, which
should help,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys said they believe that the offense will look better
against the Rams with tailbacks Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren back
in the lineup. They both sat out last Monday's game against the
Patriots nursing injuries. Pittman, who missed the last week of
practice because of a sprained ankle, also is expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   However, the key to improvement, Aikman said, is eliminating
mental mistakes that have plagued the team. They also have revived
memories of last season's 6-10 record, when similar problems
resulted in the Cowboys finishing 20th in the league in offense.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said there should be some patience with this year's
mistakes because the Cowboys are learning a new offense. He also
said the Cowboys have practiced well, but acknowledged good
practices aren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, they don't let you turn in the practice
tapes,'' Aikman said. ``You got to do it on game day.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, game day is today is against the Cardinals.

RELIGION COLUMN: CLINTON'S WOES SHOW SOCIETY'S CONFUSION ABOUT
SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PETER STEINFELS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most traditional codes of sexual ethics, whether set down in
sacred texts like the Bible or the Koran, or simply prescribed by
tribal customs, share two premises, amply confirmed by recent
events: sex is crazy, and sex is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, almost no one really doubts these things, which
contemporary culture endlessly celebrates or laments in poetry,
song and dance, explores in drama and fiction and even depicts in
sculpture and painting.
</P>
<P>
   But at critical junctures, contemporary culture prefers to
minimize what it otherwise knows is true. Over the long run, that
denial may constitute a more consequential deception than the ones
preoccupying the news media and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, recorded in folk tales and sacred narratives and epic
poems, is that sex wields the power to drive people wild. Indeed,
that is one of its chief delights. The man or woman who approaches
sex with utter calculation and composure is generally considered
repulsive, if not immoral.
</P>
<P>
   And sex, the traditional ethical codes and contemporary culture
agree, is not only powerful, it is important. It puts the self at
stake in a way that even death-defying activities like mountain
climbing do not.
</P>
<P>
   Why else do people intuitively take betraying a spouse so
seriously, and understand, even while reproving, why someone would
lie about it? Why do they automatically put it in a different
category than, say, deceiving a spouse about the family budget,
although the latter might have no less grave consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Because of these realities, for which there are plenty of
evolutionary explanations, religions and cultures have
traditionally hedged sex with rules and customs and etiquette,
trying to channel its energies and reduce its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The young and the single have been coached and compelled to
follow certain models and patterns rather than being left to invent
their sexual ethics for themselves. Marriage, entry into it and
exit from it and everything between, has been ritualized and
enclosed in a skein of duties and obligations. The gods and
governments have enforced the rules. More immediately, so has the
family. Sex, therefore, was both public and private, social and
intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these models varied widely from faith to faith and
from society to society _ so that what one group considered normal
another might find bizarre or even outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet virtually all these codes of sexual ethics assumed two
further premises: first, that sex was inevitably linked to
reproduction and therefore family lineages and, second, that women
were subordinate to men.
</P>
<P>
   But modern societies have increasingly rejected these latter
premises, and that is a major reason, though perhaps not the only
one, that traditional codes have been under siege.
</P>
<P>
   That siege has often taken the form of challenging the other
premises, about the power and importance of sex, as well. The
culture that entertains adolescents with retail knockoffs of
Dionysian rites and bases whole industries on raging hormones also
insists that the sex drive will easily yield to sound information
and classroom instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The culture that understands how deeply sexuality is implicated
in personality and psychological integrity is also a culture where
the moralist warning of sexual anarchy can expect to be derided as
an obsessed relic of Victorianism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a culture where advertising and entertainment, in their
reliance on sex, exploit its power but trivialize its importance:
Sex is exciting but also just one more way to relax and socialize,
like bowling, or get a few thrills, like sky diving, or round out
the well-appointed life style, like vacationing in exotic locales.
</P>
<P>
   These tactical denials of traditional ethics' insistence on the
power and importance of sex have become so pervasive that even a
conservative like Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has used the word
``peccadillo'' to describe Clinton's sexual transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of language that only adds to confusion about
whether sex is a private or public matter. Instead of replying
``both'' and attempting to distinguish when and how, the culture
hops from one description to the other. At one moment, reserve and
reticence are decried as prudery and censorship. At another moment,
publicity and censure are decried as prurience and invasion of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In reacting to President Clinton's sexual misdeeds, the public
has shown itself simultaneously traditional and capable of
distinctions. If the president's sexual conduct, for most people,
remains a big deal, it is not necessarily the biggest deal. If it
cannot be neatly viewed as either a strictly private matter or an
eminently public one, the public appears to have settled on
distinguishable concerns raised by his behavior _ personal
trustworthiness versus executive ability, for example _ that can be
reasonably assigned to one category or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Will this reservoir of common sense guide the society through
the adjustments and adaptations in traditional codes of sexual
ethics that have been underway, in some respects for a century or
more, in others for only a few years?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that process is not made easier by a culture that,
regarding the power and importance of sex, speaks out of both sides
of its mouth. The most important lies being told about sex are
probably not the ones that have emanated from the White House.

BAILOUT FIGHT MAY BE DEFINING CRISIS OF ZEDILLO ADMINISTRATION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The video is both damning and enlightening, an
indictment of politics as usual in Mexico and an advertisement for
the benefits of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   As the tape begins, a cartoon figure of an impoverished Mexican
Everyman shuffles along until he is assaulted by an elegantly
attired thief in top hat and tails. The rich again, Mexico's bane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that very soon they will want to pay for their
mistakes with your money?'' a disparaging voice asks while the
video parades images of fugitive bankers, discredited politicians
and long-suffering poor.
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes, the video's voice says, include more than $65
billion in bad loans made by Mexican banks, which have been assumed
over the past three years by a government agency called Fobaproa.
The amount already equals about a sixth of Mexico's annual economic
output.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party has been distributing
the video as part of an all-out drive to frustrate President
Ernesto Zedillo's attempt to pass the check for the bank bailout
along to Mexican taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the Fobaproa affair might have proved scarcely an
embarrassment for a political and financial system riddled with
cronyism and corruption. But now that the political opposition
controls Mexico's Congress, the fight over the bailout looms as
perhaps the defining crisis of Zedillo's 44-month-old
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The affair was spawned by the 1994 peso devaluation and
subsequent economic crisis. As some banks folded and others were
bought by new investors, including U.S. and foreign financial
firms, the Fobaproa agency paid for the institutions' bad loans
with 10-year bonds. Last April, Zedillo asked Congress to approve
legislation that would have paid the bad bank debt with the
people's purse, forcing Mexico's poor majority to cover the losses
of some of its wealthiest moguls.
</P>
<P>
   The debate heated up amid a worsening financial squeeze caused
by a sharp drop in oil prices. The Zedillo government made deep
cuts in social spending for housing, hospitals, schools and other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money at stake is enough to build 4.5 million houses for the
poor, the opposition party video claims. It's enough to fund the
budgets of Oaxaca or Sonora states for a century. It's enough, the
video says, to be enraged about.
</P>
<P>
   Financial scandals are nothing new in Mexico. And when both the
Congress and the Mexican press were tools of the president and the
ruling party, such a cozy bailout would have been easy to pull off
in the shadows. But this time the Congress _ controlled by
opposition parties since July 1997's historic midterm elections _
refused to play along with the government's bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolution Party, which has spent a decade
fighting what it calls the government's bias toward the rich,
immediately balked. The pro-business National Action Party waffled
and then also refused to cooperate with the president. Even members
of Zedillo's own Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, have
threatened to abandon the president on Fobaproa.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the media is testing its growing independence
from government control by pouring on information about, and sharp
criticism of, Zedillo's plans for Fobaproa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of information that is coming out is remarkable,''
says Sergio Aguayo, a political scientist and leading democracy
advocate. ``The constant flow (of information) coming out of the
printed media is defining the debate. At least now we have
information. That was not the case in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the administration and other Fobaproa backers have
launched an advertising blitz on radio and television, arguing that
a bailout actually would protect the savings of ordinary Mexicans.
A government book explaining the program has hit the streets, but
it is priced above the daily wage of most Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   For all the noise, the fight over Fobaproa testifies to the
promise that democracy offers Mexico, Aguayo and other analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied in its effort to get its Fobaproa plan through Congress,
the Zedillo administration is now working on a compromise proposal.
National Action's leaders issued a six-point plan that would cut
half the public's debt over the next 10 years, and the Democratic
Revolution Party has called a nationwide referendum on the matter
for Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout controversy is but one of a handful of scandals
buffeting Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive former head of Aeromexico, an airline once
controlled by the government, has alleged in testimony published
this week that top members of Zedillo's Cabinet schemed to funnel
some $8 million in company money to the president's 1994 election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, IBM agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement with
Mexico City's new opposition-controlled government. The deal
settles a fraud complaint surrounding the purchase of what the city
administration argued was a shoddy computer system put in by a
former ruling-party administration.
</P>
<P>
   Smelling blood, the Democratic Revolution Party has gone for the
jugulars of both Zedillo and the PRI, which has controlled Mexico's
national politics for nearly seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party's president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
is travelling the country with the anti-Fobaproa video to drum up
support against any bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The National Action Party has been less vocal but equally
uncooperative. National Action has gone along with Zedillo on
economic and financial policies in the past. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't turn away from this Fobaproa matter,'' National
Action President Felipe Calderon told reporters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be resolved. It's necessary to avoid tolerating
impunity,'' he said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``No act against the national interest should go unpunished.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In retrospect, the only public hint of the assault
to come _ the only moment when President Clinton's intense,
parallel preparations for his political survival and for a strike
against terrorists might have crossed _ came Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After he grimly admitted his intimate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the president tried to turn the nation's attention to
more noble subjects _ to ``important work to do,'' including ``real
security matters to face.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. The president did not mention his meeting that
afternoon in the White House solarium to discuss Thursday's
counterterrorist missile strikes, even as prosecutors were arriving
downstairs to grill him under oath about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention that before he went to face the prosecutors,
he ordered National Security Adviser Sandy Berger to convene the
government's top security officials Tuesday for one more
run-through of the mission. That meeting came just before the
president left on what the world and even most of his aides
expected to be a 12-day vacation, spent mostly in seclusion with
his wife, daughter and dog.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at his borrowed estate on Martha's Vineyard. Clinton's
telephone conversations to outside political advisers to discuss
the dismal reaction to his speech about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky were interspersed with calls to his security aides about
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the president and his family went out to
celebrate his 52nd birthday. He returned at 11:30 p.m. to more
telephone calls to advisers, including Vice President Al Gore, to
chew over a last, troubling question about the targets.
</P>
<P>
   He made up his mind about the targeting, then gave his final
go-ahead in a talk with Berger at 3 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Never has Clinton's fabled ability to compartmentalize his life
been more starkly demonstrated than in the last two weeks. As the
one man in the world who held all the information, he walled off
meetings with his lawyers to prepare for his testimony from
meetings with his national security advisers to plan one of the
largest military operations of his presidency: simultaneous strikes
seas apart by about 75 cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the last two weeks _ from the embassy bombings in East
Africa until the president's Oval Office address Thursday evening _
look in retrospect like a trick mirror version, compressed and
exaggerated, of the split presidency Clinton has had for more than
five years: fierce damage control and political strategizing on the
one hand, studied policy debate on the other.
</P>
<P>
   And connected to each hand, standing in the middle and alone,
was the president.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating accusations of political manipulation, the national
security team took pains to avoid any appearance of political
meddling. Berger, who headed the meetings to plan the mission, kept
the operation a secret until the middle of this week from all but
two of the president's top political advisers, chief of staff
Erskine Bowles and his deputy, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his numerous duties, which include foreign
policy, Podesta has been in charge of the president's political
damage-control effort for seven months. Further, Berger is
considered a solid political strategist, who has played a role in
Clinton's two national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But White House advisers scoffed at suggestions that politics
played a role in the assault. Several said the recommendation for
the attack was based on very strong intelligence and was unanimous.
They said Pentagon and intelligence officials with no record of
partisanship joined strongly in the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers were said by White House aides to have
complained last week that they were not getting enough time with
him to prepare. They learned the reason why only when the rest of
the world did, as the president appeared at 1:55 p.m. before
reporters gathered in an elementary school gymnasium on Martha's
Vineyard and announced, ``Today we have struck back.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a possible mission began on Friday, Aug. 7, after
powerful bombs exploded outside U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Twelve Americans and nearly 300
Africans were killed. The senior officials who would ultimately
plan the strike held their first meeting. Sketchy intelligence
reports already pointed at a culprit, Osama bin Laden, an exiled
Saudi millionaire living in Afghanistan who had declared a
terrorist war on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also began what would be a series of briefings
for House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the intelligence findings about
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Aug. 10, Clinton departed on a political
fund-raising trip to California, with White House officials
insisting that he was going about business as usual despite his
approaching date with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But the president cut short his trip to fly back to the White
House on Tuesday night, arriving after dawn. Some political
commentators surmised that Clinton was returning to prepare his
defense. In fact, his stated reason was the real reason: He wanted
to meet with his national security team.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted for an hour in the Situation Room in the
White House basement, for a briefing on the investigation into the
bombings and diplomacy with Africa. Then top White House, Pentagon,
State Department and CIA officials _ what came to be called the
small group _ moved up to the Oval Office with the president for a
45-minute talk about retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Further intelligence had confirmed links between bin Laden and
the bombings, officials said, and suggested that a group of
high-level terrorists would be gathering Aug. 20 at a large
compound in Afghanistan that was associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, had already prepared a set of flip charts for a proposed
missile assault on directions from Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The president started firing off questions. His security
advisers described him as clear-headed and focused at every
meeting. He never referred to his political or legal troubles, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, according to a senior official who was present,
Clinton wanted to know more about damage to civilians, possible
terrorist retaliation and the expected response of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton focused on one of the targets, a factory in the Sudanese
city of Khartoum that intelligence showed was used to manufacture
the building blocks of deadly VX gas _ elements in themselves not
dangerous. But, the president asked, what if the factory also
stored a great deal of the completed gas itself?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave permission to begin moving ships into position in
the Red and Arabian Seas for an attack to begin in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Thursday, the president wept silently at Andrews
Air Force Base as 10 coffins arrived from Nairobi. Meanwhile, some
of his closest advisers told reporters from The New York Times
that, contrary to his previous denials, Clinton was considering
telling the grand jury that he had had an intimate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Aug. 14, at a meeting in the Oval Office, Clinton got
the answers he had requested two days before. Shelton described a
``plume analysis,'' which showed that because of the location of
the factory, the casualties would not be high. Clinton gave the
green light for the mission, and Shelton informed him that he had
until 6 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 20, to call it off.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, David Kendall, the president's private lawyer,
practically moved into the White House. He met for hours with
Clinton in the residence. On Saturday morning, the president
delivered his radio address about receiving the bodies at Andrews.
``Our administration will remain committed to the fight against
terror,'' he said, with no elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, Aug. 17, the president worked out in the
White House gymnasium, then spent two hours with his lawyers. He
followed that with the briefing in the solarium from Berger, who
covered not just the pending operation but also the tumble of the
Russian ruble and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president walked downstairs to the Map Room and shook
hands politely with the prosecutors, whom his advisers say he had
come to loathe. At 10 p.m. he addressed the nation for four
minutes, again from the Map Room. Instant reviews panned the
speech: too much anger, too little sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   As chatter filled the air waves the next morning, he met again
with his national security team, to go over the last details of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   His team had by then given considerable thought to how to
announce the assault. They recommended that Clinton go on his
vacation as though nothing was in the works, then briefly announce
the mission Thursday afternoon before returning to Washington for
an Oval Office address. It was the only recommendation that Clinton
accepted without question, a senior administration official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gingrich was given a detailed briefing on the
intelligence on bin Laden, followed Wednesday by a description of
the planned attack.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before the president appeared in the Martha's
Vineyard school gymnasium, the White House warned television
networks of a major announcement on national security. At least one
correspondent telephoned a senior White House official to ask if
Clinton was about to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The networks broke into the soap operas to show Clinton, making
his first remarks since admitting on Monday night that he had
misled the country. ``Good afternoon,'' he began. ``Today I ordered
our armed forces to strike.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flight back to Washington, the president reworked his
Oval Office speech.
</P>
<P>
   He was not fully satisfied with one line drafted by Rahm
Emanuel, a senior aide, declaring what it would take to combat
terrorism. To Emanuel's brace of nouns, ``strength and courage,''
he added one that, so far, even his harshest political critics have
always credited him with: ``endurance.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Wednesday and Thursday with 944 adults
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   These include 530 interviewed before the U.S. military strikes
on terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan were announced, and 414
interviewed after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all
U.S. adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for those respondents interviewed after the U.S.
military strikes were announced, it is plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order
of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

   Cracks are showing &QL; 
in Comets' veneer
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN the NBA added a women's auxiliary last year, everybody was
supposed to have been created equal. But effort, intelligence and
luck never will be dispensed equally in any competitive human
endeavor, so the WNBA's haves and have-nots wasted no time in
identifying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets organization worked harder, hired better, drafted
smarter and got more breaks than any of the franchises that chose
to participate in this baby first step toward gender equality on
the play-for-pay stage. As a result, when Leslie Alexander
purchased the Comets, he wound up with an entire solar system.
</P>
<P>
   They had the requisite star at their center in Cynthia Cooper
plus a full complement of planets to orbit her. The smallest and
least-known among them, Kim Perrot, frequently would reflect the
most light. With Perrot dishing and Cooper swishing, the first
champions of the ``We got next'' league called Houston home.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot August afternoon in a sold-out Summit, Clutch City
became Coop City.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for an encore, the Comets raised the bar in 1998, winning
a remarkable 27 of 30 games and setting a standard of excellence
against which all future women's pro basketball teams will have to
measure themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But if it looked easy
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't,'' coach Van Chancellor said. ``And now comes the
hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   Bull's eye on champs
</P>
<P>
   Irrefutable evidence that coaches, whatever the sex of their
hired jocks, are chronic doomsayers? Perhaps. Alas, the truth is
the Comets wander into Charlotte's web today in a spot of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor frets over the ``law of averages'' _ the Comets are
9-1 against the Sting _ but that's probably the lesser of their
worries, considering their opponent's lackluster performance in
recent weeks and the fact they're playing a best-of-three series,
not a sudden-death knockout round. They can survive a wake-up
mess-up, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern are disturbing signs that, quite the opposite
of Stella, the Comets have lost their groove. And because of it,
they also might have lost their floor leader/defensive conscience
Perrot, who suffered a severe ankle sprain late in the final game
when she should have long since been on the bench cooling down,
saving her energy for this second season's second season.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, understandably, didn't want to enter the playoffs
having been beaten by a 12-18 Los Angeles team at Compaq Center,
but a lethargic effort had the Comets in a bind. So Perrot, whom he
used to call ``Mosquito,'' was doing her usual buzzing about when
an awkward collision with Octavia Blue with less than seven minutes
to go left her exactly that _ blue.
</P>
<P>
   By appearances, the injury appeared career-threatening. Someone
compared it to watching Joe Theismann's leg break in midshin on
Monday Night Football. Fortunately, it wasn't remotely that
serious, but Perrot is in a lot of pain, and she admits she doesn't
``do pain very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although, knowing Perrot, the most self-made Comet, she'll
attempt to play today. But she needs every step of quickness she
has to be the player that binds the others together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we try to do defensively starts with Kim,''
Chancellor says. ``She's got to be able to run and jump normally,
or it will be tough on us. She's about the best defensive player in
women's basketball. You'd hate to lose all that pressure that she
puts on the other guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Team chemistry test
</P>
<P>
   And if any frustration sets in, you wonder if the Comets will
come apart. As you know, they haven't been the happiest of
families, and the bad chemistry that blew up in their faces several
weeks ago _ much to Chancellor's amazement _ no doubt lingers
beneath the surface. Such issues rarely can be talked through,
despite public lip service to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, championships tend to be more easily won than
defended, and the Comets are about to put said maxim to the test.
Everything about last year was fairy-tale stuff, all warm and fuzzy
and brand spanking new. Things went smoother than the Tupelo honey
in Chancellor's Ole Miss accent.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their record, which is about as good as any pro team
ever produced, the Comets appear to be a team of sisters living the
Brothers Grimm existence. With a healthy Perrot, they would be
prohibitive favorites to defend their title, some internal
bickering notwithstanding. Hey, the Bulls didn't all love each
other, either.
</P>
<P>
   But without Perrot? The court is a lot more level. It's amazing
how valuable the 5-5 dervish has become when you consider that
before the Comets' tryout camp last year, Chancellor had her rated
66th among his prospects _ who were only 65 in number.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he calls Perrot's injury ``a severe blow,'' and it is. The
Comets remain good, but suddenly they aren't lucky. Guess something
had to give.

<P>
   KHARTOUM, the Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise
missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this
capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over
the site Friday night. Deep puddles of water on muddy ground
attested to the firefighting efforts after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, which is about a half-mile square, was destroyed in
the attack, though surrounding areas went unscathed. There were no
known deaths at the plant, which was hit at night, when it was
closed, but local reports said 10 people were hospitalized, four of
them in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's Islamic government invited foreign diplomats to
tour the ruins Friday. Afterward, many remained puzzled, saying it
was not clear whether the plant, as Washington asserts, made
precursors for nerve gas or whether it was purely a medical
manufacturing site, as the Sudan contends.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were
urged to attend frenzied rallies, where leading figures of the
government accused the United States of being a terrorist state,
and where the American flag was torn, burned and trampled into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his
mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as
the ultimate mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said Sudan would remain a
``tomb for its enemies, whatever this costs us in human lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al-Turabi, who is
the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the
governing National Islamic Front, remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence officials have called Turabi a close
comrade of Osama bin Laden, whom the administration has accused of
being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in
East Africa that left hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration accuses the Sudanese government of
assisting bin Laden in terrorist activities. The Sudan rejects the
charge and has asked for an urgent meeting of the United Nations
Security Council to discuss the missile strike.
</P>
<P>
   Turabi has always been considered a Rasputin by Westerners, a
mysterious figure of the fundamentalist government that took power
in a military coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the army general who is the Sudanese
president, made up for Turabi's silence by furiously waving a long
stick as he addressed a raucous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bashir said he would prove that the factory hit by the American
missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as
Washington charged. ``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was
only used for pharmaceutical products like children's and
antimalarial medicines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said international companies that had provided equipment for
the plant, which opened two years ago, would back him up. He did
not name them.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said that bin Laden
had given key financial help for the plant, which was part of the
``Sudanese military-industrial complex.'' Bin Laden lived in the
Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited
international terrorists to train at camps here.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to leave in 1996, when the government decided that
he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly.
After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to win some
concessions from the Clinton administration, including economic
aid, but failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their case that the plant was a benign operation,
government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese
businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the factory, where most of the smoke was still
billowing, was off-limits to reporters Friday, and it was
impossible to tell what was made there. In the rubble at the front
of the compound, there were wrappers from a veterinary solution
made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade
name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever. Trays of small
empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered
about on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the
plant, said he had seen bright lights and then heard the swoosh of
missiles during the attack. At first, he said, he thought the
nearby power station had been struck. Then he thought a plane had
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader
of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more
than a decade, had finally struck the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, said the factory
employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30 kinds of drugs
for humans and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokesman said that 10 people wounded from the strike
were admitted to the wards. Four of them were in critical
condition, he said. The plant does not operate at night, and there
were apparently few workers around during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in
Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the
plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons. He said
another factory, in the suburb of Kafouri, also made chemical
weapons. He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have
gone from bad to worse in the nine years of fundamentalist rule.
But even so, ordinary people seemed to be bewildered why American
should aim cruise missiles here.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was
a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. ``Most people here,
even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular
factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he
believed that the Americans knew what they were doing. ``Bin Laden
has never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the
lawyer. ``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.'' &QL;

RANGERS FALL A FEW ACES SHY OF YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo: Tom Hicks
</P>
<P>
   Owner, Texas Rangers
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 22, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Tom:
</P>
<P>
   Saw your team of the future last night at The Ballpark in
Arlington. Funny thing: The guys were wearing navy blue and gray
with a white NY on the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding. Those were the Yankees, of course _ the team the
Rangers hope to be when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   The thought occurred during batting practice _ while attendants
were stocking the owners' bunker beneath the stands next to the
Rangers' dugout with pheasant under glass and an assortment of fine
imported wines for your pregame nibbling pleasure _ that there
really isn't all that much difference between George's team and
yours.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting those 25 games in the win column, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   But there is this one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Come closer, I don't want to spread this around.
</P>
<P>
   Keep this under your hat, but a little investigative journalism
has uncovered some highly interesting numbers and one indisputable
fact: You don't have a single starter on your team who could crack
the Yankees' rotation. Not one who could bump David Wells, Hideki
Irabu, Andy Pettite, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez or David Cone
from a single start.
</P>
<P>
   Check that. You might not have a starter on your team who could
crack the Yankees' ``top six,'' considering talented Ramiro Mendoza
is New York's sixth starter.
</P>
<P>
   This is not said to denigrate the fine seasons Rick Helling and
Aaron Sele have put together or how well Esteban Loaiza has pitched
since he was obtained from the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   But facts are facts.
</P>
<P>
   My mission last night was to discover what it is that spurred
this Yankees team to be this good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best team I ever saw?'' Yankees coach Don Zimmer said, sitting
in the visitors' dugout before last night's game. He shakes his
head. ``Best record I ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me if this team is as good as the '55
Dodgers, or the '55 Yankees or The Big Red Machine. My answer
hasn't changed. I don't compare teams. But a lot of goofy things
have happened this year. We've won games every way you can think
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Cerone, the former Yankees catcher who works for Fox out of
Baltimore, said this group of players came together as a team after
the big bench-clearing brawl with the Orioles in May.
</P>
<P>
   Others talk about team chemistry, how part-time players like
Darryl Strawberry, Tim Raines and Chad Curtis have accepted their
roles, how everybody in the lineup contributes, how everyone wants
to win.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, but like Mr. Robinson said to Benjamin in
``The Graduate,'' I've got one word for you, Tom, and it ain't
plastics:
</P>
<P>
   Pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single night,'' said your very own manager, Johnny
Oates, ``they have outstanding starting pitching. There are no 7.00
earned-run averages coming out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're barely half that. At game time last night,
Andy Pettite had the worst ERA among the Yanks' six starters at
3.73. The Rangers' best was Loaiza's at 3.79 and that covers just
six starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks' team ERA was 3.60, the Rangers' 5.07.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had given up 478 runs, the Rangers 688, a 210-run
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' Oates said, ``It's right there in the
numbers. Talent-wise, they outclass everybody else totally.''
</P>
<P>
   Way I see it, you've got two problems to solve.
</P>
<P>
   How do you beat the Yankees in a short series (like in the
playoffs)?
</P>
<P>
   How do you get to be more like them?
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy answer to either question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to beat them over a 162-game schedule, thank
goodness,'' Oates said. ``You just can't do that. But you can beat
them in a short series if you pitch well and play well. You don't
have to play a perfect game, but you can't give them extra outs
because they're sure not going to give you any with their pitching
and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   I know, it can be discouraging competing against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Your general manager, Doug Melvin, was talking about
off-season possibilities the other day and someone suggested the
Yankees might sign Mike Piazza. And let Bernie Williams go, Melvin
wondered?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the writer suggested, maybe they'll just sign them all.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin frowned. ``If they sign everybody,'' he said, ``I think
I'll just quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just kidding. I think.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Tommy boy, if you really wanted to, if you really set
your mind to it, you could out-George ol' Steinbrenner any day of
the week and twice on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to prove it any time you're ready.
</P>
<P>
   And keep the P-word word close to your heart:
</P>
<P>
   Pitching.
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between the Yankees and everybody else.
</P>

CLINTON LAWYER APPEALS RULING ON PRIVILEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning of a constitutional crisis, a lawyer for
President Clinton asked the Supreme Court on Friday to overturn a
lower court ruling that some of the president's legal advisers must
testify in the investigation of Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If such compelled testimony continues, Clinton's lawyer said,
the consequences could be terrible ``both for the institution of
the presidency and for the nation it serves.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Neil Eggleston, asked the High Court to reverse the
July 27 ruling by the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals that a blanket attorney-client privilege could not prevent
some government lawyers from being called to give evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist refused on Aug. 4 to block that
ruling from taking effect, forcing Eggleston to go to the full
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand now upon the brink of the most serious confrontation
between branches of government contemplated in our constitutional
order,'' Eggleston said in his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some White House lawyers have been subpoenaed by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, who is investigating whether
the president tried illegally to cover up his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Since Starr began looking into Clinton's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, various White House lawyers and other aides have sought
to avoid giving testimony, either on the grounds of executive
privilege or attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's conversations with the lawyers retained
to defend him remain protected, as they would be for any defendant,
the appeals court held, in effect, that a lawyer who happens to be
a government employee and White House adviser is not automatically
shielded from having to give testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rehnquist's refusal to intervene, at least two more White
House lawyers, Cheryl Mills and Lanny Breuer, have gone before the
grand jury. But Eggleston still has good reason to seek a reversal
of the appellate decision.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bruce Lindsey, who is acknowledged as one of
Clinton's closest confidants and has been at the center of the
president's battle over attorney-client privilege, is due to be
questioned again. Although Lindsey has testified several times
before the grand jury, he has declined to answer certain questions
because the administration says those areas should be protected.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Clinton admitted that he had an improper
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, his troubles are not over. Starr is
still pursuing his investigation into possible presidential
criminality. &QL;

COMPUTER SERVER MAKER IN `LIQUIDITY CRISIS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It has been a bad quarter for ChatCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this
week, the suburban Chatsworth-based maker of computer servers said
it is in a ``liquidity crisis.'' If debt obligations are not
renegotiated, ChatCom ``may be forced to file bankruptcy by some of
its creditors,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ChatCom reported a sharply higher net loss and a 79
percent sales drop in its most recent quarter, mainly due to
product returns from a distributor whose business was hurt by the
Asian crisis, and weaker-than-expected demand in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the company's bad news, ChatCom was delisted from
Nasdaq this week for not meeting minimum listing requirements. It
is now trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, a computerized exchange
with no minimum requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The distributor's product return amounted to ``a very big hit
for a company our size,'' said spokesman Jerry Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   Macon Holdings in Singapore returned $2.7 million worth of
products, of which $1.2 million worth had been resold.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to U.S. distributors also declined due to weaker demand
and cutbacks in advertising and sales efforts because of the
company's cash problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ChatCom reported a net loss of $1.13 million (10
cents a diluted share) on sales of $915,000 for the first quarter
of fiscal 1999, compared with a net loss of $585,000 (6 cents) and
sales of $4.459 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom shares dipped to 16 cents Friday, down $0.0275, or 14.67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company suffers from negative cash flow, causing it to
default on several loans, according to the SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom sold products at cost in the first quarter as its gross
margin shrank to 0 percent from 36 percent, according to the
regulatory filing.
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom has suffered from three fiscal years of operating
losses. It has laid off workers over the past year, shrinking from
90 employees to 35 today.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company reached an agreement in principle with
a supplier, Vermont Research Products Inc., and High View Capital,
a shareholder and creditor, to sell them its BrightStar technology
in exchange for a relief package worth $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The package comprises $400,000 in cash and the cancellation of
trade debt, convertible notes, preferred stock and warrants held by
the two buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ChatCom will license back the technology. The company also
stands to borrow up to $300,000 from ALCO Financial Services if it
meets certain conditions.

HONG KONG TALK RADIO HOST RECOVERING FROM BRUTAL ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ On any given morning here, you could turn on the
radio and hear Albert Cheng lay into Beijing, the Hong Kong
government, the Hang Seng stock index, politicians, property
tycoons, lawyers, newspaper editors _ in short, anything that
matters in this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, two unidentified men attacked Cheng with
carving knives as he arrived at work, inflicting deep slashing
wounds on his arms, back and right leg that required six hours of
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng will survive. But in a city where talk radio has become a
vital form of public expression, the brutal assault on its most
famous practitioner has left people reeling. Doctors said Cheng may
no longer be able to wield chopsticks. Listeners fear he may no
longer wield his sharp tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a threat to people who want to be outspoken,''
said Emily Lau, a member of the Legislative Council and herself a
vocal critic of both Beijing and the Hong Kong government. ``People
may say, `Why should I bother?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng's radio program, ``Teacup in a Storm,'' is far and away
the top-rated morning show in Hong Kong. It has become a potent
outlet for the territory's 6.5 million people to sound off about
issues ranging from the Asian financial crisis to Hong Kong's
handover to Chinese rule last year. And it turned the 52-year-old
Cheng into one of the most influential, and controversial, figures
in town.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Friday they did not have a motive for the assault,
which occurred at 6:40 a.m. Wednesday, as Cheng was striding into
the studios of his station, Commercial Radio, in Kowloon. Police
inspectors said they were studying tapes of Cheng's last 40 radio
broadcasts to see if he had made remarks about people or groups
that might have been deemed offensive.
</P>
<P>
   If being offended by Cheng was a sufficient motive to attack
him, most of official Hong Kong would fall under suspicion. In a
raspy voice and style that he himself describes as ``sarcastic,''
Cheng regularly hurls insults at Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung
Chee-hwa, and many of his top advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Of Tung, who was appointed by Beijing, he once said: ``We don't
even know where this guy came from. He is so conservative. He's
from outer space and out of time. Where'd they find him? People
look to him to speak up for Hong Kong. Now people know he's only a
mouthpiece for China.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng also has a television program, ``Hong Kong Affairs.'' And
when the Hong Kong secretary for education and manpower, Joseph
Wong, declined to appear on it, Cheng flayed him so mercilessly on
the program that the ATV broadcasting company apologized. Cheng
then publicly repudiated the apology, saying he had meant to insult
Wong.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheng has taken his strongest stands against China. Before
the handover, he warned that Hong Kong could become a larger
version of Singapore, a prosperous but politically repressive city.
After the handover, Cheng seized on any hint that Beijing was
eroding civil liberties in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, he waded into a dispute about whether Tung had
attempted to muzzle the government-owned broadcaster, Radio
Television Hong Kong, at the behest of China. ``Beijing has a
problem with talk show hosts,'' he said at the time. ``They think
we're out of control, out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheng feared he would be yanked off the air after the
handover, he has continued to broadcast without interference. Even
now, some local journalists are playing down the assumption that
Cheng was attacked because of his strong views. They note Cheng
also had a colorful business career in which he published the first
Chinese-language edition of Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the motives behind this crime,'' said Kin-ming
Liu, the chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. ``We
may never know.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the two most notorious attacks on Hong Kong journalists
in recent years remain unsolved. Leung Tin-wai, a magazine
publisher, had his left forearm chopped off with a meat cleaver by
two men outside his office in May 1996. Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong
media magnate known for his criticism of China, was robbed in his
home by knife-wielding intruders in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Given the striking similarity between this week's attack and
that on Leung two years ago, Cheng's co-host, Peter Lam, believes
this is hardly a case of a business deal gone sour. ``Albert thinks
there is a high degree of probability that it was related to
remarks he made on the air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng would not be the first radio personality victimized for
his on-air vitriol. In 1984, an outspoken Denver radio talk show
host, Alan Berg, was gunned down outside his house with a machine
pistol. Berg, who was Jewish, spoke bluntly about what he saw as
pervasive anti-Semitism. Two members of a neo-Nazi gang were later
convicted of murder in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lam, he seems to be carrying on Cheng's take-no-prisoners
style. On the radio Friday morning, he excoriated a hospital for
inadvertently pumping contaminated fluid into the bloodstream of
six patients, killing three of them. Lam said he had no plans to
soften his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any doubts about how I was doing this job, I would
leave it,'' he said. &QL;

IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT EXPANDS DVD HOLDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Image Entertainment, seeking a major Internet
presence, agreed to buy the DVD and laserdisc division of retailer
Ken Crane Home Entertainment for $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Image, which remains the nation's largest laserdisc distributor
as it scrambles to boost its DVD operations, said Friday it chose
to buy Crane's business after exploring a variety of options for
moving onto the Web. Crane said its site, www.kencranes.com, is the
Internet's largest retailer of DVDs and laserdiscs with $15 million
in sales over the past 12 months and 3 million to 4 million hits
per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Image recognized the enormous growth opportunity represented
by electronic commerce,'' said Martin Greenwald, president and
chief executive officer, in a statement. ``This acquisition
solidifies Image as the leading independent DVD and laserdisc
distributor.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement noted that Adams Media Research has forecast
Internet sales of home video items, including DVD and laserdisc, to
reach $2.5 billion by 2003. The International Recording Media
Association recently said there will be 8.6 million DVD players in
U.S. homes in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Image, which has annual sales of more than $50 million, will pay
a combination of cash, stock and debt assumption for the business.
The deal, expected to close within a month, will add 55 Ken Crane
employees to the staff of the suburban Chatsworth-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this will do essentially is cut out the middleman on
orders from the Ken Crane site,'' Image spokesman Mark Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Image has seen the value of its stock nearly triple this year as
it switches its focus to DVD, which accounted for 38 percent of its
second-quarter sales. The issue traded in a wide range Friday, from
$7.50 to $9.125, and closed down $1.1875 at $7.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs, or digital versatile discs, are the same size as compact
discs with seven times the capacity. They play full-length movies
with digital clarity and six-channel sound and offer massive
amounts of background information.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ken Crane, the deal will enable the suburban
Hawthorne-based retailer to focus on its specialty of selling home
theater systems and large-screen TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cash infusion will help fund our continued expansion and
store remodeling to prepare for the arrival of high-definition
TV,'' said Ken Crane Sr., president of the chain.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 23, will move Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-REVIEW _ The images and the rhetoric last week were
those of a fast-spreading war. In the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea,
Tomahawk cruise missiles roared from the decks of American
warships, bound for targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, where they
smashed into what U.S. officials describe as a terrorist training
center and a chemical-weapons plant. In Washington, some of
President Clinton's harshest congressional critics put aside
partisanship and saluted the nation's scandal-burdened leader for
responding to terrorism with military strikes. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-POLITICS-REVIEW _ Things are so unsettled that politicians
in both parties last week found themselves, simultaneously,
condemning Bill Clinton, offering solace _ and keeping their mouths
shut. While the uproar over sex at the White House has eclipsed the
elections that are only 72 days away, the Lewinsky saga could have
a tremendous influence on how they play out, not only in November
but in 2000 and beyond. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   SOVEREIGNTY-REVIEW _ If diplomats are sent abroad to lie for
their countries, sometimes their greatest contribution to peace can
be to sell creative, convenient and competing fictions to both
sides in a civil war. As Chechnya went, so, perhaps, can go Kosovo.
In both places the ideals of absolute sovereignty and
self-determination are being bent days to make way for the notion
that peace is more complicated than either of those ideals permits.
By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-RELIGION-REVIEW _ In southern Nigeria, which is mainly
Christian, religious bumper stickers abound. ``Be a sweatless
winner,'' says one. ``Work with us at the Living Faith Church.''
Another advises that ``Jesus Christ gives, heals and delivers.'' Or
there is this simple admonition: ``Be careful, God is watching.''
The exhortations can be hard to read through the black exhaust
fumes that belch from Nigeria's crumbling fleet of vehicles, but
there is no mistaking the religious fervor that has gripped the
southern half of Africa's giant as misery has grown. By Roger
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   POLS-APOLOGY-REVIEW _ Never admit fault or apologize after a car
accident, especially if you caused it. That is the standard warning
of a personal injury lawyer, but unnecessary advice for
politicians. Most would rather be flayed than express actual
contrition for a mistake, especially if they have to use those two
unthinkable words, I'm sorry. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   MANHUNT-REVIEW _ For much of the summer, hundreds of searchers
dressed in camouflage and armed with tracking devices that detect
the slightest motion of warm-blooded bipeds have been scouring the
woods of North Carolina and the slick-rock canyons of Utah looking
for three of the nation's most-wanted fugitives. They have used
helicopters, night-vision scopes, heat sensors, motion detectors,
smoke bombs, armored personnel carriers, small planes and radios
with encrypted transmissions _ all for naught. The technology may
be James Bondian. But what the searchers really need, says one
frustrated sheriff, is a snitch and a good bloodhound. By Timothy
Egan.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-RUBLE-REVIEW _ As Russia's woes of the past week have
illustrated, the new buzzwords of international diplomacy are
devaluation, currency speculation and debt moratorium _ terminology
just as opaque and loaded with free-floating dread as anything in
the cold war lexicon. By week's end, not only were Russian
lawmakers calling for the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin,
but the world's financial markets were being pummeled, largely
because of fears set in motion by the decision of Yeltsin's
government to devalue the ruble. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   HYPOCRISY-REVIEW _ President Clinton has always been a
politician who plays by his own rules: Never give people more
information than they know, never use active words when passive
words will do, accept responsibility but place blame elsewhere,
excuse yourself within any admission. So people who abide by the
more conventional rules of required hypocrisy when they deal with
him almost always get burned. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMALS-USE-REVIEW _ Is there really any hard logic to which
animals Americans exempt from consumption, and which ones they
exploit? Is the triage of concern for different breeds _ whether
they are eaten, used in experiments or simply eliminated as pests _
a matter of sense or sentimentality? By Frank Bruni.
</P>

JUSTICE DELAYED BUT NOT DENIED: EX-KKK CHIEF CONVICTED IN '66
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to clarify day)  (bl) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Vernon Dahmer Jr. covered his face and wept
into his hands. His brother, Dennis, gently pounded a railing in
the old courthouse balcony. And their mother, the elderly Ellie
Dahmer, shut her eyes and steepled her fingers, thanking God for
the jury's verdict that, almost 33 years after the crime, found an
old, stooped klansman guilty of ordering her husband killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a jury of six blacks, five whites and one Asian
convicted Samuel Bowers, a former Imperial Wizard of the
Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, of murder in the
Jan. 10, 1966, firebombing that killed Vernon Dahmer Sr., who had
been marked for death because he helped register blacks to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard McKenzie immediately sentenced Bowers, 73, to life
in prison, and slammed down his gavel to close the courtroom as an
old black woman in the back row of the courtroom clapped her hands,
twice, in a celebration that has been on hold for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than justice for the Dahmer family, who have been
frustrated after after four previous trials _ including two state
murder trials in the 1960s _ let Bowers stroll free after all-white
juries deadlocked. The verdict proved, said Vernon Dahmer Jr., that
the society his father died to help create is alive here in
south-central Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my dad's life was about,'' he said, motioning to
the jury box that had seated a racially diverse cross-section of
the community, not an all-white, all-male jury from which blacks
were traditionally denied justice.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer Sr., a respected storekeeper, farmer and local official
with the NAACP, was singled out by the Klan because he allowed his
store to be used as a place for blacks to pay the $2 poll tax that
was required for voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Juries were selected from voting lists, and the Klan did
everything in its power, from cross burnings to whippings, from
church burnings to murder, to thwart the power that a vote can
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Klan members knew, Dahmer Jr. said, that their world could only
exist if blacks could be held back from using their numbers to
elect change, could fill jury boxes and public offices with people
of varying color.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working to make sure this day would come,'' said Dahmer
Jr. of his father. ``This,'' he said of the diverse jury,
``represents America. This represents our community. The system has
now worked for us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As one of the younger members of the Dahmer family, a man in his
late teens or early twenties, moved through the crowded courtroom,
an older white man gripped his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw history here, son,'' the older man said.
</P>
<P>
   The case was history-making, for several reasons. While it was
only the second high-profile case in the past few years in which a
white supremacist was convicted of killing a civil rights leader _
Byron De La Beckwith was convicted in 1994 in Jackson, Miss., of
the 1963 murder of Medgar Evers _ this case was different.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith, a onetime salesman who had been a virtual nobody in
the ranks of white supremacists, murdered a nationally recognized
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer had not been nationally known, just a merchant and farmer
in Forrest County, outside Hattiesburg. But Bowers, a businessman
in Laurel, Miss., was a powerful Klan figure _ the only klansman
who had the authority to order a man's death, former Klan members
testified in the trial this week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who have been convicted in civil
rights-related killings have been foot soldiers, the ones who
actually threw the bombs, not the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, whose organization was tied to church burnings, murders
and other terrorism throughout the 1960s, has served only six years
_ for his role in the infamous Neshoba County murders of Andrew
Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney. That was a federal
conviction. No Mississippi jury, Bowers once bragged to another
klansman, would convict a white man of killing a black man in the
state of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, who had shown little emotion during the trial and showed
none at the verdict, answered no when the judge asked him if he had
anything to say before sentencing. But when his defense lawyer,
Travis Buckley, asked the judge to poll the jury, Bowers turned to
stare at them, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Once, that look might have struck fear in people who lived at
the mercy of Klan nightriders, but now it was just an old man
watching time catch up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the jury came out, he started emptying his pockets,
took off his watch in anticipation of what was going to happen,''
said Forrest County District Attorney Lindsay Carter. Prisoners are
not allowed to take such things insider Parchman Prison, where he
will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew what was coming,'' said Carter.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1965-66, Jones County, north of Hattiesburg,
was regarded as one of the meanest in Mississippi for Klan
activity. It was where Bowers made his base.
</P>
<P>
   In a farmhouse just to the south, outside Hattiesburg in Forest
County, Bowers summoned Klan members there in the months before
Dahmer's murder and asked them why ``something hadn't been done''
about Dahmer, former klansmen testified. Bowers planned Dahmer's
death, and on a cold January night, sent two carloads of Klansmen
south with 12 gallons of gasoline and shotguns. One way or the
other, Vernon Dahmer Sr. would be a dead man.
</P>
<P>
   The men hurled the gallons of gasoline into the house, where
Dahmer Sr., his wife and three of his children slept.
</P>
<P>
   He was burned so badly that the skin came loose from his arms,
but while his body was in flames, he fired his shotgun over and
over at the shapes darting through his yard, giving his wife and
children time to escape through the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   A former klansman turned government informant who took part in
that raid, Billy Roy Pitts, testified in this trial that he heard a
man ``cry out in distress'' from inside the burning house.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Robert Helfrich, the prosecutor who
handled the case, evoked that image for the jury. ``A man's voice
in distress,'' said Helfrich. ``And yes, he was a man. A man's
voice is still in distress, because Sam Bowers is still walking the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice delayed,'' he added, ``is not justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer was still standing that night as the Klansmen, so
surprised at the fury of his reaction to their attack that they
shot out the headlights of one of their own cars in confusion,
rumbled away. But his lungs were so badly seared by the flames that
he died in a hospital bed 12 hours later, in his wife's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tears that I am shedding, I am shedding for Vernon,''
said Mrs. Dahmer, standing later in the hot sun outside the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter, Bettie, 10 years old at the time of her father's
murder, was handed out a window of the house from her father to her
mother, and was already burned on her arms and forehead. After the
verdict she said she was not able to talk, and stood with tears in
her eyes as her brothers thanked prosecutors for bring Bowers back
to court.
</P>
<P>
   Citing new evidence, and under renewed pressure by the Dahmer
family and others to reopen the case, prosecutors here _ backed by
state Attorney General Mike Moore _ dusted off an old indictment of
Bowers and two other klansmen, Deavours Nix and Charles Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Nix testified from a wheelchair for a variety of health
problems, although a Jackson newspaper photographer had snapped his
picture playing golf a few months ago. Nix testified as a defense
witness Thursday that he had never heard Bowers use a racial slur,
let alone order a killing, and that the Klan was not a violent
organization. He said he joined because he had heard the Klan was a
benevolent organization that passed out fruit baskets to the poor
at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nix is charged with arson and Noble with murder and arson in the
Dahmer case. They are expected to go to trial later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dahmer family said they did not want to worry about that
now. They would celebrate this victory, quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts had testified earlier that Bowers' lawyer, Travis Buckley,
once attended Klan meetings himself. Friday, Buckley's efforts to
portray a government conspiracy against Bowers fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client was sacrificed to the Moore's political
ambitions and compared his client's prosecution to Hitler's
persecution of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley's witnesses did little to refute a parade of other
witnesses who painted a more ominous picture of Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses Thursday had testified that they saw a jubilant
Bowers boast about the killing days after it. ``Look at what my
boys did to that Dahmer'' Bowers had said, testified former
klansman Robert Earl Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, he said, was holding up a newspaper at the time, with
the story of Dahmer's death on the page. &QL;

EDITORIAL: TAKING ON THE TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has launched a battle against terrorism that
promises to take the United States into unfamiliar intelligence,
military and diplomatic terrain. It is important at the outset that
the White House and the American people understand the risks
involved and set limits on the actions that may be taken. The
opportunity to combat terrorism must be pursued aggressively, but
the difficulties and dangers should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   It has been hard enough to combat state-sponsored terrorism by
countries like Iraq, Iran and Libya. At least in such cases
Washington could deal with governing authorities that might respond
to diplomatic and economic pressure. Foreign military and
intelligence services also provide fixed, non-civilian targets for
military attack, if the use of force is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years terrorism has mutated, and the greater
threat to America today may come from shadowy, independent groups
that operate across national boundaries and melt into the chaotic
societies where they find recruits and sanctuary. It is exceedingly
difficult to track and to attack freelance organizations like the
one Washington considers responsible for the embassy bombings in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Spy satellites and other electronic intelligence systems can
provide information about the location and activities of these
groups, but machines cannot replace the use of skilled field
operatives able to develop informers inside terrorist cells. The
CIA needs to expand its network of agents, but to do so under
guidelines designed to avoid past abuses.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan
demonstrated, moving against terrorist groups may require
potentially provocative military actions that violate the
sovereignty of other countries, threaten civilian populations and
intensify anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine of self-defense invoked by the Clinton
administration is valid when U.S. citizens and embassies have been
attacked or face assault. But the use of force should be
commensurate with the threat and designed to limit civilian
casualties. That appears to have been the case in Sudan and
Afghanistan, but the Pentagon still owes the public a more detailed
account of the missile attacks and their consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to authorize the assassination of terrorists will
grow over time. It must be resisted, not only because it is
inconsistent with American values but because it would invite a
parallel effort against American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Military action alone can punish and temporarily disrupt
terrorist groups, but not destroy them. The terrorist organization
of Osama bin Laden, the target of the U.S. missile attacks, is
dispersed throughout the Middle East. It is financed by bin Laden,
a Saudi multimillionaire who seems dedicated to killing Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To weaken the network, Washington should go after bin Laden's
money by tracing his accounts and seeking the help of foreign
governments and banks to freeze them. Saudi Arabia could be
particularly helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there is no substitute for improved physical
security at embassies, airports and other potential targets. The
White House and Congress ought to look at security in terms of a
protracted struggle against terrorism, not a quick fix thrown
together after the latest truck bombing. A significant increase in
spending is necessary. The United States is engaged in a long,
nasty alley fight with opponents who see no distinction between
combatants and civilians. Washington will have to be resourceful
and resolute, but it has the power to prevail without abandoning
its principles.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, in courtrooms coast to coast, the
benchmark of human identity has gradually shifted to the DNA
standard, the molecular dog tag inherent in even our most
fragmentary bodily bits. Where genetic material _ that laconic term
_ survives, other proofs of identity are essentially immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a case like the daguerreotype, soon to be
auctioned by Christie's, which may or may not depict Abraham
Lincoln, circa 1843, as a young Illinois state legislator? If it is
Lincoln, the portrait could be worth a great deal of money, because
it would be the earliest portrait of him known to exist. If it is
some less illustrious young man, the portrait would have, as they
say, only antiquarian interest.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists cannot pluck a hair from this portrait-sitter's head
or take a swab from the inside of his cheek. All they can do is
analyze, in various clever ways, the resemblance between confirmed
portraits of Abraham Lincoln and this man with the pale forehead
and the tanned lower face, attributes every frontiersman would have
shared.
</P>
<P>
   The sitter's features have been measured and morphed and
mathematicized, and the pattern of the veins in his hand has been
plotted against the veins that show in genuine Lincoln portraits.
</P>
<P>
   But what it all comes down to is doing by other means one of the
things that humans, for evolutionary reasons, happen to do
exceptionally well even without scientific tools: recognizing
faces. Suffice it to say that this portrait would never have been
so rigorously tested if the judgment of the common-sensical eye
were unequivocal, if this distant visage announced unmistakably
that it was Lincoln's own.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the portrait-sitter's mouth argues on behalf of Lincoln,
and perhaps the nose argues against, unless you take into account
the fact that deeply tanned noses set against pale foreheads often
look more pronounced. The eyes themselves seem watery, unfocused,
as if the sitter could not keep them still in the studio. But
humans do not, as a rule, decipher faces feature by feature, except
when looking at infants. Recognition is deeply intuitive, a kind of
eclat that almost defies analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed a face only a mother could love. But when it
comes to being Lincoln, it may also be a face that only a computer
could recognize.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Managed care will inevitably become the subject of more and more
litigation as millions of Americans come to live under its rules. A
recent ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that
Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in health maintenance organizations
have a constitutional right to due process when they are denied
services by the plans.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling affirmed an earlier decision by a U.S. District Court
in Arizona. That court declared that patients must be given prompt
notification when a benefit has been denied, a full explanation for
why the benefit was denied, a clear avenue of appeal and other
procedures designed to protect their right to due process. The
lawsuit was filed on behalf of the nearly 6 million Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. Those numbers are
growing rapidly, and could reach 12 million, or roughly 30 percent
of all Medicare recipients, by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court essentially found that Medicare benefit
decisions made by HMOs, which are paid by the government to provide
the coverage, amount to government action. In the field of health
care, at least, the courts are finding that managed care
organizations through which public benefits are distributed must
now meet constitutional requirements that few considered before.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians can do more to help their country solve one of its
most perilous radioactive waste problems than Alexander Nikitin.
Nikitin was an engineer on a nuclear submarine in the Soviet
Union's Northern Fleet and a nuclear safety inspector in the
Soviet, and then the Russian, defense ministry. Later, he raised
public alarms over nuclear waste left in the Arctic by submarine
accidents and haphazard disposal of spent reactor cores.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of listening to Nikitin's recommendations, Russia is
prosecuting him for high treason and disclosure of state secrets.
Amnesty International considers him its first major Russian
prisoner of conscience case since Andrei Sakharov. His trial is
likely to begin next month, underscoring the risks that
environmental activists face in a Russia whose security service and
justice system can still be twisted against dissidents,
Soviet-style.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin works for the Bellona Foundation, an environmental group
with offices in Norway and Russia. He was arrested in 1996 after
contributing to a Bellona book on the Northern Fleet's radioactive
waste. He was jailed for 10 months, and has been confined to St.
Petersburg for the past two years. While the group was researching
its report, the Russian FSB _ the KGB's successor _ raided its
Murmansk office and confiscated all its materials. But Bellona was
able to reconstruct its research from open sources, which bolsters
its credible claim that it revealed no secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Nikitin cites classified decrees that are
still kept from his lawyer, which violates the Russian constitution
and hinders his defense. At least one was issued after Nikitin's
arrest. He will be tried in secret by a judge and two laymen, who
will be chosen by the FSB. The U.S. State Department says that the
facts of the case suggest his detention was politically motivated.
Vice President Al Gore has taken up Nikitin's cause in meetings
with Russian leaders, but has not raised the matter in public.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Nikitin has paralyzed Russia's few environmental
groups, which fear that the use of even public sources about
sensitive issues or affiliations with Western groups could open
them to treason charges. The nuclear and environmental disasters
that the Soviet Union inflicted on itself pose dangers that need to
be cleaned up and removed. Nikitin is not an enemy, but an ally in
that struggle.

ROBERT WARREN, 72, WISCONSIN FEDERAL JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., N.M.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Willis Warren, a senior federal judge in Wisconsin who
caused a national uproar in 1979 when he reluctantly became the
first federal judge ever to sign a prior-restraint order against a
magazine, died on Thursday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee. He
was 72 and lived in Mequon, a Milwaukee suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Wisconsin, to which President Richard Nixon had
nominated Warren in 1974 in what turned out to be one of his final
official acts before leaving the White House after his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the judge's order was The Progressive, a left-wing
magazine in Madison, Wis., which had scheduled an article by a
freelance writer, Howard Morland, titled ``The H-Bomb Secret: How
We Got It, Why We're Telling It.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government contended that the article told ``how a
hydrogen bomb works,'' and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger
asserted that publication ``would irreparably impair the national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive then accused the Department of Justice of making
a ``sweeping attack on the First Amendment rights of the American
people.'' It also rejected an out-of-court compromise suggested by
Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle, the judge ruled that the rights guaranteed
by the First Amendment were ``not absolute and unlimited'' and
forbade publication until the courts could sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a task he relished. ``Such notoriety is not to be
sought,'' Warren said in court. Predicably, his action prompted a
furor that allied civil libertarians, publishers and editorial
writers.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court set aside Warren's injunction several months
later, and The Progressive published the article. The appeals panel
then halted all further litigation in the case but kept some
documents under seal, an action the American Civil Liberties Union
vainly protested.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Raton, N.M., Robert Warren graduated from Macalaster
College in St. Paul, Minn., and earned a master's degree at the
University of Minnesota. He graduated from the University of
Wisconsin Law School in 1956 and went into private practice in
Elkhorn and Green Bay. He became an assistant district attorney in
1958.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, he served as a state senator and assistant
majority leader in the 1960s and as Wisconsin's attorney general
from 1969 until he joined the court.
</P>
<P>
   He took senior status and a reduced work load in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is survived by his wife of 50 years, Laverne Voagen
Warren; three daughters, Cheryl Sensenbrenner, Treva Livesey and
Tara Warren; three sons, Iver, Gregg and Lyle; a brother, David;
seven sisters, Dorothy Olson, Bonnie Conditt, Betty Moede, Marylin
Blackmon, Jean Miller, Robin Cooprider and Lynda Warren, and 12
grandchildren.

ICE CREAM TRUCK SOLD POPSICLES AND DRUGS, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite its merry tunes and brightly colored
exterior, an ice cream truck that plied the streets of Bensonhurst
was not your typical dispenser of summertime treats for the boys
and girls of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the truck was known to chase after children on
bikes, according to a neighborhood resident. For another, there
were often three or four teen-agers inside, more than was needed to
dole out ice cream cones and Popsicles.
</P>
<P>
   All this may have made the truck just another neighborhood
oddity, were it not for the other things it sold: bags of hashish
and marijuana along with the Batman bars and Rocket pops, according
to investigators. And on Thursday, police said they had arrested
seven people on charges of either buying or selling drugs from the
ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was full service: ice cream, bonbons and weed,'' said Sgt.
Richard Miller, who led a sting operation that finally put the
truck out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly isn't the usual in Bensonhurst,'' he added,
``at least not out of an ice cream truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they got wind of the drug truck when undercover
officers tried to make a purchase from some dealers at Satellite
Park two weeks ago. The dealers said they were out of stock, and
suggested that the buyers instead wait for ``the good humor man.''
</P>
<P>
   When the truck failed to show, police went searching, finally
catching up with it at Seth Low Park around 6:15 p.m. Thursday.
Among the seven people arrested were the truck's driver, Alexey
Zagrebin, 20, and his helper, James LaPointe, 19.
</P>
<P>
   The five others happened to be in line to buy drugs at the truck
with the undercover officers. Two 17-year-old boys in front of the
officers bought two $10 bags of hash, then resold them to three
15-year-old boys waiting on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was an age requirement or what,'' Miller
said, chuckling. ``They just wouldn't sell to the 15-year-olds. But
when our officers got up, they had no problem selling to them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police said that Zagrebin, LaPointe and the two 17-year-old boys
have been charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance,
which carries a prison term or juvenile-detention term of no more
than six years. They said the three 15-year-old buyers were charged
with criminal possession of a controlled substance, which carries a
term in juvenile detention of not more than one year.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they seized six $10 bags of marijuana and 12 similar
bags of hash from the truck at the time of the raid. Authorities
said Zagrebin told the police that his mother had bought the truck
for him in hopes that he would get a job.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, Zagrebin and LaPointe traveled a daily
route around the neighborhood schools and three local parks just in
time for children to be getting out of class. And for four months,
they were making good money at their trade, Miller added, noting
that Zagrebin ``claimed to be making only $200 a day on ice cream,
while getting $300 a day for drugs.''

Comets try to beat 
odds against Sting
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perrot hopes to start in playoff opener
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ A recurring theme for the Comets has become
annoying for coach Van Chancellor. But with the defending WNBA
champions about to open a best-of-three semifinal series against
Charlotte at 3 p.m. today, Chancellor might be asked about the
Comets' dominance of the Sting a few times over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting and Comets have met 10 times, including exhibitions
and playoffs. The Sting has won only once.
</P>
<P>
   But each of the past three wins, all this season, has been by a
diminishing margin, concluding with a 70-67 victory at Compaq
Center on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord,'' Chancellor said Friday, ``I believe in omens. Is there
any way in the world we could quit mentioning that we've won nine
out of 10? Because they're going to read the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't look forward to playing them, because they have
so many weapons. They run everybody in the world out there.
Sometimes, I just worry that the law of averages is going to catch
up with us. But if we can get (point guard Kim) Perrot well, we'll
take our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger than the question of how long the Comets (27-3) can
beat the odds against the Sting (18-12) is whether they can survive
in the playoffs with Perrot operating on a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a struggle,'' Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Cynthia Cooper: ``I think we can win without her. It would
be so much tougher without her. I can't even imagine playing
without Kim. She's just been an integral part of our team all
season long, even last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been the rock on our team, unwavering. She's always been
there for us defensively, offensively. So right now, I'm imagining
Kim out there on the floor at point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, who sprained her ankle in the second half of the Comets'
80-71 win over Los Angeles in the season finale Wednesday night,
might see only limited duty today.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, the quarterback of the offense and the spark plug on
defense, has made progress in her rehabilitation. She was walking
normally when the Comets worked out Friday at the Sting's practice
facility. But her availability remains a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The straightaway is going to be OK,'' Perrot said. ``But to
get down and play defense, the thing that scares me the most is
that I'm not going to be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot said she will start, but a determination as to how much
she can play will be made after the first five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a healthy Perrot, it has become more difficult for the
Comets to maintain their dominance over the Sting.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets and Sting first met last season at Rice's Autry Court
in an exhibition that helped christen the WNBA. They faced off a
second time in the preseason, then as members of the Eastern
Conference squared off four times during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets won five of those games by an average margin of 12.
The Comets' only loss came Aug. 16, 1997, at the Charlotte Coliseum
when Andrea Stinson scored 19 first-half points to spirit the Sting
to an 80-71 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After disposing of the Sting 77-69 on Aug. 19 at Compaq Center,
the Comets lost their final two games of the regular season, then
faced the Sting again in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Although starting center Wanda Guyton suffered a concussion in
the second half and was knocked out of the championship round, the
Comets beat the Sting 70-54 and went on to defeat New York 65-51 to
claim the inaugural WNBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Comets and Charlotte are geared for meeting No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, the four top players for the Sting _ Stinson, power
forward Vicky Bullett, rookie small forward Tracy Reid and center
Rhonda Mapp _ have been compared to the Comets' Big Three _ Cooper,
Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Cooper relishes facing Charlotte. She expects a
war throughout the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a tough team,'' Cooper said, while downplaying the
significance of the 10 games. ``I don't think there's a danger in
(having met 10 times previously). We understand this is the
playoffs. We understand the importance of winning the first game
and how tough Charlotte really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking them lightly. Every single time we've played
them, they've been a tough team. They have certain strengths that
happen to be our weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper cited the Sting's rebounding superiority and the need for
the Comets to play 40 minutes of intense defense if they are to
win.
</P>
<P>
   If the Comets must defend without Perrot, Cooper said it will be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is definitely a concern of mine, of the team's and, I'm
sure, of the coaching staff,'' she said. ``But she'll be over on
the bench, and from there she can motivate us in a lot of different
ways. She'll be with us in spirit, and hopefully physically,
also.''

 SELLER OF BASEBALLS FROM PERFECT GAME SAYS LETTER IS FAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a bizarre twist to the sale of baseballs
supposedly used in David Wells' perfect game, the man who sold the
balls to a Long Island memorabilia dealer said Friday that he, and
not the American League umpire Al Clark, wrote and signed the
letter authenticating the Yankee pitcher's signature on the balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told people at major-league baseball when this first started
that Al had nothing to do with this, but nobody wanted to believe
that,'' said Rich Gressle, who said he owns a delivery service in
Essex County, N.J. ``Al Clark did not write the letter. I wrote
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gressle said he got six balls directly from Wells about a week
after the pitcher threw the perfect game against the Minnesota
Twins, but he said he could not be certain the balls were used in
the May 17 game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials are investigating the sale of the balls to
Mark Lewis, a dealer in Centereach, N.Y. Lewis has said he bought
six balls for $300 each and sold four of them for $1,000 each
before requesting their return after baseball initiated its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The letter that was signed by Clark and authenticated Wells'
signature said that Clark, who did not work the Wells game,
obtained the balls from John Hirschbeck, who was the game's
first-base umpire. Hirschbeck denied on Thursday that he had any
involvement with the balls, and on Friday a baseball official said
that investigators had found nothing to implicate him.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the official said, Hirschbeck has been irate that
Clark used his name. But Gressle said it was he, and not Clark, who
used Hirschbeck's name. Gressle, attributing his actions to
stupidity and greed, said in a telephone interview Friday: ``I made
up the letter and traced over Al's signature from something I had
here and gave it to Mark. This is all my fault. It's nobody else's
fault. I did it. Al Clark had nothing to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Clark, who is on vacation, through the league
office have been unsuccessful. Richie Phillips, the lawyer for the
umpires' union, said he did not know where Clark was but added that
he had spoken to him earlier. ``Clark denies dealing through any
middleman,'' Phillips said by telephone from Stone Harbor, N.J.
``He denies trafficking in those baseballs in any respect and
denies guaranteeing their authenticity. He denies any
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gressle said he has known Clark for about 10 years, having met
him through a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the Long Island dealer, said he had bought memorabilia on
several occasions from Gressle, including items from the 1995 game
in which Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive
games played. Clark was the third-base umpire in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood the balls came from Clark and other umpires,''
Lewis said in a telephone interview, speaking generally of the
memorabilia, ``but the majority from Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no knowledge that the Wells balls came from Clark
but believed Clark's signature looked the same as the Clark
signature he had on letters on American League stationery. Gressle
said he got the balls from Wells at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with David Wells the week after his perfect game,''
Gressle said. ``He wanted some photographs from me. He signed those
six baseballs that were already rubbed up and used in games. I
don't know what games. They came out of a big bag that balls go in.
He also signed some ticket stubs and a couple of photos, and that
was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gressle said Wells signed each ball and added the date and the
initials ``PG'' _ for perfect game. Wells has declined to discuss
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gressle said he could understand why people might be skeptical
about his explanation of what happened with the balls and the
letter. But he added: ``Am I taking the fall for somebody? No, I'm
not taking the fall for anybody. I did what I did. I admitted I did
it. I told people at major-league baseball I did it, and they don't
want to believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials declined to comment on Gressle's story or any
aspect of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought he could face criminal charges based on what
he says is a fake letter, Gressle, 38, said: ``I would imagine
something could come of this. I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm
trying to make the situation right. This was just something stupid
I did. It was probably a greedy thing more than anything else. It
was a chance to make what I thought was quick, easy money, and all
that it's done is given me and my family a problem. All I can say
is I'm sorry. I've told Al that a thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, without passing judgment on Clark or any other umpire,
said he felt the ``sale of memorabilia, especially for profit, is
absolutely disgusting.'' He said that was his view and also the
view of the umpires' association.

 McGWIRE USES SUBSTANCE BANNED IN SOME SPORTS  
(lb) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his pursuit of Roger Maris' home-run record, Mark McGwire has
become a folk hero, with testaments to his popularity unfolding
daily. Beginning Saturday in Pittsburgh, the Pirates will play host
to the St. Louis slugger in the first back-to-back regular-season
sellouts in Three Rivers Stadium's 27-year history.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no wonder that the man of the moment has been drawn
into a debate of the time. McGwire acknowledges he uses a
nutritional supplement that is legal in baseball but has been
banned by the National Football League and the International
Olympic Committee because it is thought to provide an unfair
advantage. It is a supplement that many doctors say they believe is
potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The testosterone-producing pill is called androstenedione and is
intended to raise levels of the male hormone, which builds lean
muscle mass and promotes recovery from injury. It is sold over the
counter, and McGwire says he has used it for more than a year. No
one is suggesting outright that it has made a difference in his
pursuit of Maris' record of 61 homers in a season.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie, McGwire hit 49 home runs in 1987, long before he
says he used the substance. And in the seasons that followed, he
solidified his reputation as one of the game's premier power
hitters. In 1996, he hit 52 home runs, the first time he crossed
the 50-homer mark. He followed that with 58 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done is natural,'' McGwire told The Associated
Press. ``Everybody that I know in the game of baseball uses the
same stuff I use.'' He also acknowledged that he uses the
muscle-builder creatine, which is an amino acid powder.
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball players are proponents of creatine _ Sammy Sosa,
who is just behind McGwire in the home-run race, and the Yankees'
Chad Curtis among them. But no other baseball player has come
forward with support for androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Because baseball's drug policy bans only illegal drugs, the
popularity of the supplements in clubhouses hardly draws the
league's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't comment,'' major-league baseball Commissioner Bud
Selig said of McGwire's use of the supplement. ``I have no
knowledge of it. The Cardinals are a disciplined organization, and
I don't think anything goes on there that shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the medical community question the safety of both
creatine and androstenedione, and the concern is beginning to take
hold in other sports. A sign in the Miami Dolphins' locker room
this summer advised players not to use creatine during two-a-day
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee added androstenedione to its
banned list last December because it believed the supplement gave
its users an unfair advantage. This summer, Randy Barnes, the 1996
Olympic shot-put gold medalist, was banned from the sport for life
because of his use of androstenedione. It was his second drug
offense.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. bombings in Afghanistan and the Sudan did
not come up at all during juma _ traditional Friday prayers _ at
Masjid Alfalah, a mosque in Corona, Queens, that is attended by
Muslims from many nations. But afterward, it was clear they were on
everyone's minds.
</P>
<P>
   And the feeling among the immigrant worshipers was almost
universal: the attacks launched by their adopted country were cruel
and very plainly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Some called the U.S. government a bully in the schoolyard of
international relations, eager to show off its power and anxious to
beat up helpless developing nations. Others pointedly criticized
President Clinton for singling out the Islamic world while turning
a blind eye to injustices against Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia.
Still others said they suspected that the president authorized the
bombings to divert attention from the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do what Clinton did, he had to have no feelings,'' said
Isslam Hadidy, 21, an immigrant from Egypt. ``Innocent lives were
lost, and the only reason all this happened is because they
couldn't control those two countries.'' Hadidy, a U.S. citizen, was
steadfast in his assessment that his adopted country had sinned
against the Muslim world and somehow, someday, would pay for its
arrogance. ``We believe, as Muslims, that injustice will never
prevail,'' he said. ``And what happened here, this was not
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashad Mohammed, 25, a business student at St. John's University
from Sri Lanka, agreed. ``They're taking a big risk,'' he said of
U.S. officials. ``Because they haven't targeted terrorists, but
innocent people, and this isn't going to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed said he had nothing against America, particularly since
he had been granted a visa allowing him to study business
administration here and learn skills that will help him when he
returns to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give people from other countries opportunities like that,
but they should treat the international situation in the same way,
and policies should be equal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed said that at the core of the anger that many Muslims
feel for the United States was its continuing support for Israel.
``They target the Islamic world, but why haven't they taken any
steps against the Israelis for all the hardships they have forced
on Arabs?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahamed Ismail, 65, an immigrant from India who has lived in the
New York region for almost 50 years, said the Alfalah mosque was a
decidedly apolitical place. ``They don't discuss politics there,''
he said. ``You just pray to Allah, and Allah will take care of the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite his protestations that he didn't know anything about
``this bomb business,'' Ismail let slip a hint of anger at
Clinton's actions. ``What he did might be wrong or it might be
right,'' he said. ``But if they're looking out for American
interests, they should think before they kill innocent people who
know nothing about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the hundreds of worshipers who gathered outside
the mosque to retrieve the shoes they had shed before kneeling for
prayers wholeheartedly supported the bombings. ``To strike back and
control them is the right step,'' said Aziz Bhatti, a Pakistani
immigrant who runs a film developing shop in Jackson Heights.
``They have their own selfish motives, and they don't represent
everybody in the Muslim world.''

AFTER HALL'S DEBACLE, JETS BRING IN A NEW KICKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when the New York Jets think they have figured out John
Hall, he mis-hits a 37-yard field-goal attempt, blows an
extra-point attempt and squibs three consecutive kickoffs _ all in
the same game.
</P>
<P>
   So coach Bill Parcells made a trade Friday following Hall's
Thursday night debacle against the New York Giants. He called his
good friend, Green Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf, and
acquired Brett Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who named Conway the kicker in the preseason finale
next Friday against the Chicago Bears, then cautioned that the deal
did not mean the end of Hall's career as a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said Hall ``was the highest-rated kicker on our board
last year,'' although he went undrafted and was signed by the Jets
as a free agent. Conway was drafted last year in the third round
out of Penn State. He had a training-camp battle with Ryan Longwell
but sat out the season because of a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hall set a National Football League record as a rookie last year
with 29 touchbacks on kickoffs, but Parcells said: ``It doesn't
make any difference if you can identify the problem if you can't
correct it. I have to satisfy my own curiosity about Conway. You
can't fix something after three, four games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall kicked on grass this preseason at Giants Stadium and
practiced on both grass and artificial turf at the Jets' training
facility at Hofstra University. He also had a new holder, the new
punter Nick Gallery. Last year, Hall converted only 1-of-5
field-goal attempts after his regular holder, punter Brian Hansen,
was injured. When Hansen held, Hall made 75 percent of his
attempts. But Hansen was traded to the Packers last Monday as
Gallery exhibited an extremely strong leg.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, like all kickers, prefers to kick on the consistency of
artificial turf. But after Thursday's 27-23 victory, he said:
``It's over. I'm not going to get into that. It doesn't matter what
kind of footing it is. I've got to make the kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hall's performance, Parcells said: ``I can't take that. It's
not just a couple of things gone wrong. It's everything. When you
see those kind of signs, it worries you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hall is the man who helped Parcells' Jets dominate on
special teams last season. Because of his touchbacks and uniformly
deep kicking, the opposition was forced to begin an average drive,
following kickoffs, 76.1 yards from the goal line _ farther than
any other team in the American Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Hall still might get back to those booming numbers. The grass
experiment at Giants Stadium will end once the regular season
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had not missed a field goal or extra point in the preseason
before Thursday, and he had been booting field goals in practice at
a rate close to what Parcells demands: 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hall's erratic charts looked like the recent stock
market. He started by making the second-longest field goal by a
rookie, a 55-yarder on his first attempt. He knocked kickoffs
through the end zone. But he also missed 2-of-6 kicks in the
40-yard range. Overall, his field-goal average was 68.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams coach, Mike Sweatman, offered a rhetorical
question: ``Do you know who his holder was?'' He stopped short of
then saying that that was the reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall was a 20 percent field-goal kicker with quarterback
Glenn Foley as his holder.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery, meanwhile, was apparently learning the hold technique
very well, even though he had never held in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hall worked out in the bubble in the off-season, which was
very helpful,'' Sweatman said. ``We've tried to get a more
consistent swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The hierarchy seemed pleased with Hall until his errant kicking
against the Giants. That led to the trade for Conway, for whom the
Jets promised unspecified considerations if he makes the team. The
6-foot-2-inch Conway has converted 3-of-5 field-goal attempts in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells dismissed the idea of keeping two kickers _ one for
kicking off, the other for field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hall was more consistent last year,'' Parcells said. ``I don't
want anyone to get the wrong idea. Nothing is resolved. I want to
create an option for myself. If we had a problem in our first game
and I hadn't tried to fix it, I couldn't forgive myself.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells said the Jets had agreed to a four-year contract
extension with safety Victor Green and were close to a similar deal
with wide receiver Wayne Chrebet. ... ``We're a long way from being
where I want to be,'' Parcells said of the club. ``No. 1 is the
kicking. No. 2 is the offensive line.''

GIANTS WAKE UP TO LIFE WITHOUT SEHORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a minute had gone by in the Jets-Giants game Thursday
night when Tiki Barber turned to look at Jason Sehorn, the Giants'
most gifted player, whose bounty of athletic gifts engendered an
aura of invincibility that fed an entire team.
</P>
<P>
   Barber saw Sehorn's face buried in a white towel on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to be all right?'' Barber said on the sideline to
Danny Kanell, Sehorn's best friend on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell had just left Sehorn's side with an affectionate jostling
of Sehorn's hair. Kanell's face was ashen, his eyes teary, when he
turned to face Barber.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Kanell said.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the question is: Will the Giants be all right?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel, the coach, vowed to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got a knot in my stomach,'' Fassel said Friday.
``The whole game I had an empty feeling. We're going to miss him.
But we've always dealt with it. We've picked up and went on to win.
Others guys are going to have to do the same now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sehorn's right knee injury _ a torn anterior cruciate
ligament and a torn medial collateral ligament that will require
season-ending reconstructive surgery _ has had a profound effect on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a team with few question marks, especially
defensively, has a hole where it was heretofore considered
strongest. It is impossible to hide a weak or even mediocre
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Giants' pass rush and middle-of-the-field pass
coverage was bolstered by Sehorn's presence.
</P>
<P>
   As Kanell said late Thursday: ``Any time you can isolate a
cornerback on a wide receiver and just forget about the receiver,
it lets the rest of the defense attack. It was a given that Jason
would shut the other receiver down.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Hamilton, a 23-year-old third-year player who has started
one NFL game, will take Sehorn's place. The rookie Shaun Williams,
a safety in college, will get the accelerated textbook instruction
at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, with Sehorn sitting on a long table in the
trainer's room, players streamed in to comfort and commiserate with
their fallen teammate. The locker room was chaotic, with a parade
of players going back to the smaller trainer's room to see Sehorn.
</P>
<P>
   They found Sehorn upbeat and serene, encouraging his mates,
indeed even consoling others.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, in an unusual break from football locker room
protocol, Sehorn's wife of six months, Whitney, had been brought
into the trainer's room to see her husband.
</P>
<P>
   She felt like crying. He would not let her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about me,'' Sehorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn's cheerfulness and spirit eased the mood of many Giants,
several of whom later acknowledged they had trouble concentrating
on the game. When intermission ended, players returned to the
field, but many on the defensive side had been so wrapped up in
meeting with Sehorn, some had not even discussed _ or paid
attention to _ what the plan for the second half was to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surreal, like it didn't really happen,'' Barber said
Friday. ``You're thinking: `Stuff like this doesn't happen.' Ten
seconds into a preseason game and the best athlete on the team is
gone _ just like that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jessie Armstead, the team's spiritual leader and an All-Pro
linebacker, said he ran onto the field for the first series of the
game with one eye on the Giants bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't help looking over there to see if Jason would come
running out,'' Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   No Giant, most notably Fassel and Sehorn, had considered such a
devastating injury likely when the decision was made to use Sehorn
as one of the team's prime kickoff return men this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In lengthy private conversations with both Fassel and Sehorn at
training camp last month, both argued that it would not put Sehorn
in additional jeopardy. The Giants were trying to improve what was
the National Football League's worst kickoff return average a year
ago, and Sehorn had all but begged Fassel to let him do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a play where the ball carrier gets hurt very often,''
Fassel said last month. ``I wouldn't consider it if Jason didn't
want to do it so badly. Plus, he has the fluid stride, quickness,
breakaway speed and aggressiveness that should make him a great
returner. This is a guy who plays with abandon in the secondary. I
don't think the risk is any greater on kickoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, who returned punts as a cornerback and safety at
Southern California, found the discussion about possible injury
annoyingly negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I hold myself back because of the risk of injury?''
he said. ``Besides, I heard people in the stands at practice
cheering when I was returning kicks today. It's considered fun now,
there's no outcry against it, right? If I get hurt, people can't
say `no' to this then. They've got to remember that they were
cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few seconds of cheering Thursday night when Sehorn
burst up the middle of the field with the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things looked pretty good,'' Sehorn said later after he had
limped into a press conference with reporters. ``Then I saw
somebody come at me. And here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The fragile psyche of what is already a diverse group of
defensive backs will have to mold anew. This is the group, after
all, that erupted in argument during the second half of the Giants
playoff loss to Minnesota. That on-the-field quarrel started when
cornerback Phillippi Sparks scolded Hamilton about a coverage and
Armstead came to Hamilton's aid.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the secondary will increase now. Their poise
will be tested and any lack of united will be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the defense, Armstead and defensive end Michael
Strahan, the team's only All-Pros, have a job to do and it includes
protecting Hamilton and insuring that the Giants pass rush and
punishing run defense is at its best. Because the Giants no longer
have Sehorn, one of the NFL's top five cornerbacks, following an
opponent's top receiver, thwarting his best efforts from sideline
to sideline.
</P>
<P>
   That extravagance disappeared with an awkward twisting and a
tackle at the end of the opening kickoff Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he had not slept much in the aftermath of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up a number of times,'' he said. ``I think everybody
felt it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel said, crisply and loudly when he was asked about
Sehorn's injury minutes after the game had ended, ``It was my worst
nightmare.''

PIAZZA LEFT HOLDING THE BAT, WITH VALENTINE HOLDING THE BAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine kept his All-Star catcher on the
bench a little too long Friday night, and the New York Mets came up
short in the eighth inning and eventually in the game, losing to
the St. Louis Cardinals, 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario unfolded in the eighth inning of the first game of
a doubleheader at Shea Stadium, with the Mets down 6-4 but
threatening with the bases loaded and none out.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, the Mets' manager, was saving Mike Piazza, his
slugging catcher, to pinch-hit for Mel Rojas, so Luis Lopez _
batting two spots ahead of Rojas _ hit with the bases loaded while
Piazza watched from the dugout. Lopez grounded into a double play,
which gave the Mets one run, but gave the Cardinals two big outs.
</P>
<P>
   As Piazza then watched from the on-deck circle, Jorge Fabregas
grounded out with the tying run on third for the final out of the
inning. A three-run rally had come up one run short. Piazza had
never come up at all.
</P>
<P>
   So Rojas, who had already allowed a run in the eighth, took the
mound for the Cardinals' ninth and allowed four more runs to put
the game beyond the reach of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had thought about pinch-hitting the
right-handed Piazza for Lopez against the St. Louis right-hander
Rich Croushore, Valentine said: ``Yes, there were thoughts.
Obviously, I should have done it. A double play was the only thing
that was going to get me there. And it got us. I just didn't think
the guy was a ground-ball, double-play pitcher. I should have hit
Mike, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Mets been able to tie the game or go ahead in the
eighth, Valentine would not have had to send Rojas back out for the
ninth, either. But the manager said he was confident that Lopez
would do anything but what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to have a shot to hit Mike with one
out,'' Valentine said. ``Luis is a good fastball hitter. I'm just
sitting there saying, `Anything but a double play.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were trailing 6-2 entering the eighth, when Jermaine
Allensworth grounded a pinch-hit single off Lance Painter to open
the inning. John Olerud followed by lining a single to left and
Edgardo Alfonzo, who was pinch-hitting for Matt Franco, walked to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That brought on Croushore, who walked Brian McRae to make it
6-3, then allowed a single up the middle to Carlos Baerga for
another run. Lopez's turn was next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mike does hit and doesn't drive in a run, we're looking at
Fabregas and Ordonez next,'' Valentine said, referring to his
backup catcher and Rey Ordonez, the only other position player
besides Piazza available to Valentine off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine rolled the dice and let Lopez bat. And on a 2-1 pitch,
Lopez grounded hard to first baseman John Mabry, who started the
double play. And Rojas proceeded to let the game to get away in the
ninth, while allowing Mark McGwire, who did not start the opener, a
ground-rule double off Alfonzo's glove at third to score a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to squeak by both ways,'' Valentine said, explaining
that he had tried to conserve both his pitching and his bench.
</P>
<P>
   The manager had also tried to squeak an extra inning out of
Hideo Nomo (5-11), who was once again beset by control problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo was asked if he found it strange that he has had little
success this season, even though nobody has been able to hit him.
``I don't think it's strange,'' Nomo said. ``Runners are getting on
by other means.''
</P>
<P>
   Like walks.
</P>
<P>
   After he struck out the game's first three batters on 11
pitches, it was apparent that Nomo had good stuff. It became
equally apparent, though, that he did not know where his pitches
were going.
</P>
<P>
   Which was nothing new. Nomo entered the game trailing only
Darryl Kile of Colorado in walks allowed in the National League.
And after Nomo walked six more batters Friday night, Nomo and Kile
were tied with 86.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 walks in 1372/3 innings, the Japanese right-hander is
averaging 5.6 walks every nine innings. That is one reason his
record is so poor, even though he entered the day third in the
league in strikeouts per nine innings and third in opponent's
batting average against.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nomo was charged with four runs on five hits in
five-plus innings. Nomo struck out eight, but of his 109 pitches,
50 were balls.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo allowed a homer to Ron Gant leading off the second, and
before the inning was over, he hit Fernando Tatis with a pitch, and
walk Eli Marrero and Matt Morris, the pitcher. Somehow, he escaped
with the Mets only trailing 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Cardinals scratched out another run to make it
2-0. Light-hitting Luis Ordaz opened with an infield single and
took second when Lopez's high throw from shorstop sailed into the
photographers' box behind first base. Nomo then struck out Delino
DeShields (for the third time), but allowed a run-scoring single to
Willie McGee.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets struggled through four innings against Morris, a former
Seton Hall right-hander, who quickly retired the first two batters
in the fifth. But Tony Phillips doubled to left with two out and
one-pitch later Lenny Harris launched his second home run of the
season. Just like that, the score was 2-2.

ARIZONA TEENS TOP NATION IN DRUG USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One out of six Arizona youths use illegal drugs _
especially marijuana _ a rate that is nearly double that of
California and a third higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers come from an annual nationwide federal study that
honed in on Arizona and California this year because both states
have approved so-called medical marijuana initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse released Friday
found that 13.1 percent of Arizonans aged 12 to 17 said they had
used marijuana in the past month. And 16.8 percent said they had
used ``any illicit drug,'' including cocaine, inhalants or heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's youth marijuana figure was more than one-third higher
than the nation as a whole _ 9.6 percent _ and it was nearly double
the rate of neighboring California _ 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study should cause alarm bells to go off in every family
in Arizona,'' said Chuck Blanchard, chief counsel for Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, the federal drug czar. McCaffrey released the report
along with the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend, every Arizona parent should sit down and talk to
their kids about drug use,'' said Blanchard, a former Arizona state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   The findings surprised government analysts, who have been
compiling similar, nationwide surveys since 1971 but had never
broken out Arizona figures individually until now.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and California, which both passed medical marijuana
initiatives in 1996, were selected as the first two states ever to
undergo individual breakdowns as part of the national drug survey.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration conceded that, with limited money
available for individual state sampling, it intentionally picked
the two states that passed drug-legalization measures that it
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Proposition 200 was designed to allow physicians to
prescribe marijuana or other controlled substances to seriously ill
patients. This year, its backers moved to put the issue back on the
ballot after the state Legislature, in effect, suspended it.
McCaffrey has been lobbying against Proposition 200 and similar
measures in other states, saying the propositions send a mixed
message to youths.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Clinton administration denied it was using its
drug-use survey to try to make a case against medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not arguing for or against, it's just looking at what
the potential impact is (of medical marijuana initiatives). It's to
look at trends,'' said Mark Weber, a substance-abuse spokesman for
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, the Clinton administration did not attempt to
make a correlation between the survey's Arizona marijuana figures
and Proposition 200.
</P>
<P>
   However, an internal document from the federal drug czar's
office suggested that it believes there may be a link. The document
highlights the survey and notes its finding that the perceived risk
of smoking marijuana is lower for both Californians and Arizonans
than for Americans generally.
</P>
<P>
   The document notes that this ``is consistent with what would be
expected, given the passage of the medical marijuana propositions
in these two states.'' However, the document says there is simply
too little evidence to reach any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of youth and adult Arizonans who perceived
``great risk'' in smoking marijuana once a month was 39.9 percent
for Arizona, and 37.6 percent for California. The national figure,
excluding those two states, was 43.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue about whether the proposition would have any effect
on youth attitudes is an open issue,'' Blanchard said. ``The idea
was, `These are two states and we might as well test to find out.
But the evidence is inconclusive. California has lower marijuana
use among youths than the national sample.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey said that Arizona's general population, not just
youths, also use drugs at a higher rate than the entire nation, but
not by as alarming a margin as teens alone. In Arizona, 7.3 percent
said they used an illegal drug in the past month, compared with 5.8
percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The overall use of illegal drugs in the country remained steady
last year, the report said, while reporting a significant increase
in drug use among youth 12-17 nationally _ from 9 percent in 1996
to 11.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar's office, as well as at least one private group,
said the lesson was to spend more time trying to lessen drug demand
by educating kids and parents.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's office has been running television and radio ads in
Arizona this year that target both parents and kids. The office has
a telephone number (1-800-788-2800) for parents who want advice in
talking to their kids about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many federal anti-drug dollars continue to be spent on
efforts to reduce the supply of drugs, rather than to reduce
demand,'' said a statement by Drug Strategies, a Washington-based
research institute fighting the drug problem. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Behind two massive, rosette-studded doors,
temporarily sealed from the eyes _ and ears _ of readers, the Main
Reading Room of the New York Public Library resonates with the
rapping, whining and screeching of hammers, drills and saws.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Elton John on a raspy radio, workers this week
were patching the creamy old marble floors and treating the bronze
frames of the new audiovisual carrels. Every moment counts. The
enormous chamber is to reopen Nov. 16 after a $15 million, 16-month
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the sweep of the transformation is plain to see. No
longer a crumbling expanse of shadows, the 297-foot-long ceiling
seems to open to the heavens through three newly painted trompe
l'oeil murals. Clouds float beneath a cornflower-blue sky; some
look like puffs of pink cotton candy, others like roiled gray-green
ocean swells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dressing up an aristocratic dowager for her 90th
birthday and making her look better than she did at her debut,''
said Lewis Davis of Davis Brody Bond, the architects responsible
for the renovation of the Fifth Avenue building, known formally as
the Center for the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   The paint has scarcely dried on the murals, but the library is
already planning its next big project: the first significant
above-ground addition since the building opened in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million addition will be a building within a building,
filling much of the open-air South Court, which is now used for
deliveries and parking. The new six-level structure will include a
training center where the public can learn how to use the library's
expanding electronic resources. Groundbreaking _ or, more
accurately, asphalt-breaking _ is to take place next year, with
completion expected by the end of 2000, in time for the building's
90th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   As different as the Reading Room and South Court projects seem,
there is a common thread: bringing the beaux-arts library fully
into the information age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word in our plan is access,'' said Marshall Rose, the
chairman of the library. ``Access to the building. Access to
computers. Access to knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The library, designed by Carrere &AMP; Hastings, opened a decade
before the first long-distance television transmission, two decades
before photocopying was invented, four decades before the first
commercially successful computer and five decades before the
Internet was started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to take a building with walls that are 3 feet
thick and make it smart, make it hum, make it user-friendly,'' said
Paul LeClerc, the library president. ``We would like to turn over
the building to the next generation in a fresh, refurbished and
wired condition.''
</P>
<P>
   He means that literally. In the Main Reading Room, most of the
carved oak tables have been wired with 16 electrical outlets and
data ports, one for each seat. They are arranged in bronze grommets
set flush into the tabletop, alternating with the classic bronze
reading lamps.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid cutting through the marble and the red Welsh quarry
tiles in the floor, workers ran the wires through conduits in the
ceiling of the book stacks below the Reading Room and threaded them
directly into the pedestal of each table.
</P>
<P>
   The tables themselves have been stripped and refinished as part
of the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   No attempt was made to either restore or replicate the original
ceiling murals by James Wall Finn, which were badly marred by
chalky patches caused by leaks. ``This isn't fine art,'' Davis
explained. ``This is decorative art.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Davis said, he studied Tiepolo, Tintoretto, Turner and
others to learn the secrets of a beautiful sky. The overall
restoration of the ceiling was undertaken by the EverGreene
Painting Studios of Manhattan. The canvas panels composing the
murals, each one 36 feet by 18 feet, were painted by Yohannes
Aynalem and then affixed to the ceiling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cost of renovating the Main Reading Room was met by the
real-estate developer Frederick Rose and his wife, Sandra Priest
Rose, a library trustee. (Frederick and Marshall Rose are not
related, although Marshall's daughter, Wendi, is married to
Frederick's nephew, Joseph Rose, the chairman of the City Planning
Commission.)
</P>
<P>
   Just below the Reading Room's arched windows, and invisible from
the street, will be the new South Court addition, set back 3 feet
from the surrounding walls of the courtyard. Its floors will be
more like platforms, reached from the library by small bridges cut
through existing window openings that have been enlarged to serve
as doorways.
</P>
<P>
   The addition will have 28,400 square feet of space, enough for
orientation and training centers, offices, meeting rooms, a loading
dock at street level and a staff cafeteria underground.
</P>
<P>
   A band of glass extending around the perimeter of the sixth
level of the new structure will turn most of the courtyard into a
kind of atrium. The library's ornate exterior walls of white Danby
marble, cleaned and repointed, will become interior walls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than looking out through these walls, the attraction will
be be looking at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, all of a sudden, going to open a new facade that has
never been visible to anybody,'' Marshall Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million construction cost of the South Court project is
being borne by New York City, largely through the efforts of
Speaker Peter Vallone of the City Council. The $5 million needed to
equip the addition will be raised privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's the cathedral of all libraries,'' Vallone said.
``I was a little concerned about taking away the open space, but
they figured out a way to preserve that concept while at the same
time fulfilling very important needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Court is largely unknown to the public, in part
because it is mostly hidden from the street and can be seen from
only a few points in the library itself.
</P>
<P>
   In early years, the courtyard was used by the staff for
recreational and social events, according to a report by Higgins &AMP;
Quasebarth, historic-preservation consultants. There was a marble
fountain and marble horse trough. A trellis-covered bungalow was
added in 1919 as a ``rest and luncheon room'' for employees.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain was demolished in 1950. The bungalow still stands
but will be razed to make way for the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   The South Court project was endorsed ``enthusiastically'' by the
Municipal Art Society and approved unanimously by the city's
Landmarks Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with them on the concept of an infill building
floating in the courtyard, so that the image remains that of a
courtyard,'' said the commission chairwoman, Jennifer Raab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone tells me you can't adapt an historic
building to modern needs,'' she said, ``I point to the library.''

SUPPORT, AND CONCERN, OVER MARCH IN HARLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For weeks, the debate over next month's planned
Million Youth March has largely been confined to mayoral news
conferences, televised sound bites, newspaper articles and, most
recently, a federal courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the streets and stoops of Harlem are slowly
beginning to buzz with interest and speculation about the march,
which organizers say will fill Malcolm X Boulevard on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents are voicing support for the idea of bringing
hundreds of thousands of young black men and women to Harlem and
encouraging them to seize control of their lives and make peace
with one another. But mixed with that enthusiasm are concerns about
the potential for violence; talk of shuttered businesses on one of
the busiest shopping days of the year; and ambivalence, at best,
about one of the march's primary organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Laurie, a legal secretary, said she was looking forward
to the event and saw little reason to fear disturbances or
violence, even if gang members attend the march, as organizers have
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the event's leader, Khalid Abdul Muhammad _ a former top
official in the Nation of Islam, who has called Jews
``bloodsuckers'' _ Ms. Laurie, 22, arched her eyebrows and sighed.
``I'm not condoning what he says,'' she said. ``But you're not
going to find anyone who's perfect. All the Martin Luther Kings of
our day are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in Harlem is so forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Johnson, 37, a life insurance salesman, said he was
adamantly opposed to the event and had his doubts about Muhammad's
intentions. ``I have yet to hear what the purpose of the march
is,'' he said, soliciting customers from behind a table on 125th
Street. ``I commend the mayor for not issuing the permit. And many
of my brothers feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have denied the organizers a permit for the Sept.
5 march because, they say, the area cannot safely accommodate 1
million people, the number that the organizers originally set as
their goal. The Giuliani administration has offered Randalls Island
or Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx as alternative locations, and
Sept. 19 as a more suitable date, to avoid conflicts with other
events already scheduled for the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the organizers sued the city in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan, saying the refusal of a permit was unconstitutional
and reflected Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's discriminatory treatment of
black New Yorkers. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, although
organizers of the march have vowed that it will take place with or
without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many people will show up for the march is impossible
to know, and it is not clear how extensive an organization is in
place to promote the event nationwide. A Web site provides contact
telephone numbers in several cities, but calls to those numbers
Friday were answered by machines. Calls to an information number in
New York were not answered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a separate event billed as the Million Youth Movement
is scheduled for the same weekend in Atlanta, and has the backing
of the Nation of Islam, the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Advertising for the march has also been scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harlem residents, like other New Yorkers, have been
learning plenty about it from newspapers and television. The news
reports have mostly revolved around Giuliani's objections to the
event, and his attacks on Muhammad as an anti-Semitic hatemonger.
For many Harlem residents, however, the mayor's opposition is just
another reason to support the march.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laurie, for one, said she could not accept the mayor's
objections to the event at face value. ``He's not really for black
people or minorities,'' she said. ``He's all for himself and
whoever voted for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the mayor's stated concerns about safety seemed
patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   Lina Cannon, 26, the owner of a beauty salon on Malcolm X
Boulevard, said Giuliani seemed to have conjured up a nightmare in
which mobs of rampaging gang members, whipped into a frenzy, would
overwhelm the decent people of Harlem. ``If anything, I feel the
mayor will be trying to start a war,'' she said. ``His objections
to everything are causing the chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Woodard, a Mount Vernon, N.Y, resident arriving for an
appointment, agreed, saying that city officials' proposals of
alternative locations belied their motives. ``This is the
crossroads of our lives,'' she said, pointing to the corner of
125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   But others shared Giuliani's concerns about safety. Pierre
Davis, 16, said that a march attended by teen-agers and gang
members would inevitably lead to violence, in contrast to the
Million Man March in Washington in 1995 and the Million Woman March
in Philadelphia last October.
</P>
<P>
   Those were adults, he said. ``They know how to come together for
a cause,'' he said, in between smoking a cigarette and calling
after nearly every young woman who walked by. ``Youth don't know
how to act.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Paterson said several business owners were
planning to close their doors the day of the event, sacrificing
back-to-school sales on what is traditionally the second-busiest
shopping weekend of the year in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But to Damien Lemons, the 17-year-old retail manager at a Krispy
Kreme doughnut shop on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 125th
Street, the talk of mayhem seemed ridiculous. He said he had spoken
to several acquaintances who belonged to gangs and who were unsure
of whether to attend the march. He said that far from worrying
about whether they would come, city officials and Harlem residents
should encourage them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be afraid of them,'' he said. ``You can't tell them
to stay away. If they were all to come, we'd know that they are
listening, that they want to help, to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Harlem seemed to agree, though, when it came to
Muhammad, the organizer of the youth march. While some said they
admired him for speaking his mind, many people who were interviewed
said they were offended by his statements over the years denouncing
whites, Jews, Roman Catholics and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad was dismissed by the Nation of Islam as its spokesman
in 1994 after a 1993 speech in which he referred to Jews as
``bloodsuckers.'' As recently as last month, he called New York a
``Jewish-controlled city'' and implied that Jews and other whites
working for the mayor were responsible for official opposition to
the Million Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   But while disapproving of Muhammad's rhetoric, many Harlem
residents appeared willing to look past it for the sake of an event
that otherwise seemed worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they believed that Muhammad would be unlikely to
resort to racist diatribes at a large gathering for fear of
alienating his audience.

COMMENTARY: TURNING CRISES INTO COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonathan Rosario answered his door dressed as if he
were ready to go on stage and do his comedy routine: black vest
over a loose white shirt, burgundy jeans and impeccably shined
shoes. He excused himself and lingered in the foyer, where he keeps
a pantheon of saints and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't mind, let me light my candles,'' he said.
``People come by and leave their names so I can pray for them. I
don't think I'm anything special, but people think my prayers do
something for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He touched a match to candles near a statue of an Indian, one of
the Virgin Mary and a black cloth doll that clutched a pile of
business cards. He glanced at autographed photos of Whoopi Goldberg
and Melba Moore. They were divine in another way, having survived
tough times in their pursuit of the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melba Moore,'' he said reverently. ``One day I'm going to open
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Along Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx, Rosario is hailed as a
stand-up guy, and not just for his shtick. Although cutbacks cost
him his day job as a crisis counselor at a housing center, he still
tackles cases for no pay. Old ladies and single mothers short on
money or luck stop him on the street and ask for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them know that the counselor-comic faces his own quiet
crisis. He expects an eviction notice to be slapped on his door
because he owes $4,100 in rent on his tiny apartment. Reluctant to
burden anyone with problems that also include a close friend's
death and a recent break-in, he mines his life for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so broke that when I go to the ATM, I get food stamps,''
he said. ``Then there's my paranoia. Every time I open my door and
see a restaurant menu, I think it's an eviction notice.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly knows the difference. He has been working _ either
for pay or for nothing _ as a housing advocate since he was a
teen-ager. He got into it seriously soon after he had testified in
a court case involving someone who he knew was not guilty of a drug
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone can walk in here with a really nice suit and say
something against somebody who doesn't look so hot, that means that
the one with the suit will win,'' said Rosario, 25. ``That means
that sometimes innocent people have to pay for something they
didn't bring upon themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains enough of a hook for him that he continues his
freelance counseling even though his unemployment benefits have run
out, his phone is about to be cut off and his part-time job at a
video store isn't cutting it. When he hits the streets of Norwood,
he becomes the answer man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I am able to forget about my problems is to help
people with worse problems,'' he said. ``I'm a lonely guy. I really
have nothing to do with my time except see who else is lonely and
who needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   He exaggerates, since he also sends out dozens of letters to
clubs, producers and anyone else who might discover him. He also
writes new jokes, sometimes drawing on the absurdity of the social
services maze.
</P>
<P>
   He dreams of being on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' since he
shares her love of wonderfully cheesy sitcoms. Like her, he said,
those old shows helped ease a rough childhood. ``She's like one of
my biggest inspirations,'' he said. ``I loved her even before she
had her own show. I remember her from `Gimme a Break.' I can even
sing the theme song.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he gets his own break, Rosario has enough fans in Norwood
looking out for him. When they learned that he was not being paid
for all the problems he was solving, they took care of him. His
hair stylist never charges him. The thrift shop gives him a
discount on clothing. And every day, Efrain Cruz feeds him pasteles
and flan at his restaurant, A Touch of Latin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts everybody else prior to him,'' Cruz said. ``I tell him
to pay when he can. With certain people I do that. Not everybody.
You got to take care of those who have heart. If somebody has
heart, you got to have heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosario does not forget the favors. ``If I ever make it, I'm
going to make him the next Jimmy's Bronx Cafe,'' he vowed. After a
while, and a brief hello to Esther, his ``hair savior'' down the
street, Rosario returned to his apartment. Some of his friends
think he's wasting his time writing jokes. He slogs on, even though
on some days it's enough of a chore to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time is not wasted,'' he insisted. ``One day, all the
things I'm writing about I'll be able to express little by
little.''

EDITORIAL: TAKING ON THE TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update time element in 8th graf.)   (bl/js)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has launched a battle against terrorism that
promises to take the United States into unfamiliar intelligence,
military and diplomatic terrain. It is important at the outset that
the White House and the American people understand the risks
involved and set limits on the actions that may be taken. The
opportunity to combat terrorism must be pursued aggressively, but
the difficulties and dangers should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   It has been hard enough to combat state-sponsored terrorism by
countries like Iraq, Iran and Libya. At least in such cases
Washington could deal with governing authorities that might respond
to diplomatic and economic pressure. Foreign military and
intelligence services also provide fixed, non-civilian targets for
military attack, if the use of force is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years terrorism has mutated, and the greater
threat to America today may come from shadowy, independent groups
that operate across national boundaries and melt into the chaotic
societies where they find recruits and sanctuary. It is exceedingly
difficult to track and to attack freelance organizations like the
one Washington considers responsible for the embassy bombings in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Spy satellites and other electronic intelligence systems can
provide information about the location and activities of these
groups, but machines cannot replace the use of skilled field
operatives able to develop informers inside terrorist cells. The
CIA needs to expand its network of agents, but to do so under
guidelines designed to avoid past abuses.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan
demonstrated, moving against terrorist groups may require
potentially provocative military actions that violate the
sovereignty of other countries, threaten civilian populations and
intensify anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine of self-defense invoked by the Clinton
administration is valid when U.S. citizens and embassies have been
attacked or face assault. But the use of force should be
commensurate with the threat and designed to limit civilian
casualties. That appears to have been the case in Sudan and
Afghanistan, but the Pentagon still owes the public a more detailed
account of the missile attacks and their consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to authorize the assassination of terrorists will
grow over time. It must be resisted, not only because it is
inconsistent with American values but because it would invite a
parallel effort against American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Military action alone can punish and temporarily disrupt
terrorist groups, but not destroy them. The terrorist organization
of Osama bin Laden, the target of the U.S. missile attacks, is
dispersed throughout the Middle East. It is financed by bin Laden,
a Saudi multimillionaire who seems dedicated to killing Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To weaken the network, Washington has rightly begun to go after
bin Laden's money by tracing his accounts and seeking the help of
foreign governments and banks to freeze them. Saudi Arabia could be
particularly helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there is no substitute for improved physical
security at embassies, airports and other potential targets. The
White House and Congress ought to look at security in terms of a
protracted struggle against terrorism, not a quick fix thrown
together after the latest truck bombing. A significant increase in
spending is necessary. The United States is engaged in a long,
nasty alley fight with opponents who see no distinction between
combatants and civilians. Washington will have to be resourceful
and resolute, but it has the power to prevail without abandoning
its principles.

POLICE TARGETING ONLINE CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christian Curry had what appeared to be a foolproof
method for winning a lucrative judgment in a federal discrimination
lawsuit he had filed against his former Wall Street employer,
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a man who he thought was a computer hacker,
officials said, Curry, who is black, asked him to break into the
company's e-mail system and distribute a phony message filled with
anti-black vitriol, and references to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail, when produced in court, would bolster Curry's claim
that the company, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, fired him in April
because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that the man Curry was trying to hire was
an undercover New York City police detective, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested on Thursday, Curry, 24, was arraigned Friday in
Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of forgery, tampering with
physical evidence and coercion.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who is from Chappaqua, N.Y., was later released from jail
and faces up to seven years in jail if convicted, prosecutors said.
His lawyer, Earl Rawlins, did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His case is the second in the last month to involve computer
hackers' manipulation of e-mail accounts for purposes ranging from
the mischievous, to the comical, to the criminal.
</P>
<P>
   As concerns about e-mail security have intensified, companies
that provide Internet access and law-enforcement agencies have
stepped up their efforts to catch people in a crime that leaves few
traces. The officer who arrested Curry was a member of the New York
Police Department's Computer Investigations and Technology Unit.
The unit is three years old and consists of a lieutenant, sergeant
and six detectives recruited from within the department.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. James Doyle, a member of the unit, said its caseload has
doubled each year since it began. After 22 arrests in all of 1997,
the unit has 29 arrests so far this year. The charges range from
pedophilia-related offenses, to credit card fraud, to computer
hackers harassing people by taking over their e-mail accounts and
sending out false messages under their name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new area for us, and it's an area that grows
exponentially,'' Doyle said. ``There's something new every six
months and we have to try to keep up with that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a case filed in late July, investigators say another former
employee of an investment bank used the e-mail accounts of his
former bosses to send out bizarre messages that resulted in dozens
of letters being mailed to them.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, investigated by the Manhattan district attorney's
office, Michael Lissack, a former investment banker and
whistle-blower, was charged with aggravated harassment last month
in an episode in which false e-mail messages were sent in the name
of former colleagues at Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, one message sent out on a Smith
Barney vice chairman's e-mail account stated that the 6-year-old
son of one of the vice chairman's friends had been diagnosed with
liver cancer. The message listed the vice chairman's home address
and said ``Little Jim would love whatever cards you could send in
the few months he has left.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second message, the papers say, Lissack pretended to be a
second Smith Barney vice chairman and asked people to send the
executive ``photos of babies for a book I'm writing'' and then
listed that vice chairman's home address.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Lissack faces up to a year in prison if
convicted. Reached by telephone Friday night, Lissack said he had
no comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's case came to light, Doyle said, through the unit's use
of classic police work, not high-tech tracing. He said the unit
maintains contacts in the computer industry who tipped them that a
man was looking for a hacker who could penetrate Morgan Stanley's
e-mail system. The unit then made contact with Curry and set up the
meetings with the undercover officer.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases the unit has been involved in include tracing the
origin of e-mail threats to blow up Canarsie High School last
spring, exposing computer fencing operations, and breaking Internet
schemes involving the sale of sports memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Doyle said, is applying old police tactics to a new
field. He said that when an officer goes online posing as a child
in an effort to ferret out potential pedophiles, for example, they
use the same tactics as an undercover detective trying to arrest a
prostitute or drug dealer. ``Just as you're taught as an undercover
how to avoid entrapment,'' he said, ``you have to avoid doing that
on computer.''

WOODS RETURNS, BUT AS RECEIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ Quincy Woods, who was AWOL from USC football camp for
three days, resurfaced Friday and began preparing to catch the ball
insteadof throw it.
</P>
<P>
   Woods left the camp at UC Irvine on Monday after coach Paul
Hackett told him he wouldn't be able to compete for one of the top
two quarterback spots. Hackett asked the 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior
to consider a move to receiver. At the time, Woods took most of his
clothes and his electric fan, but he said Friday he never intended
to leave for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home to think things out,'' Woods said. ``My heart was
at quarterback. You know how bad I wanted to be a quarterback here.
I just needed time to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods spent the past three days thinking and talking on the
phone to his mother in Illinois, his brothers and friends. He
returned to UC Irvine on Friday morning and rejoined the team for
the afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see being away a couple of (days) how much I love
being on this team,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he never considered transferring and, while he
prefers to play quarterback, he accepts the position change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about that,'' Woods said when asked if he
received a fair shot at the job. ``I just need to move on with my
life. I respect (Hackett) as a coach and need to live with the
decision he made.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who completed 5 of 12 passes for 46 yards in his two
seasons at quarterback, played wide receiver briefly in 1997 but
didn't catch a pass. He'll try to add depth to a position which is
strong at the top but has only seven healthy scholarship players.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The players will get a day off today for the first time
since the camp opened on Aug. 10. Today was supposed to be the
final two-a-day session, but Hackett decided to let the players
rest. Preparation for the Aug. 30 opener against Purdue will take
full attention when practice resumes on Sunday....
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans survived a scary moment in Friday's early practice
when the starting quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst injured his right
ankle during a non-contact passing drill. Van Raaphorst slipped
while stepping away from a charging defensive lineman. He iced the
ankle and was back to full strength by the afternoon....
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he was awaiting the result of MRIs performed on
backup offensive tackle Ken Bowen (hyperextended elbow) and
defensive lineman Darren Collins (foot). Aside from freshman tight
end Scott Huber (hip), it's a pretty healthy group. Receiver Larry
Parker, who has been troubled by a hamstring, made a spectacular
catch on a fly pattern in the afternoon and then rested the
remainder of practice.
