NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nicos Rolandis, Cyprus' former
Foreign Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, has reaffirmed
his decision to stand as a candidate for the position of
U.N. Secretary-General, a position currently held by Egyptian
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who has decided to run for a second term, is rejected by
the United States. According to the deputy spokesman for the
U.N. Secretary-General Ahmad Fawzi, however, Ghali has received
strong encouragement by many member states of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made public Thursday, Rolandis repeated his
decision to put his name forward for the position, if the Cyprus
government reiterates its support for his application.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis also said that he will be discussing the matter with
President of the Republic Glafcos Clerides when he returns from
the European Union summit in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that both the governments of Cyprus and Greece
had expressed their desire to support Rolandis' to run for the
post, provided that the present U.N. chief was not to stand
again for the post.

Rolandis failed to secure a seat in the House of

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Harassment Against Serbs in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A UN spokesman said today that
many Serbs will start to leave Sarajevo suburbs unless acts of
harassment against them by Muslims are stopped.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the UN International Police
Task Force in Bosnia, said that because of harassment, about 72
people have left the suburbs in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Many plan to leave...unless the situation changes for the
better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, five suburbs previously
controlled by Serbs have been turned over to the Muslim-Croat
federation. Most of the Serb population had fled the areas before
they were taken over by the Muslim authorities, with some 8,000
Serb still staying behind.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said that the examples of harassment include breaking
into Serb houses, stealing, abusing and trying to drive Serbs away
with death threats.
</P>
<P>
These acts were mostly committed by Muslim refugees who had
been driven out of eastern Bosnia by Serbs and gangsters from
different places in the federation, but in some cases even
federation police were involved, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
The organization for protecting local Serbs, the Serb
Democratic Initiatives, has also been harassed, with one of its
leaders, Bogdan Joyanovic, being detained on war crime charges,
although the authorities have not presented any evidence, Ivanko
said.
</P>
<P>
"Voice of multi-ethnicity is pretty silent in Sarajevo
today.... We hope that the Bosnian government which has always
supported multi-ethnicity in Bosnia will condemn these acts and
specifically will do their best stop this harassment," the UN
official said.

<HEADLINE> Jews Still Barred from Praying on Temple Mount in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Internal Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani announced today the Israeli government
would continue a ban on Jews from praying on the Temple Mount of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani made the announcement following his tour of east
Jerusalem, after Palestinians expressed concern about reports that
Israeli new government planned to allow Jewish to worship on the
Temple Mount, holy to the Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The new minister added that more police stations would be
set up in east Jerusalem in order to keep public order.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Akram Sabri, Jerusalem's Mufti, and Hassan Tahboub,
Palestinian National Authority's Minister for Religious Affairs,
claimed early this week that a secret annex to the coalition
agreements of Israeli new government would allow Jews to pray
on the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
They said that Israeli government intended to let the
Temple Mount have a weekly schedule for Jewish and Moslem
worship, similar to the arrangement at the Machpela Cave in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party, a partner of the new coalition
government, has called for lifting the ban on Jewish worship on
the Mount. The police, backed by the government and courts, have
imposed the ban on grounds that it would spark violent clashes
between Jews and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Tahboub vowed that Moslems would do whatever necessary to
prevent Jews from praying on the Temple Mount, while calling
for the Arab world to help protect the holy site.
</P>
<P>
However, senior Jerusalem municipal officials have denounced the
remarks as groundless incitement among Moslems aimed at
disrupting Israel's plans in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Defence Minister on Botswanan Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defence Minister Moven
Mahachi said here today Zimbabwe does not feel threatened by the
huge arms procurement by neighbouring Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The recent buying of tanks and fighter bombs worth 100 million
US dollars by Botswana had baffled western diplomats and
political analysts, with some suggesting the arms build-up could
trigger an arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi told Zimbabwe National News Agency that Zimbabwe was
satisfied Botswana was buying the arms for self-defence.
</P>
<P>
''We don't feel threatened. We have an excellent relationship
with Botswana,'' said Mahachi, adding he did not understand why
some people thought Zimbabwe could be in danger.
</P>
<P>
''Botswana is a very friendly country. We don't think the
procurement of the arms is a threat or aggression towards
Zimbabwe. We don't want to interfere if our neighbours buy large
arms. We have no legitimate right to ask them.
</P>
<P>
''I am surprised others are raising eyebrows, it's not a
threat at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana is said to be expanding its army from 7,000 to 10,000
troops and officials were quoted by reports as saying the
build-up was part of a long term plan to beef up its deterrence
capability. enditem

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Unlikely to Fall in Germany in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite a slight economic recovery
expected this year, unemployment will stay at 3.9 million in
Germany, the Munich Economy Research Institute said.
</P>
<P>
Though the growth rate of the German economy is expected to
rise to 2 percent in 1997 from this year's 0.75 percent, the
nation is unlikely to cut unemployment next year, the institute
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the unemployment rate for 1996 and 1997 will be
hovering at 10 percent, but more jobs may be created in the second
half of the next year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial slump and a fall in the output value in the
construction sector have kept eastern Germany lagging behind the
western part, though the gross domestic product (GDP) in the east
has grown 2.5 percent this year, five times more than that of the
western part, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
It said Germany will have a budget deficit of 135 billion
German marks (90 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, accounting for 3.9
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Under the criteria of the European Union, countries adopting
the single currency, know as "the Euro," should bring their budget
deficit down to 3 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
It is still unpredictable whether Germany, the EU's biggest
economy and the main driving force for the establishment of the
monetary union, will achieve that goal by the next year, the
institute added.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: Return of Refugees in Bosnia "Dismal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The picture of refugees returning
to Bosnia half way through the implementation of the Dayton
agreement is "dismal," a senior official for the UN Higher
Commissioner for Refugees said today.
</P>
<P>
Soren Petersen, UNHCR director for the former Yugoslavia, said
that some 90,000 refugees or displaced persons have returned to
Bosnia since last December but few to the areas where they will be
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the same number of people have left their homes
because of the transfer of land from one entity to another or the
readjustment of the inter-entity boundary line, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accord, Bosnia is divided into two entities --
the Muslim-Croat federation and Repblika Srpska. Furthermore, to
most observers, the country is actually divided into three
entities, since the Croats refuse to give up their statelet
"Herceg-Bosna."
</P>
<P>
According to Peterson, there are two reasons for the current
difficulties in returning refugees, with one being that
"fundamental causes of this war remain largely unresolved."
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that there are some leaders in the parties who
are still pursuing in the peace exactly the same goals they were
pursuing in the war" which are of ethnic division, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other reason is "the lack of resolve on the part of the
international community" which, he said, should put more pressure
on the parties on such issues as respect for human rights and
freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Peterson also called on countries to deliver their promises of
assistance to the reconstruction of the country, saying that
"without large-scale reconstruction, there will be no significant
return (of refugees)."
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official worried that the upcoming elections for a
central government and entities in Bosnia might reinforce the
partitioning of the country if war criminals remain in power.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the elections give us a radical change of leadership, I
am frankly not very hopeful that we will see a large number of
people going back to the minority areas," he said.

<HEADLINE> Social Expenditure in India Too Low: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has asked India
to increase it budgetary allocation by more than 12 percent a year
for social expenditure which it said is too low even by third
world standards, the Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The governments in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan need to
change their spending priorities and reallocate resources to the
social sectors, the bank said in its latest assessment on job,
poverty and working condition in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In India, it said public expenditures on education, health,
nutrition and population programs accounted for a meager 5.2
percent of the gross domestic product in the fiscal year of
1992-93, compared with an average of 6.4 percent for low income
countries and 10 percent for middle income countries.
</P>
<P>
By any standards, this level is too low, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, per capita annual public expenditure on
education in India is about 30 US dollars, while the average for
low income countries is roughly 80 dollars, and per capita
expenditure on health 11 dollars or so while the average for low
income countries is around 16 dollars.
</P>
<P>
To attain average social sector spending norms of low income
countries by the year 2000, India will have to increase its
budgetary allocations to those sectors by more than 12 percent a
year.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Export Volume Down by 8.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's volume of exports
dropped by 8.4 percent in the first five months of the year as
compared with the same period last year, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Government News said that the country's exports
earned 169.9 million U.S. dollars, 15.6 million dollars less than
last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to a price decline on the international
market where the falling prices for copper, molybdenum, wool and
casing for sausage cost Mongolia as much as 32.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Low returns from exports have forced up the exchange rate
between the Mongolian currency of tugrik and the dollar. After
hitting a high of one dollar for 600 tugriks, the exchange rate
has been hovering at 1:560 for the past week.

Beggars and peddlers are darting in and out of subway cars,

On weekends, when tourists and shoppers fill the subway cars,
they come out in force.

have been on the books for years, the New York Times said. The 50
US dollar summonses given panhandlers and peddlers may never be
paid, but they act as a scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence was attributable to the disbanding about a year
ago of a special 10-member team whose mission was to drive
panhandlers and illegal peddlers from the subways.
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged that despite all efforts, the fight is
perpetual. "We have no officers specifically assigned to peddlers
and panhandlers," Chief Donohue complained.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Agree to End Mad Cow Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders
agreed here today to end a three-month dispute with Britain over
the mad cow disease, but set no deadline for lifting the ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The accord, announced at the two-day EU summit which opened
here today, is a response made by the 15-nation bloc to Britain,
which has been demanding for an end to a worldwide ban on its beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major was delighted by the
compromise, saying that he was "very happy" with the agreement
even though it has not set a date for ending the ban on the beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
In return, Britain will stop its non-cooperation policy which
has bothered the EU member countries by vetoing all EU legislative
and policy measures requiring a unanimous vote, British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The deal, said the German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, has
removed "a dark cloud" in the sky over Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the embargo will be eased step by step, in
return for a bigger, verified cull of cattle at risk from bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
The EU announced a worldwide ban on the exports of British
beef after some scientists consider that there may be a link
between mad cow disease and a fatal human brain ailment called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
The deal reached by the EU countries agreed to provide cattle
breeders with an emergency fund of 650 million ECUs (523 million
U.S. dollars), including another 200 million ECUs (161 million
dollars) to compensate the breeders, according to a French
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-summit breakfast with Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi and President of the European Commission Jacques Santer,
Major has indicated that he was willing to accept a deal with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, whose country is currently the EU's rotating president,
then raised the issue at the start of the meeting, hoping that the
mad cow crisis will not prevent the summit from moving forward as
scheduled.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Test Ban Treaty in Current Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- India said on Thursday that it will
not sign the nuclear test ban treaty under negotiation at the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva, eight days before the
deadline for concluding the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Indian Ambassador Arundhati Ghose told a plenary session of the
CD that India cannot subscribe to the treaty in its present form
because "such a treaty is not conceived as a measure towards
universal nuclear disarmament and is not in India's national
security interest."
</P>
<P>
India has insisted from the start of the negotiations, opened
in January 1994, that the test ban treaty should be linked to
global nuclear disarmament and should be viewed as part of a
process aimed at achieving complete elimination of all nuclear
weapons within a "time-bound" framework.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the Conference on Disarmament is set to
conclude on June 28.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Seoul Takes Measures to Combat School Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Park Song-shik, a middle school
student living in South Korea's capital Seoul, has to be escorted
by a bodyguard to school in the morning and back home in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
The bodyguard was employed by Park's parents to protect their
son from growing school violence, which has recently surfaced as a
serious social problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics showed that about a quarter of students in
South Korea's middle and high schools have experienced school
violence such as beatings and extortion of money.
</P>
<P>
The Park family hopes that the local government will be
successful with its latest efforts to root out die-hard school
violence.
</P>
<P>
The city government has recently announced a decision to
introduce what is called a "community service system" for juvenile
delinquents of middle and high schools beginning this semester.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a recommendation by the Education Ministry
for the system under which students committing violence or other
minor offenses will be ordered to serve for a certain period of
time at some facilities such as orphanages, rehabilitation centers
and other social welfare centers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the South Korean government instructed
departments concerned to stage an intensive campaign against
school violence, but little success was achieved.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Seoul, the first South Korean city that has
accepted the government's recommendation for the "community
service system," said that the system will be applied to students
who commit delinquent acts serious enough to warrant suspension
from school.
</P>
<P>
School authorities can order the community service only when it
obtains approval from the parents of students.
</P>
<P>
The length of time for the delinquent students to serve at the
facilities will depend on their repentance, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Oh Myung-sik, a researcher in the Education Ministry, said that
the government recommendation was aimed at improving the guidance
of delinquent students.
</P>
<P>
He said that to serve at those social welfare facilities might
provide those delinquent students with a chance to repent their
past wrongdoings and resolve to become good students.
</P>
<P>
School authorities in South Korea normally forced student
wrong-doers to stay at teachers' office and write a letter of
repentance. They may also force these students to clean restrooms
or the school yard.
</P>
<P>
But such measures seem to have made those students feel
antipathy and have not produced good results.
</P>
<P>
The researcher called the new system a "voluntary community
service," saying that it is different from similar services
ordered as a legal punishment on youths committing crimes.

HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The ruling ZANU PF ordinary

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Africa Not a Forgotten Continent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
told visiting Namibian President Sam Nujoma today that "Africa was
not a forgotten continent."
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said the recent events in some African countries like
Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria and Liberia, which have led to some
negative media reports, should not become a yardstick for judging
the African continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful development in South Africa and southern Africa
has brought about a "positive situation" on that continent, which
was marked by the elimination of racial apartheid, development of
regional cooperation, establishment of democracy and a mechanism
of a market economy, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Namibia's national reconciliation policy,
Kinkel noted that Namibia is one of the south African countries
which has sent a signal of hope for the entire African continent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister announced he will visit South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Botswana in the near future.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Nujoma, who
arrived here on Monday for a five-day visit, that Namibia will
continue to be Germany's major cooperation partner in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Draft Maastricht Revision to Be Ready by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
leaders agreed here today that a special session of the EU
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) be held in October to complete
the first draft of a revised Maastricht Treaty by the end of the
year, Italian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said a consensus was reached at the EU summit
here after Ireland, which is to take over the EU presidency from
Italy on July 1, proposed a special IGC session in October in
Dublin, in addition to the regular semi-annual EU summit to
discuss the reform of the European Commission, the Council of
Ministers and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The future of the EU depends on how the roles and powers of
these three EU institutions are defined and envisaged, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the IGC, launched in Turin in March, has
carried out a profound study of the positions of the member states.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the participants at the Florence
summit agreed that the debate concerning the EU's reform should
move on to the stage of "compromise through negotiation."
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that various degrees of progress made over a
wide range of issues were enough for starting negotiations
immediately.
</P>
<P>
They identified the progress as citizen's fundamental rights,
the mechanisms for a joint foreign and security policy, and joint
justice policy.
</P>
<P>
The IGC is scheduled to complete its work on the Maastricht
Treaty aimed at bringing a political, economic and monetary union
of Europe by late June next year.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa, Cuba Sign Joint Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Affairs
Minister Alfred Nzo and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina
signed a joint communique today in Cape Town, committing
themselves to strengthening relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the five-page document, both ministers stressed the need for
democratisation of the United Nations and its Security Council and
agreed to promote the total elimination of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The communique said South Africa shared other countries'
concern over legislation passed earlier this year by the United
States' congress which permits punitive measures against countries
trading with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Robaina, arrived in South Africa on Wednesday for a five-day
official visit, said the U.S.legislation is clearly intended to
strangle Cuba economically. But he said no country, no matter how
powerful can tell cuba what to do.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N. reform, Robaina said not only should the
Security Council be democratised but the general assembly should
get back the functions which had been taken away from it.
</P>
<P>
Security council seats should not be awarded on the basis of
how powerful a country was. Millions of Latin Americans and
Africans also deserved a seat, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today called for immediate government intervention to save
thousands of jobs in manufacturing industries which are closing.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the ruling party ZNAU PF's 26th Central
Committee Ordinary Session, Mugabe said the government should
establish reasons behind the near collapse of the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
''Such intervention should, however, not be seen as an attempt
by the government to take over the troubled enterprises, but
rather as a responsible measure to save, or in some cases
salvage, them so they can maintain their capacity to operate and
sustain employment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
While seeking to develop the manufacturing sector, he said,
there was also need to reorient the country's economic reform
program with emphasis on substantial employment creation in the
agricultural and informal sectors. enditem

<HEADLINE> Italy's Prime Minister Urges EU to Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the European Union (EU)
summit in Florence, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has urged
the EU to move on despite the many differences among its members.
</P>
<P>
The European Union must move ahead, it simply cannot come to a
halt, the new prime minister told the Florence-based European
University Institute today.
</P>
<P>
He said differences over European Monetary Union (EMU) should
not drag the EU to a standstill as certain EU members could join
the single currency later than others.
</P>
<P>
The European train cannot move at the slowest speed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch a single European currency, the
Euro, by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met
as few members have been able to fulfill the EMU criteria due to
their sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its GDP in order to join the EMU.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Prodi played down the mad cow crisis, which is
expected to be one of the dominant topics at the Florence summit,
saying that "the worst has passed" in the row over the EU-imposed
ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Britain's posture of "non-cooperation" with the EU until the
ban is lifted is worrisome but does not represent overall British
policy and London will contribute to the construction of the EU,
Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that it was necessary to bring Britain back on the
track of cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission imposed a worldwide ban on the export of
British beef and cattle by-products in March after links were
suspected between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the lira, Prodi said the Italian currency
must aim for re-entry into Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, which
Italy quit in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy will hold talks with its EU partners on re-entry.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's speech is seen by observers here as a summary of
Italy's work during its six months holding the rotating presidency
of the EU and set the tone for Friday's Florence summit at the
same time.

CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omer Hassan Ahmed
al-Bashir, in his traditional Sudanese clothes, arrived here this
evening to take part in the Arab summit, which opens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Bashir at the airport. As
a show of friendship, the two presidents embraced despite strained
relations between Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
There has been hope that relations between the two countries,
which deteriorated following an assassination attempt on Mubarak's
life in Addis Ababa last year, may improve after the summit, which
Arab leaders have said is aimed at closing Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and plotting
the assassination attempt. Sudan rejected the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad arrived in Cairo
and held talks with Mubarak at the airport on the Arab summit, the
largest gathering of Arab leaders in six years.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali also arrived here today for the two-day summit,
which draws 21 of the Arab League's 22 members. Iraq was not

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic flame arrived in
Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, Thursday
afternoon on the 54th day of its journey to Atlanta for the
Olympic Games on July 19-August 4.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Baltimore Thursday morning, the torch relay
entered the District of Columbia just before 3:00 p.m. EDT and
immediately began the 7-hour city trek amidst celebrations at
major places.
</P>
<P>
Watched and greated by thousands of people along the sides of
the route, the torch, was carried by some 80 high school students,
senior citizens and former Olympians, of whom more than half are
"community heroes", along the route from East Capital Street
through the D.C. and Arlington County to the White House, the
destination of the day.
</P>
<P>
It also passed through many major places in the city with
celebrations at the Capitol Hill, the Howard University, the
Washington National Cathedral and the Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol Hill, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said "Each of
us, as we watch the flame and watch the runners, will draw a
little bit of that spirit of peaceful competition."
</P>
<P>
AT 10:00 p.m., the torch arrived at the White House, where
President Bill Clinton accepted the torch. Clinton and
torchbearer I. King Jordan, the president of Galluadet University,
a school for the deaf, held the torch in tandem to light a
cauldron on the South Lawn of the White House, where the flame
will remain for the night.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame, a symbol of hope and peace, was lit in
Greece March 30 and arrived in Los Angeles on April 27. From Los
Angeles, it began a 84-day 15,000-mile (2,5000-kilometer) relay
across 42 of the U.S. states carried by 10,000 U.S. and foreign
athletes, school children, students and community heroes.
</P>
<P>
The torch relay will continue Friday morning after a White
House ceremony and will enter Prince William County via Fairfax
County of Virginia.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Public
Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau today pledged there would be
significant moves towards privatisation and restructuring of
state assets before the year-end.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during debate on her department's budget vote, Sigcau
said some entities would be fully privatised, some partially
privatised and some would acquire strategic equity partners.
</P>
<P>
''Clearly we support what the president is saying that he
supports privatisation,'' said the minister, stressing that she
was running a ministry that ''wanted to move''.
</P>
<P>
However, problems with pension funds stood on the way of
restructuring, she added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the restructuring process, the minister
emphasised that privatisation would be protracted and carefully
considered.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, an adviser to the government on the
privatisation process would be appointed next week, she said.
until the work was complete it would be impossible to map out the
exact direction the government would take.
</P>
<P>
The adviser would be responsible for drawing up the model on
which restructuring would be based. enditem

<HEADLINE> South Korea's January-May Trade Deficit Up From 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit during
the first five months this year rose to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars,
15 percent up from the same period of 1995, according to a report

The trade deficit in May amounted to 1.35 billion dollars with

earlier, and 12.68 billion dollars in imports, 7.3 percent up from
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Exports of semiconductor, which accounted for 19.4 percent of
South Korea's total exports in the first quarter of this year,
fell by 1.3 percent in April and 18 percent in May, mainly due to
a fall in prices worldwide. As a result, their contribution to the
total exports decreased to 12.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Steel and chemical product exports also dropped by 33.4 and
12.1 percent last month respectively, while automobiles and
textiles posted increases of 39.1 percent and 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit last year stood at 10.06 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the 6.34 billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased by 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125.06 billion
dollars in 1995, the fastest yearly growth since 36.2 percent was
recorded in 1987, while imports grew even faster at 32 percent to
135.12 billion dollars, the highest since they shot up 35.8
percent in 1979.

<HEADLINE> EUROSTAT: EEA Has Some 9,500 Credit Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Economic Area (EEA)
has almost 9,500 credit institutions, according to a report out
today from EUROSTAT, the Statistical Office of the European
Communities in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The data, for 1994, show that the bulk are in Germany (around
3,700), Italy (1,000), France (600) and the United Kingdom (500).
</P>
<P>
Germany has 40 percent of the EEA total. Many are small saving
banks or cooperative banks of local importance.
</P>
<P>
To the French figure (and the EEA total) must be added 1,000
"other credit granting activities." These include specialized
credit institutions, such as those for regional development and
small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The smallest number are in Greece and Ireland, in each around
50 active in the market. Branches of foreign enterprises are often
included in these figures.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the five years to 1994 the number of
EEA credit institutions fell, often through mergers and
acquisitions. These often affect smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 French credit institutions are recorded as earning over
347 billion ECUs (267 billion US dollars) in interest and
commission, an annual growth of some 23 percent from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Figures for Germany were some 265 billion ECUs (204 billion
dollars) and around 6 percent annual growth.
</P>
<P>
The UK, almost 128 billion ECUs (98 billion dollars), saw an
annual fall of almost 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
EEA countries comprise 15 European Union member states and
Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

<HEADLINE> Europol Deal Reached After Ending Mad Cow Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders
today reached an agreement on setting up Europol, billed as a sort
of European FBI, after Britain ended its policy of non-cooperation
over mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The agreement envisages an opt-out for Britain, which will not
be bound by rulings from the European Court of Justice on disputes
between states and between citizens and states.
</P>
<P>
The accord is a follow-up to a framework agreement worked out
some weeks ago, which was shelved when Britain began vetoing all
decisions requiring unanimity in a bid to secure a phased lifting
of an EU ban on its beef exports imposed on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Britain settled its dispute over mad cow disease with the EU
shortly after the Florence summit opened, thus ending its
non-cooperation policy within the 15-nation bloc.

<HEADLINE> "Counter-Summit" Threatens to Boycott Revised EU Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- About 70 non-governmental
bodies from the European Union (EU) today threatened to boycott
reforms emerging from the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference
(IGC) unless the revised Maastricht Treaty contains stronger
provisions on transparency and democracy in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organizations ended a "counter-summit" to
the EU Summit in Florence today and issued a final communique
calling for a "generalized " extension of qualified majority
voting (QMV) and the co-decision powers of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The aim would be to "place citizens at the heart of the EU and
solve the problem of European democracy," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Counter-summit Chairman Pier Virgilio Dastoli said the IGC does
not appear to be moving in this direction.
</P>
<P>
Unless these goals are achieved, the NGOs said they would
organize a "refusal front" in member states aimed at marshaling
public opinion to reject the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty
that emerges from the IGC.
</P>
<P>
An extension of the QMV is strongly opposed by Britain, which
is seeking in the IGC negotiations to retain the veto powers of
individual nations.
</P>
<P>
The counter-summit was also attended by Irish European Affairs
Minister Gay Mitchell, who voiced support for transparency in the
work of the Council of Ministers and declared that the IGC will
produce a Union with a "quasi-federalist" structure.

<HEADLINE> Israel Makes No Decision on Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today held discussions with Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, Foreign Minister David Levy and other senior army
officers on the Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron, but so far
no decision has been made, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the army's opinion is that Israeli troops
would redeploy from most parts of the West Bank town, while
leaving all security responsibilities in Israel's hand.
</P>
<P>
According to this plan, the areas evacuated by the Israeli
army would become Zone B, similar to the Zone B areas in the West
Bank where Palestinian police and international observers will be
allowed in, but Israel maintains over all security controls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Hebron today, stones and bottles were thrown at
Israeli vehicles, and the army detained some Palestinian suspects
for questioning, and later released them.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh told
Israel Radio today that redeployment is "a test case" for the
Israeli new government, warning if the Israeli army does not pull
out, there would be grave consequences.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process cannot proceed unless there is a
redeployment," said Natsheh, and only after the redeployment,
"the Palestinians and other Arab leaders will be convinced that
Netanyahu will go on in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israeli army was supposed to pull back from
about 85 percent of Hebron by March 28. However, following a
series of suicide bombing attacks against Israel by Hamas
activists in late February and early March, former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank town to be handed over to the
Palestinian National Authority, in accordance with the Oslo peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had already completed its redeployments in
other major Palestinian towns of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah,
Bethlehem, Kalikilya and Tulkarm in the West Bank by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
In earlier May, the Labor-led Israeli government announced that
the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the
May 29 general elections due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Netanyahu, said after the
elections that he would leave the decision of the redeployment in
Hebron to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood after
the 1967 Middle East war, during which Israel took over the town
from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu has said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Clashes With Congress Over Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton is
prepared to veto the fiscal 1997 foreign aid bill if Congress
does not provide funding to implement an agreement with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The accord concerns the construction of civilian nuclear power
plants, the Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher revealed the president's
possible move when he had a luncheon meeting with Washington Post
editors and reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives and Senate foreign aid
appropriators have recently decided to cut the president's 25
million dollar request for the program to 13 million, which left
the U.S. government in disarray over how to meet the U.S.
commitment on the program.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said Congress' decision was "one of the most
short-sighted things that Congress could possibly do." He told the
newspaper that Clinton had authorized the Office of Management and
Budget to notify Congress "he might have to veto the bill."
</P>
<P>
The United States reached the accord last year with the DPRK to
replace the latter's graphite nuclear reactors with civilian
nuclear power plants by providing 500,000 metric tons of fuel oil
annually during the 10 years or more when Japan and South Korea
undertake the construction of the projects.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has asked Congress for 25 million dollars to pay for
the U.S. contribution in fiscal 1997, in the expectation that his
allies would match the U.S. funds. Many congressional Republicans,
however, have criticized it as overly generous to Pyongyang.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders to Urge Israel to Continue Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders will reaffirm their
commitment to peace and urge Israel, which has had a new government
headed by the hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu, to do the same without
delay, according to a draft of the final communique to be issued
at the close of an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Local media obtained copies of the draft, which was discussed
and finalized by Arab foreign ministers here today.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit to be held Saturday and Sunday is aimed at
closing the Arab rank and supporting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The draft final communique urges Israel to honor and implement
all agreements with the Arabs and seriously commit itself to the
bases on which the Mideast peace process was built.
</P>
<P>
The draft states that the kind of peace the Arabs seek is the
one premised on the land-for-peace principle, the terms of
reference of the Madrid conference that began the peace process in
1991, and the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It asserts that the Palestinian cause is the core and crux of
the Middle East conflict and the center of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The draft communique demands that Israel fully withdraw from
all territories it occupied in 1967, including east Jerusalem, the
Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It calls upon the United States and Russia, the co-sponsors of
the Mideast peace, the international community and the European
Union to back up the peace process and guarantee its continuity on
the same bases agreed, along with ensuring the implementation of
signed treaties and agreements.
</P>
<P>
The draft communique points out that terrorism is a phenomenon
that must be confronted worldwide so as not to affect the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that all the countries in the region should join
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and that Israel must subject
its nuclear facilities to international inspection and join the
drive to clear the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction as a
prerequisite for security, stability and peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The draft also dwells on the means of closing the Arab rank,
clearing the Arab atmosphere and effecting Arab solidarity.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Arab Summit Aimed at Forging United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab summit, the largest
gathering of Arab leaders in six years, is aimed at forging a
common Arab stand to support the Middle East peace process based
on the principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Though Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a number of Arab
officials have denied that the summit was called in reaction to
the new Israeli government, the tough stand of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the peace process is apparently the
main reason for Arab leaders to meet at this particular time.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, which draws 21 of the 22 members of the
Cairo-based Arab League, will open Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was elected prime minister in the Israeli
elections late last month, has vowed to take a tougher line than
that of his predecessor Shimon Peres in Israel's peace
negotiations with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement Tuesday, Netanyahu reiterated that his
new government will not accept an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital, will not return the Golan Heights
to Syria and will not even discuss the future status of Jerusalem
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states feared that Netanyahu's hardline policy would
jeopardize the Arab-Israeli peace process based on the principle
of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
In this time of crisis, as what Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid said, the Arabs stand together. "The situation
is seriously threatening the peace process and we should work to
maintain the momentum and accelerate the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is a message that "the Arabs will not accept
anything but the principle of land-for-peace," said the Arab
League chief.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders, after their two-day meeting, are expected to
issue a statement to voice Arab states' keenness on continuing the
peace process and urge the Israeli government to honor the
principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Reviving Arab solidarity, an issue which is interrelated with
that of supporting the Middle East peace process, will be the
other main purport of the summit, the first since Arab leaders met
on August 10, 1990, when the Arab world split over Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.

Over 50,000 members of their families have also encamped with

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Arab Summit Aimed at Forging United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past few years, a number of Arab leaders have called
for overcoming the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to close
Arab ranks in the face of new regional and international
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have hailed the summit as the first step toward
Arab solidarity, but the absence of Iraq from the gathering
suggests that realizing the goal still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not invited to participate in the summit apparently
because the deep rifts ensuing from the Gulf crisis have not been
healed yet.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Baghdad is excluded to avoid any snags that
could impede the convocation of the long-awaited summit.
"Undoubtedly, the situation is extremely sensitive and the wounds
of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait haven't been healed yet."
</P>
<P>
However, there is hope for resolving other inter-Arab disputes
like Syria's estranged relations with Jordan and the Palestinians
for signing separate peace accords with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has also pinned hopes on the summit to improve relations
with Egypt, which has accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and
plotting the foiled assassination attempt on Mubarak's life last
year. But it seems that Egypt has not been ready to reconcile with
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The goal of realizing Arab solidarity becomes a more uphill
task as it is surely impossible for the summit to discuss and
resolve all issues of the Arab world within a short period of two
days.
</P>
<P>
But holding the summit after six years of division is in itself
quite an accomplishment. As Nabil Fahmy, political advisor to
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, put it, the summit reflects
the fact that there are common interests in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It may lay a foundation and develop a real process for "better
Arab-Arab cooperation and coordination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Irrespective of its possible results, the gathering of Arab
leaders will at least show to the Israelis and the world that the
Arabs are really a force to be reckoned with.

CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Planning Minister of the Palestinian
Authority (PA) Nabil Shaath today called on Israel to adhere to
the peace process and Israeli-Arab reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, a member of PA President Yasser Arafat's delegation
that arrived here today to attend a pan-Arab summit, said that the
summit is very important for moulding a unified Arab stance on the
peace process, especially in view of the latest developments in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arab countries link the land-for-peace
principle and the establishment of an independent Palestine state
to the normalization of relations in light of the Israel acts.
</P>
<P>
On the way of dealing with Benjamin Netanyahu's government
following the Likud government's recent policy statement before
the Knesset, Shaath said such a statement is likely to turn peace
notions upside down.
</P>
<P>
He said that the summit, which will open here Saturday, will
call for achieving a comprehensive peace based on international
legitimacy and the Oslo accords signed between the Palestinians
and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's acting Prime
Minister Sishayi Nxumalo today called for an end to a civil
servants strike which he described as unconstitutional, reported
the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's civil servants resolved on Thursday to join a
strike by the country's teachers who had stayed away since last
Friday in support of a demand for an 18 percent pay increase.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants joined the strike after giving the
government one week to reconsider its offer of 9.9 percent pay
hike.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo called on the Swazi nation in Mbabene not to allow
themselves to be "hijacked by radical elements of their
irresponsible action on the Swazi people at large."
</P>
<P>
He said the strikers were unconcerned about the effects the
strike would have on investor confidence, economic growth and the
already unacceptable high unemployment rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated the Swazi government's willingness to
meet the striking civil servants and teachers in an attempt to
resolve the issues that provoked the strike.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government was unable to budge from the
increase offered to teachers and civil servants because the funds
were not available.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Chief Denies Grachev's Coup Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Security Council chief
Alexander Lebed believes that neither sacked Defense Minister
Pavel Grachev nor his inner circle had attempted a military coup,
his spokesman Vladimr Titov said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Itar-Tass, Titov quoted his boss, Lebed,
as saying that "reporters made a mountain out of a molehill
again."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, some people in Grachev's entourage tried to
provoke the army into showing signs of dissatisfaction with his
dismissal, initiating messages in his support.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the campaign was aimed at exerting
psychological pressure on President Boris Yeltsin, who dismissed
Grachev but appointed Lebed as the powerful Security Council
secretary and his national security assistant Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of presidential elections on June 16,
Yeltsin came first with 35.28 percent of the votes. He was
followed by Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov with 32.04
percent.
</P>
<P>
As none of the 10 candidates won over 50 percent of the votes,
the top two, Yeltsin and Zyuganov, should battle it out in the
second round on July 3, in which Lebed, who won the strong third
place with 14.52 percent in the first round, could play allegedly a
decisive role.
</P>
<P>
Titov said such actions of the above-mentioned military might
have aggravated the already difficult situation inside Russia.
</P>
<P>
Lebed "definitely cut short the attempts to initiate this
information and propaganda wave of discontent. Besides, he intends
to charge the generals (involved) the cost of government
telegrams," Titov added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebed himself, addressing the State Duma (lower
house of parliament) earlier today, stressed that the "Russian
Armed Forces are in full order." "I do not understand why this
issue is continually brought up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Duma deputies about his plans to fight corruption,
he said he came to speak about the specific problem, whereas "the
questions are coming on a most broad scope of issues."

Saturday is not directed against anyone or against Israel.

regarding peace, the president said: "We should not pass premature
judgments."

"We hope that the peace process would proceed ahead and we call
upon Israel to pursue the implementation of its agreements as this
is the core and the crux of the peace process," Mubarak added.

Netanyahu, the president said he does not want to go into
details until he meets with Netanyahu and gets to know him in
person.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Boasts of His Economic Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- President Clinton said today
that his administration has surpassed expectations in cutting
budget deficit and creating new jobs since taking office.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Workers' in Chicago, Clinton said that when he ran for
president four years ago he submitted an economic plan that would
cut the deficit by half and create 8 million jobs in four years.
</P>
<P>
"We cut the deficit by more than half and the economy has not
produced 8 million new jobs, it has produced 9.7 million new
jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department earlier this month announced
revisions to prior data that boost the Clinton administration's
net job-growth figure to 9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Clinton aides, backed by government statistics, said job
creation has averaged more than 2.4 million a year over the past
four years, that business failures have declined by 19 percent and
that measurements of consumer confidence have increased by 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
But President Clinton's boast was rebuffed by his Republican
rival in presidential campaign, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Dole's spokeswoman Christina Martin said today that "what does
he have to say to the people of California, North Carolina and
Florida, who are continuing to see increases in jobless claims."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton was busy with a series of fund-raising events
for the Democratic National Committee and Chicago is the city
where Democrats will formally nominate Clinton to run for the next
U.S. presidency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Preparing to Adjusts Mideast Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. may have to adjust its
strategy for peace in the Middle East to accommodate Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's views, U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher told the Associated Press in a interview on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But its basis remains Israel's swapping occupied land for Arab
recognition, he said, as he was preparing for talks with Netanyahu
next Tuesday on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu offered this week unconditional negotiations with the
Arabs but also has declared he would neither relinquish Golan
Heights in exchange for a peace treaty with Syria nor agree to
establishment of a state for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's purpose of the Middle East tour next week is to
"understand how he (Netanyahu) intends to approach the matter".
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State made it clear that the goal will not
change while "the route to those goals will have to reflect his
plans".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. goal is to "find the most effective way to achieve the
goals that we've established in the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Associated Press that he would give Netanyahu "a
full opportunity to indicate what his approach is" during his
first face-to-face exchange with Netanyahu since his victory over
Shimon Peres in the May 29 election.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The South African Chamber of
Business (SACOB) today warned that the government's privatization
program would have to be speedily implemented as time was not on
the side of South Africa to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the pledge by Public Enterprises Minister Stella
Sigcau that there would be significant moves towards
privatization and restructuring of state assets before the end of
the year, the SACOB said the announcement showed a new commitment
to the principle of privatization.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the SACOB said the government was
clearly sensitive to the guidelines agreed on earlier this year
by government and labour in the National Framework Agreement
(NFA).
</P>
<P>
"Privatization is a key element in future economic performance
in terms of the government's latest macro-economic strategy," the
chamber said, adding it would be necessary for privatization to
be taken beyond the NFA.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it would be necessary to ensure that the conditions
under which privatization took place "are sufficiently attractive
to give the right signals to the investment community here and
abroad."
</P>
<P>
SACOB also stressed that the restructuring of state assets was
an essential part of South Africa's search for "global
competitiveness".

CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Abadullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said here today
that his country's participation in the Cairo Arab summit is out
of its keenness on supporting Arab causes and protecting Arab
countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon arrival at the Cairo International Airport, the
crown prince, who is leading Kuwait's delegation to the Arab
summit starting Saturday, expressed hope that the conference would
help enhance the Middle East peace process and realize some
progress on all peace tracks according to international legitimacy
and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Kuwait's Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and
Acting Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Al-Dakhil held a press
conference in Cairo to reaffirm Kuwait's support to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his visualization of an Arab reconciliation,
the acting foreign minister said that there was no doubt that the
Iraqi aggression on Kuwait was the reason of the disputes among
the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iraq to implement U.N. resolutions and release all
prisoners of war, adding that the implementation of
U.N. resolutions was the basis of any reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has still not forgiven Iraq for its invasion in 1990,
and this is part of the reason why Iraq was not invited to the
Cairo summit.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has applauded Iraq's absence, signifying that the Arab
world has yet to heal the deep rifts ensuing from the Gulf crisis
in 1990-1991.

WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) --The forthcoming G-7 Summit in
Lyon of France, which was termed as "employment summit", will have
no specific proposals "of great magnitude", U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said today.
</P>
<P>
In remarks at a press briefing, Rubin stated that attributed to
preventive actions by the world's most industrialized nations, he
does not expect "any shocks to" global markets this year.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Group of Seven nations which is made up by the
United States, France, Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy and Canada
will meet July 26-30 in Lyon, France to seek solutions for
unemployment and review actions taken to reduce risk to financial
markets. Russia is to participate in political consultations.
</P>
<P>
A study paper on foreign exchange rates is expected to be
released at the summit as an addition to the leaders' final
statement.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of the World Bank and IMF began two years ago at the
G-7 summit in Naples, Italy, and then adopted at the 1995 meeting
in Halifax, Nova Scotia of Canada. The reforms focus on the IMF
adopting stronger disclosure standards.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders are expected to review or push forward
initiatives on strong disclosure standards through the IMF,
increase the resources available to the IMF in financial crises by
raising the share from new country participants. "Countries will
express their concerns to us,"' Rubin noted. "But there are always
issues that we don't agree on."
</P>
<P>
Other topics on the G-7 agenda will be discussing China's
future acceptance into the World Trade Organization, dealing with
organized crime and money laundering, pushing development in
war-torn Bosnia- Herzegovina and plans for the first WTO summit in
Singapore in December.
</P>
<P>
About future G-7 meetings, The U.S. Treasury Secretary forecast

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Denounces Serb Visa Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The UN Higher Commissioner for
Refugees(UNHCR) on Saturday criticized the Bosnian Serbs' policy
to demand visas from Yugoslav citizens of Muslim and Croat origin
wishing to enter into the Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said that the Serb authorities,
which put their policy into effect Wednesday, "apparently decided
to extend its principles of ethnic purity to its visa policy".
</P>
<P>
The new policy requires Yugoslav Muslims and Croats to apply
for visas from Serb representative offices in Yugoslavia, while
Male Yugoslavs of Muslim and Croat origin with age between 16 and
60 will not be allowed to enter the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR regards the policy "as a violation of all civilized
standards of behavior", said Janowski.
</P>
<P>
"This basically is trying to break down citizens of a country
into ethnic categories and that country is not even Bosnia and
Hercegovina," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Bosnia is divided into two
entities, namely The Bosnian (Muslim-Croat) Federation and
Republika Srpska and only the central government above two
entities is entitled to issue visas.

<HEADLINE> Personnel Reshuffle Planned Beforehand: Chernomyrdin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today said that the latest reshuffle in the
presidential team had been planned beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of three top security officials was described as
aimed at substantially increasing the effectiveness of all links
in state power.
</P>
<P>
"The renovation of the president's team at this pivotal point
of presidential elections was planned beforehand," the prime
minister told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, four days after the first-round presidential
elections, President Boris Yeltsin sacked First Deputy Prime
Minister Oleg Soskovets, Federal Security Service chief Mikhail
Barsukov and his chief bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov.
</P>
<P>
The president also dismissed his Defense Minister Pavel Grachev
on Tuesday and named former general Alexander Lebed as the new
military chief, who finished third behind Yeltsin and Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov in Sunday's polls.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin would not have been the president if he had not taken
such measures," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He explained: "Some leaders carried out inadmissible actions
which sometimes bordered on cynicism."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the entire government will be
reorganized.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The main criterion in this process will be the
authority and high professionalism of leaders and their ability to
stay aloof from departmental interests."
</P>
<P>
"Not only such quality as personal loyalty comes to the fore,
but also new ideas, intelligence, desire and ability to move
ahead," Chernomyrdin added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the runoff elections scheduled for July 3, the
prime minister said: "Russia's new president will be the one who
wins the runoff."
</P>
<P>
As to a possible inclusion of liberal economist Grigory
Yavlinsky and his bloc members in the government, Chernomyrdin
said that he would welcome "representatives of any party and
movement who have professional skills and know their business."

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Relations Across Taiwan Straits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese spokesman today urged
leaders of the Taiwan authorities to respond in action to the
eight-point proposition put forward by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on issues concerning negotiations to "end the state
of hostility across the Straits" and the prospect of visiting the
mainland, as referred to by Taiwan's leader in a speech on May 20,
the spokesman said in an interview with Xinhua today that
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems" remains the
basic policy of the Chinese government for resolving the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's important speech on the Taiwan issue,
delivered on January 30 last year, represents a programmatic
document governing the settlement of the Taiwan issue, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and that of the State Council,
said that as early as on New Year's Day, 1979, the National
People's Congress Standing Committee put forward a proposal to end
military confrontation across the Taiwan Straits through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of the 1990s we have suggested time and
again that the two sides hold talks on formally ending the state
of hostility across the Straits, and gradually realizing a
peaceful reunification," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman cited President Jiang as saying that under the
premise of one China, all issues could be discussed, including the
form of official talks between the two sides of the Straits, so as
to find a way considered appropriate by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang put forward the proposal in a report to the Fourteenth
National Congress of Communist Party of China in October, 1992.
</P>
<P>
On January 30 last year, Jiang reaffirmed the proposal on
holding talks, saying that as the first step, negotiations should
be held and an agreement reached on officially ending the state of
hostility between the two sides of the Straits, under the
principle of one China, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On that basis, the two sides should undertake jointly to
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and map
out plans for future development of their relations, the spokesman
cited Jiang as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of visiting the mainland by leaders of the Taiwan
authorities, Jiang said on the same occasion that "leaders of the
Taiwan authorities are welcome to pay visits in appropriate
capacities. We are also ready to accept invitations from the
Taiwan side to visit Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"The affairs of the Chinese people should be handled by
ourselves, something that does not take an international occasion
to accomplish," the spokesman quoted Jiang's as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that following the struggle of anti-splittism
and anti-Taiwan independence, and faced with the strong demand of
Taiwan compatriots, leaders of the Taiwan authorities had to make
some kind of response to the above-mentioned proposal made by
President Jiang Zemin, and were forced to give up some unrealistic
pre-conditions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taiwan authorities had sincerity indeed, they should
lose no time in taking practical steps, and as the first step,
hold talks with us on formally ending the state of hostility
across the Straits and on other political topics, under the
principle of one China," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Hekmatyar to Take Oath as Afghan Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Afghan presidential spokesman
Abdul Aziz Murad today confirmed that Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, head of
Hezb-i-Islami, will enter Kabul on Wednesday to take oath as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Kabul, Murad said, "we confirm the date
that has been announced by the Hezb spokesman and welcome the
arrival of Hekmatyar and his top officials in the capital after a
break of some years."
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for Hekmatyar to officially enter
the Afghan capital since 1979 when Soviet troops invaded
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989 and the collapse
of Soviet-backed Najibullah regime in 1992, Hekmatyar was sworn in
as prime minister of a coalition government in 1993 according to
the then Islamabad Accord signed by various guerrilla factions.
</P>
<P>
However, he never entered Kabul and occupied the office fearing
life attempt by troops loyal to Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar quit the post after participating in an abortive coup
against Rabbani on January 1, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Relations Across Taiwan Straits (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When asked to comment on the claim that the Taiwan authorities
deliberately sidestepped the "one China" principle, and the direct
exchanges of mail services, trade, air and shipping services in the
speech, which aroused widespread repercussions in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao, the spokesman said, the "one China" principle is
the prerequisite and basis for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan authorities did not mention "one China"
during the recent speech and evaded the fact that Taiwan
is part of China's territory, and instead played tricks with
concept of "popular sovereignty" in attempt to divide China's
territory.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasised that the "promotion of pragmatic
diplomacy" is actually the continuation of Taiwan's upholding of
"two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" policies.
</P>
<P>
He said that "our struggle against splittism and 'independence
of Taiwan' will never stop, so long as the Taiwan authorities does
not stop its splittist activities."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the direct exchanges of mail, trade, air
and shipping services are the pressing common aspirations of the
people across the straits.
</P>
<P>
He urged Taiwan authorities to give much consideration to
people's interests and lift man-made barriers, in order to realize
the direct exchanges as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment that many Taiwan political personages
want to come to the mainland to exchange views on political
issues, the spokesman said, Beijing welcomes various parties and
people from all walks of life in Taiwan to exchange views with
mainland departments and personages concerned on relations across
the straits, and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on last year's struggle against splittism and
"Taiwan independence," the spokesman said the struggle against
the "Taiwan independence" launched since last June "has fully
shown the determination and capability of the Chinese people, the
Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government in
safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and
they have heavily cracked down on the splitting forces in Taiwan
and exerted great influence for the promotion of the peaceful
reunification."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "our struggle against the 'Taiwan
independence' and splittism is not one between democracy and
anti-democracy, but a struggle between those advocating 'Taiwan
independence' and splittism and those opposing 'Taiwan
independence' and splittism.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Taiwan also overreaches itself by claiming
that it will "guide the development direction of the mainland."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities ignored the fact that the mainland has been
enjoying a political stability, has witnessed great economic
growth and has strengthened its comprehensive national strength,
in addition to the daily improving of its international status and
its constantly growing influence in the international community
since its reform and opening up to the outside world 18 years ago,
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"We put our hopes on the Taiwan compatriots," the spokesman
said, urging the people across the straits, compatriots in Hong
Kong and Macao, and all other overseas compatriots to further
close their ranks and oppose splittism and cast aside the "Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
He also called for increased economic cooperation and exchanges
in various fields across the straits, an early realization of
direct exchanges of mail, trade, air and shipping services, and
continued struggle for the reunification of China.

Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
According to a Foreign Ministry press release, Kadirgamar

<HEADLINE> EC Plan to Create Jobs Falls on Deaf Ear at EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- European leaders attending
the EU summit here today refused to accept a financial plan
proposed by European Commission President Jacques Santer to
allocate more money for large transport networks in an effort to
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
Germany in particular rejected Santer's proposal to raise 1
billion ECUs (1.24 billion U.S. dollars) between 1997 and 1999 for
priority rail and road networks.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden are also among those who
said "no" to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Santer, in a formal statement, expressed his regret over the
setback of his "pact of confidence for employment," a
multi-faceted strategy to cut Europe's high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
"I have wanted the European Council to take a decision now on
the financing of the Trans-European Networks (TENs) but a small
number of delegations were not yet ready to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many member states of the European Union are unwilling to
commit more fund to such project, which has long been a
controversial issue for the 15-member organization that has been
troubled with the burden of heavy joblessness.
</P>
<P>
More than 18 million people are now out of work in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The TENs financing plan is one of the few areas of Santer's
pact where fresh money is actually proposed to battle Europe's
job problem.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of the initiative call on EU leaders to speed up
work towards completing the single market and to the growing
insecurity among average citizens.
</P>
<P>
Santer's plan was dimmed as the row between Britain and the EU
over the "mad cow" disease highlighted the two-day affair.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Demand Removal of Karadzic From Political Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15 European
Union countries today demanded that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic be removed from his presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
In a draft declaration issued at the two-day EU summit, the EU
leaders stressed that the Dayton peace accord excludes all those
indicted for war crimes from participating in the Bosnian
elections slated for this fall.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, (the EU) reiterates the demand of the Peace
Implementation Council on 14 June for Mr. Karadzic's removal from
the political scene," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic was nominated as a candidate for president on Thursday
by his followers in Pale.
</P>
<P>
But the Bosnian Serb leader was indicted along with his
military chief Ratko Mladic for crimes against humanity in the
three-year-and-a-half war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders threw their weight behind the recommendation to
postpone the Bosnian elections and recommended the elections be
held on September 14, which is the latest date permitted under the
Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
The EU has pledged to provide monitoring and supervision for
the Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are also concerned with the June 30 elections in
the Bosnian city of Mostar.
</P>
<P>
"Following successful elections, and provided that the newly
elected leadership show genuine commitment to the reunification of
the city and cooperation with the European Union Administration of
Mostar, the European Union will consider extending the mandate of
the (administration) for a further limited period," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led multinational Peace Implementation Force has a
one-year mandate and is scheduled to withdraw from Bosnia this
December.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President: Arabs to Stick to "Land-for- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
said here today that the Arab states will stick to the "land-for-
peace" principle and will not accept any new formula for the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said in an address to a closed-door session of the Arab
summit that Arab states will also adhere to all the U.N. Security
Council resolutions related to the Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
His address was made available to the press covering the
summit, the first of its kind in six years.
</P>
<P>
His remarks was apparently in reaction to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent policy statement that Israel
opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital and a return of the Golan Heights to Syria, a
stand which indicates that the new Israeli government will not
accept the principle of "land-for-peace," agreed upon at the 1991
Madrid Middle East peace conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arabs call on Israel to continue the peace
process based on this principle.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has repeatedly demanded that Israeli troops withdraw
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi stressed that the aim for Arab states to negotiate with
Israel is to recover the Israeli-occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arabs believe in the sponsors of the Middle
East peace process, namely the United States and Russia, and call
on them to continue supporting efforts to establish a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, who is attending the summit with 13 other Arab heads of
state, added that the Arab states call for the return of
Palestinian refugees to their homeland and a political solution
to the issue of Jerusalem as they are the common rights of the
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The common rights, he said, also include rendering Middle
East free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to Israel, he said that anyone who hopes
for peace should not refuse joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi also spoke of the need to deter any further attacks
from Israel on Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Arab summit, which opened here earlier today, is
focusing on two main issues -- closing Arab ranks and supporting
the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Official Says Strikes Irresponsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Interior Minister
Nasirullah Babar today strongly criticized the opposition's
decision to resort to strikes in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Islamabad, Babar said that strikes could
achieve nothing except paralyze the normal life of people.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has called for a country-wide
strike on Sunday to protest against the newly-announced federal
budget for fiscal year 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
"Strikes damage a country's economy and, as we have seen in
Karachi, they do not lead to solution of the problems," said
Babar.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is their democratic right, it is not justified
when the government is prepared to accommodate the genuine
proposals of the opposition in the budget," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition has been trying to dislodge the
government and now they have decided to adopt methods that will
benefit neither themselves nor the people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the government would take necessary
measures to ensure peace in the country if the opposition forced
people to join the strike or undermined the law and order
situation.
</P>
<P>
Many people and organizations in the country's business circle
have declared that they will not participate in the strike, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the official Associated Press of Pakistan
also showed that a majority of the Pakistanis are not interested
in strikes.

<HEADLINE> Indian Cabinet to Be Expanded Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- India's three-week-old United
Front government is expected to be expanded next Friday, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
To a swearing-in ceremony for new ministers, President Shankar
Dayal Sharma, who is on a two-week visit to Shimla, Himachal
Pradesh, is cutting short his stay there and returning to New
Delhi on Friday morning, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The much-waited expansion of the government led by H.D. Deve
Gowda was delayed reportedly due to differences on the Finance
Ministry's austerity measures announced on Monday within the
13-party United Front.
</P>
<P>
The austerity measures, including streamlining the government
staff and schemes, are designed to cut the fiscal deficit to below
four percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Bells rang at St. George Church,
located on Moscow's Poklonnaya Hill, and thousands of Muscovites
laid flowers and pine branches at the Victory Monument there, to
mark the Day of Memory and Mourning.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Russian President Boris Yeltsin, accompanied
by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other high-ranking
officials, laid flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier outside
the Kremlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
The tributes of respect were for those who died during the

launched an attack on the Soviet Union, starting a war which
claimed the lives of dozens of millions of the Soviet people.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential decree Yeltsin has declared June 22 the Day
of Rememberance and Mourning, continuing a noble tradition started
by Peter I for paying tributes of respect to the dead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to war veterans, near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
Yeltsin said he was leaving for Brest, Belarus, directly from the
tomb to take part in ceremonies marking the 55th anniversary of
the heroic defense of the Brest Fortress.
</P>
<P>
TV stations in the country today suspended all entertainment
programs to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the tradition will help promote the solidarity
of the whole society on the basis of eternal values, and hand down
the memory of the heroic deeds of the liberators to the next
generations of Russians.

<HEADLINE> 46 Poor Counties in Hebei Become Better off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The average annual income of
people in 46 poverty-stricken counties in north China's Hebei
Province has increased 150 percent in five years, thanks to an
improvement in agriculture production.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that annual income per capita in the 46 poor
counties has risen from 359 yuan five years ago to the present 900
yuan (about 108 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 the province has poured 2.2 billion yuan to aid the
poor, bringing in an additional 2.2 million mu (about 147,000
hectares) of farmland, and over 9,000 kilometers of roadways to
less developed areas.
</P>
<P>
So far all of the 46 counties have access to electricity and
highways, while the province has provided adequate food and
clothing for over five million people, who used to live in
destitution.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the province has tried to bail the poor out of
difficulty by developing local economies instead of merely
providing relief.
</P>
<P>
Apart from attracting investment and striving for new projects,
the province has paid attention to ameliorating low-yield
farmland, sinking water wells, looking for supplies of
electricity, building water conservancy projects, all geared to
increasing agricultural production output.
</P>
<P>
The province has also developed planting and breeding on large
tracts of land, and has built a number of commodity production
bases. As a result nearly 1,600 villages in poverty have developed
pillar industries and key products.

<HEADLINE> Moussa Welcomes Israeli FM's Softened Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
welcomed Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy's softened stand on
the the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to calm Arab leaders, the Israeli new foreign
minister told Israeli Television Friday that he will leave "to
some extent" open the possibility of giving up at least part of
the Golan Heights if it helps Israel achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
His statement was in contrast with the announced policy
guidlines of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu, who had
strongly rejected returning the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the 1,180-square-kilometer heights in the 1967
war with its Arab neighbors. Damascus has long demanded for the
return of the strategic land.
</P>
<P>
The previous Israeli government led by the Labor party
initially linked the issue to the normalization of relations, but
later it eventually recognized Syria's sovereignty over the Golan
provided proper security arrangements are made.
</P>
<P>
The swing to power of the hardline Likud in the May 29
elections in Israel has worried Damascus, which now saw little
hope for an early settlement of its dispute with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the inaugural session of the Arab
summit here today, Moussa said Netanyahu's policy guidelines are
"very negative" as it threatened the Middle East peace process
based on land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He said Levy's statement has pacified Arab apprehensions on
this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Arab leaders met here for a two-day Arab summit aimed
at closing Arab ranks and forging a united Arab front to support
the peace process based on the principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders will issue a final communique after two days
of mostly closed-door sessions to reaffirm their commitment to
peace and urge Israel to do the same without delay.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders in six years,
was called by Egypt, Syria an Saudi Arabia after the election of
right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel's new prime
minister late last month.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit Expected to Promote Sino-Spanish Economic Co-op </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Spanish business people in China
have expressed wishes that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
forthcoming visit to Spain will help promote the development of
economic and trade links.
</P>
<P>
Enrique Madrigal, chief representative in Beijing of the
International Union Techniques of Spain, said that Jiang's visit
demonstrates the good political and trade relations between the
two countries, which will help the development of bilateral trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
The organisation started cooperation with China in the '80s,
and has participated in the construction of several large projects
in China, involving a Spanish investment of over 800 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Madrigal said that his company pays attention to the new
projects which are to be started during China's Ninth Five-Year
Plan, adding that his organisations hopes that it can provide
technology and experiences in various aspects for the projects.
</P>
<P>
Chief representative of the Spanish Exterior Bank to Beijing,
Victor Ochoa said that Jiang's visit to Spain is very important
and conducive to economic exchanges of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that foreign investors will find it much easier for
them to conduct business in China, with China's further opening to
the outside world, and the establishment and improvement of the
new banking system.
</P>
<P>
In addition Spanish diplomatic envoys have emphasized the
significance of Jiang's visit, especially when the new Spanish
Government and more Spanish enterprises are showing increasing
interest in conducting political and economic cooperation with
Asia, China in particular.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Spanish trade volumes in 1993 were one billion US dollars
and the figure rose to 1.9 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, Spain has provided China with total
loans of 2.5 billion US dollars for many projects covering
chemicals, telecommunications, energy and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Spain is planning to invest in more than 270 projects in China,
with a total contracted investment of 373 million US dollars.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Silicon Valley's ardor for President Clinton has cooled,
largely because he has vetoed legislation intended to cut down on
lawsuits by shareholders, legislation that high-tech companies
desperately wanted.
</P>
<P>
-- The diverse characteristics of the church fires in the
Carolinas alone illustrate the daunting tasks faced by Federal and
local investigators searching for causes to nearly three dozen
suspected arsons at black sanctuaries in the South.

The Washington Post:

yesterday to investigate the FBI files controversy, concentrating
first on the former White House aide who obtained confidential
reports about hundreds of Republicans by claiming they needed
access to the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>

their months-long struggle over health care and minimum wage

Addressing the 13th National Consultative Assembly here,
Mugabe said the indigenous people will be equipped to enable them
to acquire shares in parastatals, financial institutions and
various multinational organisations.
</P>
<P>
ESAP ii, yet to be launched, comes after the conclusion of the
first phase launched in 1991 and affected the majority of the
10.5 million people in the country. At least 55,000 workers lost
their jobs during the ESAP i.
</P>
<P>
''During ESAP ii, our goal is to empower our indigenous people
in order to strengthen their foothold in the stgrategic sectorfs
of our economy,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
''In this regard, the government will ensure that the
privatisation of parastatals addresses this aspect by making sure
that the indigenous people are given the necessary instruments
with which to secure meaningful share-holding in parastatals,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government's present investment drive should
also assist the indigenous business through joint-ventures and
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
''The government is currently looking into mechanisms of
mobilising resources at affordable rates that will assist
indigenous people to embark on new projects and possibly take
over ailing companies through worker buy-outs or on joint venture
basis,'' Mugabe said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Terms Arab Summit as "Going Smoothly" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said that the Arab summit, which opened here today, was
"going smoothly" and its final communique was still under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
He said that positive steps have been realized by the Arab
leaders at the summit, the first one in six years.
</P>
<P>
"This is a basic step toward activating joint Arab action,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give more details of the closed-door
session, only saying that the leaders will continue to debate
what was on the agenda, mainly Arab solidarity and the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described as "very good one" the tripartite summit
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and King Hussein of Jordan, held this morning prior to
the opening of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive development taking place in the
conference," said Moussa, who was bombarded by questions raised
by journalists.
</P>
<P>
Syria estranged its relations with Jordan and the
Palestinians after the two parties separately signed peace
agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, whose country was the first Arab one to make peace
with Israel, brought about the meeting between King Hussein and
al-Assad in an attempt to overcome their differences.
</P>
<P>
As a another sign of reconciliation, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat met with al-Assad with the presence of Mubarak late
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the two tripartite meetings were "absolutely
fruitful," describing them as "a good beginning which opened the
door for understanding."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Arafat demanded at the summit that the final
communique include a call for the recognition of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, Moussa said that
Arafat would address this issue in this afternoon's session.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak opened at noon the Arab summit, which was
delayed for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Mubarak called for Arab solidarity
and urged Israel to cooperate with the Arabs to achieve a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, whose country
holds the current presidency of the 22-member Arab League, also
took the floor following Mubarak's address to highlight the
importance of the summit. Then the summit went into the closed-
door session.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders will issue a final communique after two days of
mostly closed-door sessions to reaffirm their commitment to peace
and urge Israel to do the same without delay.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders in six
years, was called by Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia after the
election of right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as
Israel's new prime minister late last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that his new Israeli government opposes
the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital, the return of the Golan Heights to Syria and discussion
on the future status of Jerusalem with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that such a stand will jeopardize the Middle East
peace process, Arab leaders hope that a united Arab stand on
peace will press Israel to honor and implement all agreements
with the Arabs and seriously commit itself to the bases on which
the peace process was built.
</P>
<P>
Besides the main issues of Arab solidarity and the peace
process, other topics being discussed at the summit include
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Palestinian refugees, the situation in Iraq, terrorism and
relations between the Arabs and Turkey, according to sources
close to the summit.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen heads of state are attending the summit. Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi arrived in Cairo for the summit almost in
the last minute.

TOKYO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of registered alien
residents in Japan reached 1,362,371 by the end of 1995,
accounting for a record 1.09 percent of the country's total
population, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics announced by the Justice
Ministry's Immigration Bureau, the ratio of Koreans from South
Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the
alien population fell below 50 percent for the first time to 48.9
percent from 80.3 percent in 1985 and 64 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said a possible reason for the decline was the
decrease of permanent residents and marriages to Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Residents from South Korea and the DPRK totaled 666,000, down
1.5 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Most Green Province to Become Even Greener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's greenest province - Fujian
- has vowed to become even greener in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The east China province has made great efforts to build city
and town forests since 1989. The provincial government has set a
quota on government at city or county levels to ensure that they
can attain their afforestation goals.
</P>
<P>
As a result almost 67,000 hectares of green land have been
newly planted. The green coverage rate in 11 cities and 46
counties has risen from 12 percent in 1989 to over 25 percent,
with each individual having a green space of 4.1 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The province has set a new target that by 2000 urban green
coverage rates will reach 30 percent so that each person has a
green area of five square meters.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governor Chen Mingyi has urged Fuzhou, Xiamen,
Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Putian to become green cities of national
standards by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen has called for measures to design urban afforestation
scientifically, taking advantage of every inch of idle land and
motivating the initiative of individuals, enterprises and
institutions to plant trees and flowers.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Guanyang County in the mountainous
northern area of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has become the
last county to be connected to the region's mobile phone network.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the region established a mobile phone network with 140
base stations, 4,906 channels and 128,000 subscribers, according
to People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Muslim Rebel Leader Wants Police Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Muslim Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) has rejected the government's
proposal for an administrative body headed by the MNLF in Mindanao
unless it is vested with police powers, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Muslim rebel group started their two-day
informal peace talks in Davao city in the southern Philippines on
Friday after a three-day delay.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the government) are serious in their desire for
peace, then they must ensure the instrumentality they want to put
in our hands will be capable of matching this gargantuan task that
will be assigned to us," said MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari.
</P>
<P>
"The MNLF is ready to make accommodations on any other
remaining issues, but not on this fundamental issue of internal
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed the establishment of a southern
Philippine council for peace and development, which is to be
headed by Misuari, to serve as a two-year transitory mechanism
before a new autonomous government is set up in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The council will oversee peace and economic development
programs in 13 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao and Palawan,
listed as "areas of autonomy" in the Tripoli agreement of 1976.
</P>
<P>
The informal talks, if successful, are expected to pave the way
for formal peace negotiations between the two sides in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The on-going talks will focus on what are considered the
toughest issues of the entire negotiations -- the transitional
implementing structure and mechanism, the integration of the MNLF
forces into the government troops and the setting up of a regional
security force.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has been fighting for autonomy in the southern
Philippines during the last two decades, reportedly claiming tens
of thousands of lives.

<HEADLINE> Town of Swallows on Tropic of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people are being
plagued by mosquitoes, and persecuted by their nasty bites.
</P>
<P>
But in China's Mojiang township - which lies on the Tropic of
Cancer - a strange phenomenon has given locals a respite from the
insect invaders.
</P>
<P>
Up to half a million swallows have decided that Mojiang is the
place to be on a warm summer's day.
</P>
<P>
And while the acrobatic antics of the swallows amuse townsfolk
they are delighted that their feathered visitors thrive on a diet
- of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
At dusk local folk are entertained to a wonderful sight in the
skies: tens of thousands of swallows are perched on four power
lines extending as long as 600 meters in Mojiang town - altitude
of 1,300 meters.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the local environmental protection bureau said
that swallows started to swarm in the town in 1990. With great
care and enthusiasm of the people, the number of swallows keeps
growing.
</P>
<P>
People estimate that there are 500,000 swallows in the town,
seat of Mojiang Hani Autonomous County.
</P>
<P>
Every year the swallows arrive in the town in late
Autumn and leave in the July-August period when the rainy season
starts.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the mild climate attracts so
many swallows. The county's average temperature throughout the
year is 20 degrees centigrade, with temperatures on the hottest
days standing at 27-28 degrees and on the coldest days 11-12
degrees, both quite suitable for the survival of swallows.
</P>
<P>
The swallows take a rest in the town at night and go out to
hunt insects in nearby mountains or farmlands, living a regular
life. When it gets dark, swallows take to the town as their
paradise, sweeping overhead in the low sky, and then suddenly
flying high, and as fast as lightning.
</P>
<P>
Because of the swallows few mosquitos plague local
citizens - the daily 'air show' of the amazing swallows turning
Mojiang into a mosquito-free zone.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Tackle Water Shortage in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a large-scale
research program aimed at tackling the serious water shortage in
northwestern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Researchers pointed out that while water resources in the
region is distributed unevenly, vast potentials exit in terms of
the proportion of the total amount of and per capita water
resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are proposing that the region's water resources
utilized in a coordinated way by diverting water between different
places, building water conservancy projects and establishing
information systems.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages in the region have aroused close attention from
senior Chinese leaders. President Jiang Zemin has urged relevant
departments to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The region, consisting of the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and
Qinghai and Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions,
covers one-third of the country's total area. Coal reserves
account for 50 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Several industrial bases have been built up there,
concentrating on energy resources, non-ferrous metals, grain and
the petroleum industry. However water shortages have damaged the
local ecological environment and blocked social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that desert area in the region accounts for
more than 90 percent of the country's total, with the desertified
area increasing at an average rate of 0.2 to 0.3 square kilometers
each year.
</P>
<P>
Due to improper use of water resources, the brined area has
reached 30 million mu (1.8 million hectares) in the region, with
large numbers of poplar trees dying along the banks of the lower
reaches of the Tarim River, and some local lakes becoming too
salty.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Play Major Role in Political, Economic Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawyers have played an
increasingly bigger role in all aspects of social life since their
reappearance in 1980, a senior justice official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Geng, vice-minister of justice said the government will
improve the management over the legal profession under a new law on
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"The current management system on lawyers will be reformed to
protect the legitimate rights and interests of lawyers, and
improved control over lawyers will be taken according to the new
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was speaking at a national work conference on
implementing the new lawyers' law effective on January 1 next
year. The meeting was attended by heads of provincial judicial
departments.
</P>
<P>
China abolished the system of lawyers in 1959. But in the past
16 years, the concept of lawyers has developed from being "legal
service workers of the state" to "legal service workers" who can
work without being affiliated to the government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Justice Ministry said that lawyers
nationwide have handled 2.5 million criminal and 2.7 million civil
cases in the previous 16 years.
</P>
<P>
They handled over 200,000 criminal and 310,000 civil cases last
year, 70,000 and 30,000 up from 1993, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers act as consultants in legal affairs for over 230,000
government bodies and enterprises today, and have handled 3.07
million cases in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
They have participated in the policy-making processes of
governments and enterprises and promoted the realization of rule
of law in the country, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers handled 320,000 economic lawsuits and 450,000
non-lawsuit economic affairs in 1995, representing rises of 90,000
and 100,000 cases respectively from 1993.
</P>
<P>
And lawyers specializing in specific fields have helped to
standardize the development of new fledgling industries and
economic sectors, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lawyers have also dealt with 140,000 case with overseas
elements involved. Some lawyers have successfully handled major
cases of anti-dumping, international investment, intellectual
property rights protection and trade, protecting state
interests, and the interests of parties involved both at home and
from abroad, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
The number of lawyers has risen to over 90,000 and number of
law firms of various kinds of ownership is now more than 7,200.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also pointed out that problems still exist in the legal
service industry.
</P>
<P>
"A small number of them are poor in proficiency, others have
bad morals, and even knowingly break the law, which draws fierce
criticism from society," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The rights and responsibilities of lawyers should be
integrated at the same time as implementing the law to protect
lawyers' rights and at the same time improve the management of
them for the healthy development of the whole industry," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou's Environment Protection Keeps Pace with Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province, is among the country's top ten cities in
environmental protection, even though its economy grew at 23.6
percent from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Its per capita GDP exceeded 12,000 yuan in 1995, the second
highest among Chinese cities, but the city did not achieve its
rapid economic growth at the expense of environmental quality,
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
The amount of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the city's
air decreased in 1995, and the amount of harmful chemicals in
rivers in the city's vicinity also dropped.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that strict enforcement of environmental
protection laws has played a vital role in the co-ordination of
environmental protection and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Businesses have to obtain waste-disposal certificates from the
city's environmental protection departments, which conduct regular
inspections. Those found discharging waste at levels that exceed
standards will be required to treat pollution problems or be shut
down.
</P>
<P>
The investment in a good environment has paid off. From 1991
to 1995, the city's industrial enterprises put 350 million yuan
into controlling pollution, and the city government raised 1.7
billion yuan for improving the city's infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali Pledges to Run for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali has pledged to stand for a second five-year term
despite U.S. opposition, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The General Anzeiger newspaper quoted the U.N. chief as saying
in an interview that all his predecessors had served two terms as
the U.N. head.
</P>
<P>
"Can't I follow suit simply because I am the first African
(secretary-general)?" the 73-year-old Egyptian asked.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was surprised by a quick U.S. response of
opposition to his decision to run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman first announced Boutros-Ghali's decision late
on Wednesday, but a U.S. official soon declared that Washington
would not back him. The White House later officially confirmed
the stance.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that in the past countries would only
express their attitudes just prior to the elections.
Boutros-Ghali's current term expires in another six months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that what he would be running for was not
the post itself but the capability as the U.N. chief to complete
the political and structural reforms of the international
organization.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two-thirds of the U.N. member states are
third world countries which have required the U.N. to solve
various problems.
</P>
<P>
"I have to serve a second term so as to finish the task I have
started," Boutros-Ghali was quoted as so saying.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the world will not have lasting peace if the
North-South problem is not solved.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali was in Bonn to inaugurate two U.N. offices.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Herbert Schmeulling said on Friday
that the federal government has not yet decided on whether to
support Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
it was a long-established tradition that the secretary-general
serves a second term as the head of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also praised Boutros-Ghali for what he has
achieved under difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Russia criticized the U.S. position but did not make known its
own attitude.
</P>
<P>
The 15-seat U.N. Security Council normally nominates a new
candidate for the post in the final months of the incumbent's
tenure in office. The candidate is usually approved by the
185-member General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Closing Arab Ranks, Urges Israel to Honor Peace Commitments (by Liu Rong and Meng Xin) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
stressed here today the importance of closing Arab ranks and
urged Israel to strictly fulfill its pledges and commitments
within the context of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at a pan-Arab summit, which is being
held at the Cairo International Conference Center, Mubarak
said the expanded summit is aimed at realizing the aspirations
of the masses and expressing the Arab nation's determination
to close ranks.
</P>
<P>
He called for adopting a unified Arab stand and formulate an
integrated vision of the future with all its dangers, aspirations
and challenges.
</P>
<P>
The summit was held in response to a call made by a
tripartite summit of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said: "The issue of paramount importance to all of
us and to our peoples is to close Arab ranks, clear the
atmosphere and enhance Arab solidarity and cooperation within
the context of a unified goal and destiny, in order to
confront the great challenges ahead of us."
</P>
<P>
He said the Arabs should discuss together and move toward
defending their national security as one man in facing dangers
and threats without an encroachment on the rights and interests of
others.
</P>
<P>
"We are a nation that bears no grudge against anyone for
we believe in co-existence in justice with other nations," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
A rift has arisen among the Arab countries because
of Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and other inter-Arab
disputes. Iraq was not invited to attend the current summit,
which drew 21 of the Arab League's 22 member states.
</P>
<P>
"The current international regional changes make it incumbent
upon us to adopt a unified stand and coordinate our efforts in a
bid to reach a clear-cut strategy of our collective relations
with the new world and the huge economic blocs which emerged
during the past few years," said Mubarak, who is the host of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to a proposal he presented in March 1995
to prepare a new Arab code of honor to evade devastating
differences in the Arab family in the future and contain any
disputes so as to avoid further escalation of tension.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mubarak reaffirmed that peace to the Arab nation is an
inalienable stragetic goal. He put forward some points to clarify
his envision of peace:
</P>
<P>
-- First, "we seek to realize a comprehensive and just
peace which will continue until the goal agreed upon by the
parties is attained;"
</P>
<P>
-- Secondly, the negotiations cannot be carried out in a
vacuum, but rather are governed by the Madrid framework, namely,
the commitment to U.N. Security Council's Resolutions 242, 338
and 425 as well as the principle of "land for peace;"
</P>
<P>
-- Thirdly, it is unacceptable for any party to seek to
destroy this legal fact;
</P>
<P>
-- Fourthly, no party has the right to rule out or avoid
tackling any point in the negotiations;
</P>
<P>
-- Fifthly, goodwill in negotiations requires all parties
to commit themselves to the honest and accurate implementation
of any agreements reached;
</P>
<P>
-- Sixthly, "we ask Israel ... to strictly fulfill its
pledges and commitments within the context of the peace
process, away from any threats or attempts to impose a
status quo, or adopting extremist stances that do not abide
by concluded agreements;"
</P>
<P>
-- Seventhly, realizing an equitable and comprehensive peace is
the sole means to achieve security and stability for all
parties.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said: "We call upon the new Israeli government to
cooperate with us so as to complete the peace process without
slackness or hesitation. We call upon the Israeli government to
prove its commitment to real peace known to the international
community, not more and not less."
</P>
<P>
In Israel, hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu has won the May
29 elections to replace Shimon Peres as prime minister. The
new Israeli government has pledged to continue the Middle East
peace process with neighboring Arab states.
</P>
<P>
But, in the meantime, the Netanyahu government opposes the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state and the return
of the Golan Heights to Syria, and insists on a united Jerusalem
under Israel's sole sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Arab summit is expected to issue a final
communique, which will be publicized upon its conclusion late
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Girl's Invention to Save One Million Tons of Water Monthly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A 15-year-old Chinese girl is
flushed with success after inventing a simple device that can save
her city a million tons of water every month.
</P>
<P>
Fan Yukun has developed a simple switching system which
re-directs waste kitchen water from the plughole to the toilet -
saving masses of household water. Now her invention has been
patented.
</P>
<P>
Fan dreamed up the invention which is very simple but
successful, China Construction News has reported.
</P>
<P>
Fan, a junior secondary school student in Ji'nan, capital of
east China's Shandong Province, uses waste water from the kitchen
to flush the toilet.
</P>
<P>
Her method was to build an extra drainage pipe on the kitchen
sink so that water soiled by washing rice, vegetables, bowls,
hands, and clothes can flow directly to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
Her system allows people to switch water from washing pans,
pots, or fish, which cannot be recycled for re-use, to the toilet,
using the added drainage pipe.
</P>
<P>
Technology of the invention, which has been patented, is
capable of making use of 80 percent of waste water for a second
time, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 Chinese farmers have
obtained farming technician certificates, known as "green
certificates".
</P>
<P>
China started to issue green certificates to farmers in 1990
and so far two million farmers across the country have attended
relevant training.
</P>
<P>
The "Green Certificate Project", carried out by the Ministry of
Agriculture, covers farming, animal husbandry, water conservancy,
machine management, rural cooperative economy administration,
rural energy resources, rural environmental protection and
forestry.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-year Plan period (1996-2000), China plans
for another ten million farmers to receive "green certificate"
training.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Green certificates will be issued to 2.5
million farmers, who will form a contingent of personnel
specializing in farming technology, Vice Minister of Agriculture
Zhang Yanxi told a national conference.

<HEADLINE> 73 Overseas Law Firms Allowed to Open Branches in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released today by the
Chinese Ministry of Justice show that 73 overseas law firms have
been allowed to open branch offices in China.
</P>
<P>
And seven Chinese law firms have been given permits to establish
branch offices overseas, including the United States, Russia
and Singapore, said Zhang Geng, vice-minister of justice, at a
conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"The exchanges and cooperation of China's legal service
industry with overseas are expanding steadily," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of Chinese law firms have relationships of
cooperation with overseas counterparts, more and more Chinese
lawyers are sent abroad to study, and many overseas lawyers are
coming to Chinese law firms to work, according to the
vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
Chinese judicial administrative departments have in the past
ten years received over 5,000 lawyers from 50 countries and
regions, according to statistics. Many influential international
conferences on law have been held in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that such exchanges and cooperation have helped
promote China's economic and trade relations with foreign
countries and regions, and introduce China's achievements in legal
system construction and its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts to quicken the pace of reunification of the
motherland, 18 lawyers resident in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
have been granted law qualification certificates of the People's
Republic of China after taking legal examinations.

<HEADLINE> Rent-An-Alligator Scheme Starts In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research center is having
so much success with the threatened Chinese alligators that it is
renting them out.
</P>
<P>
The rent-a-'gator scheme has ensured that people in cities and
provinces throughout China can see the animals in their own zoos
and wildlife centers.
</P>
<P>
The Director of the Chinese Alligators Research Center in
Anhui Province claims that the center is now capable of breeding
1,000 Chinese alligators a year, and has mapped out an ambitious
plan to utilize the animal commercially.
</P>
<P>
Amazingly only 500 of the alligators survived in the 1970s,
threatening the snapper with extinction.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983, the center's aim was to save the Chinese
alligator. So far a tourist district, which boasts Chinese
Alligators and other rare animals, has been set up at the
center. It has played host to millions of tourists from both at
home and abroad in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The center has rented 400 Chinese alligators, and sold 130
alligators to dozens of cities and provinces in the country,
marking a good start of the commercial development of the
animal.

<HEADLINE> Tunisian President Urges Israel to Continue Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cairo, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine al Abidine
Ben Ali urged Israel here today to continue the Middle East peace
process, with a strong warning of joint Arab actions in case of
its failure.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call while addressing the opening
ceremony of a pan-Arab summit at the International Conference
Center here.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is also current chairman of the 22-nation
Arab League, said: "There is no question of allowing mistaken
calculations to take it backward or to deviate it from the right
path."
</P>
<P>
He asked the new Israeli government to comply with U.N.
Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425, which embody the
principle of "trading land for peace."
</P>
<P>
After years of confrontation, the previous Israeli government
of the central-left Labor Party accepted the formula four years
ago, but the hardline Likud-led new government, formed after the
May 29 elections, has rejected it outright.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian president said Israel today bears a special
responsibility for confirming these principles and renewing its
commitment to the agreements with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable that the implications on this subject
in the electoral discourse and the working program of the
new Israeli cabinet prevent the state from honoring the
commitments it has made to pursue the path that leads to
peace and security for all," the president added.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the peace process. But in
the meantime, it opposes the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state, the return of Golan Heights to Syrian and
the sharing of Jerusalem with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The change in Israeli policy has provoked fears among the
Arab leaders who agreed to come here for the two-day summit
to work out a unified stance toward the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali called on the United States and Russia, co-sponsors of
the 1991 Madrid Conference which set the the Middle East peace
process in motion, to assume their responsibilities in pushing
the peace process forward and "preventing any further
backsliding."
</P>
<P>
He warned that their failure could result only in a loss
of credibility, a resurgence of tension and confrontation and
a rise to violence and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It is indispensable that we arm ourselves against these
eventualities with calm and determination, but at the same
time with the force of those who know that they are strong
in their rights and capable of defending them," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Arab reconciliation, the other main theme of the summit,
the president urged for careful study of the situation and
wide-ranging consultations among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
With no specific references to any regional states, he
reaffirmed the principles of respect of sovereignty,
non-interference in internal affairs, commitment to good
neighborliness and settlement of disputes through political
channels.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sympathy with the Iraqi people, he said that to
put an end to their current suffering is "indispensable in
consolidating the process of peace and stability in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not invited to the summit to head off possible
controversies. Some gulf countries remain reluctant to forgive
Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. However, Egyptian
officials said that the return of Iraq to the Arab fold
might be discussed during the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian president also called for intensive efforts to
settle the dispute between Libya and some western powers, which
have been enforcing an international embargo against Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was among the top Arab
participants here when the Tunisian President addressing the
session. He arrived here this morning only hours before the
summit convened.
</P>
<P>
The summit began close sessions after the opening ceremony.
A final communique is expected to be released at the end
of the gathering late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first Arab summit in six years, with 14 heads of
state participating.

<HEADLINE> Kodak to Expand Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Kodak Co. is planning to
 set up a manufacturing base in the Chinese inland area, it is
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Siewert, vice-president of Kodak and head of its China
operations, said that China was the sixth largest market for
consumer photography products in the world, and in the next five
years, it could become the second or third largest.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kodak's 1995 revenue rose 60 percent in China, as
the market for photography of all kinds grew some 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kodak's 1995 revenues increased 10 percent in the world to 14.98
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kodak has invested about 20 million US dollars in two equipment
manufacturing facilities in China.
</P>
<P>
Last month, it set up a new factory in Shanghai's Pudong New
Area to make cameras for sale in China and in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Another factory in Pudong makes electronic flashes Kodak then
exports to build into the disposable cameras it makes in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Kodak now makes film at eight locations around the world, two
of them in the United States. The nearest supplier for China is
in Australia and the transport time required affects film quality
and ties up a lot of capital in inventory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Siewert said that in the future, his company wants to make
whole camera in China, including film, adding that it hopes to set
up new factories or buy existing companies to manufacture film,
paper, chemicals, film processing equipment and cameras there.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Go Tougher Towards Fake Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Standard Orgainisation of
Nigeria (SON) is considering the option of prosecuting culprits
if the current spate of importation and manufacture of fake
industrial items continues.
</P>
<P>
The SON might take a step further than the current seizure and
destruction of fake products since it has not served as enough
deterrent to culprits, said Joseph Abalaka, Director-General of
SON, on Friday when about 1,476 pieces of substandard electric
iron were to be destroyed here.
</P>
<P>
The electric irons were reportedly imported from Britain and
the defects include the exposure of users to the risks of
electric shock.
</P>
<P>
In the past SON had been concealing the identity of culprits
from the public to save them from embarrassment. But the practice
has helped encourage the importation and manufacture of fake
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
According to Abalaka, his organisation has now resolved to
disclose the identities of the culprits since they have not
reciprocated the SON's gesture.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the commitment of his organisation to closely
monitor the quality fo products locally manufactured or imported.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Frequent Jordanian, US Military Exercises Aim at Strategic Partnership (by Wen Xinnian) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Frequent U.S.-Jordanian military
exercises are apparently aimed at forging closer ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. marines and equipment started to arrive in Jordan Friday
ahead of a joint military exercises with the Jordanian Armed
Forces beginning movements in Qatraneh south of Amman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. ships, the USS Tarawa, the USS Duluth and the USS
Rushmore, docked Friday at Aqaba, a Red Sea port city of Jordan,
and unloading operation started immediately, the English-language
daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three vessels carried around 4,000 marines and sailors,
and about 1,400 of them are expected to take part in the June 23 -
July 10 exercises codenamed "Infinite Moonlight '96."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces are part of the 13th Marines Expeditionary
Unit, a component of the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
About the same number of Jordanian service personnel will take
part in the exercises, which are part of U.S.-Jordanian military
cooperation launched in 1981.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known whether the exercises are to be
protracted.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement released last Wednesday by the U.S. and
Jordan said that the exercises will be staged from June 25 to
July 10.
</P>
<P>
This war game, the first this year attended by U.S. marines,
will allow "U.S. Navy amphibious forces and Jordanian Armed
Forces to train side-by-side, strengthening the bilateral military
relations and enhancing coordination and cooperation between
U.S. and Jordanian forces," a joint Jordanian-American statement
said last week.
</P>
<P>
"The exercise is part of the ongoing bilateral exercise
program between the military forces of the U.S. Central Command
and the military forces of Jordan," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Infinite Moonlight '96" will be the second Jordanian-American
joint military exercises this year after the armed forces of the
two countries staged a joint training exercise in early May at an
air-force base north of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Advanced jet fighters, including F-16s that Jordan is expected
to receive this year from Washington as part of the U.S. military
assistance to Jordan, took part in the exercises codenamed "Eager
Tiger."

<P>
Meanwhile, a U.S. air force unit was preparing to leave
Jordan after taking part in the May exercises and also flying
surveillance flights over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The "Air Expeditionary Force (AEF)," which consists of 34
U.S. fighter jets and mid-air fuelling aircraft, also offered to
train Jordanian air force pilots on F-16s warplanes ahead of
the expected delivery of 16 aircraft of the same type to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the AEF unit helped Jordan upgrade facilities at
the air base to receive and accommodate F-16 planes, leaving
behind part of the equipment it brought with it.
</P>
<P>
Amman and Washington have beefed up their military cooperation
since Jordan signed its historic peace treaty with Israel in
October, 1994, ending their 46-year state of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Jordan shifted its policy towards Iraq last August following
the defection of Hussein Kamel, the son-in-law of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Kamel's defection to Jordan, the U.S. and Jordan
launched a joint military exercise aimed at defusing the alleged
threatening of Iraq's retaliation against Jordan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry visited Jordan in January
and announced a package of U.S. military assistance, including
the F-16s warplanes.
</P>
<P>
General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staff, discussed Jordanian-American military cooperation during
his visit here this month.
</P>
<P>
He indicated during his talks here that armored tanks,
helicopters and military equipment were part of the
U.S. assistance to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Another senior U.S. Defense Department official,
Under-Secretary for Personnel and Readiness Edwin Dorn, also
traveled to Jordan last week and held talks with Jordan's Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Field Marshal Abdul Hafez Mirai on
U.S.-Jordanian military ties.
</P>
<P>
Observers and diplomats here noted that the strengthened
U.S.-Jordanian military ties are part of U.S. efforts to allow
Jordan to play a more important role in its post-Gulf War Middle
East political layout.
</P>
<P>
They also believed that Jordan sought to establish a strategic
partnership with the U.S., designed to figure itself in a high
position in the Middle East politics with the support of
Washington.

In addition, six new schools will join in the
government-subsidized free education program, making the number of
free education schools reach 45. A total of 31,300 students,
accounting for 59.81 percent of all in the new semester, will

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Call for Arab Solidarity in Cairo (by Meng Xin (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called for Arab solidarity and urged Israel to cooperate
with the Arabs to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in his opening address to a
pan-Arab summit, which is aimed at closing Arab ranks and forging
a united Arab front to support the peace process based on the
principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Mubarak said that the summit comes to affirm
that the Arab nation is "on the level of shouldering responsibility
in face of international changes and variables as well as other
problems."
</P>
<P>
"Contacts among us in deliberations to call and prepare for
the summit have revealed that the issue of paramount
importance to all of us and to our peoples, is to close
Arab ranks, clear the atmosphere and enhance Arab solidarity
and cooperation within the context of a unified goal and
destiny," he said.
</P>
<P>
All these are aimed to confront the "great challenges" ahead,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are a nation that bears no grudge against anyone for we
believe in co-existence in justice with other nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the Israeli government to prove its commitment to
real peace known to the international community, not more, not
less," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders will issue a final communique after two days
of mostly closed-door sessions to reaffirm their commitment to
peace and urge Israel to do the same without delay.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders in six
years, was called by Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia after the
election of right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as
Israel's new prime minister late last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that his new Israeli government opposes
the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital, will not return the Golan Heights to Syria and even
will not discuss the future status of Jerusalem with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that such a stand will jeopardize the Middle East
peace process, Arab leaders hope that the united Arab stand on
peace will press Israel to honor and implement all agreements it
has signed with the Arabs and seriously commit itself to the
bases on which the peace process is built.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that the summit came "at the right time to protect
here national objectives. It also provides a categorical proof of
the vitality of this great nation which was and still is the best
nation on earth, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Arab nation has proved that it does not give in to
disruption and partition, nor does it remain inefficient and
paralyzed or hesitant to play its role in formulating a world that
moves to an era, full of exciting developments and deep and
radical changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak urged Israel to honor its agreements signed with the
Arabs and the U.N. Security Council resolutions, namely
Resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the principle of land-for-peace,
on which the peace process is based.
</P>
<P>
"We ask Israel ... to strictly fulfill its pledges and
commitments within the context of the peace process, away from
any threats or attempts to impose a status quo, or adopting
extremist stances that do not abide by concluded agreements,"
said Mubarak, who was the first of the Arab leaders to take the
floor as the host.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, peace is a legal and factual state that can
only be achieved by the will of both parties, mutual wish
and equal endeavor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which drew 21 of the Arab League's 22
members, is also aimed at bringing solidarity to the Arab
world, which has been divided by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and other inter-Arab disputes.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Iraq from the summit may suggest that the
Arab world will still face an uphill task to close its
ranks, but there is hope for resolving other inter-Arab
disputes at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have hailed the summit as the first step in
achieving Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"The current international and regional changes make it
incumbent upon us to adopt a unified stand and coordinate
our efforts in a bid to reach a clear-cut strategy of our
collective relations with the new world and the huge economic
blocs which emerged in the past few years," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of reconciliation, King Hussein of Jordan met
with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad today prior to the
summit, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with Assad
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Syria estranged its relations with Jordan and the Palestinians
because the two parties signed separate peace agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Besides the main issues of Arab solidarity and the peace
process, other topics to be discussed at the summit include
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Palestinian refugees, the situation in Iraq, terrorism and
relations between the Arabs and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen heads of state are attending the summit, with
other participating countries being represented by crown princes
or government officials. The Somali ambassador to the Arab
League is leading his country's delegation to the summit due
to the chaotic situation back home.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi arrived in Cairo for the
summit almost in the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister Arrives in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto arrived in South Korea's southern resort island of Cheju
today for a two-day working visit to the country, during which he
will hold summit talks with President Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
At their summit in Cheju tomorrow, Kim and Hashimoto will
mainly discuss the successful co-hosting of the 2002 World Cup
soccer finals, the latest developments on the Korean Peninsula and
in Northeast Asia as well as future-oriented relationship between
Seoul and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, the International Football Federation decided in
Zurich, Switzerland, that South Korea and Japan will co-host the
2002 World Cup football finals.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the spirit of cooperation vital for a successful
World Cup, the two leaders will agree to boost personnel and
cultural exchanges between the two countries, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
They will also exchange views on the two countries' setting up
maritime boundaries of the exclusive economic zones, a new
bilateral fishing regime and joint historical research, the
officials added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the issue of Korean "comfort women" during World
War II, Kim and Hashimoto are likely to reach a consensus on how
to deal with the issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is expected to express his apologies for Japan's
wrongdoings during the 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were
recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves -- for
the Japanese imperial army as it swept through East and Southeast
Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that what the South Korean government wants
is not a verbal apology by Japanese leaders, but "action" to
satisfy the victims.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the two leaders will try to find ways
during their summit talks to improve the Seoul-Tokyo ties which
have been hurt recently by the territorial rights issue involving
Tokto Island, called Takeshima in Japanese, in the East Sea (Sea
of Japan).
</P>
<P>
Kim and Hashimoto met each other on March 2 this year in
Thailand on the sidelines of the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
and discussed general diplomatic issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This visit marks Hashimoto's second trip to South Korea. In
November 1990, he visited Seoul as finance minister.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Stop Dam Project If Court Advises So </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government will
order all work to be stopped on the Bakun hydro-electric dam
project if the attorney-general so advises, Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said here today.
</P>
<P>
"If the attorney-general advises to stop today, we will issue
the directive, that is we can give the developers a day or two to
settle it," he said at a press gathering.
</P>
<P>
The dam project, costing 13.6 billion Malaysian Ringgit (some
5.44 billion US dollars) and scheduled to be completed in 2002, is
being built in Sungai Balui, Sarawak state.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Quality Amendment Order 1995, which allowed the
Sarawak state government to approve the environment impact
assessment for the Bakun project, was announced to be invalid by
the Kuala Lumpur High Court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Involving the clearing of 69,000 hectares of land, the dam is
Malaysia's largest privatized project and only second to China's
Three Gorges Dam in the world.
</P>
<P>
The dam project, with a total capacity of 2,400 megawatts, is
expected to generate between 1,500 to 1,800 megawatts of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Some non-governmental organizations in Malaysia said the
project would destroy the environment in the region and urged the
developers to stop work immediately after the high court rule.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government would abide by the court's decision
on the status of the project, Anwar nevertheless pointed out that
the court ruled on purely technical grounds and did not order the
project to be stopped.

<HEADLINE> Iran Takes Skeptical Attitude toward Cairo Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran maintains a skeptical
attitude towards the Cairo Summit which opened today in Cairo,
Egypt, saying all Arab states are pursuing their own interests.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government kept silent on the Cairo
Summit. However, two local morning dailies published an editorial
and a commentary, respectively, reflecting the view of the Iranian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Abrar noted in the commentary that each Arab
country, those in the frontline in particular, pursue their own
goals. The PLO is after a Palestinian state headquartered in
Jerusalem, and Syria and Lebanon are interested in the withdrawal
of the Israeli forces from the Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Damascus is pursuing a more important goal from
this summit, and that is the realization of the Arab world's
leadership by Syria.
</P>
<P>
English daily Iran News stressed in the editorial that Arab
leaders should take a clear stand before the Moslem world and the
U.S.-Israeli alliance, demonstrating that justice is the solution
to the problem that has plagued the Middle East for half a
century.
</P>
<P>
The daily noted that the two-day summit is to review the
Middle East situation now facing a serious crisis as the Israeli
new government takes a hard stance towards the peace
process. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declined to
fulfill the commitments made by his predecessor to Israel's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that some analysts are skeptical of the ability
of the gathering to produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said "some observers believe that a broader-based
summit under the framework of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) would have had a better impact in countering the
potential Israeli danger which is designed to be not only against
the Arabs but also against the entire Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it added, sympathizers of the summit believe that
Arab leaders could succeed if serious and sincere decisions are
made to adopt a future strategy for countering the danger from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It concluded with a reminder to the people in the summit that
they should send a clear message that justice is the only means
that could pave the way for resolving the problem in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> UAE Press Highlights Importance of Cairo Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Two newspapers in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) today expressed the hope that the Arab summit,
which is being held today in Cairo, would yield a unified position
and joint work to insure security and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for the marginal differences on the agenda of
the summit of the Arab nation," Al-Bayan said in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
The summit should adopt "a unified position" representing a
firm Arab front in face of challenges, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper reiterated its call for restoring Arab solidarity
that constitutes the main aim of today's summit, saying that the
summit would reach a concrete political strategy to ensure the
continuation of the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, Al-Wehda said it was looking forward to the
summit in anticipation that it would revive the Arab solidarity to
face up to challenges.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the hope that the summit would reach an agreement
on a clear Arab perspective and bring about positive results to
fulfill the aspirations of the Arab nation at large.
</P>
<P>
The paper called on the participants in the summit to work out
a strategy for joint action to guarantee peace, security and
stability in the region, especially after Israeli hard-line
government led by Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu took office.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records 209 Million Dollars Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a trade
surplus of 524 million Malaysian Ringgit (about 209 million US
dollars) in March this year, according to figures released here
today by the Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The department said the surplus for the month under review was
the first recorded since December 1995 following deficits of 440
million dollars in January, 294.4 million dollars in February.
There was a deficit of 1.4 billion Ringgit (about 560 million
dollars) in March last year.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for March 1996 came on the back of a 30.3 percent
rise in the exports to 18.2 billion Ringgit (about 7.28 billion
dollars) against imports which grew 15.1 percent to 17.7 billion
Ringgit (about 70.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department said, in the first quarter of 1996, Malaysia
experienced a reduced trade deficit of 1.4 billion Ringgit (about
560 million dollars) from 1.7 billion Ringgit (about 680 million
dollars) in the January-March period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The lower trade deficit in the first three months of 1996 was
the result of higher growth in exports which amounted to 47.3
billion Ringgit (about 18.92 billion dollars), while the exports
in the same period of 1995 were 40.6 billion Ringgit (about 16.24
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Imports in the first three months of the year totaled 48.7
billion Ringgit (about 19.48 billion dollars) compared with 42.4
billion Ringgit (about 16.96 billion dollars) in January-March
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Statistics Department, the top exports in the
first three months were thermionic valves and tubes, photocells,
while the top imports were machinery and transport equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMAPALA, June 22 (Xinhua)-- The Ugandan government has
suspended importation of beef and dairy products from countries
where there is a high incidence of mad cow disease, reported the
local daily "The New Vion" today.
</P>
<P>
Other items whose importation is suspended include embryos,
ova, ruminant derived protein feeds, bone meal and meat meal, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Agiculture, Animal Industry
and Fisherires said on Wednesday that the ministry through its
Department of Veterinary Services has since April initiated
measures to monitor over 5,000 head of cattle imported since 1983
from Britain, Ireland, Germany, Holland and other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The measures are being done in accordance with the
international conventions relating to animal health,it said.
</P>
<P>
The exercise done in collaboration with the Ministry of
Health, has so far not found any case of the disease called Bse
in cattle or even the diesease called Crentzfeldt Jacobs Disease
(CJD) in human beings in Uganda, it said.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the imports will be maintained in the
duration of the monitoring exercise, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has set up a joint
medical-veterinary team to continuously monitor the situation,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Bse disease was first reported in Britain where some people
died of another related disease called CJD which is closely
related to mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The reports have since scared the European Union and other
countries which have suspended importation of beef and other
dairy products from countries suspected to be infested.

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Opens in Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cairo, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An Arab Summit convenes in an
hour at the Egyptian Capital in an attempt to work out a
unified stance toward challenges facing the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders from all the Arab League countries except Iraq
are arriving at the Cairo International Conference Center, site
of the two-day summit here, for the opening ceremony, which was
originally scheduled for 11:00 hour local time this morning.
</P>
<P>
Among the latest arrivals is Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi,
who decided to participate in the summit, the first such move in
six years, in last hours. He came by a special plane, breaking
an international air embargo enforced by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The summit was called by the leaders of Egypt, Syria and Saudi
Arabia, who met at a tripartite summit in Damascus early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Arab reconciliation and Middle East peace process are
two main themes of the summit, which some of the Arab
leaders called "long-awaited" to heal their inter-rifts and
adopt a common stand toward changes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The summit opens with some reconciliatory signs in sight:
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad met Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat here late last night shortly after his arrival, with
President Hosni Mubarak sitting between them.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting since 1994 between Assad and
Arafat, who seem to have differed over the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was followed by another tripartite session this
morning of President Assad, King Hussein of Jordan and their
Egyptian counterpart Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian and Jordanian leaders were believed to advocate
different approaches toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Although no details of the meetings have been made public
so far, the efforts by President Mubarak, host of the
current pan-Arab summit, have, to some extent, improved the
atmosphere of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the Arab countries discussed the agenda
and final communique of the summit here Friday to guarantee
the success.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft communique made available at the end of
the ministerial meeting, the Arab leaders would express their
desire to set up an annual consulting mechanism in the framework
of the Arab League, a step aimed to close Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab leaders are also expected to come out
with one voice to urge Israel to continue the Middle East
peace process based on the "land-for-peace" principle.
</P>
<P>
The hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu's win of the Israeli May
29 election as prime minister has triggered fears among the
Arab leaders that the peace process might be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said no to an independent Palestinian state,
to the return of the Golan Heights to Syrian and to the
demand by the Palestinians for sharing Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel have voiced concern over the
summit, urging the Arab leaders not to push Israel too hard.
</P>
<P>
The return of Iraq to the Arab fold would also be
picked up for discussion at the summit, Egyptian officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not invited to the summit in a bid to head
off controversies.
</P>
<P>
Some Gulf countries remain reluctant to forgive Baghdad for
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Opens with Aim of Forging United Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A pan-Arab summit opened here today
to discuss means of closing Arab ranks and forging a united Arab
front to support the peace process based on the "land-for-peace"
principle.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders participating in the summit will issue a final
communique after two days of mostly closed-door sessions to
reaffirm their commitment to the ongoing peace march and urge
Israel to do the same without delay.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was the last of the 14 Arab heads
of state to arrive here for participation in the summit. He flew
here aboard a Libyan airliner in violation of a U.N. air travel
ban imposed on his country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit opened, the Arab leaders held a flurry of
bilateral and trilateral meetings to coordination stands and
exchange views on the regional situation and international issues
of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King Hussein and
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad met here earlier this morning for
consultations, only hours before the summit opened in the Cairo
International Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders in six
years, was called by Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia after the
election of right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as
Israel's new prime minister late last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that his new government opposes  the
establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital, will not return the Golan Heights to Syria and even will
not discuss the future status of Jerusalem with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that such a stand will jeopardize the Middle East
peace process, Arab leaders hope that the united Arab stand on
peace will press Israel to honor and implement all the agreements
it has signed with the Arabs and seriously commit itself to the
bases on which the peace process was built.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which drew 21 of the Arab League's 22
members, is also aimed at bringing solidarity to the Arab
world, which has been divided by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and other inter-Arab disputes.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Iraq from the summit may suggest that the
Arab world will still face an uphill task in closing its
ranks.
</P>
<P>
There is hope, however, for resolving other inter-Arab
disputes at the summit. Arab leaders have hailed the summit
as the first step in achieving Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Besides the main issues of Arab solidarity and the peace
process, other topics to be discussed at the summit include
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Palestinian refugees, the situation in Iraq, terrorism and
relations between the Arabs and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen heads of state are attending the summit, with
other participating countries being represented by crown princes
and government officials. The Somali ambassador to the Arab
League is leading his country's delegation to the summit due
to the chaotic situation back home.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Leaving Sarajevo out of Fear of Persecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Many Serbs in Sarajevo are
preparing to leave to avoid persecution, a U.N. official said at a
press conference today.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 Serbs will leave Sarajevo before long and a large
number of the 8,000 Serbs remaining in the city will follow them,
said Aleksandar Ivanko, U.N. representative to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko criticized the Bosnian Muslim authorities for taking
little action to improve the situation in the former Serb-held
municipalities which worsened after Muslims moved in.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia,
five Serb-held municipalities in Sarajevo were handed over to the
Muslim-Croat federation on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Serbs in these municipalities have reportedly been beset by
everyday robberies and other harassment for months, said deputy to
the international High Representative for Bosnia Michael Steiner
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 60,000 Serbs have left Sarajevo.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Insurance Corporation Crowned With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Insurance
Corporation announced that it has achieved great success in
past 20 years, "The Ethiopian Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the 20th anniversary of the corporation,
General Manager of the corporation Hailemichael Kimsa said, while
the corporation has registered substantial increases in both
premiums and compensations, at no time in this time span has it met
with anything like bankruptcy or suffered any losses.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian insurance corporation was established in 1976
after the former Mengistu's government nationalized 13 private
insurance companies. It presently offers 80 percent of all insurance
services in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, premiums which amounted to
50.5 million Birr (6.33 Birr exchange one U.S.Dollar) in 1977 have
reached 291 million Birr in 1995/96, while profits grew from 10.4
million Birr in 1977 to 56.4 million Birr in 1995/96. The
compensation payments have risen to 118 million Birr in 1995/96
from 17.6 million Birr in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Hailemichael Kimsa said the corproation stands on a strong
financial footing with property worth more than 500 million Birr
and 280 million Birr in cash as well as big buildings, including
five in Addis Ababa and eight in regions.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Arrives in Cairo for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi arrived
here this morning to attend a two-day pan-Arab summit in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency said that Gaddafi had no choice but
to fly with his delegation to Cairo despite the air embargo
imposed on Libya.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi flew on a Libyan airliner directly from the Libyan
capital of Tripoli to Egypt, it said.
</P>
<P>
This move violated U.N. air travel sanctions imposed on Libya
in 1992 following its failure to surrender two Libyans wanted in
connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a white suit covered by a flowing white overcoat,
Gaddafi was given a state welcome by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi was the last of the 14 Arab leaders to arrive and
attend the Arab summit, which is expected to close Arab ranks
and push forward the Middle East peace process in the wake of
the election of Israeli hardline Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu as the prime minister late last month.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Between Aidid, Atto Renews in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 7 people were killed
and 13 others wounded when a fierce fighting broke out between
militiamen supporting General Mohamed Farah Aidid and those of
Osman Ali Atto in south Mogadishu yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in which small and heavy machine guns, rocket
propelled grenades, anti-aircraft missiles and mortars shells
were used, has subsided at the early hours of last night and
recommenced this morning with extensive fire shelling which still
continues.
</P>
<P>
Each of the warring sides has accused the other for igniting
the war.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid, the Interior Secretary
of the United Somali Congress of Somali National Alliance
(USC/SNA), militiamen supporting Aidid have attacked the defense
positions of the USC/SNA from three different directions. Qeybdid
said his militiamen have repulsed back the attack of Aidid's,
inflicting them heavy losses. Qeybdid said no side has made any
territorial gains.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the deafening heavy shelling used by both sides,
there were several misguided cannonades that hit residential
areas in south Mogadishu. The ordinary citizens accuse both sides
for being responsible of such blind bombardment, however, Qeybdid
said his men only fired when being provoked and warned the
citizens not to let the militiamen use their residential areas as
mortar launching sites as retaliation may soon hit back.
</P>
<P>
Radio South Mogadishu supporting Osman Hassan Atto
characterized the fighting as a cowardly attack carried out by
what the radio called the anti-peace militiamen of the self
proclaimed group, a term USC/SNA usually refers to the government
of General Aidid. There's no official word yet from General
Aidid's side over the fighting in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed fighting remains unknown, however,
the two sides were fighting in south Mogadishu since March this
year after the political divergence between general Aidid and his
former financier,Osman Ali Atto, reached its highest peak
following the ousting of General Aidid from the chairmanship of
the USC/SNA. So far, more than 150 people are believed to have
died and half million others were wounded ever since the armed
confrontation began between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local authorities in Garbabarrey District of
southwestern Somalia have revealed that the plane being kept in
the town has brought four Somali deportee from Holland. A
spokesman for the Somali National Front (SNF) said they're asking
Holland for no ransom or any other charges, but take back the
deportee they forcefully brought to Garbaharrey as they put it.
SNF said the deportee are not from Garbahjarrey, but they
declined to state their town of origin.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports from Garbaharrey, 600 km southwest of
the capital Mogadishu, two men from the security services of
Kenya and two other men from Holland were accompanying the Somali
deportee. However, the four men returned back to Nairobi from
where they hired the plane while the pilot still remains with his
plane in the airstrip of the town.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM: Compromise on Land with Syria Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has indicated that the new right-wing Likud government might
also pursue a policy of land, although limited, for peace with
Syria, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the hint in a television interview Friday night. He
said that while Syria could not dictate the terms of an
agreement, a compromise could be found if Damascus is interested
in peace.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli foreign minister said that if peace depends on
Israel's adjustment of its border with Syria, then he would
support such a policy.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the gesture is merely aimed at showing
an olive branch to the on-going Arab Summit in Cairo or means a
real flexibility of the hardline policy regarding the Golan
Heights, which was captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli new government policy guidelines
published on June 18, the Likud-led government "views the Golan
Heights as essential to the security of the state and its water
resources. Retaining Israeli sovereignty over the Golan will be
the basis for an arrangement with Syria."
</P>
<P>
The position has touched off vehement condemnation from Syria
and other Arab countries. Syrian officials have declared that
Israel must withdraw completely from the Golan Heights, otherwise
there will be no peace anyway between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Levy's statement aroused an angry reaction from Jewish settlers
in the Golan Heights. The Golan settlements committee issued a
statement calling on the Israeli government to clarify its stand
regarding the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The settlers believe that the remarks made by Levy have
signaled Israel's readiness to compromise on the issue of handing
over the Golan heights to Syria.

WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Carl Lewis showed he was still
the medal hope in the 200-meter race in the Atlanta Olympic Games
when he clocked a outstanding time at the United States track and
field trials in Atlanta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He ran the race and finished second in his heat with a time of
20.30 seconds, less than a second slower than his personal best of
19.75 set 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first day I felt like myself," Lewis said, "I was
dehydrated all week and cramping all over. This time, I felt like
myself again, not flat."
</P>
<P>
"Let them know I've got my legs back. I felt strong and
powerful, like myself again." added Lewis

After Lewis finished last in the 100m, the long jump seemed
urgent because of the competition he's have in the 200m. He

<HEADLINE> Albania's Ruling Democrats Win Big Majority in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic Party
won 122 out of the 140 parliamentary seats in the three-round
contentious general elections, including a re-run in some
constituencies where voting irregularities were observed.
</P>
<P>
Final results released today by the Central Electoral
Commission confirmed the landslide victory for President Sali
Berisha's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Socialists still refused to accept the
election results and international pressure remains high on the
Albanian government to annul the election.
</P>
<P>
The final results gave the main opposition Socialist Party 10
seats of the one-chamber parliament, the People's Assembly, and
the Republic Party and the Union of Human Rights each 3 seats. The
Balli Kombetar party received 2 seats.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, 115 of the 140 seats are elected
directly from nationwide single-seat constituencies, and the
remaining 25 are chosen from party list by proportional
representation.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the new parliament will open on July 1
according to a decree issued Wednesday by Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Repeating their accusations against the government of vote
rigging and fraud in the balloting process, the Socialists
reiterated today that they will not accept the election results
and will boycott the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists, mainly ex-communists, and five other opposition
parties withdrew midway from the first round of the elections late
last month and demanded a fresh vote.
</P>
<P>
Their demand was rejected by the Central Electoral Commission
and a second round was held in some constituencies undecided in
the first round and in only three others where the commission
admitted irregularities existed.
</P>
<P>
Later under mounting Western pressure, the commission declared
the outcome in 13 more electoral districts invalid and arranged a
re-run in these places this week.
</P>
<P>
But the Socialists were unsatisfied with these compromises and
boycotted both rounds.
</P>
<P>
Their allegations of voting fraud were supported by observers
sent here to monitor the polls by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
A final report issued by the OSCE Wednesday on the elections
said that the poll seriously violated Albania's election law and
international norms.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the European Parliament adopted a resolution
demanding a repeat of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has invited leaders of Albania's six
major political groups, including the Democratic Party and the
Socialist Party, to meet in Strasbourg in northeastern France to
discuss the controversial elections.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Professors Threaten to Resign if Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of the Kuwait
University professors opposed to the controversial bill banning
coeducation in Kuwait are reportedly planning an extended
protest which may include their collective resignation, local
newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Both English and Arabic newspapers carried reports on
evidences that a series of meetings and discussions are taking
place this week and may culminate with professors offering
their resignation en mass if the Cabinet approves the bill.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Kuwait Times said a large number of
professors have been to the Kuwait University administration to
express their determination to resign if the bill comes into law.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by the Islamic parliamentarians
dominated National Assembly and referred to the Cabinet for final
decision last month. It triggered serious debates between its
supporters and opposers in the country ever since it was passed in
the parliament on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait government agreed on a compromise with the members of
the parliament last Tuesday to endorse the draft law on condition
that segregation in private foreign schools is not to be imposed
through an amendment.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the deal, segregation will be imposed at
Kuwait University, the only university in the small emirate.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, following a meeting between
Kuwait Education and Higher Education Minister Ahmed Al-Rubei and
members of Kuwait University Teaching Staff Board Friday, the
professors decided to suspend their resignation threat until
after Monday when the Council of Ministers is expected to take a
decision on the segregation law.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rubei is opposed to the bill. Nothing was released about
his meeting with the board.
</P>
<P>
So far the picture on the bill is not clear in spite of a deal
stricken between the Islamist members of parliament and the
government.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The 4th Palestine International
Festival opened Friday night in the West Bank city of Ramallah
despite tensions stemming from the rise of Israel's right-wing
Likud Party to power.

<HEADLINE> Banker Calls for Greater Supervision over Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior central bank official
said here today that the relaxation on foreign exchange controls
should be guaranteed by stricter supervision.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuan, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, told a
national meeting attended by officials of local foreign exchange
administration departments that "worldwide experience has shown
that relaxation on foreign exchange controls should be accompanied
by stricter supervision."
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, the central bank's governor, announced Thursday
that China would make the yuan convertible under the current
account by the end of this year, a significant move towards the
relaxation of foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that banks, in their business activities, must
separate foreign exchange on the current account from that on the
capital account now that China has relaxed controls on the current
account, and still keep a tight control on the capital account.
</P>
<P>
"The financial order will be disturbed if the two accounts are
mixed up," Chen warned.
</P>
<P>
He explained that supervision has now become more important
than ever, as the operations of foreign-funded enterprises into
China's current system on selling and buying foreign exchange from
July 1 will increase the business volume of banks as well as the
number of banks dealing in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
He urged financial institutions to continue the improvement of
their internal management rules and beef up self-discipline to
ensure effective supervision of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that China will continue to perfect its rules
and regulations on the management of foreign exchange, and make
its supervision methods more sophisticated.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Tin Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm oil
(CPO), tin and rubber markets ended the week mixed with CPO and
tin prices lower while rubber price higher.
</P>
<P>
Crude palm oil physicals ended the week lower following the
bearish Malaysian June palm oil forecast, saying that Malaysia's
CPO production in June would increase 3 percent to 745,000 tons
while palm oil stock figures were higher.
</P>
<P>
Players liquidated their positions as they were uncertain of
the immediate trend as well as the lack of fresh tenders. Dealers
said the market was oversold since last week.
</P>
<P>
Price for June South ended the week at 1,125 Malaysian Ringgit
(about 450 US dollars) per ton, 20 Ringgit (about 8 dollars) lower
from last week's closing.
</P>
<P>
The price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week
also lower on bearish sentiment from the London Metal Exchange
(LME).
</P>
<P>
The tin price fell 18 sen to end the week at 15.18 Malaysian
Ringgit (about 6.07 dollars) per kg from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the market saw the price dropping to 15.12 Ringgit
(about 6.05 dollars), and rebounded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the week rose to 506 tons this week from 406
tons the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM's price difference against the LME was at a premium of
85 dollars per ton from 90 dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market closed slightly higher
this week on short covering activities following some buying
interests from China.
</P>
<P>
The market saw some demand mainly from China for SMR 20 and
this development sparked short-covering activities early this
week.
</P>
<P>
Price for July RSS 1 ended one sen higher to 369.5 sen (about
1.85 dollars) per kg while SMR 20 rose 4.5 sen to 310.5 sen (about
1.24 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers here predicted that the uptrend would be
short-term with the incoming long summer holidays that would see
the absence of European buyers on the market.

<HEADLINE> Hekmatyar to Enter Kabul, Take Oath as Afghan PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the former
Afghan Prime Minister and Chief of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar
Group), will enter Kabul and retake the office of prime minister
next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that thousands of Hezb
fighters will accompany Hekmatyar to Kabul and the new Afghan
cabinet will take oath before next Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report quoted Ustad Qareeb-ur-Rehman, Hezb spokesman in
Peshawar, Pakistan, as saying that a defense minister and a
finance minister belonging to the Hezb will also be sworn in next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the reconciliation agreement signed by the Afghan
government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani and one of its
arch rivals Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) on May 24, the two
sides would establish a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported previously that Hekmatyar's party had been
offered the offices of prime minister, defense minister and
financial minister, while Rabbani's side would retain the offices
of president and foreign affairs, interior and national security
ministers in a broadened administration.
</P>
<P>
Rehman said that the Hezb will also get the portfolios of
deputy interior minister and deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement brokered between Hekmatyar and Rabbani last
month will be implemented in letter and spirit," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Arrangements have been made to welcome Hekmatyar in Kabul on
Wednesday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar had been made Prime Minister with President Rabbani
in the light of the Islamabad Accord signed by various Afghan
parties in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, Hekmatyar never entered Kabul and occupied the office
fearing life attempt by Rabbani's men.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1994, Hekmatyar took part in an abortive coup
unleashed by Chief of Uzbek Militia Rashid Dostum against Rabbani
and then totally broke away from the Rabbani's regime.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Sets Goal for Development of Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has set
the goal of helping all its ethnic minorities enjoy a stable and
secure life by the end of this century, Vietnamese press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Over nine million ethnic minority people, accounting for 13.1
percent of Vietnam's total population, are dispersed over
two-thirds of the territorial land of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, many ethnic minorities remain in underprivileged
situation in remote and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics showed that 29 ethnic minorities
registered less than 50,000 Vietnamese dong (four U.S. dollars)
per capita income per month, the lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
And 90 percent of ethnic minority households possess estate
worth less than one million Vietnamese dong (90.8 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has invested 90 billion Vietnamese
dong (8.1 million dollars) during the period of 1992 to 1995 for
the development of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government launched a nation-wide
program with an investment of 30 billion Vietnamese dong (2.7
million dollars) to eliminate hunger and improve production and
living standards in ethnic minority areas.
</P>
<P>
The investment is expected to increase 2.5 times in the next
few years, and reach 336 billion Vietnamese dong (30.5 million
dollars) by the year 2000.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's former
acting Attorney-General Luis Eduardo Montoya was placed under
house arrest today to wait for a trial for fraud charges, local
reports said.
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant for Montoya was issued two weeks ago but the
arrest was made possible only after the Senate suspended him from
office last Wednesday, thus stripping him of judicial immunity.
</P>
<P>
Montoya became acting attorney-general last month after his
predecessor, Orlando Vasquez, was jailed over drug corruption.
</P>
<P>
Both Montoya and Vasquez were charged with providing false
evidence in charges against Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso in
a failed effort to force Valdivieso to step down.
</P>
<P>
Valdivieso is heading the probe into allegations that President
Ernesto Samper accepted drug money to finance his 1994
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Montoya could be held under house arrest for up to three months
before the authorities rule on the fraud charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Jose Leon Jaramillo was sworn in as the new acting
attorney-general Thursday.

</P>
<P>
With the firm support from the JP, the AL has the clear

Meanwhile, the BNP has also decided to join the parliament
though it will go for legal steps against alleged poll rigging and
irregularities during the elections, paving the way for the
formation of the new government under a stable situation.
</P>
<P>
Hasina was elected leader of the AL's parliamentary party and
at an invitation from the president, she will take the oath as the
prime minister on June 23, a top al official said.

Earlier on Thursday, President Abdur Rahman Biswas said that he
will invite the leader of the AL to form the new government after

(BNP), the former ruling party in the country, has decided to join

<HEADLINE> Thai Rubber Industry to Face Stiffer Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's natural rubber exports
will face threat as western countries push ahead new international
standards on the protein content.
</P>
<P>
Under the International Standardization Organization (ISO)
rules, latex in Thailand's natural rubber is being linked with
severe allergies, said Thai Deputy Industry Minister Sonthaya
Khunpluem.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said today that the United States and the
European Union also have set their own standards on protein
content in natural rubber, which are even more complex and cover
allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, there were reports of severe allergic reactions
resulting from the protein content in natural rubber gloves.
Reactions to latex included itching, burning, stinging, and
patches of skin, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is one of the world's largest rubber producers and
exporters. Its major rubber products for export include gloves,
condoms and elastic for clothes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand exported examination gloves worth 202.8
million US dollars, mainly to the United States, Britain, Japan,
Germany, Spain, Israel, Singapore, Greece, Brazil and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Local rubber product manufacturers are urging the government to
offer assistance in research and development to help them head off
any problems.

<HEADLINE> EU Summit Moves On With "Mad Cow" Crisis Defused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 21 (Xinhua) -- European leaders on Friday
got rid of a major stumbling block of the Florence summit, the
"mad cow" crisis with Britain, and were able to move on for talks
about job creation and the establishment of the European Monetary
Union.
</P>
<P>
A reconciliation was reached after both sides -- Britain and
its EU partners -- gave in.
</P>
<P>
Britain agreed to stop its "non-cooperation" with the European
Union (EU) and the EU promised to lift step by step the worldwide
ban on British beef and cattle by-products, which was imposed on
March 27 when links were suspected between the "mad cow" disease
and its human equivalent disease.
</P>
<P>
However, no timetable was set for the lifting of the embargo,
which, as observers believe, could take months, even years as more
controversies would occur.
</P>
<P>
London, under its "non-cooperation" policy, had blocked in the
last month more than 70 resolutions of the EU that require
unanimity.
</P>
<P>
Besides the "mad cow" issue, the leaders of the 15 member
countries of the EU also reached an agreement to allow the
Europol, a trans-European crime-fighting intelligence agency, to
get down to business.
</P>
<P>
Britain had held up the launching of the agency for a year on
the ground that the European Court of Justice, which has a role in
the operations of the Europol, might infringe on its national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, a protocol will be added to the convention of
Europol that countries who want to, can have their courts refer
cases to the European Court of Justice, clearly allowing Britain
to opt out of the use of the court.
</P>
<P>
The leaders on Friday also examined the progress of the
inter-governmental conference mandated at the Turin summit earlier
this year and decided to hold another special summit in Ireland in
October to push forward the revision of the Maastricht Treaty.
Ireland is scheduled to take over from Italy the rotating EU
presidency in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
They also signed agreements of cooperation with Chile and
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the summit achieved little on another major issue --
job creation. The leaders failed to reach consensus on the
so-called "confidence pact" for jobs proposed by EU President
Jacques Santer, calling for part-time working rules as a strategy
for boosting work.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl responded that to cut down
unemployment is the responsibility of individual governments.
</P>
<P>
Several large member states also obstructed another proposal of
Santer to shift 1.7 billion U.S. dollars of surplus EU fund to
sponsor job-creating road and rail project.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Approves Eight Oil Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Congress approved
today eight contracts on foreign investments in its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The eight contracts will allow foreign oil companies to explore
oil deposits at different sites throughout the country, a member
of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign companies expected to invest 700 million
U.S. dollars in Venezuela are Mobil Oil, Amoco, Nippon, Conoco,
Elf Aquitaine, Enron and BP.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the contracts, these oil companies will bear
the cost of exploration and will share a pre-determined percentage
of the profits from subsequent production with the Venezuelan
government.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta described the contracts as "a new
stage" of the country's 1976 nationalization of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
"We are now able to form associations on an equal footing...we
should understand that we are operating in a global framework and
not close ourselves into our own nationalism, but rather open
ourselves to invest", Arrieta said.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Guatemalan Gov't, Rebels Resume in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A new round of talks on
military reform between the Guatemalan government and guerrillas
resumed here today, moving a step closer to end the Central
America's last and longest war.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will end on Sunday, are considered key to a
final agreement by the Guatemala National Revolutionary Unity to
lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The military carried out a campaign against suspected rebels
and their sympathizers in the 1980s. Tens of thousands were killed
and scores of communities were wiped out during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala's Assembly of Civil Society, a group made up of
church, human rights, political parties and other non-governmental
groups, called on the army to be made answerable to civilian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas and human rights advocates have accused the army
of widespread abuses and have charged that the army controls too
much power in Guatemalan politics, the economy and society in
general after the military rule ended in 1986.
</P>
<P>
President Alvaro Arzu has promised to change that. Shortly
after taking office in January, he purged top military commanders
and more than 100 police officers.
</P>
<P>
Government and guerrilla negotiators in early May signed their
last important agreement, dealing with socioeconomic and agrarian
issues.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have fought with the government for more than 30
years where about 140,000 people are believed to have died in the
war.
</P>
<P>
The signing of a final peace agreement would end the last civil
war in Central America.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy FM to Visit New Zealand, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Charas Puachuay started his visit to New Zealand and Australia
today aimed at correcting the trade imbalance on farm and
livestock products between Thailand and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I will seek to persuade the two countries to invest in cattle,
especially milk-cattle, in Thailand and the Mekong subregion,"
said Charas.
</P>
<P>
During their scheduled talks, Charas and his counterparts of
Australia and New Zealand will focus on the technical cooperation
in livestock.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian region needs foreign direct investment to
meet its increasing demands for milk.
</P>
<P>
Thailand alone spends more than 10 billion baht (400 million US
dollars) a year in importing milk powder, said Charas.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, last year Australia had an 11.7
billion baht (468 million US dollars) trade surplus with Thailand
while New Zealand had a three-billion-baht (120 million US
dollars) trade surplus with Thailand.

BONN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Regional organizations should be
given a bigger say in resolving crisis, proposed German Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe today to the visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe suggested that when crisis occurred beyond NATO's sphere,
the United Nations should depend more on the regional
organizations than NATO and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He illustrated the case with an example, saying that in dealing
with crises of the African continent, the U.N. should in the first
place cooperate with the troops of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe also noted that NATO is willing to offer training and
equipment assistance to these organizations when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting held by the Parliamentary Group of the
Social Democratic Party in the last day of his three-day visit
here, Boutros-Ghali called on the international community to give
top priority to the elimination of poverty.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the most significant pillar to guarantee peace
and stability is not the "blue helmets," but those assisting
volunteers.

<HEADLINE> "Silk Road" Countries Stitch Together A Tourism Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Countries along the ancient "silk
road" are to combine their efforts to promote tourism along the
route which has a 2,000 year history.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a three-day international
symposium on the silk road which ended recently in Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, starting place of the silk
road.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the World Tourism Organization and China's
National Tourism Administration, the symposium attracted more than
100 people, including high ranking tourism officials from 25
countries and tourism agents as well as Chinese and foreign
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
Silk road countries plan to establish a tourism committee to
organize and coordinate efforts for tourism marketing, opening of
borders, tourism service investigations and other related matters.
</P>
<P>
The countries also decided to launch an overall marketing
operation for silk road tourism, which will include combining
efforts in publishing books, audio and video products.
</P>
<P>
Tourism agents from Japan, Republic of Korea and some European
and American countries have shown interest in promoting silk road
tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
As silk road tourism has been limited by traffic problems along
some stretches of the route, border entry problems in some
countries, lack of hotels and special tourist guides, the
countries have decided to hold special meetings soon to resolve
the problems.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the United Nations, the participants of the
symposium planned to establish a non-profit-making silk road fund,
aimed at aiding the development, investigation and marketing of
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The silk road, started from Chang'an (Xi'an), ancient capital
of the Han Dynasty, passed through the Gansu Corridor, Tarim
Basin, the Pamirs, to Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Iran
and Iraq, then ended at sea ports in Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> "Daughter's Kingdom" Attracts Worldwide Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of ethnic minority people
living in an outlying area bordering Sichuan and Yunnan provinces,
southwest China, are attracting worldwide attention for their
unique social structure.
</P>
<P>
The Mosuo people are unique as they still preserve their
ancient matriarchal system, rare today in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30,000 Mosuo people living in the area
around Lugu Lake bordering the provinces of Sichuan and Yunan.
</P>
<P>
Their community is known as "Daughter's Kingdom" since the
people still preserve their ancient matriarchal system and the
tradition of live-apart marriages.
</P>
<P>
Their families, usually large, are based on maternal kinship.
</P>
<P>
One household of the Mosuo people usually has a dozen or even
more than 30 members. In each family there is only the maternal
grandmother and her brothers and sisters, mother and her brothers
and sisters.
</P>
<P>
The maternal grandmother is the highest commander in the
family. A capable woman, she is entrusted with arranging
production and dealing with household duties, managing finance and
property. All family members are asked to absolutely obey her
orders.
</P>
<P>
Live-apart marriage is a unique and romantic marriage form for
the Mosuo people. At present more than 70 percent of the people
still preserve such marriages.
</P>
<P>
Usually when a man and woman meet each other and fall in love,
the man will ask a match-maker to send tea, candy and garments, as
well as other presents to his sweetheart's home. In return the
young woman's mother will give the man linen trousers that her
daughter has made herself, and send the man's gift of candies to
her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
After that the man and the woman will begin their live-apart
marriage.
</P>
<P>
The man usually visits the woman at night and leaves her in the
morning, returning to his own home. The man and the woman do not
belong to each other's family.
</P>
<P>
When they have children the father is not responsible for
raising them, apart from sometimes buying food and new clothes for
his children. He is only responsible for bringing up the children
of his own sisters.
</P>
<P>
Marriage among the Mosuo people is based on love. If one of the
couple finds that something between them has changed and suggests
stopping their contact, they will stop their live-apart
marriage. They will continue to find new partners.
</P>
<P>
Mosuo people usually start their live-apart marriage after they
have attended grown-up ceremonies at the age of 11 or 12. But,
such marriages are not allowed between cousins and maternal
cousins.
</P>
<P>
Some changes have taken place in the form of marriage of the
Mosuo people. Some of them have married after registration at
government departments and started family lives just like ordinary
Chinese people. But the old traditionals are still strong in the
land of Daughter's Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Labor Unions Launch General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's three
biggest labor unions launched a general strike today which was
aimed at keeping 12 million people off work to demand higher pay
and protest against unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The strike has closed docks in the port of Santos but failed to
paralyze business and transport in major cities.
</P>
<P>
Vicente da Silva, secretary-general of the Cut Union, described
the strike as a success. "With a peaceful but energetic
demonstration, the workers will show what they want from this
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil's major port of Santos, dock workers paralyzed
all loading and unloading activities, although transport and other
business in the city continued normally.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Sao Paulo, the nation's largest industrial center,
said that about half of the metal workers had joined in the
strike, while transport services in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and
the capital Brasilia started out slowly but normalized during the
morning.
</P>
<P>
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso condemned the strike,
saying "A strike does not raise wages. A strike just perturbs
those working for higher wages."
</P>
<P>
The most serious incident reported was in Rio de Janeiro where
strikers blocked vehicles from leaving a plant.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Management of City Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is to tighten management of
city roads in an effort to ease urban traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
A new regulation, to come into effect October 1, urges local
officials to seek more funding to build and repair high-quality
roads to ensure people ride in safety.
</P>
<P>
The document, revealed by today's "China Daily", is said to be
the country's first regulation on this matter.
</P>
<P>
The problems faced by urban people include poor road
maintenance, illicit occupation of roads for commercial purposes,
frequent digging and declining road quality, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of cars and other vehicles have been growing
dramatically in recent years as the economy soars, adding a
headache to city planners.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will ban trucks carrying heavy materials from
using urban roads, unless they get local government's approval.
</P>
<P>
It also will prohibit illegal occupation and improper digging
of urban roads, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Completes Demilitarization in Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has completed
the demilitarization process in Eastern Slavonia, the last
separatist Serb enclave in Croatia, a U.N. spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"Demilitarization has been successfully completed. All that
remains is a turnover of some 12 to 15 military barracks and real
estate to UNTAES," said Philip Arnold of the U.N. Transitional
Authority in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,000 Serb militiamen had demobilized during a
one-month demilitarization process, which began on May 21, Arnold
said, adding that Yugoslavia's regular army and special police had
retreated over the border.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, bordering upon northwestern Yugoslavia, was
one of the three enclaves seized by Croatian minority Serbs in a
1991 uprising against Croatian government's declaration of
independence from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under a treaty reached between the Croatian government and the
Serbs last year, the UNTAES, starting early this year, would
administer Eastern Slavonia, the last enclave still under the
control of the Serbs, for no more than two years before it could
return to the Croatian rule.
</P>
<P>
The next step to implement the Eastern Slavonia treaty includes
the resettlement of around 80,000 Croat refugees and
re-establishment of Croatian rule there, Arnold added.

<HEADLINE> Bucaram Leads Slightly in Ecuador Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Abdala Bucaram Ortiz, candidate of
the populist Ecuadorean Roldosista Party, had a 1.4 percent lead
over rival Jaime Nebot, the candidate of the Social Christian
Party, showed a recent opinion poll released today by the Perfiles
y Opinion polling firm.
</P>
<P>
A victory for Bucaram in Ecuador's July 7 run-off presidential
election would represent an abrupt shift in Ecuadorean politics,
from the rightist stance of current President Sixto Duran-Ballen.
</P>
<P>
Nebot, who placed first in the May 19 election, gained greater
levels of support from higher-income voters and those over 50
years old. Bucaram was favored by younger voters and those from
lower-income strata.
</P>
<P>
The recent poll results showed Bucaram had a 39.8-percent share
of the voter preferences. However, the number of undecided or
potential abstainers remained high, according to the poll
conducted in 13 Ecuadorean cities.
</P>
<P>
About 7 million Ecuadoreans are eligible to vote, and the
winner will take office on August 10.

<HEADLINE> Mosuo People on the Way to Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Many of the Mosuo people, an
ethnic group living in an outlying area bordering on Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces in southwest China, have become wealthy thanks to
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Mosuo people attract visitors from both home and
abroad. The visitors are fascinated by the unique way of life of
the Mosuo people in the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Mosuo people still preserve the matriarchal system, which is
rare in the world. They also have a unusual tradition of
live-apart marriages.
</P>
<P>
Su Mingfa and his family are from one of the Mosuo households
which have become rich by running tourism services. They live on
the banks of Lugu Lake, a place inhabited by some 30,000 Mosuo
people.
</P>
<P>
What is different between Su and other Mosuo people is that he
did not follow the tradition of live-apart marriage, but instead,
married into, and lives with his wife's family.
</P>
<P>
In this 18-member family, Su's mother-in-law is the highest
commander, and his wife is the general director. But actually Su
himself is the backbone of the family, since it is him who gives
orders when "foreigners" are at their home.
</P>
<P>
Su Mingfa, 43, served in the army for six years. He first
established a traditional live-apart marriage with his wife 10
years ago. Later he started to live with his wife's family and
became one of its member, fulfilling his dream of helping the
family become wealthy.
</P>
<P>
As Lugu Lake becomes more and more famous, Su found that it
would be profitable to offer accommodation for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Su and his family built a compound with houses around a
courtyard, just 10 meters away from Lugu Lake.
</P>
<P>
Inside the compound, there are scripture halls, central room,
girls' boudoirs as well as stables.
</P>
<P>
Su's family also live in this quadrangle, the rest rooms are
used as guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
Every morning Su usually asks his brothers and sisters-in-law
to catch fish and shrimp in the lake to cook traditional Mosuo
meals for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Su's family have received more than 4,000 tourists since they
started the family business in March of last year, which has
brought a big profit for the family.
</P>
<P>
Su's family now have fitted carpets on the floor of the central
room, and they have bought a color TV, stereo set and washing
machine, as well as other household electric devices.
</P>
<P>
Su has three children and all of them are at school. Su said
that he is ready to support his children to receive their higher
educations.
</P>
<P>
Su said that his 170,000-yuan quadrangle can now provide meals
for 200 tourists, and offer lodgings for 60 people. Su expects to
regain his investment within three years.
</P>
<P>
He also has plans to invest some 100,000 yuan in interior
decoration in the next few years to improve the competitiveness of
the business.
</P>
<P>
Just as many other Mosuo families, Su's family is hospitable
and generous.
</P>
<P>
Once an Australian tourist who was nearly pennyless was
accommodated for the night at his home. Su's family offered the
tourist free meals and lodgings for two days and gave her
travelling expenses back to Kunming, capital of southwest China's
Yunnan province.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Gao Ruo, daughter of an ordinary
fisherman and whose only amusement was singing when catching fish
in a lake two years ago, has become a tourist guide.
</P>
<P>
Every week Gao Ruo, 18, leads a group of tourists on
sight-seeing tours to Lugu Lake, bordering the provinces of
Sichuan and Yunnan in southwest China. This is the home of some
30,000 Mosuo people.
</P>
<P>
All tourists like Gao Ruo very much, since she often tells them
stories about the Mosuo people, or teaches them Mosuo folk dancing
and singing.
</P>
<P>
Mosuo girls are good at singing and dancing. The job of tourist
guides creates many chances for them to give full play to their
talents.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 20 Mosuo girls have been hired by folk
cultural villages in Beijing, Shenzhen and Chengdu, singing and
dancing groups and travel agencies. Some have even been invited to
visit Los Angeles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
But most of Mosuo girls stay at home, and sometimes act as
tourist guides.
</P>
<P>
Mosuo people are a unique ethnic group who still preserve the
matriarchal system, which is rare in the world, and a tradition of
live-apart marriages.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development of local tourism has changed greatly the
traditional life style of the Mosuo people and made their lives
more colorful and wealthy.
</P>
<P>
All 72 households in Luoshui village near Lugu Lake have opened
tourism-oriented services, with 50 percent of them running
guesthouses and dining halls.
</P>
<P>
One hotel in the village receives 20,000 tourists annually. The
hotel earned 180,000 yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in the village has reached 1,900 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Wang Jiaze is still working in the fields. He is now an
owner of small-scale farm. His 13-member family contracted about
two hectares of farmland, which produced more than 10,000
kilograms of grain last year. Wang's family earns over 40,000 yuan
annually.
</P>
<P>
Fisherman Lalongbu is no longer fishing. He has opened a
department store and a video saloon. He has also bought a truck to
transport goods. The monthly net income of his family stands at
over 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that 10 years ago Mosuo people had no
contact with the outside. They lived on fishing and growing crops,
but many of them did not have enough food to eat.
</P>
<P>
Everything has changed since the implementation of the policy
of reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Lugu Lake has become an important tourism spot in Sichuan
province. A 30 million yuan, 70 kilometer-long highway leading to
Lugu Lake has just been completed. Preparations for constructing a
three-star hotel beside the lake is going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
In the Lugu Lake area the per capita annual income of the Mosuo
people has exceeded 1,000 yuan, one of the highest in the area.
</P>
<P>
All Mosuo children of school age have gone to schools. Watching
cable television programs, listening to the radio, singing Karaoke
and modern dance, have become part of the new lifestyle of the
Mosuo people.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Rain Afforestation Project in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A tropical rain forest project is
to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
Under the program tropical rain-forest trees will be planted,
along with tropical fruit trees and economic trees. Related
agricultural and sideline product processing zones will also be
established in the area of 5,400 hectares in Jianfeng Mountain
area, Ledong county in southern parts of Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 35 million US dollars, with 18 million
coming from Asian Development Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Cui Xiaosu, an official in charge of the implementation of the
project, said that the theme of the project will focus on
environmental protection and help the poor in the project area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Cui is also confident about the economic returns of
the project, since the area boasts rich land resources and
favorable soil and climate conditions for the growing of tropical
rain trees.
</P>
<P>
The project area now has 12,000 people, mainly of the Li
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the project will stimulate local economic
development, expand employment and improve farming skills of local
people. More than 30,000 people are expected to benefit from the
project.
</P>
<P>
Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than
44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China. The forest is of
great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in
Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
There are also many endangered and unique plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government has always attached great importance to the
protection of this area. It first set up a tropical primary forest
protection zone in the area in 1951. A national forest garden was
established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial
government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The amount of cocaine seized in the
first six months of 1996 in Greece has risen almost ten times
compared to the same period last year, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police seized 19 kilos of cocaine compared to only two kilos in
the first six months of 1995. the figure is also close to three
times the total amount from the first six months of 1993, 1994,
and 1995 put together.
</P>
<P>
However only 10-15 percent of the total amount of drugs
smuggled is thought to be caught.
</P>
<P>
Police said the number drug offences and arrests have also shot
up and blamed this on increased drug trafficking between Greece
and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the number of reported drug violations was 177. In
1994 and 1995 it dropped to 174 and 135 respectively but surged
dramatically to 273 in the first half of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks were mostly
higher with bonds today, with the Dow Jones industrial average
being lifted to its best finish since late May.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials rose 45.80 to 5,705.23, the first close
above 5,700 since May 28.
</P>
<P>
Growing uncertainty about the direction of inflation and
interest rates has muffled the market's moves for weeks, limiting
Dow to moves of less than 30 points for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-10 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 516.41 million
shares, jumping from the sub-400 million levels of recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Several broad-market indexes snapped extended losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index, which has fallen by more than 5
percent in just over a week amid concerns about computer-industry
profits, rebounded some with help from a positive earnings report
from software maker Oracle.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices improved, helping ease their interest rates. The
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 7.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although most sectors bounced back today, financial services
stocks remained under pressure due to the recent worries about
consumers defaulting on credit card debts.

soft-drink giant, said its global volume is expected to increase
by about 9 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The growth in global volume, considered an important gauge for
Coca-Cola, is the company's highest since the second quarter of
1995, when it reported global volume growth of 10 percent. The
figure was also stronger than most analysts' expectations of about
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects its volume in North America to
increase between 7 percent and 8 percent. It said the momentum in
the U.S. also reflects strength from its Olympics marketing
program.
</P>
<P>
It also expects volume to increase between 8 percent and 9
percent in Latin America; between 11 percent and 12 percent in
Europe; and 10 percent in the Middle East and Far East. Coca-Cola
said volume for its Africa region will be flat compared with last
year.

<HEADLINE> Oracle Profit Cools Down Wall Street Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Oracle Corp. of the United
States, the world's leading company in the database software
market, posted a stronger-than-expected profit and sales for the
past quarter.
</P>
<P>
Net income for the period ended May 31 leapt 47 percent to
266.3 million U.S. dollars, from 181.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the news reached the Wall Street, investors felt somewhat
released from their worries about computer industry's profits and
the technology-heavy NASDAQ index recovered from its continuous
declining for the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Oracle managed to beat forecasts despite working under several
handicaps. One of its major efforts was to challenge a kind of new
technology, making a kind of "network computer" priced at 500 U.S.
dollars, much lower than conventional PCs.
</P>
<P>
Its profit was largely generated by all its major markets of
database software, according to a report of the company.
</P>
<P>
Oracle's main competitors are Informix Software Inc. and Sybase
Inc.

<HEADLINE> City Watchdog SIB Launches Review of LME </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Security and Investment Board
(SIB), the chief City regulator, has launched a full- scale review
of the London Metal Exchange (LME) following last week's
revelation of the Japanese company Sumitomo's loss of 1.8 billion
US dollars in unauthorised copper trading.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports say today that the review, which comes at
the request of LME chairman Raj Bagri, was launched Wednesday in a
bid to restore international confidence in the market in the wake
of the Sumitomo copper affair.
</P>
<P>
The LME has faced accusations of lax supervision since
Sumitomo's announcement of huge losses because of unauthorised
dealings by Yasuo Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader.
</P>
<P>
The SIB said that the review would be led by David Pritchard,
51, head of the SIB's markets and exchanges division, and would
examine the position of British brokers involved with Hamanaka.
</P>
<P>
The review, scheduled to take six months, will encompass all
the metals traded on the metal exchange, tin, lead, zinc, nickel,
aluminium, but attention will focus on copper.
</P>
<P>
It will also cover derivative trading, on and off exchange.
Over-the-counter, or off-exchange trading, has traditionally
fallen outside the metal exchange's remit.
</P>
<P>
The review will study not only the LME's own rules and
operations but also the arrangements for international cooperation
between regulators.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB, said: "It is important to
emphasize that in this case the problems have occurred within a
customer of the market, rather than within a regulated investment
firm or bank."
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless the SIB has a strong interest when the impact of
these events creates questions of confidence," Large added.
</P>
<P>
The SIB said it was working closely with the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and with Japanese regulators.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Sumitomo had agreed to cooperate with the
SIB inquiries.

NEW YORK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The General Motors will begin its
mass sales of its electric car, the EV-1, this fall in California
and Arizona as its gift to the 100th anniversary of the world's
car industry.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the USA Today, Honda will follow
with its electric car next spring. Sometime next year, Toyota
introduces an electric RAV4 sport utility.
</P>
<P>
Environmental concerns and rising oil prices have prompted
serious attempts at building alternative fuel vehicles, the
paper said. The market isn't there. But when the breakthrough
comes, "It's going to be impossible to hold it back," says John
Castagna, a specialist closely watching the field.
</P>
<P>
He said that "In another 15 or 20 years, 15 to 20 percent of
vehicles on the road will be electric."
</P>
<P>
But other experts think the more likely vehicle choice is a
hybrid car that can run on an alternative fuel like hydrogen,
natural gas or electricity, then switch to regular gas if it runs
low.

WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
