<HEADLINE> US Women's Soccer Team Tops Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mia Hamm scored her 104th goal in  
international play as the United States women blanked Finland 2-0 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm, who scored from the box in the 58th minute off Joy  
Fawcett's pass, moved within one goal of Italy's Carolina Morace 
for second place on the international goal-scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
	Although controlling the play throughout, the Americans were  
unhappy about their overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be better if we want to win the World Cup,'' Hamm  
said. ``We have to be at our best and right now we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which will be the host of the World Cup later  
this year, took a 1-0 lead on Fawcett's header in the 29th minute. 
The defender was left unmarked near the left post and converted a 
corner kick by Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm nearly set up another goal moments later, but Kristine  
Lilly's header just went wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we made enough great chances today,'' United  
States coach Tony DiCicco said. ``It's not easy to play against a 
team that will not come out and play and they sat in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's best scoring chance came during the 39th minute, but  
goalkeeper Briana Scurry deflected Julia Uusmalmi's drive from 25 
yards over the crossbar.

<HEADLINE> Black Scholar Seeks Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- In the annals of the civil rights movement,  
Preston King isn't even a footnote. But to his family, he is an 
unfinished chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, when young men were still required to register for  
military service, the local draft board refused to extend King's 
deferment to pursue his education. He had been granted time to get 
a master's degree at the prestigious London School of Economics and 
Political Science. But now, ready to pursue a doctorate, he was 
told to report for induction. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who is black, refused, accusing the all-white board of  
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	His proof? The board secretary's insistence on addressing him by  
his first name in correspondence -- and a couple centuries of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have received government orders with which I cannot in  
principle comply due to an immediately conspicuous defect in 
form,'' he wrote in 1959 to the Selective Service's state 
headquarters. ``And in the end I should rather sit in prison, or do 
whatever else, than submit -- an act which I could never square with 
my conscience -- to this reflection of a stupid and inane racialism 
in government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, King was convicted of failing to report and was  
sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The young man who had said he hoped to become a U.S. diplomat  
instead began a life outside the United States as a fugitive. He 
fled the country and, for the better part of four decades, has not 
dared return -- even for the funerals of his parents and brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the ambitious youth from this small south Georgia town is  
a renowned political philosopher and author in England, where his 
daughter, Oona King, is a member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she showed up in Georgia with a BBC television crew  
and instantly put her father's long dormant case back on the front 
burner -- and Albany's segregated past on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The file of King's trial had long ago been packed away, the  
hopeful 20-year-old face on his passport photo stamped 
``CANCELED.'' But now, the U.S. Department of Justice has ordered a 
copy to review. 
</P>
<P>
	Oona King and her American relatives are using her clout to push  
for a presidential amnesty. And so today's justice system has been 
called upon to decide whether King was a legitimate protester 
rejecting generations of humiliating denigration or just a spoiled 
academic who played the race card. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is kind of a cosmic joke,'' says King, now a bearded  
scholar with an Australian passport and an accent more British than 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Albany is a progressive university city in the pecan- and  
peach-growing areas about 145 miles south of Atlanta. Once 
dominated by beef packing plants and cotton mills, the local 
economy is now driven by the likes of Procter &AMP; Gamble, Merck and 
Miller Brewing. Almost half the city's 76,000 residents are black, 
and blacks hold four of the six city commission seats. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a world away from the segregated Albany of King's  
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Clennon W. King, a respected entrepreneur in the  
black community, would park his modest Chevrolet two blocks away 
when collecting rents from white tenants, so as not to appear too 
``uppity.'' Carol King, King's sister-in-law, remembers the 
humiliation of having to cover her hair with tissue paper before 
trying on hats at the local department store. 
</P>
<P>
	King's brother, Clennon Jr., applied for a place in the  
all-white University of Mississippi; instead of being considered, 
he was certified insane. When another brother, Paul, requested a 
college deferment in the early 1950s, the draft board informed him 
he didn't need to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, in his office at Albany State University, where he is a  
professor of English and modern languages, 67-year-old Paul King 
says, ``It was a matter of the way people thought of blacks, that 
they were supposed to be more subservient and that they were 
supposed to think about agriculture or domestic work -- things of 
that sort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the seven King boys were brought up to think differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Their father, who helped found the local chapter of the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and their 
mother, Margaret, a graduate of Tuskegee and Fisk universities, 
always encouraged them to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people had been conditioned to think that they were  
less than others,'' Paul King says. ``And Preston was a person who 
had been taught to soar, to do his best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another thing their father stressed was decorum and respect.  
People, including black people, were to be addressed as ``Mr.'' and 
``Mrs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Preston King, the youngest child, was at historically black Fisk  
University in Nashville, Tenn., when he reported for the draft and 
received his first deferment. It was 1954, the year the U.S. 
Supreme Court decision in Brown Vs. Board of Education desegregated 
the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jacqueline Terry, secretary of Local Board No. 48 in  
Albany, wrote to him in November to inform him of reporting 
procedures, she began the letter, ``Dear Sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, when King applied for permission to study  
abroad, he appeared in person. When Ms. Terry saw that he was 
black, he contends, she turned her back on him and was cool. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, letters from the board were addressed, ``Dear  
Preston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While King says that rankled him, he did not make an issue of it  
until 1958, when his deferment was up. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traveling in Europe when the board notified him his  
deferment had expired. When he failed to respond to a second 
letter, Ms. Terry sent him an induction notice. 
</P>
<P>
	With a scholarship in hand to pursue a doctorate and the offer  
of a teaching position, King sent two quick letters in September 
1958, apologizing for his tardy response and asking for more time. 
The board refused to reopen his case and ordered him back to 
Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	King exploded.  
</P>
<P>
	``In your correspondence with me, conducted in the name of the  
Board, you have adopted a style and tone which I consider quite 
frankly harsh and very nearly bullying,'' he wrote in October. 
``You have, too, been studiedly discourteous, a fact illustrated by 
your practice of addressing me, a person you do not know, and in 
official correspondence, by my Christian name, and without a 
title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King informed the board that ``any such correspondence received  
by me shall simply be ignored, regardless of personal 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Terry says the board was more than fair with King, granting  
him a two-year deferment when one year was the standard. As for her 
manner of addressing him, she says her orders were to address all 
candidates by their first names, regardless of race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was professional,'' says Ms. Terry, the only surviving  
member of that draft board. 
</P>
<P>
	King says he expected the board would be reprimanded. But when a  
colonel in Atlanta reviewed the case and ruled there was no 
discrimination, King dismissed it as merely rubber-stamping. 
</P>
<P>
	When King came home in 1960 to lecture and visit his family, he  
was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	During his three-day trial in U.S. District Court at Albany,  
King's defense attorneys, including his brother C.B., sought to 
show that he did not willfully shirk his responsibility. They also 
tried to prove discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	But King offered no evidence that white candidates were  
addressed differently from blacks. There was no testimony about any 
white student being granted a deferment in similar circumstances. 
(The national military draft was discontinued in 1976, and Ms. 
Terry says all of the local board's records have been destroyed.) 
</P>
<P>
	King was released pending appeal but instead jumped his $2,500  
bond and returned to England -- leaving behind a system that had 
rejected what he saw as an offer to redeem itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing legitimate about what was done in my case,''  
he says from his office at Lancaster University, where he is a 
professor of political science. ``I was doing them a favor, and 
they turned it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while he has taught and lectured in Africa, Europe, Australia  
and even as close as Canada, King may not appear at the college in 
his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Up the road in Macon, the gleaming white-marble courthouse where  
King's file now resides was named last year in honor of William A. 
Bootle, the judge who presided over King's case. At 96, Bootle's 
mind is still sharp, and he stands by the verdict and sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a draft dodger,'' the white-haired jurist says in a  
patrician Georgia drawl. ``He had to be convicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Bootle now concedes that the board might have been  
discriminatory in its correspondence with King, he says it merely 
reflected the times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see, that was a part of our culture and custom, and this  
draft board was made up of white people in Albany, Ga.,'' he says. 
``And the truth is that we white people did not call black people 
`Mr.' and `Mrs.' in those days. Do you understand that? We just 
didn't do it. And we didn't shake hands with them. We just didn't 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol King says Bootle's comments speak volumes.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the whole issue: `At that time,''' says the retired  
teacher and school administrator. ``Would they prosecute a runaway 
slave if they found him at this time? ... He's still suffering the 
consequences, and they wish he would die and blow away. Because, 
quite frankly, he's an embarrassment to this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. King traveled to Washington in early February to meet with  
members of Attorney General Janet Reno's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Oona King says she is heartened by her discussions with U.S.  
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's astonishing that we have the civil rights movement, and  
40 years down the line we still have people who are still suffering 
the consequences,'' says Ms. King. 
</P>
<P>
	She has a U.S. passport and says she will continue, as long as  
she needs to, to serve as her father's surrogate at funerals and 
other family gatherings back in Georgia. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> DirecTV Losing CBS, Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of satellite customers  
nationwide will no longer be able to watch ``Ally McBeal,'' ``60 
Minutes'' and other Fox and CBS shows on their satellite systems 
after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal court orders are forcing the cutoffs in a dispute  
between satellite companies and broadcasters over conditions under 
which viewers who get their TV from satellite can watch network 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law allows satellite companies to provide ``distant''  
network signals from other broadcast areas to customers only if 
those customers can't receive their local stations using rooftop 
antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds for  
years over how to interpret an arcane legal test for determining 
when a satellite customer can't get a local signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all satellite TV customers will lose CBS and Fox signals --  
only those who the court says weren't legally entitled to receive 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, barring last-minute legal maneuvers by the  
satellite companies, roughly 700,000 customers nationwide won't be 
allowed satellite reception of CBS' and Fox's programs via 
satellite after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV Inc., the nation's largest satellite TV company, said it  
began cutting off illegal customers from the CBS and Fox programs 
late Thursday, shortly after a federal judge in Miami issued a 
temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, DirecTV spokesman Jeff Torkelson said the company was  
reviewing its legal options to avert a massive cutoff. ``It's 
possible we could attempt an appeal, ... but it's not clear whether 
any action would be taken,'' Torkelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Morrisey, an attorney for PrimeTime 24, which also must  
comply with the court-ordered cutoff, said the company plans no 
last-minute legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters argue that beaming distant broadcast signals into  
local markets can hurt local stations' ratings and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite customers cut off from CBS and Fox will need to get  
rooftop antennas to watch their local stations. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chuck Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and  
Communications Association, predicted many will be unable to 
receive decent pictures from their local Fox or CBS stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is likely to be resolved by Congress, where pending  
legislation would make it easier for satellite customers to receive 
distant network programs and their local TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt in Miami issued an order last  
year requiring PrimeTime 24, a leading satellite TV programming 
supplier, and its distributors to stop beaming CBS and Fox programs 
after Sunday to satellite customers who aren't legally entitled to 
receive them. On Thursday, Nesbitt ordered DirecTV to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, DirecTV had been using PrimeTime 24 to provide  
its customers CBS and Fox programs. DirecTV began carrying these 
and other networks' signals on its own Thursday -- but the court 
promptly ordered it to stop providing the CBS and Fox programs to 
illegal customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another order by the same court will cut off an additional 1.5  
million customers from CBS and Fox signals by April 30. None of 
these orders affect NBC, ABC or other networks' affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Nesbitt set March 8 hearing on requests by all four  
networks and their affiliates to force DirecTV to stop providing 
ABC and NBC programs in the future to those customers.

<HEADLINE> Satanism Lawsuit Has Weighty Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The issues are weighty: religious  
liberty, personal privacy, public education. At the outset of a 
federal trial in which three Catholic families are attacking a 
school district, both the First Amendment and the First Commandment 
were invoked. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the tooth fairy was mentioned. A psychic who had  
lectured on creativity said she also was a telepath. A yogi who 
taught stress reduction said he also was a numerologist. 
``Interspecies communication'' was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	And the exasperated judge wanted to know just one thing:  
</P>
<P>
	``Can a psychic tell when this case will finish?''  
</P>
<P>
	The case, which resumes Monday, is perhaps an extreme example of  
the backlash against a nationwide trend that has broadened course 
offerings away from the basics of reading and math. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute began in 1995, when kids in the Bedford Central  
school district, which takes in four affluent towns in Westchester 
County, began playing a strategy card game called ``Magic: The 
Gathering.'' The cards bear images ranging from innocent fairies to 
a lurid depiction of a woman about to be sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents objected to the darker aspects of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's much worse than witchcraft,'' said Mary Ann DiBari, a  
plaintiff who is also a member of the Northeast Ritual Crime 
Investigators Association. 
</P>
<P>
	And when some children formed a Magic club that met in a  
classroom, parents demanded that the schools end all support of the 
game. Superintendent Bruce Dennis halted play for 30 days until 
mental health experts assured him the game posed no danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Not satisfied, the parents went to court and added a number of  
other school activities to their complaint: making models of Aztec 
gods as part of the study of Mexico; studying an owl's regurgitated 
lunch for evidence of its diet; taking a field trip to a cemetery; 
celebrating Earth Day; and making ``worry dolls'' to put under 
children's pillows to keep nightmares away. 
</P>
<P>
	Such activities, they said, amount to ``the promotion of  
Satanism and occultism, pagan religions and New Age spirituality'' 
and violate freedom of religion. The worry dolls, said Mrs. DiBari, 
amount to voodoo. When asked if she found the tooth fairy 
objectionable, she said, ``It was not taught to my child in 
school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earth Day? The plaintiffs said part of the celebration included  
making pledges to the Earth, which they said was like praying. ``We 
worship the creator, not the creation,'' Mrs. DeBari said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs also objected to drug and suicide counseling, as  
well as some homework assignments, as violating the families' 
privacy. They demanded injunctions against some activities, the 
right to opt out of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district said the activities were mainstream and  
wholesome. And allowing opt-outs, Dennis said, would bring chaos to 
the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute sharply divided the community. Some parents held a  
news conference to announce their support of the curriculum. Some 
Catholics separated themselves from the plaintiffs' religious 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the initiation of this lawsuit,'' one parent wrote to  
the judge, ``the atmosphere in the Bedford public schools has been 
one of fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing an important case, the American Catholic Lawyers  
Association has taken up the plaintiffs' cause; the liberal People 
for the American Way is supporting the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Charles Brieant has been insisting that a court is not the  
place for a curriculum dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The framers of the Constitution ``never intended this mess,''  
said the 75-year-old jurist, but he was unable to force a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony last week, the plaintiffs' children told of being  
forced to make models of Mexican and Indian idols; one parent 
recited the First Commandment stricture against false gods. 
</P>
<P>
	The children said they were bothered when the yogi -- Agia Akal  
Singh Kalsa, whose World Wide Web site is called ``yogaguy'' -- came 
to the school to lead stress-reduction exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	When the yogi testified -- in the turban and white robes of a  
Sikh minister -- he said his lesson had ``nothing to do with 
religion'' and that he hadn't mentioned his numerology hobby to the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs claim the schools allow the expression of Eastern  
religions but exclude Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychic, Nancy Weber, said she had been invited to lecture  
on creativity and that she hadn't mentioned being a psychic, a 
telepath or a minister in the LifeSciences Congregational Church. 
The plaintiffs said Ms. Weber inappropriately asked the students to 
``tap into'' themselves by drawing with their non-dominant hands. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. Weber was on the stand, she was asked if she believes  
in ``interspecies communication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I know what interspecies communication is,''  
Brieant said when the defense objected to the subject being 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's communication between people and animals,'' said  
plaintiffs' lawyer James Bendell. 
</P>
<P>
	``You mean, `Come here, Rover, lie down?''' the judge said as  
lawyers and spectators burst into laughter. ``Objection 
sustained.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton announced new federal rules  
Saturday to make child car seats safer and protect ``our smallest 
and most vulnerable passengers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new measure is aimed at helping parents avoid the familiar  
struggle to cinch child safety seats and the confusion that results 
when using seats or cars of different designs. The rule establishes 
a single standardized system for anchoring child safety seats in 
new cars and light trucks by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his weekly radio address, cited government estimates  
that more than 70 percent of children who ride in car seats are at 
risk of injury because their seats are improperly installed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rule, all new child seats will have three standard  
attachments, one on top and two at the base. And all new cars and 
trucks will have standard anchors in the back seats to link to the 
seat attachments. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this new rule and with these three simple attachments,''  
the president said, ``we can save lives and prevent up to 3,000 
injuries a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His radio address was broadcast during a six-day trip with stops  
in Arizona and California before a four-day vacation at a Utah ski 
resort. Before leaving Los Angeles, the president played golf at 
the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. His partners 
included his chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
	The new federal rules have been a long time coming. Two years  
ago Clinton announced he was directing the Transportation 
Department to set uniform standards for car seats. Since then, the 
design of the seat anchorage has changed, in part to try to ensure 
that auto makers could use the same anchor system in vehicles sold 
in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The new standards were recommended by a panel of medical and  
safety experts, seat manufacturers and consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton singled out one member of that panel, Joe Colella,  
executive director of The Dana Foundation, who has been lobbying 
for a universal model since his 3-year-old niece, Dana, was killed 
in a 1993 crash. She was in a car seat that was incompatible with 
the seat belts in her family's car, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All too often, car seats don't protect our children as well as  
they should,'' he said. ``Anyone who has struggled to get a car 
seat to fit snugly into a back seat knows exactly what I'm talking 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president repeated his recommendation that states tighten  
their standards for drunken driving convictions and adopt blood 
alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 percent ``to keep more drunk 
drivers off our roads.'' Many states now set their level at 0.10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year defeated an effort to push states to make  
that change. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates a 137-pound woman who drinks three  
beers in an hour could have a blood alcohol content of 0.07, while 
drinking four beers over the same time period could push her to 
0.10.

<HEADLINE> Indians To Protest Buffalo Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDINER, Mont. (AP) -- Led by a Lakota Sioux spiritual leader,  
about 100 members of American Indian tribes are on a pilgrimage 
asking for an end to the killing of bison that wander out of 
Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	They are bearing witness to the sacred relationship between the  
buffalo and Indian people, said Joseph Chasing Horse, a traditional 
Lakota Sioux leader who helped organize and led the event. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Indian people, eating the flesh of bison is comparable  
in religious significance to Holy Communion among Christians, who 
symbolically eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ, Chasing 
Horse said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Montana cattle ranchers, however, it's a matter of killing  
animals they fear will carry disease to their herds. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, the pilgrims had traveled about 500 miles in 20  
days, many on foot or on horseback, across prairie and mountains 
from Rapid City in the Black Hills of South Dakota on their way to 
this gateway town at the north entrance of Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
	The buffalo, or American bison, was a life-giver to the Plains  
Indians, providing meat, skins and bone that could be shaped into 
implements. In the Lakota language, the buffalo is Tatanka Oyate, 
which means ``He who owns us,'' indicative of the animal's central 
importance to the culture of the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the Lakota Sioux were representatives of tribes from as  
far away as New York and Arizona, including the Algonquin, Apache, 
Assiniboine, Blackfeet, Crow, Navajo, Nez Perce, Northern Cheyenne, 
Southern Ute and Tuscarora. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prophesy says that if the buffalo disappear, the Lakota  
will disappear,'' Chasing Horse said. ``We want to protect the last 
free-roaming herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When winter snowfall is heavy, Yellowstone bison seeking forage  
often wander out of the park and into nearby Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	But Montana livestock officials say about half of the  
Yellowstone bison are infected with brucellosis, a disease which 
can cause cows to abort their calves and can cause undulant fever 
in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	During the winter of 1996-97, Montanans shot or shipped to  
slaughter 1,100 bison, more than a third of the park herd, under a 
federal-state management plan designed to protect their 
multimillion-dollar cattle industry from brucellosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have disputed the likelihood of the disease spreading to  
cattle, and have blasted Montana's policy as being based on cowboy 
politics rather than solid science. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences studied the issue and said  
there was a small but real risk of bison passing the disease to 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't view this as a cattle vs. bison issue. It's a  
straight disease issue. ... We'd like to get this resolved and 
cleaned up,'' said Marc Bridges, acting administrator of the 
Montana Department of Livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials generally believe it is inappropriate to  
intervene any more than necessary in what they regard as a 
free-ranging herd of native wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always said that we feel we're in a tough position here,  
having to deal with so many different agencies that have policies 
different than ours, and to find a compromise we can all live 
with,'' said Marsha Karle, chief spokeswoman for Yellowstone 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy dates back about 15 years. In the mid 1980s,  
Montana authorized a public hunting season for bison. That led to 
television news footage of hunters shooting stationary beasts, 
which then toppled over, spilling their blood onto the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a public relations fiasco. By the early 1990s, the state  
ended civilian bison hunting but said animals that wandered into 
Montana could be shot by state livestock officials or, when 
possible, herded back into Yellowstone by park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a modified management policy now in effect, bison that  
wander out of the park are corralled and tested for brucellosis. 
Animals that test positive are shipped to slaughter; those that 
test negative are either released onto national forest land near 
the park or hazed back inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
	This winter has been mild and bison have not left the park in  
such large numbers as they did two years ago. As of Friday, Montana 
livestock agents had captured and shipped to slaughter 17 bison. At 
least 500 bison had been hazed back into the park. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal officials are working on a new, long-range  
bison management plan. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary environmental impact statement on the new plan is  
expected around July 2000, according to Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the disease issue is removed, these bison can migrate  
however they want to migrate and the wildlife agencies of the 
various states could get in there and regulate them. And we'd still 
have a viable bison herd in Yellowstone National Park,'' Bridges 
said.

<HEADLINE> Drag-Death Killer To Be Isolated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- John King is no longer the center of  
attention in Jasper. The white supremacist convicted of dragging a 
black man to pieces behind a pickup truck is now alone in a cell on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	The convicted killer arrived at the facility Friday, a day after  
he was sentenced to die by injection for killing James Byrd Jr., 
49, last June. There are 443 other men on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	All new arrivals are kept apart from other condemned men until  
prison officials determine whether they will be allowed to spend 
recreation time with others and perform jobs around the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	During this evaluation period, the new arrivals spend 23 hours a  
day in their cells, with one hour of recreation all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of  
Criminal Justice, said the department has not decided what to do 
with King. 
</P>
<P>
	All death row inmates' work privileges have been suspended until  
further notice after the unsuccessful escape attempt by seven 
condemned men last November. For now, the inmates get only an hour 
of face-to-face contact per day in recreation yards half the size 
of a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisoners' rights advocate Ray Hill said King, 24, might never  
be allowed any contact with other prisoners -- and that might keep 
him from harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is a flash point to some of the population on death  
row, so to keep Texas from having another Jeffrey Dahmer situation, 
they'll keep him in pretty close quarters,'' Hill said. Dahmer, the 
Milwaukee serial killer, was beaten to death by another inmate in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued this week that King, who has dozens of racist  
tattoos, could be a murderous threat to minorities behind bars. 
Similarly, the 187 black men on death row might want to avenge 
Byrd's grisly slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks aren't the only ones who might have a grudge against  
King. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald said that King, when he was arrested, claimed to be a  
member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white prison gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigation has revealed he was never a member,''  
Fitzgerald said. ``But as a result of making that claim, our gang 
intelligence people focused a lot of attention on the AB's that 
they did not want. He's not popular with the AB's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorney, Brack Jones, noted his client's miserable  
prison prospects during closing arguments. He called King ``a dead 
man walking,'' whether he got life in prison or the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Shows Up Late for Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It didn't take long for Dennis Rodman to stir  
up a little controversy with his new team, but a Los Angeles Lakers 
spokesman said it wasn't the eccentric forward's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, impressive in his first game for the Lakers on Friday  
night in a 99-83 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, ran into 
some traffic Saturday, and was late for practice at Los Angeles 
Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Supposedly he was about 10 minutes late, '' Lakers spokesman  
John Black said Saturday night. ``It was no big deal. He got caught 
in traffic. It was the same thing for me. Traffic was stopped on 
the 405 (freeway).'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Rodman would be fined Black replied, ``We don't  
discuss fines. We never have. We handle that internally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder each of the last seven  
seasons, had 11 rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes Friday 
night. He will play his second game with the Lakers against the 
Houston Rockets on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said back-up center Elden Campbell was sent home from  
practice with the flu and was questionable for the 
nationally-televised game against the Rockets.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Columnist Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Longtime San Antonio Express-News sports  
columnist Kevin O'Keeffe has resigned, claiming editors who didn't 
like his criticism of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich told 
him he could no longer write about the NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keeffe, who had worked at the newspaper since 1975 and became  
a columnist in 1980, resigned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Express-News Editor Bob Rivard said in a notice to readers  
Saturday that the paper's editors were disappointed O'Keeffe 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our position that he can return to work as a  
columnist,'' Rivard said. ``If he does not, we want to make it 
clear that he was not fired or otherwise forced to tender his 
letter of resignation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keeffe spoke about his departure in interviews on local  
television and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought I had been, quote, taking cheap shots at Gregg  
Popovich, unquote.'' O'Keeffe told KSAT-TV sports. ``And they 
basically said because of that you can't cover the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, in this market, if I can't cover the Spurs I might as  
well go down to Thom McAn and sell some shoes,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivard discounted O'Keeffe's claims that he was forced to quit  
for writing columns critical of Popovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not air an internal personnel situation in public,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Prescription Drug Prices Up 3.9 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prescription drug prices rose 3.9 percent in the  
fourth quarter over the same period a year ago, far outdistancing 
the overall rate of inflation of 1.5 percent, a research firm 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, by IMS Health, showed the rate of increase is  
accelerating slightly, compared to earlier in the year. In each of 
the second and third quarters, drug prices rose 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the way in prices increases, were brand name drugs sold  
in retail stores, which rose 4.7 percent. That was down from a 5 
percent increase in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs are a hot issue for Congress, which is trying to find ways  
to help the elderly dependent on Medicare, which usually does not 
pay for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical industry has fought expanding prescription  
drug coverage to Medicare, fearing the move would lead to 
government price controls as is done in most parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers who have prescription drug insurance coverage are  
somewhat insulated from the price increases. They often pay a set 
fee for drugs called a co-payment, such as $10 or $15 per 
prescription, although drug price increases eventually filter 
through to them as increases in their insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason overall drug prices are up is because price declines  
for generic drugs have slowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Generic drug prices fell by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter,  
compared to a 5 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1997, IMS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that the generic drug industry can no longer sustain  
the large price declines of the past,'' said Martin Glogowski, IMS 
Health's vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten states and the federal government are suing four generic  
companies for allegedly conspiring to sharply increase the prices 
of two drugs in violation of federal antitrust laws. The Federal 
Trade Commission and the states say prices for anti-anxiety drugs 
clorazepate and lorazepam jumped more than 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Measured in dollars, prescription drug sales rose by a robust  
16.8 percent in the fourth quarter, same as a year ago. Prices 
increases, according to IMS, account for less than a quarter of the 
growth. Rather, most sales growth came as a result of increased 
demand for new drugs or new uses for old drugs, IMS Health said.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Fires Aide Over Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayoral candidate Dwight Evans has fired one  
of his campaign officials and another has resigned after a 
supporter created a phony Web site about a Democratic rival and his 
views on race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, www.white99.com, claimed to be the official  
campaign site of mayoral candidate John White, but was really 
created by a friend of a deputy campaign manager of the Evans 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said the site was created without his knowledge.  
</P>
<P>
	John White's lawyer, Mark Mendell, said Friday he will pursue  
civil and criminal charges -- though he didn't specify against whom. 
``Do you really believe that something of this magnitude did not 
have blessings from on high?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site quoted an interview with White in a Spanish language  
newspaper, Al Dia, where he said: ``The black and the brown, if we 
unite, we're going to control this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, a former Housing Authority director, and Evans, a state  
representative, are both black. They are seeking the Democratic 
nomination in the race to replace Mayor Edward Rendell, who is 
barred by the city charter from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	White said the quote was accurate, but had been taken out of  
context in Al Dia. What he meant, he said, was that minorities 
should participate in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said he has apologized to White and that the campaign  
official who knows the author of the Web site has been fired. 
Evans' campaign manager has also resigned.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Strike at R.I. Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A one-day strike by health workers at a  
Rhode Island hospital began today after negotiations over a labor 
contract broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	Union organizer Pamela Chandran said about 1,100 workers,  
including nurses and medical technicians, would miss work today at 
Women &AMP; Infants Hospital, which caters to pregnant women and has a 
large ward for neonatal intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between hospital management and members of the New  
England Health Care Employees Union broke off Friday night, 
Chandran said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this will push management toward reaching a contract  
agreement,'' she said of the strike, adding that workers would 
return Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Kinder, an attorney for the hospital, said the facility  
would continue to care for patients today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hospital will operate Saturday and all essential services  
will remain, but it's a very difficult thing for a health care 
institution to sustain a series of hit-and-run strikes like this 
one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital workers are seeking improved overtime pay, benefits  
and job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder said the hospital has promised that no union workers will  
be laid off even if a proposed merger of the hospital is approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Women &AMP; Infants workers returned from a month-long lockout Jan.  
20 and have been working under a wage freeze and reduced overtime 
pay, conditions the union claims violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder said the hospital had agreed to lift the interim work  
rules.

<HEADLINE> Brogna Sees Burrell Gaining on Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- The ghost of J.D. Drew fades into  
Philadelphia baseball history a little more each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he'd like to, Rico Brogna can't forget the saga of the  
No. 1 draft pick who got away. The Phillies' first baseman fears 
that it's only a matter of time before Pat Burrell, the No. 1 pick 
who followed the Drew debacle, shoves him out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogna has emerged as one of the most productive and best  
defensive first basemen in the National League since the New York 
Mets traded him to the Phillies in 1996. Those who watch his smooth 
glove work can't believe he hasn't won a Gold Glove, and Brogna's 
104 RBIs last year were the most by a Phillies first baseman since 
Don Hurst's 143 in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	All these credentials could be rendered meaningless once Burrell  
is ready to make his anticipated major league debut. After the 
Phillies lost Drew, their No. 1 pick in 1997, Burrell is easily the 
most hyped prospect in club history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew this day was coming,'' general manager Ed Wade said  
Saturday. ``We knew it'd be an issue that we'd have to address. For 
now, it's not a decision we have to make in the near future. Rico 
is our first baseman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, a college star as a third baseman at the University of  
Miami, was assigned No. 76 and sent across the diamond to work out 
at first base when camp started. The high number indicates that 
he'll start the season in the minors -- in Double-A at best, Wade 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no way Burrell was going to move out Gold Glove  
third baseman Scott Rolen. That left Brogna wondering if this will 
be his last spring training with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that they're really excited and enthusiastic,  
because it looks like he's going to be a great hitter,'' Brogna 
said of Burrell. ``The city's excited because he's the No. 1 draft 
pick, and they went through a very tough ordeal with J.D. Drew. 
</P>
<P>
	'' This happening the very next year makes everyone anxious to  
see what he's going to be like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drew refused to sign with the Phillies after they made him the  
third overall pick in the 1997 draft. The Phillies wouldn't grant 
agent Scott Boras' demand for a $10 million package, and Drew sat 
out 1 1/2 seasons and ended up with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all this, Brogna hasn't demanded a contract extension  
beyond his current $2.95 million deal for this season. And he's 
agreed to help Burrell learn his new position, and would even play 
the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants nothing more than to see his name in the starting  
lineup when the Phillies open their new stadium in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was brought up from my dad and the way I learned sports was  
the team always comes first,'' Brogna said. ``We're in the same 
uniform now. Any way I can help anybody in the same uniform, I'm 
going to be willing to do it. I don't look at it as a threatening 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogna, whose 80-game errorless streak was broken last year,  
seems an unlikely candidate to move to the outfield. The Veterans 
Stadium turf that will be a factor for three more seasons would be 
a blow to Brogna's courageous battle with spinal arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Logically, Brogna would be trade bait to help the Phillies  
acquire pitching to go with their foundation of young position 
players once Burrell is ready for the majors. They are unlikely to 
be able to afford to give Brogna the big contract he's earned after 
giving Burrell a record $8 million package including a $3.15 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Brogna is the first baseman of the moment, and probably  
for this season. The future -- which has the initials ``P.B.'' 
instead of ``J.D'' -- is still to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to be a part of the whole process, from  
the worst of times to the best of times,'' Brogna said. ``I hope 
someday we end up on the same team here together.''

	Clinton Mulls China Human Rights  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New pressure is now on the Clinton  
administration to support an international resolution condemning 
China after the release of a State Department report documenting a 
surge human rights abuses there. China must learn it ``cannot 
purchase stability at the expense of freedom,'' President Clinton 
told a San Francisco audience. But he indicated he's not yet ready 
to announce whether he will back such a resolution. The 
department's annual human rights report, issued yesterday, gives 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright more ammunition to use when 
she meets with Chinese officials next week during an Asian trip.

	Reformists Appear Ahead in Iran  
</P>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Early results from Iran's first local  
elections in 20 years show hard-liners losing to candidates who 
support reformist President Mohammad Khatami, an independent 
newspaper reported today. Election officials at the Interior 
Ministry said that former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri and 
other pro-Khatami candidates were the front-runners in early 
results, the Jahan-e-Islam daily reported. It was unclear when the 
first official results would be released. Final results could take 
up to a week to tabulate because of the large number of candidates, 
ministry officials said.

	U.S. Economy Continues To Thrive  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the global financial crisis, the U.S.  
economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly 15 years last quarter, 
closing out a year in which Americans enjoyed the best combination 
of rapid growth, low unemployment and low inflation in at least 
three decades. The nation's gross domestic product, the total 
output of goods and services, shot up at a sizzling annual rate of 
6.1 percent from October through December, the Commerce Department 
said yesterday.

	Nigerians Vote for New President  
</P>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Fifteen years after Nigeria's last  
civilian leader was ousted by the army, Nigerians today are voting 
for a new civilian president in a long-awaited transition from 
military rule. At polling stations in Lagos, voters began lining up 
in the morning for accreditation, while on some street corners, 
groups of exuberant young men shared bottles of palm wine, singing 
and chanting party slogans. The elections are a contest between 
retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo and former finance minister Olu 
Falae, both former political prisoners under the late military 
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.

	British Balloonists Break Record  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two British balloon pilots attempting to fly  
nonstop around the globe set a record today for the longest hot air 
balloon flight, their spokesman said. Adventurers Colin Prescot, 
48, and Andy Elson, 45, were soaring at 17,000 feet over Bombay, 
India when they broke the endurance record at 1 a.m. EST after 
being aloft 233 hours and 55 minutes, spokesman Ian Ashpole said. 
The previous record had been set by Elson last year on his failed 
round-the-world bid, which ended in Burma after China refused him 
permission to enter its airspace.

	McCain Denounces Nasty Campaigning  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Casting himself as the conscience of  
the GOP presidential field, Sen. John McCain yesterday promised 
``not to stoop to negative campaigning against fellow Republicans'' 
and challenged his rivals to take a similar pledge. ``Scorched 
earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an Al Gore 
presidency,'' the Arizona senator warned in a speech to the 
California Republican Party. Four other GOP presidential prospects 
addressing the same group today have been highly critical of 
front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush. They are former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, businessman Steve Forbes, activist Gary Bauer 
and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Interested in Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Potential baseball ownership groups in the  
nation's capital perked up after hearing the Montreal Expos 
franchise might be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has denied a request by the Expos to put  
off a March 6 deadline for having a new ownership group and stadium 
financing in place. The rejection increased the chances of the team 
eventually leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington and northern Virginia, there was some optimism the  
area might get the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hope springs eternal again,'' said Michael Frey, a Fairfax  
County supervisor and a member of the Virginia Baseball Stadium 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``But who knows what next week will bring? It is all part of a  
roller coaster'' was quoted in The Washington Post on Saturday. 
``You try not to get too high or too low until it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Collins III, the leader of the Virginia-based group  
investor group, said he was watching the developments closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the team is put up for sale with the blessing of major  
league baseball, we stand ready to discuss the acquisition and 
relocation to the national capital area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams, who said this week he would lead an  
aggressive effort to bring back a team, called baseball's refusal 
to give the Expos more time ``a classic force play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bases are loaded and it is a full count for Montreal,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Senators left town after the 1971 season and  
became the Texas Rangers.

<HEADLINE> NFL May Reject Sale of Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven NFL owners are willing to reject the  
deal the sale of the Washington Redskins, according to the 
Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven no votes would mean the remaining 24 team owners would  
have to grant their approval for the deal to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid by Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel Snyder faces  
opposition from the owners of the New Orleans Saints, the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cleveland Browns, the Denver Broncos, the 
Buffalo Bills, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers, 
the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other teams were still undecided, and the owners were  
awaiting a report on the sale from the NFL finance committee ahead 
of an expected vote at an owners meeting March 14-18 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of the NFL's 30 teams must approve the sale for  
it to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins President John Kent Cooke -- son of the team's late  
owner, Jack Kent Cooke, and who lost out in his own bid to buy the 
team -- would benefit most if the deal is turned down. But under an 
agreement with the trustees of his father's estate, he must vote to 
approve.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Explodes But None Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH BONNEVILLE, Wash. (AP) -- A natural gas pipeline exploded  
in the Columbia River Gorge, sending a fireball into the winter sky 
and creating an orange glow visible for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings  
following Friday night's blast about 30 miles east of Portland, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The building shook when it happened,'' said Walter Lobsinger,  
a cook at the Sidetrack Restaurant in North Bonneville. ``Flames 
were 100 feet high at least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,900-mile line operated by Williams Gas Pipelines of Salt  
Lake City runs from Sumas, on the Canadian border, to northern New 
Mexico. Utility officials in Washington and Oregon said no service 
disruptions were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Williams, Jennifer Pierce, said crews were  
investigating the cause of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an explosion on the same pipeline on Jan. 2 near  
Pendleton, Ore., Pierce said. As many as 10,000 customers in Oregon 
and southeastern Washington lost service but no one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Research Plane Probes Nor'easter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the government's hurricane hunting  
research planes has became a nor'easter hunter, plunging into the 
winter storm battering New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration P-3 Orion  
was completing a research project in Newfoundland when the storm 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	So it flew into the nor'easter Thursday to take a variety of  
measurements designed to aid meteorologists studying these intense 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane dropped instruments called ``dropwindsondes,'' which  
continuously radio back measurements of air pressure, humidity, 
temperature and wind direction and speed as they fall toward the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	That information gives scientists a detailed look at the  
structure of the storm and its intensity. Measurements showed winds 
of 60 mph at the earth's surface while winds at 10,000 feet 
altitude were calm. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane flew through the center of the storm and recorded a  
surface pressure reading of 988 millibars. Normal surface pressure 
is 1,013 millibars. Pressure falls in storms. 
</P>
<P>
	While a pressure of 988 millibars represents a strong storm,  
powerful Hurricane Mitch last October managed a reading of 905 
millibars. 
</P>
<P>
	NOAA officials said the observations were taken at the height of  
the storm off the tip of Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft had been flying research projects out of Canada and  
Iceland for the past 30 days and was en route from St. John's, 
Newfoundland, to Tampa, Fla. when the storm developed. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Florida-based plane is best known for flying into  
hurricanes, in winter it does a variety of weather research. 
</P>
<P>
	The just-completed project was a study of high winds over the  
North Atlantic, designed to aid in the calibration of a 
wind-sensing instrument being developed for launch on weather 
satellites.

	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Robert Heron, a leader in designing  
tramways and ski lifts, including Aspen Mountain's Lift No. 1, died 
Friday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Heron, trained as a civil engineer, began his career building  
aerial tramways to haul material to the mines of the Kennicott 
Copper Co. 
</P>
<P>
	While working for the Denver-based Stearns Roger Manufacturing  
Co., Heron came up with trams that the Army's 10th Mountain 
Division used to shuttle ammunition, food, water and casualties 
during the battle of Riva Ridge in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heron is best known for his peacetime work.  
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1940s, Heron and his older brother formed Heron  
Engineering. Among their first projects was Lift No. 1 on Aspen 
Mountain. The brothers also built one of the world's first double 
chairs, at Berthoud Pass, in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1945-1979, their company built and installed 78 ski lifts  
and aerial tramways around the world, 30 of them in Colorado. 
Twenty-six of his Colorado lifts are still operating. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Heron was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame,  
and other honors followed.

	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Richard R. Shinn, who joined MetLife as  
a $15-a-week mailroom employee in 1939 and rose to become chairman 
and chief executive officer, died Friday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, a native of Lakewood, N.J., was 18 when he went to work  
for MetLife. He went on to become a prominent leader in the life 
insurance industry and assumed key roles in national and state 
public policy issues, including membership on the blue ribbon panel 
that averted New York City's financial crisis in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his personal involvement, MetLife floated $80 million in  
``Big Mac'' bonds that helped alleviate the city's financial 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn was elected MetLife's president and a member of the board  
in 1969. He was appointed chief executive officer in 1973 and 
became chairman of the board and CEO in 1980. He retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his leadership, MetLife became the industry's foremost  
provider of group insurance and entered the property and casualty 
insurance and reinsurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executive vice president of the New York Stock Exchange  
from 1986 to 1988. He also served as a member of the boards of the 
Lincoln Center for Performing Arts, Cornell Medical College, the 
Boys Clubs of America and the Metropolitan Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a director of St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical  
Center of New York, Vanderbilt University, Barnard College and the 
Inner City Scholarship Fund.

	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- David H. Smith, who co-developed a  
vaccine that has almost eradicated bacterial meningitis in the 
United States, died Tuesday of malignant melanoma, a skin cancer. 
He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and co-inventor Porter Anderson began developing the  
vaccine while both worked at the University of Rochester. After the 
vaccine hit the market, cases of Haemophilus influenzae Type B 
infections plummeted nationwide from 20,000 in 1987 to 81 in 1997, 
federal statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith formed Praxis Biologics, a company spun off from the  
University of Rochester in 1983. He eventually sold it for $232 
million, and put much of his wealth from the vaccine into a 
foundation that funds conservation and scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in  
Boston in the late 1960s to 1976, and chairman of pediatrics at the 
University of Rochester from 1976 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Anderson were awarded the prestigious Lasker Clinical  
Medical Research Award in 1996 for their work on the vaccine. The 
same year, Smith received the Pasteur Award from the World Health 
Organization.

was the spiritual leader of more than 6,000 families in eastern 
Washington and northern Idaho, died Friday from complications 
following a heart transplant. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry had been hospitalized since late September. Until the  
transplant on Jan. 7, he directed the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane 
from his room. 
</P>
<P>
	He presided over his last communion service on Christmas Day,  
around a dinner table with his wife and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry had suffered from cardiomyopathy, an enlargement and  
weakening of the heart, and had waited more than two years for his 
new heart.

<HEADLINE> Student Rehired After `Canuck' Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- A student who lost his job as a writer  
for the Indiana State University campus newspaper after referring 
to Canadians as ``Canucks'' in a column has been rehired. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Viquez, 23, was fired after his Feb. 17 column in the  
Indiana Statesman used the phrase ``Canuck'' in a tongue-in-cheek 
manner to describe the influx of Canadians into American 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rehired this week by Statesman editor Brian McKinley, who  
said the firing had involved issues beyond the column. He declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Merv Hendricks, ISU's director of student publications, had  
complained that the term is a derogatory label for French 
Canadians. He said he later received e-mails from Canadians saying 
they weren't offended by the term, which is the nickname of 
Vancouver's National Hockey League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Viquez, a senior majoring in recreation/sports management, said  
he wrote the column at the suggestion of his Canadian girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have no apologies for what I wrote. I think we all  
know Canuck is not an offensive word,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Sign Thompson, Runyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers signed left-handed  
pitcher Justin Thompson to a two-year deal and signed reliever Sean 
Runyan to a one-year contract Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is guaranteed $3.6 million, and could earn up to $4.3  
million if incentives are reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract took a little longer than I thought it would,''  
Thompson said. ``I've always felt like a part of this team, but it 
took so long to get done that it made it real frustrating. It made 
me wonder, `How much a part of this team are you?' But now that 
it's done, I'm fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 25, has led Tigers pitchers for the past two seasons  
in innings pitched, strikeouts and complete games. Last year he 
compiled a 11-15 record with a 4.09 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous season he had a 15-11 record, a 3.02 ERA and was an  
All-Star selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan, 24, went 1-4 last year with a 3.58 ERA and one save. He  
led the majors in appearances by a rookie pitcher with 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Runyan's contract were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Longshot Upsets Field in Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- After Saturday's Southwest Stakes,  
maybe somebody will listen to trainer John Milliron when he raves 
about Jim'smrtee. 
</P>
<P>
	Milliron gave the son of 1992 Kentucky Derby winner Lil E. Tee  
every opportunity to succeed and the longshot scrambled the 
3-year-old picture at Oaklawn Park with a half-length victory over 
Kutsa. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim'smrtee was the biggest price in the field of nine that  
included previously unbeaten Temperence Time. Ridden by Travis 
Hightower, Jim'smrtee paid $106, $33.20 and $24.20. Kutsa paid $8 
and $10. He finished two lengths in front of King of Scat, who paid 
$8. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning time was 1:39 2-5, the slowest since the Southwest  
became a mile race in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperence Time, who had won all four of his starts, wound up  
seventh after trying two turns for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been telling you all along about this colt,'' Milliron  
said. ``Nobody would listen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had been high on the colt since he ran a gutsy third  
to Gold Market at one mile and 40 yards in December in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the colt's next two races were on an off track and that  
he had trouble handling the surface. ``All night long I kept 
praying, please don't rain, don't rain,'' he said. ``I knew I had 
the racehorse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the little prayer, Milliron added blinkers to  
help the colt's concentration and the anti-bleeding medication 
Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim'smrtee was second in his last start, a six-furlong allowance  
race. ``At the head of the lane, he got to looking around at the 
crowd, the noise and that's when I said blinkers are going on,'' 
Milliron said. ``Lasix has always been in my plans. I said when I'm 
getting ready to crank him, he will be on Lasix. I didn't want no 
bleeding or nothing to happen to this colt today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Hutzel, who has a 600-acre farm near Hot Springs, bought  
Jim'smrtee for $7,500 as a weanling at a sale in Little Rock. ``I 
liked Lil E. Tee when he ran here,'' Hutzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim'smrtee, who had won only once in eight previous starts,  
earned $45,000 from the $75,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington Park broke on top and was quickly joined on the lead  
by Kutsa. Jim'smrtee was third into the first turn and was still 
third down the backstretch, parked off the rail. Hightower sneaked 
a peek back before entering the far turn and made certain he did 
not leave a hole for McKendree, hard on his heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington Park gave up before reaching the turn. Jim'smrtree had  
some trouble negotiating the turn, but moved even with Kutsa before 
they turned into the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner edged past Kutsa in the final 50 yards, but Hightower  
said he still wasn't paying attention to the business at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Halfway down the stretch I got about a neck in front and  
thought I was putting the winner away, but my horse got tired 
late,'' said David Guillory, the rider on Kutsa. 
</P>
<P>
	Milliron said Jim'smrtee would make his next start in the Rebel  
Stakes in about three weeks.

	Today is Sunday, Feb. 28, the 59th day of 1999. There are 306  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 28, 1849, the ship California arrived at San Francisco,  
carrying the first gold-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1827, the first U.S. railroad chartered to carry passengers  
and freight, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., was incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1844, a 12-inch gun aboard the USS Princeton exploded,  
killing Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur, Navy Secretary Thomas W. 
Gilmer and several others. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1861, the Territory of Colorado was organized.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, the Senate committee headed by Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn.,  
issued a preliminary report saying at least two major crime 
syndicates were operating in the United States. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nobel-Winner Glenn Seaborg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Glenn Seaborg, the Nobel Prize-winning  
nuclear chemist who discovered plutonium and so many other elements 
that scientists had to redesign the periodic table, has died. He 
was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg died Thursday night at his home not far from his office  
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The lab said he had been 
convalescing since August, when he suffered a stroke while being 
honored at an American Chemical Society meeting in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg helped run the Manhattan Project that led to the use of  
the atomic bomb during World War II, then campaigned for the 
peaceful use of atomic energy as chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Commission, forerunner to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He was often asked if he had any idea what he had unleashed when  
his team discovered plutonium in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a 28-year-old kid and I didn't stop to ruminate about  
it,'' Seaborg said in a 1997 Associated Press interview. ``I didn't 
think, `My God, we've changed the history of the world.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in the lab, mostly at the University of California,  
Berkeley, that Seaborg gained renown as one of the century's 
greatest scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with  
the late Edwin McMillan for research into the transuranium elements 
(those beyond uranium on the periodic table), Seaborg received the 
National Medal of Science in 1991, the nation's highest award for 
scientific achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of element 94, plutonium, happened on a stormy  
night in February 1941 when he, McMillan, Joseph Kennedy and Arthur 
Wahl bombarded a sample of uranium with deuterons and transmuted it 
into the new element. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, joined by Emilio Segre, the team identified the  
isotope plutonium-239 and showed that it was fissionable. That made 
it the candidate to be the explosive ingredient in a bomb as well 
as the fuel for nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, Seaborg formulated a concept of the structure of heavy  
elements that was called one of most significant changes in the 
periodic table since Mendeleev's 19th century design. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senior colleagues counseled that advocating such a radical  
concept would ruin my scientific reputation,'' he recalled in his 
online biography. ``Fortunately for me, at the time my scientific 
reputation was nothing to worry about losing. And even more 
fortunate, I was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg and his colleagues used his concept as a stepping stone  
to the creation of other heavy transuranium elements, including 
americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, 
mendelevium, nobelium and seaborgium. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``seaborgium'' was officially accepted as the name for  
element 106 in August 1997, it was the first time an element had 
ever been named for a living person. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a great honor because that lasts forever,'' Seaborg  
said. ``One hundred years from now, or a thousand years from now, 
it'll still be seaborgium when you'd probably have to look in 
obscure books to find any references to what I had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Seaborg's fingerprints are all over 20th century history.  
</P>
<P>
	His colleague Albert Ghiorso, who with Kenneth Hulet, Seaborg  
and others co-discovered element 106, said Seaborg's scientific 
brilliance, way with words and administrative aplomb made him a 
good ambassador for his field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the one who really first popularized nuclear chemistry.  
It was started by other people; he was the one who really pushed it 
to the fore and he deserves a lot of credit,'' Ghiorso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg earned a chemistry degree from UCLA before moving on to  
work at the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. and finally to Berkeley, 
a mecca for the burgeoning world of nuclear science. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg helped discover the workhorses of radiation medicine,  
including technetium-99m and iodine-131, which was used to prolong 
his own mother's life in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He has written hundreds of articles and books, including work on  
a recent back-to-basics science standards tome for California's 
schools and a soon-to-be-published autobiography titled ``A Chemist 
in the White House: From the Manhattan Project to the End of the 
Cold War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg is survived by his wife and five of their six children.

<HEADLINE> Prescription Drug Prices Up 3.9 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prescription drug prices rose 3.9 percent in the  
fourth quarter over the same period a year ago, far outdistancing 
the overall rate of inflation of 1.5 percent, a research firm 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, by IMS Health, showed the rate of increase is  
accelerating slightly, compared to earlier in the year. In each of 
the second and third quarters, drug prices rose 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the way in prices increases, were brand name drugs sold  
in retail stores, which rose 4.7 percent. That was down from a 5 
percent increase in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs are a hot issue for Congress, which is trying to find ways  
to help the elderly dependent on Medicare, which usually does not 
pay for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical industry has fought expanding prescription  
drug coverage to Medicare, fearing the move would lead to 
government price controls as is done in most parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers who have prescription drug insurance coverage are  
somewhat insulated from the price increases. They often pay a set 
fee for drugs called a co-payment, such as $10 or $15 per 
prescription, although drug price increases eventually filter 
through to them as increases in their insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason overall drug prices are up is because price declines  
for generic drugs have slowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Generic drug prices fell by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter,  
compared to a 5 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1997, IMS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that the generic drug industry can no longer sustain  
the large price declines of the past,'' said Martin Glogowski, IMS 
Health's vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten states and the federal government are suing four generic  
companies for allegedly conspiring to sharply increase the prices 
of two drugs in violation of federal antitrust laws. The Federal 
Trade Commission and the states say prices for anti-anxiety drugs 
clorazepate and lorazepam jumped more than 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Measured in dollars, prescription drug sales rose by a robust  
16.8 percent in the fourth quarter, same as a year ago. Prices 
increases, according to IMS, account for less than a quarter of the 
growth. Rather, most sales growth came as a result of increased 
demand for new drugs or new uses for old drugs, IMS Health said.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Reached in Minister's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Jurors in the racketeering trial of the  
National Baptist Convention USA president reached a verdict today, 
then it was sealed while a judge considered a defense request for a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came on the third day of deliberations in the  
racketeering trial of the Rev. Henry Lyons, the powerful Baptist 
leader accused of fleecing companies of more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous e-mail sent to two media outlets accused a juror of  
discussing deliberations outside the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It caused great concern on our part,'' Lyons' attorney, Denis  
DeVlaming, told Circuit Judge Susan Schaeffer in asking for a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail said the female juror on the six-member panel was  
overheard saying jurors were convinced of Lyons' guilt. The woman 
allegedly expressed dissatisfaction and concern at being the only 
holdout against finding co-defendant Bernice Edwards guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer summoned the juror to the courtroom. The juror denied  
the conversation. Furthermore, she said she didn't know the writer 
of the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, and  
co-defendant Bernice Edwards are accused of financing a lavish 
lifestyle with money from companies seeking to do business with 
convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Lyons and Ms. Edwards duped the companies by  
selling them a bogus 8.5 million-member mailing list and then used 
the money to buy a waterfront home, a time-share condominium, a 
huge diamond ring and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
almost $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 
money intended to rebuild burned churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Lyons faces between three and seven years in  
prison. Edwards faces three to five years in prison if she is 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also faces a federal trial in April on 54 counts,  
including tax evasion, money laundering and extortion.

<HEADLINE> Behrens Wins Gulfstream Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Behrens, second in his previous two  
stakes races, moved to the front at the three-eighths pole Saturday 
to win the $350,000 Gulfstream Handicap by 2 1/2 lengths over 
fast-closing Archers Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jorge Chavez, Behrens covered the 1 1/4 miles in 2:01 4-5  
to return $4.80, $3 and $2.20. Archers Bay paid $3.80 and $2.80 and 
Sir Bear finished third to return $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens was the 7-5 favorite despite not having won since  
September 1997, largely on his previous two performances. He 
finished second to Sir Bear in the Broward Handicap on Jan. 9, then 
was runnerup to Puerto Madero three weeks later in the Donn 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we brought him back this year, he really started to  
mature and his races show it,'' trainer H. James Bond said. ``He 
came into this race really well and I expect him to keep running 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens has won five of 14 career starts, with earnings of  
$1,389,000. Until Saturday, the last win for the 5-year-old son of 
Pleasant Colony had come in the 1997 Pegasus Stakes at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	That was followed by a disastrous start in the 1997 Breeders'  
Cup Classic, when he faded from third on the backstretch to finish 
seventh in a field of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez is in the midst of a seven-day suspension, but was able  
to ride Behrens under the ``designated stakes'' rule. That allows a 
jockey to ride in certain stakes if they are willing to add a day 
to their suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good exchange,'' Chavez said. ``He is a much better  
horse now. I think he's going to improve even more. I thought Sir 
Bear would be on the lead. When he wasn't, I just got in behind the 
front horse and waited to move.''

<HEADLINE> Tanker Full of Gas Crashes in La. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIOLET, La. (AP) -- The Coast Guard shut down a 21-mile stretch  
of the Mississippi River Saturday to clean up oil spilled when a 
tanker filled with gasoline lost power and hit a series of boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash about 11 p.m. Friday knocked a hole in one of the fuel  
tanks of the 551-foot, Liberian-flagged Hyde Park, spilling 3,000 
gallons. The Coast Guard said the 25,000 metric tons of gasoline it 
carried remained safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The river was reopened to traffic about 5 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
	The tanker was headed downriver when it lost power and hit a tug  
pushing 12 loaded barges loaded with coke, damaging one and sinking 
another. It also hit a dock, a crewboat grounded on the bank and 
two more barges. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt, but crews set up booms around downriver water  
intakes to keep oil out of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hyde Park was carrying pyrolysis gasoline, a refined  
petroleum product used for a variety of chemical processes.

<HEADLINE> Men's 400 Is Open Without Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With record-holder Michael Johnson missing from  
the men's 400 meters, Steve Lewis, Milt Campbell and Angelo Taylor 
all set their sights on winning the race at today's USA Indoor 
Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The field is evenly spread,'' Campbell said Friday after  
winning his trial heat in 45.75 seconds, the fastest by an American 
this year. ``He (Johnson) wasn't guaranteed to win, but now 
everyone has a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Campbell, no relation to the Milt Campbell who won the  
1956 Olympic decathlon, was pleased that Johnson, the world indoor 
record-holder and 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion, isn't 
competing, Taylor was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish he were here so I could get a chance to run against  
him,'' Taylor, the 1998 NCAA 400-meter hurdles champion from 
Georgia Tech, said after winning his heat in 45.91. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love competition. I'm not afraid of competition. It will  
make me better. I'm just looking to improve. Anytime someone steps 
on the track, you're not sure he's going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, there are no guarantees, but Johnson is considered  
the king of the quarter-milers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Johnson, Lewis was on top in the 400, along with Butch  
Reynolds, the world record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was only 19 when he won Olympic gold medals in the 400 and  
1,600 relay in 1988. Four years later, he won the silver medal in 
the 400 and another gold in the relay. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Lewis was besieged with injuries, and in 1996, doctors  
discovered a cyst ``the size of a sausage'' in his lower back. If 
the cyst had not been removed in time, Lewis said he might not have 
been able to walk again, much less run. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after two impressive races -- a victory in 46.48 last  
Saturday in New York, his first indoor race in five years, and 
46.38 in winning his heat at the Georgia Dome on Friday -- Lewis 
said, ``I'm not finished making history yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I've reached my potential yet,'' Lewis, 29,  
added. ``I don't feel too old to accomplish things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I have a lot more in me. I feel I still have it. When  
you're a runner, it's hard to stop because of injuries. When I was 
younger, things came a little easier. But now that I'm older, it's 
tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Lewis wins today, he would qualify for the U.S. team for the  
World Indoor Championships next weekend at Maebashi, Japan. It 
would be his first international team in seven years since the 1992 
Barcelona Games.. 
</P>
<P>
	Incidentally, there was a Michael Johnson in Friday's 400  
trials. This Michael Johnson is a junior at Georgia Tech. He ran 
nothing like his namesake, finishing second in his heat in 47.09, 
failing to qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Two world champions advanced easily into today's finals.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Little, the men's 200 champion in 1997, had the fastest  
time in the three 200 heats, 20.59. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel much pressure to repeat (as world champion),''  
Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark, the 1997 world champion in the women's 400,  
won her heat in 53.12, the slowest of the three heat times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough (to defend the world title), but I'm  
tough,'' Miles-Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials also were held Friday in the women's 200 and 800, and  
men's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notables advancing were Joetta Clark, three-time defending  
champion seeking her sixth title overall, and Meredith Valmon, the 
1991 champion, in the women's 800, and Rich Kenah, the 1997 world 
indoor and outdoor bronze medalist in the men's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 29 finals were scheduled today.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Cops Seek Missing Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUNTA GORDA, Fla. (AP) -- Law enforcement agents searched rural  
areas near this city on Florida's west coast Saturday for a 
4-year-old girl last seen three weeks ago with her baby sitter, but 
authorities provided few clues to sort out several conflicting 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby sitter, 22-year-old Melissa Cooper, told investigators  
the child was the victim of a a ``totally senseless'' crime while 
she and her boyfriend were in Punta Gorda, about 75 miles south of 
Tampa. She reportedly told police were the body could be found. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby sitter's mother, 42-year-old Deborah Cooper, said that  
her daughter told her the girl, Pilar Rodriguez, was fatally beaten 
by the baby sitter's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	But the boyfriend, trucker Keith Allen Wilson, said the baby  
sitter told him the child's father took the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not made any arrests in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, unconvinced by the baby sitter's statement about  
a crime, believe the girl is in Florida and may still be alive, 
said sheriff's Col. John Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope she's alive. We have no indication that she isn't at  
this point,'' he said. ``We're going with the assumption that she 
is alive, possibly abducted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child's father, 29-year-old Marco Rodriguez, who shares an  
apartment with the baby sitter's mother, reported his daughter 
missing Monday. He said Ms. Cooper was supposed to return with the 
child on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found Ms. Cooper visiting relatives in Wisconsin.  
She told detectives in Florida where they might find Pilar's body, 
said Caledonia, Wis., Police Chief Jeffrey Meier.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Right on time, Randy Myers showed up for spring training. Right  
on his time, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers became the last player to arrive at camp for the San Diego  
Padres on Saturday and made no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing it this way for 10 years,'' Myers said at  
Peoria, Ariz. ``I prepare for seven months, and I don't include 
March as one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, he was not late because the mandatory reporting  
date is Tuesday. But the other pitchers and catchers reported on 
Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, 36, thought he'd be traded in the winter, and there were  
rumors he would sent to the Chicago White Sox for Jaime Navarro. 
Myers was willing to restructure the remaining two years and $12.25 
million on his contract, but no deal came. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers had 45 saves for Baltimore in 1997, then signed with  
Toronto. He was successful on 28 of 33 save chances for the Blue 
Jays before the Padres got him on waivers Aug. 6. The left-hander 
struggled as a setup man for Trevor Hoffman, going 1-3 with a 6.28 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy was only with us a short time last year, and I think  
it's fair to say, he wasn't throwing like he had the year before,'' 
manager Bruce Bochy said. ``So our concern is to get him back to 
where he was. Because this guy can help us a lot. He's one of the 
better left-handed relievers that's been in the game the last 20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player in Padres camp -- country singer Garth Brooks --  
still is not sure what his future holds. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the team's minor league affiliates -- Las Vegas, Mobile,  
Rancho Cucamonga, Fort Wayne and Idaho Falls -- have each inquired 
about securing a roster spot for Brooks. A decision on if and where 
he will be playing this season won't be made until mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rookie of sorts, Navy Petty Officer 3rd class Mark  
Probst, practiced with the Anaheim Angels in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Probst, 23, partnered with outfielder Tim Salmon to stretch, run  
and take batting practice. He even showed off his skills from his 
days as a pitcher at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a dream come true for me,'' Probst said. ``This is  
the dream of every young Little Leaguer. I have missed playing 
baseball and I am so glad I got to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Probst was given the opportunity to change careers for a day  
after being selected from a group of 80 West Coast sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of catchers, Philadelphia's Mike Lieberthal and Atlanta  
backup Eddie Perez, are progressing nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	All indications are that Lieberthal is recovering from a pelvic  
injury that ended his season shortly after the All-Star break. He 
hit 20 home runs in 1997, but was limited to eight last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal is running without pain and participating in all  
workouts at Clearwater, Fla. He is scheduled to DH in 
Philadelphia's exhibition opener on Thursday against the University 
of South Florida and will catch Friday against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been bothered by it,'' Lieberthal said. ``Not longer  
than a month ago it still bothered me, and I still had a cortisone 
shot. But it feels all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal was placed on the disabled list last July 24 with  
what was called a stress ``reaction'' in the pelvic area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a frustrating injury, because it takes a long time to  
heal,'' Lieberthal said. ``It takes about six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez was in uniform for the first time since undergoing surgery  
for a groin injury on Feb. 19. He did some throwing in the outfield 
and reported no problems at Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez plans to do some hitting Sunday before he starts running  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good,'' he said. ``It feels like I can do everything,  
but I better not do it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who hit a career-high .336 last season as a backup to  
Javy Lopez, was catching for Greg Maddux when he was hit by a foul 
tip during batting practice.

<HEADLINE> Defense Phase Ends for Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After more than four months of highly  
technical and often arcane testimony, Microsoft Corp. rested its 
defense of the government's antitrust lawsuit against the computer 
software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is scheduled to resume in April, after at least a  
six-week break, with Microsoft and the government presenting 
rebuttal arguments. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is 
expected to rule over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The key questions on Friday were largely the same as outlined by  
the Justice Department and 19 states during the trial's opening 
days last October: Did Microsoft illegally use its influence in the 
technology industry to crush its software rivals and maintain its 
lucrative Windows dominance? 
</P>
<P>
	The government has identified Microsoft's victims as Netscape  
Communications Corp., whose Internet software has fallen from 
prominence since 1995, as well as Intel Corp., Apple Computer Inc., 
Sun Microsystems Inc., America Online Inc. and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denies it possesses monopoly power and maintains it  
fought tough but fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's outcome dramatically could affect the computer  
industry during a period when it is making huge technology strides 
and helping drive the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A verdict also could come during a period of remarkable change:  
Weeks after the trial began, America Online agreed to buy Netscape 
for $4.2 billion in a deal that also included Sun Microsystems. 
Even the judge wondered publicly that it ``might be a very 
significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson agreed to allow Microsoft to investigate the impact of  
the purchase during the lengthy upcoming recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Microsoft witness was Robert Muglia, a senior vice  
president who rebutted earlier testimony that the company sought to 
undermine Sun Microsystems' rival Java technology, which allows 
software to run on a variety of computer operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Muglia, however, acknowledged that Microsoft encouraged software  
developers to use Windows-only features that effectively prevent 
their Java programs from running with other operating systems.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Stock Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lycos Inc. is trying hard to tout its merger  
with USA Networks as an ideal marriage of online and real-world 
commerce, but investors remain unsure about the deal's future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet company's stock tumbled 6 percent Friday, even  
after chief executive Robert Davis met with investors to promote 
the deal amid questions about whether Lycos' biggest shareholder 
will approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's caused so much uncertainty and turmoil in the  
marketplace, no one knows what to believe,'' said Abhishek Gami, an 
analyst at William Blair &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks, controlled by media mogul Barry Diller, plans to  
combine its Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster, a telephone 
ticket sales service, with Lycos to create a huge seller of 
jewelry, electronics, concert tickets and other goods over the 
Internet and on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, which provides Internet search and information services,  
is already the Web's fourth most popular destination and would 
enjoy a wealth of cross-promotion with the USA Networks businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at this transaction as one we'll look back on as a  
defining event in this industry,'' Davis told reporters Friday in a 
news conference to emphasize the $22 billion deal's potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis held a similar session with investors late Thursday after  
Lycos reported second-quarter results that edged Wall Street's 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lycos shares fell $5.37 1/2 to close Friday at $87.62 1/2 on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock had dropped immediately after the 
deal was announced Feb. 9 and is now down 31 percent from that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Lycos investors feel they are not getting the huge premiums  
often showered on shareholders of merged Internet companies, and 
also worry that they are getting the short end of the deal. Lycos 
shareholders will own 30 percent of the new company, USALycos 
Interactive Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not really sure what they're getting,'' said Brian  
Hill, an analyst with investment bank Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill. ``It's 
more typically aligned with Hollywood, where they mix everything up 
so much that you never know if you're getting a good deal or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp drop in Lycos shares led CMGI Inc., a venture capital  
firm that owns 20 percent of Lycos, to say on Feb. 11 it wouldn't 
vote for the deal if the stock didn't recover. That news gave the 
stock a brief boost on speculation that the deal would be 
renegotiated or scrapped, but the shares have since stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis tried to cheer investors Friday by saying he believes CMGI  
would eventually approve the deal. ``There is a large and growing 
list of shareholders who support this transaction,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	CMGI officials did not return calls seeking comment on whether  
the company's position has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis would not comment on whether the deal could be  
renegotiated, but said Lycos would still pursue it if CMGI remained 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The new USALycos will have $1.5 billion in annual revenue, most  
of which comes from Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster. Davis 
will remain as CEO.

<HEADLINE> 2 Women Spend Night on Chairlift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Two skiers at the Big Sky resort spent a  
night stuck on a chairlift, staying warm by shadow boxing, 
composing songs and renaming nearby peaks until employees found 
them the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Turner, 27, said she and Melissa Buller survived the  
16 1/2-hour ordeal by not panicking while they dangled 30 feet above 
the slopes in 30 mph winds, afraid to jump for fear of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were scared, but we knew not to overreact,'' Ms. Turner  
said Friday. ``You need to conserve as much heat as possible. ... 
It's lucky we had knowledge of how to prevent hypothermia and 
frostbite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West Yellowstone residents were the last to catch the  
Southern Comfort chairlift Wednesday afternoon. They finally 
reached the top Thursday morning after they were spotted by a 
resort worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got us hot chocolate and water,'' Ms. Turner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Big Sky has procedures to prevent such accidents, and the rules  
are being reviewed to make sure this doesn't happen again, resort 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women tried to stay warm by rubbing their legs and arms.  
</P>
<P>
	``We sat in every position imaginable,'' said Ms. Turner, who  
napped while Buller stayed awake. ``I had chills the whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither woman suffered frostbite. The resort said it was 25  
degrees on the mountain and winds averaged about 31 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were extremely lucky with the weather conditions,'' Ms.  
Turner said. ``If you're going to be stranded, you couldn't have 
picked a better night.''

<HEADLINE>  Life's Back to Normal for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Two weeks after his impeachment trial,  
President Clinton's life seems almost back to normal: speeches, 
travel, fund raising, golf. There was even a family reunion at a 
Utah ski resort to celebrate Chelsea's 19th birthday Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons borrowed the gated, multimillion-dollar mountaintop  
home of Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg for the Utah 
vacation, where they will stay until Tuesday. Katzenberg has 
several intermediate ski runs just off his back yard at the Deer 
Valley Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was getting ready to leave Los Angeles, the president told  
reporters he had had a good day, including shooting an 83 over 18 
holes of golf. ``It was really fun,'' he said. ``I loved it.'' He 
added that he would be catching up on his reading in Utah. ``I 
don't ski so I'm going to stay in and read,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was greeted upon his arrival in Salt Lake City by  
Gov. Mike Leavitt and other local officials before taking a 
motorcade to the Katzenberg home. 
</P>
<P>
	After a scandal-scarred year, a sense of relief and higher  
spirits has seeped into Clinton's entourage. ``We've come a long 
way in the last six years. We've had a good time,'' Clinton told 
cheering supporters late Friday. He talked about the agenda he will 
pursue ``until the last hour of my last day in office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But troubling problems remain for the president, as he  
acknowledged on this six-day trip in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I've made any progress at all in bringing peace  
to Washington, D.C,'' the president said, only half-jokingly, at a 
San Francisco fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, although the impeachment battle is over, Republicans  
remain angry and distrustful, clouding hopes for legislative 
achievements that could improve Clinton's tarnished legacy. His 
job-approval ratings remain high, but opinion polls show that most 
Americans deplore his personal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like his programs; they don't like him,'' said Andrew  
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. ``I don't think it's 
ancient history in terms of how they feel about Clinton and the 
scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohut said 78 percent of Americans say they want a different  
kind of president than Clinton in 2000. ``They want a different 
kind of person, but they want the same kind of programs and 
policies,'' he said. ``The public wants both continuity and 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks Clinton's poll ratings will start to slip over time.  
But not right now, not while scandal-related stories linger. ``All 
of that keeps that dynamic of supporting the president alive,'' 
Kohut said. ``We're not out of this environment quite yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were angry demonstrators at Clinton's stops in Tucson,  
Ariz., San Francisco and Los Angeles, with signs recalling 
allegations of sexual misconduct against him. ``Resign in '99,'' a 
sign read in San Francisco. Many signs branded Clinton a rapist, 
referring to accusations by Juanita Broaddrick that Clinton 
sexually assaulted her 21 years ago. The president's attorney says 
the charges are false. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the demonstrators, there were other reminders of the  
impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing Clinton in San Francisco, Democratic Sen. Barbara  
Boxer said that Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., one the 13 House 
prosecutors in the president's impeachment trial, is considering a 
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, Jim,'' Boxer said in sarcastic reference to his  
prospects. Clinton laughed heartily. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., one of his  
most ardent defenders against impeachment, as a ``lion on the House 
Judiciary Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter aftermath of the impeachment struggle is likely to  
linger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not over,'' said William Kristol, a GOP strategist and  
editor of the conservative ``Weekly Standard'' magazine. ``It's 
obvious now more than ever that the issue of Clinton, in its 
various aspects, is going to be the subtext of the next two years 
and the 2000 elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have the two parties divide so dramatically on such  
a fundamental issue as impeachment and then have it go away, even 
if lots of people in both parties want it to go away,'' he said. 
``November 2000 is when the real verdict comes.''

<HEADLINE> Nobel-Winner Glenn Seaborg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Glenn Seaborg, the Nobel Prize-winning  
nuclear chemist who discovered plutonium and so many other elements 
that scientists had to redesign the periodic table, has died. He 
was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg died Thursday night at his home not far from his office  
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The lab said he had been 
convalescing since August, when he suffered a stroke while being 
honored at an American Chemical Society meeting in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg helped run the Manhattan Project that led to the use of  
the atomic bomb during World War II, then campaigned for the 
peaceful use of atomic energy as chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Commission, forerunner to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He was often asked if he had any idea what he had unleashed when  
his team discovered plutonium in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a 28-year-old kid and I didn't stop to ruminate about  
it,'' Seaborg said in a 1997 Associated Press interview. ``I didn't 
think, `My God, we've changed the history of the world.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in the lab, mostly at the University of California,  
Berkeley, that Seaborg gained renown as one of the century's 
greatest scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with  
the late Edwin McMillan for research into the transuranium elements 
(those beyond uranium on the periodic table), Seaborg received the 
National Medal of Science in 1991, the nation's highest award for 
scientific achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of element 94, plutonium, happened on a stormy  
night in February 1941 when he, McMillan, Joseph Kennedy and Arthur 
Wahl bombarded a sample of uranium with deuterons and transmuted it 
into the new element. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, joined by Emilio Segre, the team identified the  
isotope plutonium-239 and showed that it was fissionable. That made 
it the candidate to be the explosive ingredient in a bomb as well 
as the fuel for nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, Seaborg formulated a concept of the structure of heavy  
elements that was called one of most significant changes in the 
periodic table since Mendeleev's 19th century design. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senior colleagues counseled that advocating such a radical  
concept would ruin my scientific reputation,'' he recalled in his 
online biography. ``Fortunately for me, at the time my scientific 
reputation was nothing to worry about losing. And even more 
fortunate, I was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg and his colleagues used his concept as a stepping stone  
to the creation of other heavy transuranium elements, including 
americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, 
mendelevium, nobelium and seaborgium. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``seaborgium'' was officially accepted as the name for  
element 106 in August 1997, it was the first time an element had 
ever been named for a living person. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a great honor because that lasts forever,'' Seaborg  
said. ``One hundred years from now, or a thousand years from now, 
it'll still be seaborgium when you'd probably have to look in 
obscure books to find any references to what I had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Seaborg's fingerprints are all over 20th century history.  
</P>
<P>
	His colleague Albert Ghiorso, who with Kenneth Hulet, Seaborg  
and others co-discovered element 106, said Seaborg's scientific 
brilliance, way with words and administrative aplomb made him a 
good ambassador for his field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the one who really first popularized nuclear chemistry.  
It was started by other people; he was the one who really pushed it 
to the fore and he deserves a lot of credit,'' Ghiorso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg earned a chemistry degree from UCLA before moving on to  
work at the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. and finally to Berkeley, 
a mecca for the burgeoning world of nuclear science. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg helped discover the workhorses of radiation medicine,  
including technetium-99m and iodine-131, which was used to prolong 
his own mother's life in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He has written hundreds of articles and books, including work on  
a recent back-to-basics science standards tome for California's 
schools and a soon-to-be-published autobiography titled ``A Chemist 
in the White House: From the Manhattan Project to the End of the 
Cold War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg is survived by his wife and five of their six children.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti's Bid for Telecom Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Olivetti SpA's audacious bid for Telecom Italia SpA  
won approval Saturday from Italy's stock-market regulatory agency, 
clearing the way for what would be Europe's biggest 
telecommunications takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval of the regulatory agency, Consob, means Telecom  
Italia will have a much harder time in any effort to block the 
hostile acquisition by Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has said it would offer $58 billion in cash, bonds and  
shares for shares in Telecom Italia, the world's sixth-largest 
telecommunications firm and five times the size of Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	A newcomer to telecommunications, Olivetti made its name  
building computers and typewriters. Its bid poses the biggest 
challenge so far in an industry still dominated by companies that 
long enjoyed monopoly rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Saturday, Telecom Italia chief  
executive Franco Bernabe said the company would present its own 
industrial plan to shareholders, pitting it against Olivetti's 
takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have poison pills in my pocket,'' Bernabe was quoted  
as telling Sole-24 Ore, a financial daily. ``But I have a plan: 
increasing the value of our company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti managing director Roberto Colaninno said he also was  
planning to present an industrial plan to enhance the value of 
Telecom Italia, formerly a state-owned monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob ruled that Olivetti's revamped bid met all regulatory  
requirements, which a first intent-to-bid made on Feb. 20 failed to 
fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Olivetti's second notice said the bid to buy  
Telecom stock would begin in April. The first filing failed to give 
a bidding date. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob said Saturday the bid would be valid as long as Olivetti  
honored its pledge to begin in April. Olivetti has yet to set the 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob's approval of Olivetti's bid sharply limits Telecom  
Italia in any attempts to stave off the takeover. Under Italy's 
corporate laws, Telecom Italia would need authorization from 30 
percent of its shareholders to execute any defensive maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Telecom Italia would have to gather together its 2  
million shareholders. Italy has no well-developed mechanism for 
proxy voting.

Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. ``I don't think it's 
ancient history in terms of how they feel about Clinton and the 
scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohut said 78 percent of Americans say they want a different  
kind of president than Clinton in 2000. ``They want a different 
kind of person, but they want the same kind of programs and 
policies,'' he said. ``The public wants both continuity and 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks Clinton's poll ratings will start to slip over time.  
But not right now, not while scandal-related stories linger. ``All 
of that keeps that dynamic of supporting the president alive,'' 
Kohut said. ``We're not out of this environment quite yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were angry demonstrators at Clinton's stops in Tucson,  
Ariz., San Francisco and Los Angeles, with signs recalling 
allegations of sexual misconduct against him. ``Resign in '99,'' a 
sign read in San Francisco. Many signs branded Clinton a rapist, 
referring to accusations by Juanita Broaddrick that Clinton 
sexually assaulted her 21 years ago. The president's attorney says 
the charges are false. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the demonstrators, there were other reminders of the  
impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing Clinton in San Francisco, Democratic Sen. Barbara  
Boxer said that Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., one the 13 House 
prosecutors in the president's impeachment trial, is considering a 
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, Jim,'' Boxer said in sarcastic reference to his  
prospects. Clinton laughed heartily. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., one of his  
most ardent defenders against impeachment, as a ``lion on the House 
Judiciary Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter aftermath of the impeachment struggle is likely to  
linger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not over,'' said William Kristol, a GOP strategist and  
editor of the conservative ``Weekly Standard'' magazine. ``It's 
obvious now more than ever that the issue of Clinton, in its 
various aspects, is going to be the subtext of the next two years 
and the 2000 elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have the two parties divide so dramatically on such  
a fundamental issue as impeachment and then have it go away, even 
if lots of people in both parties want it to go away,'' he said. 
``November 2000 is when the real verdict comes.''

<HEADLINE> Rhode Island Nurses Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Staging their second symbolic strike in  
two months, more than 1,000 nurses and other union workers at Women 
&AMP; Infants Hospital held a one-day walkout on Saturday, causing 
doctors to postpone some non-emergency surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesting stalled contract talks, members of New England Health  
Care Employees gathered outside the hospital where a similar action 
was staged in late December, followed by a 29-day lockout. Strikers 
were to return to work Sunday, and hospital officials promised not 
to lock them out again. 
</P>
<P>
	One nurse said even after an agreement is reached, things might  
never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, it was a family-oriented environment,'' Theresa Price  
said. ``I don't know if it will go back to being that way with the 
management anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calling in temporary workers, the hospital had to cancel  
some non-emergency procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks broke off Friday night, hospital spokeswoman May  
Kernan said, adding that concessions the union offered weren't 
enough for the hospital facing a $1.4 million operating loss in the 
current fiscal year. No new contract talks have been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lockout, the hospital imposed a wage freeze and  
eliminated some holiday benefits. The union wants those work rules 
tossed out and plans a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital wants to retain the wage freeze for one year,  
followed by a two-year period in which the average wage would 
increase a total of 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which says the hospital's wage increase offer would  
be wiped out by inflation, wants more pay and protection from 
layoffs. Union officials couldn't immediately be reached for 
comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurses have been working without a contract since Nov. 30.

<HEADLINE> Oil Vendor Acquitted of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A New Jersey-based oil company and two of its  
executives have been acquitted of charges they stole almost $1 
million from New York City by overcharging for heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Oil New York Inc. and managers Joseph Colonel, 40, and  
Samad Farooki, 48, were found innocent Friday of scheming to 
defraud, grand larceny and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged the defendants reported inflated wholesale  
prices to an oil trade publication. Because the price paid by the 
city was based on the average wholesale price in the publication, 
the city's oil costs were artificially inflated, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how troubling and reprehensible that conduct may be,  
it is not a violation of the Penal Law to excessively profit by 
taking advantage of opportunities provided by an ill-conceived 
contract,'' ruled Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey Atlas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Mexico Move Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unhappy with President Clinton's decision to  
give high marks to Mexico's counternarcotics programs, some 
lawmakers contend that Clinton is looking too much at Mexico's 
efforts and not enough at results. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``certified'' on Friday that Mexico is a fully  
cooperating partner in the drug war despite a decline in narcotics 
seizures and an increase in opium poppy cultivation, among other 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of senators led by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,  
chairman of the Senate caucus on drug issues, wrote to Clinton and 
urged that he follow strict criteria in February 2000 when, by law, 
certification decisions next come up. 
</P>
<P>
	They recommended that the criteria include Mexico's willingness  
to extradite drug chieftains, its ability to arrest and prosecute 
money launderers and leaders of narcotics syndicates and its record 
on drug eradication and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's decision drew outright opposition from House Minority  
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``Mexico has not done enough to meet 
the requirements of our law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee, said Clinton's decision ``cannot 
stand.'' The results of Mexico's counterdrug campaign, Gilman said, 
``are dismal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law, countries found not to be fully cooperative are  
decertified and can be subject to economic sanctions unless the 
president grants them a waiver on national interest grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexico is cooperating with us in the battle for our lives,''  
Clinton said in a speech in San Francisco. Mexican President 
Ernesto Zedillo is ``working hard to tackle the corruption 
traffickers headlong,'' he said, adding, ``He cannot win this 
battle alone. And neither can we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, who heads the White House Office of National  
Drug Control Policy, said that last year, Mexico implemented 
legislative reforms, arrested numerous drug traffickers and 
sustained massive interdiction and eradication programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a news conference that outright decertification of  
Mexico would ``devastate'' efforts to build long-term cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico City, Juan Rebolledo, undersecretary at the Foreign  
Secretariat, said Mexico was happy ``that an obstacle has not been 
imposed to cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicente Yanez, president of the National Chamber of  
Manufacturing Industries, said in a radio interview, ``It should be 
us who certify the United States,'' a reference to the U.S. demand 
that causes drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Colombia, decertified with a national interest waiver  
last year, was elevated to fully certified status on Friday. The 
move was seen as a gesture to Colombian President Andres Pastrana, 
with whom the administration has established close ties during his 
six months in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti, plagued by what officials called a ``dysfunctional  
criminal justice system,'' was decertified with a national interest 
waiver. In the same category were Cambodia, Nigeria and Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan and Burma, key opium poppy countries, were  
decertified with no national interest waiver.

<HEADLINE> FAA Probes Marine Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) -- Two Marine Corps jets strayed from their  
flight pattern and passed within nearly a mile of a commuter plane 
approaching Dulles International Airport, according to the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which is investigating Thursday's incident, said it  
happened 35 miles south of Dulles when the F/A-18 Hornet fighters 
out of Andrews Air Force Base left their assigned holding pattern 
and passed close to United Express Flight 7618, a turboprop with 16 
passengers and three crew members on board. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said Friday a preliminary review  
found error by the military pilots. They had been waiting for 
approval from air traffic controllers to begin maneuvers over 
Quantico Marine Corps Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Salac said the FAA was concerned that the jets violated  
regulations that require three miles of separation from commuter 
planes. They must also be separated by 1,000 feet in altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Marine Corps and Atlantic Coast Airlines, which  
operates United Express, reported the fighters had been on course 
to pass behind the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Rinaldi, president of the Air Traffic Control  
Association at Dulles, said the jets were 20 seconds away from 
striking the plane when a controller gave an urgent order for the 
fighters to change altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just the quick thinking of the controllers in the  
Dulles tower radar room that averted this from becoming something 
catastrophic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Coast spokesman Rick DeLisi said the commuter plane's  
pilot was unaware of the incident until he was informed of it by 
air traffic controllers at Dulles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No passenger ever knew there was anything happening, and,  
really, nothing happened,'' DeLisi said. ``Our plane was never 
asked to do anything except maintain its pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a military transport plane out of Andrews barely  
missed colliding over Leesburg with a Mesa Airlines commuter plane 
bound from Long Island, N.Y., to Dulles. An investigation is 
pending.

<HEADLINE> Man Killed in Boxing Match Brawl </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- A man was reported killed under the  
wheels of a bus Saturday night after boxing fans brawled following 
the main bout of a Commonwealth middleweight title match. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said officers were called to ``a large-scale fight'' at  
Oldham Leisure Center after the bout between Paul Jones and Jason 
Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout ended in the seventh round when Jones was disqualified  
and Matthews won the title. Fighting soon broke out in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	An ambulance service spokesman said a man, said to be a  
31-year-old London resident, was killed when fighting spilled 
outside and he apparently fell under the wheels of a bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were running battles in the reception and surrounding  
corridors between what appeared to be opposing sets of fans,'' 
Press Association journalist Jon Wilde said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trouble then seemed to spill outside while security guards  
battled to try to calm things down. There were dozens of officers 
all over the place inside and outside, some of them with dogs,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police later sealed off both entrances to the sports center and  
detectives set to work investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of arrests.

<HEADLINE> Indians To Protest Buffalo Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDINER, Mont. (AP) -- Witnessing a ritual unseen for a century,  
a hundred members of American Indian tribes gathered here Saturday 
on a pilgrimage seeking an end to the killing of bison that wander 
out of Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who made the pilgrimage are bearing witness to the sacred  
relationship between the buffalo and Indians, said Joseph Chasing 
Horse, a traditional Lakota Sioux leader who helped organize and 
led the event. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Indians, eating the flesh of bison is comparable in  
religious significance to Holy Communion among Christians, who 
symbolically eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ, Chasing 
Horse said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Montana cattle ranchers, however, it's a matter of killing  
animals they fear will carry disease to their herds. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, the pilgrims had finished a journey of about 500  
miles over 20 days, many on foot or on horseback, across prairie 
and mountains from Rapid City in the Black Hills of South Dakota to 
this gateway town at the north entrance of Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
	The buffalo, or American bison, was a life-giver to the Plains  
Indians, providing meat, skins and bone that could be shaped into 
implements. In the Lakota language, the buffalo is Tatanka Oyate, 
which means ``He who owns us,'' indicative of the animal's central 
importance to the culture of the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-hour ceremony Saturday on a windswept, muddy field,  
just inside a massive stone arch that marks the entrance to the 
country's oldest national park, the gathering prayed and sang. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long ago, the buffalo gave his blood for us. Today, we give  
our blood for him,'' Chasing Horse told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Gary Silk, a Lakota activist from South Dakota, removed his  
shirt. Others thrust sharp sticks through his skin in two places 
just below the shoulder blades. The sticks were left in place, a 
rope was attached to each, and a ceremonial buffalo skull was tied 
to the other end of each rope. 
</P>
<P>
	Silk then danced slow circles around the gathering of about 250  
Indians and white spectators, as blood trickled down his back from 
the two wounds. Many people -- women and men, Indians and 
non-Indians -- wept as they looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	Then another man sat on the skulls, Silk took hold of a horse's  
tail, and the horse pulled him away from the skulls, tearing the 
sticks free from Silk's flesh. Others applied traditional medicines 
to stop the bleeding and disinfect the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The ritual has not been performed in over 100 years, Chasing  
Horse said. Until Saturday, it has never been seen by white people, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the Lakota Sioux were representatives of tribes from as  
far away as New York and Arizona, including the Algonquin, Apache, 
Assiniboine, Blackfeet, Crow, Navajo, Nez Perce, Northern Cheyenne, 
Southern Ute and Tuscarora. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prophesy says that if the buffalo disappear, the Lakota  
will disappear,'' Chasing Horse said. ``We want to protect the last 
free-roaming herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When winter snowfall is heavy, Yellowstone bison seeking forage  
often wander out of the park and into nearby Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	But Montana livestock officials say about half of the  
Yellowstone bison are infected with brucellosis, a disease which 
can cause cows to abort their calves and can cause undulant fever 
in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	During the winter of 1996-97, Montanans shot or shipped to  
slaughter 1,100 bison, more than a third of the park herd, under a 
federal-state management plan designed to protect their 
multimillion-dollar cattle industry from brucellosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have disputed the likelihood of the disease spreading to  
cattle, and have blasted Montana's policy as being based on cowboy 
politics rather than solid science. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences studied the issue and said  
there was a small but real risk of bison passing the disease to 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't view this as a cattle vs. bison issue. It's a  
straight disease issue. ... We'd like to get this resolved and 
cleaned up,'' said Marc Bridges, acting administrator of the 
Montana Department of Livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials generally believe it is inappropriate to  
intervene any more than necessary in what they regard as a 
free-ranging herd of native wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy dates back about 15 years. In the mid 1980s,  
Montana authorized a public hunting season for bison. That led to 
television news footage of hunters shooting stationary beasts, 
which then toppled over, spilling their blood onto the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a public relations fiasco. By the early 1990s, the state  
ended civilian bison hunting but said animals that wandered into 
Montana could be shot by state livestock officials or, when 
possible, herded back into Yellowstone by park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a modified policy now in effect, bison that wander out of  
the park are corralled and tested for brucellosis. Animals that 
test positive are shipped to slaughter; those that test negative 
are either released onto national forest land near the park or 
hazed back inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
	This winter has been mild and bison have not left the park in  
such large numbers as they did two years ago. As of Friday, Montana 
livestock agents had captured and shipped to slaughter 17 bison. At 
least 500 bison had been hazed back into the park. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal officials are working on a new, long-range  
bison management plan.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Move on Without Mo Vaughn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- He had a flair for the dramatic and a  
fondness for speaking his mind. Mo Vaughn has taken those talents -- 
and his hitting ability -- from Boston, leaving the Red Sox weaker 
offensively but not obsessed with his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood is good. It's going to be good all season,'' says  
center fielder Darren Lewis, whose Fenway Park locker was next to 
Vaughn's. ``We have guys on this ballclub that have been around for 
a while. There's no question Mo's going to be missed here, but it's 
time to turn the page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox will miss moments like Vaughn's grand slam at last  
year's home opener that gave them a 9-7 win over Seattle. Teammates 
won't have his yelling to pump them up or his gregariousness so 
they can relax quietly after games while he regales reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	And Boston pitchers won't have the comfort of knowing that even  
if they struggle, Vaughn can bail them out with a homer. He led the 
team with 40 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to pitch,'' reliever Derek Lowe said. ``If we're  
going to worry about the offense, I don't think the offense is 
worried about the pitching. I don't think you're going to pitch 
differently just because one guy's here or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what about the role Vaughn filled as a media magnet before  
he signed as a free agent with Anaheim? Can Nomar Garciaparra, 
Boston's best positional player but a sometimes reluctant 
conversationalist, assume that? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something you get used to. It's not something you  
relish or you worry about,'' Garciaparra said. ``You can't replace 
a guy like Mo, but nobody's looking to do that. Nobody's going to 
say, `All right, I'm Mo Vaughn.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra hit .323 with 35 homers and a team-high 122 RBIs but  
isn't worried that his production will suffer without Vaughn 
protecting him in the lineup. Actually, for most of the last 2 1/2 
months of the season, it was Garciaparra, batting fourth, who kept 
pitchers from pitching around Vaughn, who hit third. 
</P>
<P>
	``People keep saying, `is Nomie going to step up in the  
clubhouse?' My comment is, `I hope he doesn't.' I hope he keeps 
doing what he's been doing,'' pitcher Bret Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was runner-up to Juan Gonzalez in the AL MVP voting  
last year and is one of just five major leaguers to hit at least 30 
homers in each of his first two seasons. But Vaughn won the MVP 
award in 1995 and averaged nearly 35 homers in each of the last 
five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	And his battle for the AL batting title went down to the last  
regular-season game last season. He finished at .337, second to 
Bernie Williams' .339. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox are hoping rookie Trot Nixon, who could win the  
right field job, can add some offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not one person can do what Mo did,'' Nixon said, ``but a team  
comes together, a few guys have good years that really weren't 
expected and, all of a sudden, you've filled Mo's shoes. It's going 
to be tough. I think it can be done but not by just one person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn wasn't the only free agent first baseman. Rafael Palmeiro  
went from Baltimore to Texas and Will Clark moved from Texas to 
Baltimore. Frank Thomas is one of the few first baseman with 
Vaughn's ability to hit for power and average. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans want to know whether Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette  
is interested in Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White Sox haven't said that Frank Thomas is available,''  
Duquette said during an online chat session Friday. But he didn't 
rule out dealing his own prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also going to trade some of our young ballplayers to  
acquire established major leaguers,'' he told the cyberspace 
questioner. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, Mike Stanley appears to have the inside track on  
the first-base job, although Jose Offerman and Reggie Jefferson 
also could spend time there.

	``You're going to have nine guys in the lineup and nine guys  
have to pull their weight,'' Jefferson said. ``So we can't go out 
every day and say, `Mo's not here.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	But his absence is obvious, especially to third baseman John  
Valentin. He and Vaughn were college teammates at Seton Hall and 
played together at Triple-A Pawtucket. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really difficult to imagine'' not playing with Vaughn,  
Valentin said. ``I'm definitely going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will, too, at least until the Red Sox show they can be  
successful without him. Until then, Valentin said, Vaughn's 
departure will remain a hot topic in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that we can put it behind us. Depending on how we  
play will determine that,'' Valentin said. ``If we play well, it'll 
be gone. But if we don't, then it will be with us for the whole 
year.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Panel Backs Diabetes Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration  
are recommending approval of a test that could dramatically improve 
how doctors care for diabetics. The test would provide the first 
continuous measurements of patients' glucose levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement Friday was for MiniMed Inc.'s ``continuous  
glucose monitoring system.'' The FDA is not bound by its advisers' 
recommendations but typically follows them. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics' bodies cannot regulate glucose, or blood sugar.  
Millions of patients control their glucose with insulin shots, 
other medications or special diets. 
</P>
<P>
	To know if treatment is working, diabetics prick their fingers  
several times a day to perform a blood test. The tighter control 
maintained on glucose, the less likely diabetics are to suffer 
blindness, heart disease and other complications. 
</P>
<P>
	MiniMed's testing system will not replace those blood tests.  
</P>
<P>
	But a few blood tests a day do not give doctors a full picture  
of how well diabetics are doing, just a snapshot. Maybe one patient 
always tests his blood at noon, but his glucose sharply spikes two 
hours later. If doctors knew, the patient could adjust his testing 
schedule or even his treatment to better steady his glucose levels. 
</P>
<P>
	MiniMed's system includes a sensor to be implanted just under a  
diabetic's skin, usually on the abdomen, for three days. The sensor 
measures glucose levels every 10 seconds and records each 
five-minute average, even providing nightly readings that today's 
diabetics have no way to get. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer program downloads the sensor's recorded measurements  
so the doctor can analyze daily glucose fluctuations and customize 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``a breakthrough technology. We think it could potentially  
revolutionize the care of diabetics,'' said Dr. Steven Gutman, the 
FDA's director of clinical laboratory devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The device doesn't measure glucose in blood like the  
finger-prick tests do. Instead, it measures the ``interstitial 
fluid'' between cells, providing glucose readings different from 
those diabetics are used to. But MiniMed's research showed that 
interstitial fluid could accurately show trends in glucose 
fluctuations, FDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	MiniMed ultimately hopes to create a continuous glucose monitor  
that patients would wear to warn of dangerously high or low glucose 
levels. But the FDA stressed Friday that this first device is a 
three-day test only.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President Ernesto Zedillo on Saturday called  
on Mexicans to help prevent forest fires like those that blanketed 
much of the country and parts of the United States in haze last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo said in his weekly radio address that the country has  
lost almost a third of its forests and jungles in less than 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our generation should be the first that begins to stop their  
destruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo blamed the deforestation on population growth, the  
``irrational exploitation'' of forest resources, and the 
traditional practice of slash-and-burn agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Slash-and-burn fires to clear land for planting, combined with a  
drought blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon, resulted in 
14,445 fires last spring, according to government figures.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Driving tractors and carrying picks  
and shovels, 70,000 Venezuelan soldiers Saturday kicked off a 
program aimed at repairing highways, building schools and providing 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of government employees and civilian volunteers also  
participated in the program, which covered everything from eye 
examinations to haircuts for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed  
1992 coup attempt, says the ``Bolivar 2000'' program will take 
advantage of the experience and manpower of the 120,000-member 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics fear he wants to militarize the country.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavez downplayed those fears Saturday as he toured slums  
participating in the project. ``There's nothing wrong with using 
the engineers, doctors and other professionals in the armed forces 
to bring help to the many people who need it,'' he told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A federal legislator has been  
charged with masterminding the killings of his predecessor and 
three of her relatives in northeastern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Talvane Albuquerque was charged with ordering gunmen to kill  
Rep. Ceci Cunha, her husband and two in-laws on Dec. 16 inside 
their home in Maceio, capital of Alagoas state, the Rio daily O 
Globo reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Albuquerque wanted Cunha killed so he could  
take her place in Congress. Albuquerque denies the charges and says 
he has been set up by political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque was the runner-up to Cunha in October congressional  
elections. He was sworn in as a federal congressman last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not certain if Albuquerque will ever face trial. Under  
Brazilian law, legislators can be tried only after the attorney 
general formally asks Congress and the Supreme Court to strip them 
of their political immunity.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway May Not Play Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat guard Tim Hardaway did not practice  
Saturday because of a hyperextended right knee and wasn't sure 
whether he'd be available for Sunday's game against Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of right now, I think I'm going to play,'' said Hardaway,  
who injured himself Friday in a collision with Detroit's Grant 
Hill. ``I can't say for sure, but I think I'm going to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials will wait to make a decision on Hardaway until  
just before tipoff Sunday afternoon, spokesman Tim Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's knee was bent back and banged by Hill's knee while  
Hill was stepping on Hardaway's foot in the first quarter of 
Friday's game, a 95-93 Detroit win that snapped the Heat's 
seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star stayed in the game and played the rest of  
the first half, but said he couldn't have gone any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway is Miami's second-leading scorer with an average of  
18.8 points per game. With Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard already 
on the injured list, scoring has been at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just have to deal with it,'' coach Pat Riley said. ``I  
hope the thing heals quickly. We need to get some guys healthy.''

<HEADLINE> Search Called Off for Missing Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTON, Mass. (AP) -- Searchers Saturday night called off the  
ground search for a 9-year-old boy who disappeared in a sudden 
snowstorm while looking for his dog. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we are still hopeful for a rescue,'' state  
police Capt. Robert Bird said Saturday, as crews combed the 
cranberry bogs and woods surrounding the family's home. He 
acknowledged that search crews were aware that after two days of 
fruitless efforts they also could find a body. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 people covered an area with a 1 1/2-mile radius in  
the community about 30 miles southeast of Boston, hoping to find 
Corey Anderson alive. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter equipped with a heat-seeking infrared device flew  
over the area before dawn, hoping to pinpoint the boy's location 
when no other people were around. The helicopter would fly over 
again Saturday night, Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously time is not on our side,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The search was to continue Sunday, when rain and sleet was  
forecast for the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey's parents and police have said they hope the fourth-grader  
took shelter in a barn or other warm place as the snowstorm bore 
down on his hometown and temperatures dropped into the 20s on 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey -- who was home from school because of the storm that  
dumped 7 inches of snow in the area -- left his house around noon. 
Bundled up in two jackets, a sweater and his mother's black 
fur-lined boots, he went in search of his dog, who had bolted 
outside. Jasmine, a golden-retriever mix, turned up an hour later 
in a neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey's parents made tearful appearances on the evening news  
when the boy first vanished. By Saturday morning, the couple was 
secluded in their home. The boy's aunt, Joan Romero, said the 
family was trying to keep its spirits high. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still hopeful when we see the cops and the state police  
haven't given up. They're just more determined,'' she said. 
``(Corey's) tough, very tough. Nobody messes with him, we're 
counting on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police do not suspect foul play, but detectives are  
investigating nevertheless. Volunteers have joined the search, 
battling snow and darkness, combing a circle 3 miles across through 
dense woods, lakes, swamps and cranberry bogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Farinah, a father of four from Taunton, arrived at the  
scene Saturday morning to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``My oldest is 10 and I can't imagine dealing with something  
like this,'' Farinah said. ``If I was in the same situation, I'd 
want every human being within a 100-mile radius out there with 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Recommendations Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A commission studying changes in the Medicare  
system will miss its Monday deadline for making its 
recommendations, the panel's co-chairmen say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues the commission was directed to consider are  
complex, difficult and of great importance to every American,'' 
Sen. John Breaux, D-La., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., wrote 
President Clinton and congressional leaders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of  
Medicare is in ``the final stages of its deliberations, and we are 
optimistic that we will be able to submit our recommendations 
shortly,'' their letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel expects to end its work by March 31, they said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 17-member commission is only one or two votes shy of the 11  
it needs to recommend a plan that would make Medicare, the federal 
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, more like 
the health benefits that many companies and the federal government 
offer their employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that plan, retirees would choose from a menu of  
health-insurance policies and get a Medicare subsidy to help cover 
the enrollment fee or premium. The government-run system that most 
retirees now use to get reimbursed for each medical bill would 
compete with private health plans, which would have to offer 
similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux has been a leading proponent of the proposal, which  
Republicans on the panel also support. But most Democrats on the 
commission say the plan lacks enough detail to demonstrate it would 
ensure adequate health care at reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Those Democrats also say they are holding out for a  
recommendation that Medicare help all beneficiaries pay for 
prescription drugs -- something the program does not now cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican members say the cash-strapped program can't afford  
drug coverage for everyone, and Breaux has suggested a compromise 
that would mainly help those with the lowest incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also is considering whether to recommend raising  
the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, and if so, whether some 
younger people should still be able to get scaled-back coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sticking point: whether to recommend more money for  
Medicare -- from tax increases or government surpluses, for example 
-- in addition to cost-cutting changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Without some action, Medicare is expected to run short of cash  
in about a decade -- just before the first of the huge baby boom 
generation begins to retire. Lawmakers are looking to solid, 
bipartisan consensus from the commission to help neutralize 
political dangers of making changes to the popular program. 
</P>
<P>
	In another area, a government auditor cast doubt Friday that the  
agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs will 
surmount the year 2000 computer problem by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration still must perform a  
tremendous amount of testing on its computer systems before the end 
of the year, Joel Willemssen of the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, told a House Government Reform 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they're not doing what they can,'' Willemssen  
testified. ``It's that there's a limited amount of time left to get 
it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nancy-Ann DeParle, the agency's administrator, said that  
while there was still a lot of work to be done, ``We will be ready 
well before Jan. 1, 2000.''

<HEADLINE> New Papa Bonds Reports to Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Barry Bonds had some explaining to do.  
</P>
<P>
	No, the San Francisco Giants' star outfielder wasn't really late  
to spring training. No, he didn't exactly demand a contract 
extension. Yes, he still wants to play for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds was miffed about all the reports and rumors that swirled  
around him in the offseason. But his mood was softened by the 
reason he was a day late for the team's voluntary reporting day: 
his new daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a great baby,'' Bonds said of Aisha Lynn Bonds, born  
Feb. 5. ``She sleeps well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds showed up in camp late Thursday, after the team's first  
full-squad workout. But on Friday, the only major league player to 
hit 400 homers and steal 400 bases was hard at work, with a new, 
stronger physique and a more amiable attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted he really wasn't late because the mandatory  
reporting date for major leaguers is next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants were more than willing to cut their star some slack  
for his tardiness. Manager Dusty Baker was especially sympathetic 
because he is a new father, too. Darren John Baker was born Feb. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds did show flashes of temper when he refused to talk to a  
reporter late Thursday, claiming he had been misquoted about his 
desire for a contract extension. On Friday, he was mostly smiles -- 
and explanations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star, seven-time Gold Glove and  
three-time MVP, was quoted earlier this year as saying he wanted 
the Giants to extend his contract. Two years ago, he signed a $22.9 
million extension that pays him $9.7 million this year and $10.7 
million in 2000, and gives the Giants a $10.3 million option for 
2001 with a $2.5 million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question that was posed to me was `What would be your  
ideal situation?' '' he said. ``My ideal situation would be to 
retire at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to clarify that it was only natural to want the  
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I did want a long-term contract, So?'' he said. ``I  
don't see what's wrong with wanting to stay in my hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also was the suggestion that Bonds wouldn't mind a trade  
to a World Series contender. A recent report indicated the Atlanta 
Braves had contacted the Giants about him after Andres Galarraga 
was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Bonds expressed his loyalty to the Giants,  
reminiscing about the days he spent at the team's windy bayside 
ballpark trailing his father, Bobby Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unconcerned that some Giants fans do not view him with  
the same warm sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter to me. As long as I can pay my bills and  
take care of my children,'' he said, ``I don't need to be an 
icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds appeared healthier and a bit bulkier than in previous  
years. He explained that following offseason surgery on his knee, 
he concentrated on his lower body strength, something he hadn't 
done before. The training, he said, eased pain in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants second baseman Jeff Kent said he recently was watching  
television and saw Bonds working out. He said Bonds looked great. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I watched it from the couch,'' Kent laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Although dogged by questions that, at nearly 35, he might be  
nearing the end of his career, Bonds often made light of his age. 
He said it might finally work to his advantage after years of 
trying to get pitches to hit from wary opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope people think I'm getting a little older, a little  
slower and they give me a few more chances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker thinks Bonds is still in his prime, not just because of  
his toned body, but because of his mental attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he continues to love the game,'' Baker said. ``I  
believe as most guys get older, it's not the body, it's if you 
continue to love the game the same. I do believe he loves the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Bonds hit .303 with 37 home runs and 122 RBIs. He hit  
a personal milestone as the lone member of the 400-400 club, and 
enters this season with 411 homers and 445 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Although last season Bonds suggested his next goal was to reach  
500-500 and retire, this year he has other intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only goal I have is winning the World Series,'' he said.  
``I think I've accomplished most of my other goals.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Lewinsky Makes Diana Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky sees a parallel between her own  
difficulties and the problems of the late Princess Diana, a British 
newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a princess in a royal sense, but I was also wronged by  
a man who said he loved me,'' Ms. Lewinsky was quoted as saying. 
``And remember, I was in love with him. I was trapped, too. I had a 
lot of pressure on me, and like Diana, I had nowhere to go, nowhere 
to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Mirror's article was a prelude to this week's  
publication of ``Monica's Story,'' by Andrew Morton. Morton's 1992 
book, ``Diana, Her True Story,'' revealed the breakdown of the 
princess' marriage to Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Diana was killed in an August 1997 car crash in Paris.  
</P>
<P>
	Morton's book about the former White House intern and her  
relationship with President Clinton is to be published March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday paper's daily sister tabloid, The Mirror, says it  
will carry ``Monica's Story'' in this week's newspaper, but it 
hasn't indicated which day or whether there will be extensive 
excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
	The article published Sunday was by reporter Andrew Golden and  
described the New York meeting of Ms. Lewinsky, Morton and his 
publisher at an unspecified date. Golden was present at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton told Ms. Lewinsky she was ``a victim at the hands of the  
most powerful man in the world,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are huge similarities here to the Diana story, where the  
princess was trapped in a situation with a man who was at the heart 
of the most powerful royal family in the world,'' Morton was quoted 
as telling Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way you are like Diana -- caught up in this unreal  
situation and with no clear way out. I believe the public will want 
to know how you got caught up in all of this and how you coped with 
it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- The last thing Teresa Almengor remembered  
before blacking out was her 3-year-old daughter standing next to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember her handing me the phone and remember hearing the  
911 dispatcher,'' Ms. Almengor said Friday. ``The next thing I 
knew, I had all these firefighters around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Almengor lost consciousness Jan. 29 after suffering a  
chemical reaction to medication, little Heather Gilmore remembered 
what her mother always told her: ``I called 911.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Heather also remained calm throughout the  
8-minute conversation with the emergency dispatcher. Said the 
preschooler, ``Oh, I was kind of shaky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso police believe the young girl's composure saved her  
mother's life. Police Chief Carlos Leon presented the girl with a 
special lifesaver's award. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's my hero,'' Ms. Almengor said. ``She did a good job, and  
I'm proud of her.''

	Kosovo Monitors Tail Yugoslav Army  
</P>
<P>
	SUVA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International monitors cruised the  
muddy back roads of Kosovo today, tailing Yugoslav army tanks and 
armored personnel carriers to prevent attacks against ethnic 
Albanians. Violence between the two sides has been increasing and 
there are fears that it could blossom into a new Yugoslav 
offensive. The monitors, who came to the province in November to 
observe a cease-fire, have become ``de facto peacekeepers,'' said 
William Walker, the chief monitor for the Organization of Security 
and Cooperation in Europe. He appealed today for both sides to put 
down their weapons.

	Libya: Hague Court Should Hear Case

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said today  
that the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, 
is the proper venue for the 1988 Pan Am bombing case -- rather than 
a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands. Gadhafi has long 
refused to turn over two suspects, who were indicted in both 
Scotland and the United States, arguing that they could not get a 
fair trial in the West. The bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
killed 270 people.

	Moderates Appear To Lead in Iran  
</P>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Political moderates and reformers apparently  
led embattled hard-liners in early returns from Iran's first 
municipal elections since 1979. An election official at the 
Interior Ministry estimated today that as many as 25 million 
Iranians cast ballots, or about 60 percent of the 40 million 
eligible voters. The heavy polling yesterday demonstrated broad 
interest in a contest that could boost reformist allies of 
President Mohammad Khatami in the power struggle against 
hard-liners. About 330,000 candidates ran for 200,000 seats on 
municipal councils.

	Israel Seals Off West Bank and Gaza  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has decided to seal off the Palestinian  
territories this week, citing warnings of attacks by Islamic 
militants. The closure, scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight and 
last for four days, will make it impossible for Palestinians with 
jobs in Israel to get to work. The Defense Ministry's decision to 
impose a closure on the Palestinian areas falls during the week 
Israeli Jews celebrate the Purim holiday. The holiday has been 
marred by attacks since 1994, when a Jewish settler gunned down 29 
Palestinians worshippers before being bludgeoned to death by 
survivors.

	Leaking Ship's Bow Dragged To Sea  
</P>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- The broken bow of a cargo ship that ran  
aground and spilled thousands of gallons of oil was slowly dragged 
through the surf toward open water today on its way to a burial in 
the deep Pacific. The section was moved about 40 feet before the 
morning high tide dropped. The bow section still must be dragged 
over two sandbars. It will take two to three days for the hulk to 
be towed far enough so it can be sunk in 9,000 feet of water. The 
ship, carrying 400,000 gallons of oil to fuel its engines, ran 
aground on Feb. 4 while waiting out a storm to enter Coos Bay.

	Defibrillator Training Launched  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Red Cross launches an ambitious  
program this week to train thousands of people to jump-start the 
hearts of cardiac arrest victims, putting the power of lifesaving 
defibrillators in your co-worker's hands. CPR buys crucial time, 
but it will not restart a heart. Now companies, shopping malls, 
even amusement parks are buying portable defibrillators, small 
versions of the electric shock paddles that can jolt hearts into 
beating again. Experts say portable defibrillators could save 
100,000 lives a year, if used widely enough.

	Maggert, Magee in Match Play Finals  
</P>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Andrew Magee and Jeff Maggert delivered  
the drama in the semifinals of Match Play, both coming from three 
holes down to advance to the finals and a chance to win $1 million. 
The semifinals were supposed to be a snore without marquee names 
like Tiger Woods, David Duval, Ernie Els and Mark O'Meara, all long 
departed. Maggert disposed of Woods in the quarterfinals yesterday. 
Maggert and Magee, who have gone at least five years without 
winning, will play 36 holes tomorrow at La Costa Resort for the 
richest prize in tour history. The loser gets $500,000.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John Celestand scored 18 points and No. 8  
St. John's shot a season-low 32 percent as Villanova upset the Red 
Storm 66-60 today to significantly enhance its NCAA chances. Malik 
Allen added 14 points and 11 rebounds and had two baskets with less 
than a minute left in the game for Villanova (20-9, 10-8), which 
survived a late Red Storm rally sparked by Erick Barkley's 17 
second-half points.

<HEADLINE> Russian Skier Wins 20th Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSAU, Austria (AP) -- Nothing motivates Larissa Lazutina like a  
dispute with her Russian team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropped from the two-race pursuit event after a relatively weak  
performance in the opening race, Lazutina bounced back Saturday to 
win the gold medal in the women's 30-kilometer classical 
cross-country race at the Nordic Ski World Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very hungry,'' Lazutina said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old skier also led a 1-2 Russian finish, with Olga  
Danilova far behind in second place and Kristina Smigun of Estonia 
in third. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new event, the Nordic combined sprint competition, Bjarte  
Engen Vik of Norway captured his second gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Vik, the Olympic champion, led after the 90K ski jumping portion  
and cruised home in the 7 1/2K cross-country race to win by 30.2 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle was for the silver and it went to Mario Stecher of  
Austria, who edged Kenji Ogiwara of Japan, the 1997 world champion, 
in a very close finish, edging the Japanese by .2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordic combined had been a two-day event, but it has now been  
compressed into one day to improve its marketability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprint event, where the cross-country race is half the usual  
15-kilometer distance, was crammed into less then 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazutina has had a stormy relationship with the team leadership.  
</P>
<P>
	After failing to medal in individual events at the 1997 worlds  
in Trondheim, Norway, Lazutina found her own sponsors, quit the 
team and started working with a personal coach. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off at last year's Olympics in Nagano, where Lazutina  
took a medal in each of the five events, including three golds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Ramsau championship began badly with an eighth-place  
finish in the opening 15K. That would be a respectable performance 
by any other standards, but Lazutina was the worst-placed Russian. 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough for her to be dropped from the two-leg pursuit,  
in which two gold medals can be won. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was back leading the Russian relay team to the gold  
medal two days ago and on Saturday she scored an overwhelming 
victory in the 30K despite falling early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``After being the worst of the Russians in the 15K, the team  
leaders decided to drop me from the next two races and I wasn't 
sure I was going to race today,'' Lazutina said. ``This is a great 
satisfaction for me. I wanted to show what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the race held in mild and sunny weather, Lazutina led all  
the way and was timed in one hour, 29 minutes, 19.9 seconds, 
beating Danilova by one minute, 34 seconds and Smigun by 1:54.7. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazutina, a two-time overall World Cup winner, now has 20 medals  
from Olympic Games and the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Bente Martinsen, the World Cup leader and 5K champion  
who is a specialist in classical races, had to withdraw because of 
a flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefania Belmondo of Italy, winner of two golds here, finished  
13th.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Sorry for Broaddrick Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Sen. James Jeffords has apologized for  
saying Juanita Broaddrick's allegations that President Clinton 
sexually assaulted her are a ``private matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Juanita Broaddrick's statements are disturbing and should be  
taken seriously, as any claim of rape should be. ... I truly 
apologize if my inarticulate comments this morning gave anyone the 
wrong impression,'' the Vermont Republican said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Jeffords spoke about the allegations on  
Burlington radio station WKDR. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed by host Mark Johnson, the senator said, ``I don't know  
why it wouldn't be a private matter. If something that happened 21 
years ago with a woman who invited, at least under her story, the 
president to her hotel room and she was not happy with what 
happened, I don't know why that's not a private matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick, an Arkansas nursing home administrator, said  
Clinton came to her hotel room in 1978 and sexually assaulted her. 
Clinton was the Arkansas attorney general at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	On the radio program, Jeffords questioned Broaddrick's  
truthfulness and the timing of her allegations, which Clinton's 
private lawyer, David Kendall, has called ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's impeachment trial, Jeffords was the first  
Republican senator to go public with his decision to vote to acquit 
the president on both articles of impeachment. He is up for 
re-election next year.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Coach Howard Iba Dead at 92 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. JOSEPH, Mo. (AP) -- Howard Iba, longtime basketball coach at  
Central High School and brother of the late Oklahoma State coach 
Hank Iba, has died at the age of 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Iba died Friday at a St. Joseph hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Henry and Howard Iba grew up in the northwest Missouri town of  
Easton, playing basketball on a dirt court with their other two 
brothers, Clarence and Earl. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1929-30 season, three of the brothers were instrumental  
in taking the Northwest Missouri State Teacher's College team to a 
31-0 record, with Hank as coach and Howard and Clarence as players. 
</P>
<P>
	All four brothers went on to coaching careers and are members of  
the Missouri Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Iba coached at Central High School for 26 seasons. He led  
the Indians to their greatest achievement in 1958, when the boys 
finished second in the state with a 26-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	From Northwest Missouri State Teacher's College, now Northwest  
Missouri State, Hank went on to Oklahoma State, leading the Cowboys 
to national championships in 1945 and 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Brother Clarence Iba, now deceased, coached at Tulsa, and Earl  
Iba, the youngest, coached junior college basketball in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Iba's survivors include his wife, Vivian, of St. Joseph;  
and brother Earl Iba, now of Tigard, Ore.

<HEADLINE> FAA Probes Marine Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) -- Two Marine Corps jets strayed from their  
flight pattern and passed within nearly a mile of a commuter plane 
approaching Dulles International Airport, according to the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which is investigating Thursday's incident, said it  
happened 35 miles south of Dulles when the F/A-18 Hornet fighters 
out of Andrews Air Force Base left their assigned holding pattern 
and passed close to United Express Flight 7618, a turboprop with 16 
passengers and three crew members on board. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said Friday a preliminary review  
found error by the military pilots. They had been waiting for 
approval from air traffic controllers to begin maneuvers over 
Quantico Marine Corps Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Salac said the FAA was concerned that the jets violated  
regulations that require three miles of separation from commuter 
planes. They must also be separated by 1,000 feet in altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Marine Corps and Atlantic Coast Airlines, which  
operates United Express, reported the fighters had been on course 
to pass behind the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Rinaldi, president of the Air Traffic Control  
Association at Dulles, said the jets were 20 seconds away from 
striking the plane when a controller gave an urgent order for the 
fighters to change altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just the quick thinking of the controllers in the  
Dulles tower radar room that averted this from becoming something 
catastrophic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Coast spokesman Rick DeLisi said the commuter plane's  
pilot was unaware of the incident until he was informed of it by 
air traffic controllers at Dulles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No passenger ever knew there was anything happening, and,  
really, nothing happened,'' DeLisi said. ``Our plane was never 
asked to do anything except maintain its pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a military transport plane out of Andrews barely  
missed colliding over Leesburg with a Mesa Airlines commuter plane 
bound from Long Island, N.Y., to Dulles. An investigation is 
pending.

	Kurd Shot by Israeli Guards Dies  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- A Kurdish man injured in the storming of the  
Israeli consulate in Berlin died Saturday, 10 days after three 
other Kurds were shot and killed by Israeli security guards, police 
said. The 26-year-old Kurdish man, among 16 wounded in the 
shooting, died without regaining consciousness in a Berlin 
hospital, police said. The victim was among 75 Kurdish protesters 
who gathered at the consulate Feb. 17 to protest the arrest of 
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is imprisoned in Turkey 
and faces a possible death sentence. Israel has said the security 
guards acted in self-defense as the Kurds stormed the consulate.

Gennady Padalka, the Mir's commander for the past six months, and 
Slovak Ivan Bella, who had been on the Mir for just under a week, 
touched down early Sunday morning, said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman

other local officials before heading off for a vacation. The 
Clintons borrowed the gated, multimillion-dollar mountaintop home 
of Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, where they will stay

	Report: Lewinsky Makes Diana Link

	LONDON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky sees a parallel between her own  
difficulties and the problems of the late Princess Diana, a British 
newspaper said Sunday. ``I'm not a princess in a royal sense, but I 
was also wronged by a man who said he loved me,'' Ms. Lewinsky was 
quoted as saying. ``And remember, I was in love with him. I was 
trapped, too. I had a lot of pressure on me, and like Diana, I had 
nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.'' The Sunday Mirror's article was a 
prelude to this week's publication of ``Monica's Story,'' by Andrew 
Morton. Morton's 1992 book, ``Diana, Her True Story,'' revealed the 
breakdown of the princess' marriage to Prince Charles.

	Libya: Hague Court Should Hear Case  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared to  
pull back Saturday from a U.N.-brokered compromise on the 1988 Pan 
Am bombing case. In a joint statement issued in Tripoli with 
visiting Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Gadhafi said the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, was the 
proper venue for the case -- rather than a Scottish court sitting in 
the Netherlands. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on 
Libya in 1992 to compel the country to turn over two Libyans wanted 
in the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. On 
Friday, the United States and Britain gave Libya a one-month 
deadline to turn over the suspects.

and lungs will be sent by helicopter to a university hospital in 
Osaka, where a patient is waiting to receive the organs. Another

first team to go 16-0 in league play. William Avery scored 24

Blue Devils (29-1), who came into the game leading the nation in 
scoring (93.7) and margin (25.7). Seven teams had perfect records

<HEADLINE> Match Play Crowd Not Very Happy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- The Golf Guy was bummed.  
</P>
<P>
	A huge styrofoam golf ball perched on top his head, he sat on a  
motor scooter with a ``Thanks Tiger'' sign on a road outside the 
second hole at La Costa Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble was that Tiger Woods was long gone. Jeff Maggert had  
taken his place in Saturday's World Match Play semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Golf Guy, that meant no more stunts like he pulled a day  
earlier by sneaking onto the course and pretending to float in a 
creek near the 14th green. 
</P>
<P>
	It just wasn't the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really kind of bummed out Tiger didn't make it,'' said the  
Golf Guy, also known as 39-year-old Scott Wilson. ``You see the 
crowd. It's about a third of the size it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed it was.  
</P>
<P>
	A Final Four of tour grinders wasn't only prompting people  
across the country to turn off their television sets. It was 
drawing yawns at La Costa, even with a $1 million first prize at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	A new tournament that began the week on such a high note that  
players were being asked if it would achieve major status went into 
the weekend with a field that looked much like the leaderboard of 
the competing Tucson Open. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a roar to be heard on the course, even when Jeff  
Maggert eagled the par-5 12th. There was no Tiger slamming his 
driver into the ground in disgust or pumping his fist in the air 
after making a putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four guys grinding it out, just like they do 25 to 30 weeks  
a year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Magee smiled only once on the front nine, when a duck  
feather landed on his golf ball as he tried to putt on No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Pate laughed on 14, but it wasn't because Maggert had  
missed a putt. He had merely spotted the Golf Guy's massive dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was laughing at some guy on a cliff with a golf ball on his  
head'' Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference Saturday was everyone was guaranteed at least  
$300,000. One will walk away Sunday with $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't seem to provide a spark with the quiet and polite  
fans who did show up Saturday. It was thinner than the weekday 
crowd the day before which followed Woods for 35 holes before he 
finally lost to Maggert on the 17th green of his second match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not much excitement in the air,'' one fan said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not without Tiger,'' replied another.  
</P>
<P>
	The stands behind the seventh green, full a day earlier, were  
half empty, and the crowd following John Huston and Magee on the 
fourth tee could have fit in Magee's living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the golf wasn't very good, with almost as many holes being  
won with pars as they were with birdies. It wasn't until the back 
nine where the shots got sharper did it begin to resemble the kind 
of play that knocked all the top players out long before the 
weekend began. 
</P>
<P>
	It was enough to make fans yearn for something else besides a  
beautiful day at sunny La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see Tiger out there,'' one fan remarked after  
seeing Steve Pate and Maggert together in the fairway. ``He would 
be outdriving everybody.''

<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Suffice it to say that either Andrew  
Magee or Jeff Maggert will have a career day Sunday when they face 
off in the 36-hole championship match of the $5 Andersen Consulting 
Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has won a tournament since 1994, and the winner will  
walk off with a $1 million check. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee has just four PGA Tour wins, his last coming in the 1994  
Northern Telecom Open. Maggert has just one, the 1993 Walt Disney 
World-Oldsmobile Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The big deal about the Match Play Championship, besides bringing  
together 64 of the world's best golfers, is the $5 million purse 
and $1 million winner's cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like money,'' Magee said after beating John Huston 3 and 1  
in the semifinals Saturday. ``Money's a motivating factor in this 
tournament. It's a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it's going to make all the other guys who didn't  
qualify very upset that Jeff and I are just passing everybody on 
the money list with this match play event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million first-place prize will be more than Magee or  
Maggert have made in a single season on tour. Last year was the 
best for both, as Maggert made $992,964 to finish 27th on the money 
list and Magee made $964,302 to finish 30th. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Magee has to settle for the second-place check of  
$500,000, he'll still jump from 109th on the money list all the way 
up near the top 10. He's made only $33,947 in four tournaments this 
year, having twice missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert, who beat Steve Pate 1-up in the other semi, is  
currently 17th on the money list with $296,060. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert didn't seem nearly as jazzed about the million bucks as  
Magee did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really insignificant,'' Maggert said. ``I want the  
victory more than putting a few more dollars in my bank account.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *B-SIDE PLAYERS:* So Sunday's championship match won't feature a  
Tiger Woods, David Duval or Ernie Els, or anyone higher than 23 on 
the world ranking list for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee and Maggert said it didn't bother them that everyone,  
including ABC-TV, was expecting a marquee matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, weren't you guys? Come on,'' Maggert said in his  
post-match news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Maggert, by the way, who eliminated Woods in Friday's  
quarterfinals, winning 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a fact of sports in general,'' Maggert said.  
``People want to write about the Chicago Bulls. They don't want to, 
pardon the LA Clipper fans ... that's just the way professional 
sports are. Whether it's basketball or football or golf, it's the 
superstars in the game that make it such a great game. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have very competitive sport. Our sport is unlike other  
sports, where the 50th or 60th best player is really not that far 
from being No. 1. In any given day or any given week, you can be 
the best player in the world. I think everyone has witnessed that 
this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magee, who considers himself just a regular guy, said he doubted  
his status would change even if he won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we really care,'' Magee said. ``We look at  
Tiger's life and it's difficult. He can't go out at night, he can't 
do anything without someone bugging him because of all the press 
he's gotten. I enjoy my life. I enjoy being a little bit obscure 
out there. No one really recognizes me when I go out, even in my 
hometown of Phoenix. That's nice. I don't think I'd trade that for 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CONSOLATION MATCH:* Pate and Houston will play an 18-hole  
consolation match Sunday, with $400,000 going to the winner and 
$300,000 to the loser. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUNDAY'S SCHEDULE:* The championship match will be contested  
over 36 holes, with the first 18 scheduled to start at 10:20 a.m. 
EST. The consolation match will begin at 2:20 p.m., followed by the 
second 18 of the championship match at 2:29 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FASHION CAPTAIN:* On Friday, Magee said he was measuring his  
success by having to iron a shirt every night in advance of the 
next day's match. On Saturday morning, he had to go out and buy 
socks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten bucks, baby. I didn't expect to be here,'' he said. ``I  
packed for the Nissan Open and I packed for, you know, maybe 
getting halfway through this week and I was going to go home and 
have a nice weekend off. But I have to play now. I'm thrilled about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also picked up a pair of socks for Sunday. ``At that price, I  
didn't even ask for a discount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scouting report: ``They are not that good of socks. They are  
not like anything sporty. They are kind of formal.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes School Flexibility Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Sen. Bill Frist said Congress has a  
chance to free many local schools from bureaucratic red tape with 
his proposal to increase flexibility and accountability in the 
public education system. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington demands 50 percent of all paperwork that teachers and  
principals have to file but provides only 7 percent of education 
money, the Tennessee senator said Saturday in the GOP's weekly 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long, Washington has been part of the problem with  
education, enacting many well-intentioned programs that result in 
more red tape and regulation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his Education Flexibility Partnership Act, Frist said,  
local schools would be freed from burdens of bureaucracy. The 
``Ed-Flex'' bill would let school districts seek waivers from rules 
attached to federal aid, he said, and, freed from burdensome 
regulations, local schools could apply the money to programs better 
suited to their students' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve states already have ``Ed-Flex'' pilot programs, and Frist  
trumpeted stories of their success. In Maryland, he said, a school 
has used the program to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading 
from the first through fifth grades and cut the average 
student-teacher ratio in math by half. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what education should be about -- putting our students  
first,'' Frist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has implemented ``Ed-Flex'' more broadly than any other  
state, and after only two years participating schools boast higher 
scores than other districts in reading and math on the state's 
achievement tests, Frist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frist said the Senate will consider the bill next week. The  
legislation is co-sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans have been at odds over changes in  
education rules and the extent to which the federal government 
should be involved. Last month, President Clinton proposed changes 
that include tying more of the federal money that schools get to 
whether they meet federal goals. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week, he told the National Governors' Association: ``We  
don't have any business telling you whom to hire, how to teach, how 
to run schools. ... But let's not kid ourselves. We're not doing 
our children any favors by continuing to subsidize practices that 
do not work and failing to invest in practices that do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frist said his bill would achieve two Clinton priorities --  
accountability and flexibility -- and believes he has bipartisan 
support for the measure.

<HEADLINE> Drag-Death Killer To Be Isolated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- John King is no longer the center of  
attention in Jasper. The white supremacist convicted of dragging a 
black man to pieces behind a pickup truck is now alone in a cell on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	The convicted killer arrived at the facility Friday, a day after  
he was sentenced to die by injection for killing James Byrd Jr., 
49, last June. There are 443 other men on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	All new arrivals are kept apart from other condemned men until  
prison officials determine whether they will be allowed to spend 
recreation time with others and perform jobs around the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	During this evaluation period, the new arrivals spend 23 hours a  
day in their cells, with one hour of recreation all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of  
Criminal Justice, said the department has not decided what to do 
with King. 
</P>
<P>
	All death row inmates' work privileges have been suspended until  
further notice after the unsuccessful escape attempt by seven 
condemned men last November. For now, the inmates get only an hour 
of face-to-face contact per day in recreation yards half the size 
of a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisoners' rights advocate Ray Hill said King, 24, might never  
be allowed any contact with other prisoners -- and that might keep 
him from harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is a flash point to some of the population on death  
row, so to keep Texas from having another Jeffrey Dahmer situation, 
they'll keep him in pretty close quarters,'' Hill said. Dahmer, the 
Milwaukee serial killer, was beaten to death by another inmate in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued this week that King, who has dozens of racist  
tattoos, could be a murderous threat to minorities behind bars. 
Similarly, the 187 black men on death row might want to avenge 
Byrd's grisly slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks aren't the only ones who might have a grudge against  
King. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald said that King, when he was arrested, claimed to be a  
member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white prison gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigation has revealed he was never a member,''  
Fitzgerald said. ``But as a result of making that claim, our gang 
intelligence people focused a lot of attention on the AB's that 
they did not want. He's not popular with the AB's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorney, Brack Jones, noted his client's miserable  
prison prospects during closing arguments. He called King ``a dead 
man walking,'' whether he got life in prison or the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Company Recalls Spring Roll Shells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- O' Tasty Foods is recalling its O' Tasty Foods  
Spring Roll Shells because they contain egg whites which weren't 
included on the products' list of ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have allergies or severe sensitivity to eggs run the  
risk of serious or life threatening allergic reactions if they 
consume these products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in City of Industry, Calif., has received no  
reports of illnesses. But the Food and Drug Administration urged 
the recall because ``egg whites'' was omitted from the list of 
ingredients on the front of the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring roll shells were distributed through retail and  
wholesale stores in California, Illinois, Texas, Colorado, New 
Jersey, Utah, Geogria, Montana, Michigan and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall includes products dated before Feb. 3, 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who have purchased O'Tasty brand Spring Roll Shells  
which do not have ``egg white'' printed on the front side of the 
plastic bag may return them to the place of purchase for a full 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may also contact the company at 1-800-953-1229.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Protests Cop Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson led about 500  
people at a rally and march through city streets Saturday, once 
again asking authorities to fully investigate what he called the 
``firing squad'' that shot a young black woman to death as she sat 
in her car. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyisha Miller was shot 12 times by four police officers early  
Dec. 28 at a gas station in a shooting that has inflamed racial 
tension in this city about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't seek revenge or retribution. We seek remedy,''  
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The county district attorney's office is conducting a grand jury  
investigation to determine whether charges should be filed against 
the officers, and the FBI is making a preliminary inquiry to 
determine whether there should be a full civil rights 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Attorney General Janet Reno said she plans to meet  
with civil rights representatives concerned about police misconduct 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent fatal shootings of young blacks by police under  
questionable circumstances in New York and Pittsburgh have added to 
the concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, Asian, Latino and Jewish civil rights advocates last week  
called for President Clinton to take steps to address the problem.

<HEADLINE> McCain to GOP: Stop Sniping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain urged his fellow GOP  
presidential hopefuls to refrain from attacking each other, but 
launched a series of broadsides on President Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore, McCain's potential opponent in a White House 
race next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scorched earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an  
Al Gore presidency,'' he warned. And he urged activists to withhold 
their support from any GOP candidate who attacks another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let us go down the road of mindlessly destroying each  
other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge will be put to the test almost immediately. The  
Arizona senator was the first of seven Republicans with White House 
dreams to address the GOP state convention, and four who go on 
stage today have been highly critical of front-runner Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	They are former Vice President Dan Quayle, businessman Steve  
Forbes, religious activist Gary Bauer and former Tennessee Gov. 
Lamar Alexander. Also attending the convention are 1996 candidate 
Alan Keyes and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to McCain said earlier Friday that he intends to make  
``restoring integrity at the White House'' a cornerstone of his 
campaign. McCain called on his listeners to ask themselves, ``Are 
you proud?'' and then offered a litany of White House scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you proud when monks and nuns abandon their vows of  
poverty and pay tens of thousands of dollars to have spiritual 
communion with the vice president?'' asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you proud when the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House is  
rented by the night, and the president of the United States serves 
as the bellhop?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the seven such examples cited by McCain, three involved Gore.  
None mentioned the president's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before have so many prospective presidential candidates  
flocked to a state Republican Party convention in California. 
Lawmakers here recently moved the California primary to the 
earliest possible date, March 7, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has said he intends to pin his campaign for the  
nomination on California, and his address Friday night contained 
appeals tailored to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he told convention attendees he carried 55 percent  
of the Hispanic vote in his re-election last year. ``I want all 
their votes. Their support is my honor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics constituted an estimated 13 percent of the voter  
turnout on Election Day in California, up from 9 percent in the 
1994 gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
	He also made an implicit plea for unity to the California  
Republican Party, which is bitterly split over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticking with the unity theme, he invoked former California Gov.  
and President Ronald Reagan's golden rule, ``I will speak no ill of 
a fellow Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let you know what I stand for and what I stand against,  
but I will not engage in personal attacks and the politics of 
division.'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks New Child Seat Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New federal rules announced today by  
President Clinton will require child safety seats to fit easily 
into standardized anchoring systems in all cars by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to make automobile travel ``even safer for our  
smallest and most vulnerable passengers,'' Clinton said in his 
weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``All too often, car seats don't protect our children as well as  
they should,'' Clinton said. ``Anyone who has struggled to get a 
car seat to fit snugly into a back seat knows exactly what I'm 
talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that more than 70 percent of all children riding in car  
seats are at risk because the seats are not properly installed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used his address to endorse the recommendations of a  
panel of medical and safety experts, seat manufacturers and 
consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the year 2000, the Department of Transportation will  
require every safety seat to have three standard attachments 
designed to fit three standard anchors in the back seat of every 
car,'' Clinton said. ``With this new rule, and with these three 
simple attachments, we can save lives and prevent up to 3,000 
injuries a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are intended to help parents avoid the struggle to  
cinch the seat with a seat belt. A second goal is to avoid the 
confusion that results when using seats or cars of different 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
	The design involves installation of a metal bar behind the rear  
seat to serve as anchor to toddlers' seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The president repeated his call for states to tighten their  
standards for drunken driving and adopt a blood alcohol 
concentration level of 0.08 percent ``to keep more drunk drivers 
off our roads.'' Many states now set their level at 0.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year defeated an effort to push states to make  
that change. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates a 137-pound woman who drank three beers  
in two hours could have a blood alcohol content of 0.07, while 
drinking four beers over the same time period could push her to 
0.10. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the West Coast, Clinton attended a $200,000 fund-raiser  
for Democrats in Los Angeles on Friday night. He dined at the home 
of billionaire fund-raiser Eli Broad before ending the night at the 
house of supermarket magnate Ron Berkel. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is on the right path to the future and moving in the  
right direction,'' he told cheering Democrats. ``We've come a long 
way in the last six years. We've had a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation must ``take advantage of these good times to  
deal with the big, long-term challenges we face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton taped his radio address earlier Friday in San Francisco,  
where he delivered a speech that laid out his vision for U.S. 
foreign policy during the last two years of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that NATO is ``prepared to act'' in Kosovo, pledged to  
redouble his efforts for peace in the Middle East and offered 
encouragement to Russia and China in their struggle for prosperous 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged Americans not to shrink from continued involvement  
in the drive for peace and prosperity around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hotel where the president spoke, hundreds of  
protesters demonstrated about a variety of causes. One person 
carried a sign: ``Clinton -- king of corruption in the reign of 
raunch.''

<HEADLINE> Defibrillator Training Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Red Cross launches an ambitious  
program this week to train thousands of everyday Americans to 
jump-start the hearts of cardiac arrest victims, putting the power 
of lifesaving defibrillators in your co-worker's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, 350,000 Americans collapse and die of cardiac arrest  
-- their hearts just suddenly stop beating. Every minute spent 
waiting for paramedics to arrive lowers the chance of survival by 
10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	CPR buys patients crucial time, but it will not restart a heart.  
Now companies, shopping malls, even amusement parks are buying 
portable defibrillators, small versions of the electric shock 
paddles made famous on TV, that can jolt hearts into beating again. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say portable defibrillators could save 100,000 lives a  
year, if used widely enough. They don't require medical expertise. 
Anyone with simple training can grab one and restart a person's 
heart, said Red Cross President Steve Bullock. 
</P>
<P>
	And they can't hurt: The machine won't shock if it detects a  
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to have America trained,'' said Bullock, who will  
announce Wednesday a pilot training program in more than a dozen 
cities. ``This is the way we're going to save more lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between March and July, the 4 1/2-hour courses will be phased into  
the Red Cross' standard CPR training for U.S. businesses in those 
cities, teaching company employees how to defibrillate a collapsed 
co-worker or customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Workplace training can protect the most people, because 130  
million Americans work each week and many spend the majority of 
their waking hours on the job, Bullock said. One study suggests 
cardiac arrest is most common Monday mornings and Friday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-city pilot project will be expanded to companies  
nationwide in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Bullock hopes to offer broader defibrillation  
training, in places like neighborhood community centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hard at all,'' said Ron Trainor, safety director of  
Brechteen Co., the first company trained. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad tracks surround the Chesterfield, Mich., meat-casing  
factory, meaning trains could block a much-needed ambulance, he 
said. Now if a worker collapses, 26 of the 150 employees, enough 
for each shift, could use a defibrillator kept handy on the factory 
floor instead of awaiting paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardiac arrest is not a heart attack, it's worse: Without  
warning, the electrical signals that pump the heart go haywire and 
heartbeat stops. Victims pass out almost immediately. One in 20 
survives. 
</P>
<P>
	CPR gets oxygen to the victim's brain while help is summoned,  
but only a jolt of electricity can restart the heart. 
Defibrillation within four minutes is most successful; after 10 
minutes, it usually fails. Yet in many places -- traffic-clogged 
cities, high-rises with slow elevators, remote rural areas -- 
paramedics can't arrive in time. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of several versions of portable defibrillators began  
selling only in late 1996, and not all paramedics carry them. 
Experts have focused on getting more paramedics and police, who 
often beat ambulances to an emergency, to carry them. Some large 
corporations have trained security guards to use the devices, and 
airlines, too, are buying them. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're not yet a common part of first aid. The American  
Heart Association began offering community defibrillation courses 
in September, but the Red Cross program aims to give defibrillators 
a higher profile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross trains with Heartstream Inc.'s defibrillator: A  
computerized voice tells you to place two adhesive pads on the 
patient's chest. The machine measures EKG signals through the pads. 
If it diagnoses cardiac arrest, it charges up and tells you to push 
the ``shock'' button. A mild jolt travels through the pads, which 
then measure if the shock worked or if another is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	People do need training, stressed the heart association's  
Patricia Bowser. They're taught to call 911 and start CPR while 
someone retrieves the defibrillator, and they get important advice 
like never to defibrillate someone lying in water. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, ``it's very, very easy,'' said Bowser, who expects  
defibrillator use to grow once more states pass laws giving 
liability protection to people who try to save a bystander. Only 21 
states have such laws now, but ``it's changing like crazy. The 
defibrillator issue is such a hot topic.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Stars in Lakers' Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Nine months off the basketball court  
hasn't done a thing to dull Dennis Rodman's rebounding instincts. 
His ability to snag loose balls with the zeal of a player half his 
age had the Los Angeles Lakers marveling at their 37-year-old 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't going to be doing that at 37,'' said 26-year-old  
Shaquille O'Neal. ``I can't say enough about how impressed I am. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had 11 rebounds and six assists playing 26 minutes off  
the bench in his season debut Friday night as the Lakers beat the 
Clippers 99-83. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little shy at the beginning because I didn't want to  
mess up, but when I stepped on the court it all just came back to 
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Rodman could describe himself as shy. He certainly didn't  
look it, with tattoos snaking down his limbs and his famous hair 
dyed a muted mix of yellow, purple and black. He would don the 
multiple nose rings and earrings after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt kind of awkward,'' said Rodman, who helped the Chicago  
Bulls win a sixth NBA title last spring. ``In a weird way, I really 
didn't want to put on a Lakers uniform because I've been on three 
different teams and have been a winner on all three. Coming to the 
Lakers is just a different feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of 17,505 put out a welcome vibe as soon as the  
part-time pro wrestler stepped on the Forum floor for warmups. 
Three female fans donned multi-colored wigs in honor of Rodman's 
ever-changing hair color. The fans cheered loudly for each rebound 
he hauled down, arms flailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they love a person that goes out there and works, that  
is not going out there ... to be flashy,'' he said. ``I think they 
really relate to me in that way. I like to think that the people in 
Los Angeles and the state of California have accepted me for who I 
am, and I am just going to go out there and work every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he kept the Lakers dangling for weeks while deciding  
whether to play this season, Rodman easily won them over. 
Especially O'Neal, who wasn't so friendly last spring when he and 
Rodman mocked each other publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a lot of loose balls. That's what I've been looking  
for, a player like that,'' O'Neal said. ``You really don't know how 
good people are until you get a chance to play with them. He's 
pretty good and he's pretty smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's career in Los Angeles began by tipping a loose ball to  
O'Neal for a monster dunk six minutes into the game. Although the 
Lakers were outrebounded by the Clippers, 48-46, no one blamed 
Rodman. Instead, his teammates likened him to a genius. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought a lot of energy and intensity to the game,'' Kobe  
Bryant said. ``Something that I think everyone underestimates is 
his ability to get the ball out after the rebound, his long passes. 
He got us a lot of easy hoops and that's what we're looking for. He 
is so smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal likes the new arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he's my teammate, I've listened to him talk and we've  
had conversations,'' the center said. ``He has a lot of knowledge 
about the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman heaved a couple of 70-foot outlet passes to his teammates  
for baskets, but new coach Kurt Rambis liked Rodman's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had virtually no work with him, but he's already  
communicating. He talks,'' said Rambis, announced as the 
replacement for Del Harris just 2 1/2 hours before tipoff. ``We have 
to pick it up on the defensive end, and that's been his specialty, 
along with rebounding. We're really counting on him to pull 
everybody along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman pulled in the Hollywood crowd, including director Penny  
Marshall, Oscar-nominated actor Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Richard 
Crenna, singer-producer Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds and Dyan 
Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's wife, actress Carmen Electra, soaked up the applause  
when fans spotted her seated several rows above the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a spark for this team, and I'm glad he's  
here,'' O'Neal said.

<HEADLINE> Muehlegg Wins American Birkebeiner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAYWARD, Wis. (AP) -- Johann Muehlegg of Germany called himself a  
loner in winning the 27th annual American Birkebeiner cross-country 
ski race Saturday, competing on the 52-kilometer course for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to ski alone to my own rhythm,'' he said. ``I saw it  
was possible to break away after five kilometers so I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muehlegg's time was 2 hours, 3 minutes, 7 seconds over the  
northern Wisconsin course from Cable to the snow-packed main street 
of Hayward, which was lined by hundreds of spectators with cowbells 
and other noise-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is advertised as North America's longest ski race. The 1997  
record is held by Russia's Mikhail Botzinov at 5 minutes faster 
than Muehlegg, who had never see the course before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very hard course,'' Muehlegg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carl Swenson of Boulder, Colo., last year's winner, was second  
in 2:06:33, outdistancing Stephane Passeron of France, by 5.1 
seconds with a sprint over the final 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	After Muehlegg pulled away, Swenson said, he was left with a  
two-man race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hung onto Stephane as best I could,'' Swenson said. Passeron  
was slowed by slush on Lake Hayward and ``I knew I had him then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skiers described the course as generally good despite overnight  
thundershowers. Besides slush on the frozen lake, the course 
approach to the lake was muddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials reported a participant collapsed and died during  
the race, possibly of a heart attack. The skier was not immediately 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The race has had only one previous heart-attack death,  
Birkebeiner spokesman Ron Bergin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura McCabe of Park City, Utah, was the leading women with a  
time of 2:22:59 in her fifth try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this race,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The women's race was dominated by Americans. Kelly Schalk of  
Laramie, Wyo., was second at 2:27:31. Kara Zimmer of Duluth, Minn., 
followed at 2:30:42. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 kilometers, Schalk was delayed by a fall that broke a  
ski pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-kilometer Korteloppet was won by Joshua Tesch of Wausau,  
Wis., at 1:00:06, followed by Andy Erickson of Jericho, Vt., in 
1:00:47 and Matt Schadow, Minnetonka, Minn., in 1:00:55. 
</P>
<P>
	Christa Farrand Case of Grass Valley, Calif., won the woman's  
Korteloppet in 1:13:04. Aniya Deitz of Fifield, Wis., was second in 
1:16:29 and Susanne Hill, Winnipeg, Manitoba, third in 1:18:14.

<HEADLINE> Some Campaign Donations Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Campaign contributions by young people have  
risen sharply this decade, raising concerns among election 
officials that children are being used to evade campaign finance 
laws, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors identified on campaign documents as ``students'' gave  
nearly $2.6 million for the 1996 presidential election -- a 45 
percent increase over 1992, according to a Times analysis of 
federal records. Between 1991 and 1998, children, high school and 
college students gave a total of $7.5 million in political 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission regards student giving as such a  
potentially serious loophole that it has urged Congress to ban 
donations by minors, according to the commission's 1998 legislative 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an area of great abuse where you have the absurd  
situation of small children supposedly contributing their own money 
to a candidate of their own choice,'' said Donald Simon of the 
political watchdog group Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, in many cases, what's going on is simply a way for  
the parents to beat the contribution limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law sets no minimum age on donors but requires that the  
funds be ``owned or controlled exclusively'' by contributors and 
that they give ``knowingly and voluntarily.'' Parents are forbidden 
from giving money to children to make donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, in a story for its Sunday editions, found that many  
minors gave money on the same day or around the same time their 
parents gave the maximum contribution allowed under federal law. 
Individuals are limited to donations of $1,000 per candidate and 
$20,000 per party in a specific election, though there is no limit 
on ``soft'' money contributions for broader use. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Lerner, the FEC's associate general counsel, said the  
agency ``has realized in recent years that people are trying to get 
as much money into the process as they can, and this is an area 
where it's pretty easy to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1975, the FEC has fined only one parent in a case  
involving contributions by a minor. Stewart Bainum Jr., a former 
Maryland state senator and executive of a chain of nursing homes, 
paid $4,000 in 1997 after he acknowledged donating the same amount 
in the name of his 2-year-old son as well as exceeding campaign 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy area of the law to enforce,'' said Ian  
Stirton, an FEC spokesman. ``Somebody has to know this is going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign finance bill was introduced in Congress last month  
that would ban all political donations from individuals under 18. 
The same bill failed to pass last year.

<HEADLINE> No Samaranch Successor in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With the Olympics mired in crisis, IOC president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch appears more determined than ever to stay in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	But the questions remain: Can he hold on? For how long? Who  
might succeed him? 
</P>
<P>
	The answers to all three are anyone's guess.  
</P>
<P>
	As the International Olympic Committee prepares for a watershed  
meeting March 17-18 to deal with its worst corruption scandal, no 
obvious successor to Samaranch has emerged from among a half-dozen 
leading candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has come under tremendous pressure since the scandal  
broke late last year over cash and other inducements received by 
IOC members from Salt Lake City and other Olympic bidders. Calls 
for his resignation have mounted. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Samaranch appears to have widespread support from his  
main constituency -- the IOC members from whom he will seek a vote 
of confidence next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent interviews with a cross section of IOC members elicited  
the same general response: Samaranch is the only one who can lead 
the committee out of the crisis and he should see through his final 
term until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	With no obvious successor in place, Olympic officials say  
Samaranch's departure could trigger a vicious internal battle that 
would only drag the IOC deeper into crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to be debating your leadership,'' said  
Australian executive board member Kevan Gosper. ``It's the time to 
rally around your leadership. If the ship's in a storm, you don't 
throw the captain overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch received a rousing endorsement this week from NBC  
sports chief Dick Ebersol, whose network is paying $3.5 billion for 
U.S. television rights to five Olympics through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be crazy'' for Samaranch to leave, Ebersol  
said in an Australian TV interview. ``Since 1980, he brought so 
many positive things to the (Olympic) movement. ... And he was 
totally responsible for creating the vast business success that 
they've had. On top of that, he is a man of incredible personal 
integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the IOC's marble headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, a  
sort of siege mentality has set in. Samaranch has stopped doing 
interviews and made no public appearances or statements in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch has kept busy, conferring with his aides and IOC  
members, laying the groundwork for the March session, the most 
crucial meeting in his 19 years as president. Aides say Samaranch, 
who appeared tired and disheartened a month ago, is more upbeat and 
more determined to fight on and save his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of the March meeting should help determine  
Samaranch's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	If the IOC fails to expel members and push through major  
reforms, Samaranch's position will become untenable. Even if 
Samaranch comes out stronger and the crisis dies down, his future 
remains a matter of conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
	There is speculation he might decide to step down in calmer  
circumstances before the end of his term, possibly after next 
year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of any early departure is crucial and could be part  
of the reckoning to determine a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Olympic Charter, if the IOC president leaves before  
the end of his mandate, the first vice president -- there are four 
VPs -- takes over until an election at the next general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	So, if Samaranch were to resign in March, Pal Schmitt of Hungary  
would step in as president, pending an election at the IOC session 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	If Samaranch waited until June, Schmitt's VP term will have  
expired by then, and Canada's Dick Pound would take control. In 
2000, Anita DeFrantz of the United States would be next in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of whether Samaranch makes it to the end of his term,  
there is no obvious long-term heir. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading contenders are executive board members Pound, Gosper,  
DeFrantz, Jacques Rogge of Belgium and Thomas Bach of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean board member Kim Un-yong was a serious presidential  
hopeful but he is among those under investigation in the Salt Lake 
scandal. Even if Kim escapes without expulsion, his chances have 
been severely hurt, if not killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who has been the IOC's chief negotiator of TV and  
sponsorship deals, has been put in a difficult position as head of 
the commission investigating ethical misconduct of members in the 
Salt Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	While some feel Pound's stock has risen, several members say his  
presidential chances have been compromised. By giving Pound the 
high-profile job of prosecuting IOC members, Samaranch may have -- 
wittingly or unwittingly -- ruined his ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, head of the IOC's press commission, has become  
increasingly active as Australia prepares to stage the 2000 Games, 
but his age -- 65, nine years older than Pound -- is a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, the first woman to reach the IOC vice presidency, is a  
prominent advocate for athletes' rights and the advancement of 
women. But some members believe it's too early for DeFrantz, only 
46, to be considered a serious candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strong position is Rogge, an orthopedic surgeon who has  
made a rapid rise to the IOC's inner circle. Rogge holds 
influential roles as head of the European Olympic Committees, and 
as the IOC's point man for the Sydney Olympics and the 2004 Athens 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Another name mentioned in IOC circles is Jean-Claude Killy, the  
French skier who won three gold medals at the 1968 Grenoble Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy, an IOC member since 1995, has not been a major player.  
But he's a favorite of Samaranch, has name recognition and has not 
been dragged into the scandal or internal politics. Whether he has 
the desire to be president is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of Britain's Princess Anne also has come up. Robert  
Helmick, the former IOC member from the United States who resigned 
in 1991 amid conflict-of-interest allegations, suggested in a 
newspaper column that she should take charge as ``interim 
administrator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne, an IOC member since 1988, has been held up as an example  
of unimpeachable integrity for refusing gifts from bid cities. But 
her royal duties leave her little spare time for the IOC (she will 
miss the March session due to previous commitments). 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe right now there's anyone who is clearly ready  
to take (Samaranch's) place,'' Ebersol said. ``Hopefully, the 
meeting in March will be a success and over the next two years 
they'll be doubly diligent, and by the time they vote in 2001, 
there'll be someone clearly ready to succeed Samaranch's 
position.''

<HEADLINE> Rev. Henry Lyons Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The head of one of the nation's most  
influential black denominations, who prosecutors said ``traded the 
Good Book for the bank book,'' was found guilty today on charges of 
swindling millions of dollars from companies seeking to do business 
with his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National Baptist  
Convention USA, also was found guilty of grand theft in the 
disappearance of almost $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of 
B'Nai B'rith, money intended to rebuild burned black churches in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member jury acquitted Lyons' co-defendant and alleged  
mistress, Bernice Edwards, on the racketeering charge, the only 
count she faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, flanked by his attorneys, showed no reaction as the judge  
read the verdicts. He faces three to seven years in prison. Edwards 
sobbed and put her head on her lawyer's shoulder after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused the pair of stealing more than $4 million  
from corporations wanting to sell cemetery products, life insurance 
policies and credit cards to the convention's touted 8.5 million 
black members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have called the membership figure a hoax and said  
the convention could have had closer to 1 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Lyons and Ms. Edwards duped the companies by promising  
a membership mailing list that never existed -- at one point, 
according to testimony, even making up lists from $90 computerized 
phone disks that led one company to send letters to such 
non-Baptists as a grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and a Catholic 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair then went on lavish spending sprees, buying a diamond  
ring ``the size of a dime,'' a $700,000 waterfront home, a 
time-share condominium in Nevada, several luxury cars and expensive 
clothing, according to testimony during the five-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial came to a standstill Saturday morning when two Tampa  
Bay television stations turned over copies of e-mails they had 
received from a man who claimed he overheard a female juror 
discussing the case with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' attorney immediately asked for a mistrial. The judge  
denied the request after the juror denied the conversation. In a 
second e-mail, the same man wrote that he did not overhear the 
conversation directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began investigating Lyons' finances in July 1997,  
after his wife set fire to the waterfront home. She told deputies 
she found the deed in her husband's briefcase and believed he and 
Ms. Edwards were having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Lyons, later convicted of arson and sentenced to  
probation, since has said she supports her husband and does not 
believe Ms. Edwards was his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, a convicted embezzler from Milwaukee, took the  
witness stand to deny having a sexual affair with the minister and 
asserted she earned every dime she spent by working as the 
convention's public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
	However, convention aide Bonita Henderson testified she did have  
an affair with Lyons and told jurors that Ms. Edwards bragged of 
having a sexual relationship with him, even telling convention 
pastors the pair would marry ``as soon as he got rid of his drunken 
wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henderson described making up a membership list for the  
Globe Life Insurance Co. at Lyons' direction, using a computerized 
telephone directory and eliminating names ending with ``-ski'' or 
clearly of other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The company paid Lyons $400,000 for that list, executives  
testified, then realized they had been duped when they received 
complaints from a grand dragon for the Ku Klux Klan, a Catholic 
priest and a member of their own board of directors who each 
received sales letters with Lyons' endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company later paid Lyons another $600,000 when he claimed  
the list had been sabotaged and he could get them another. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest victim, prosecutors said, was the world's  
second-largest funeral home company, the Loewen Group, which was 
cheated out of almost $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere along the line, he traded the Good Book for the bank  
book. That's what this case is all about,'' Assistant State 
Attorney Bill Loughery told the jury in closing arguments Thursday. 
``It's beyond hypocrisy and it's actually criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers attacked prosecutors as acting as ``the moral  
police,'' saying the minister's failed business deals were not 
criminal matters and the case actually is about religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention has kept Lyons as its leader, saying he stole no  
funds from them and committed no wrongdoing, attorney Grady Irvin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like it,'' he said, pointing at prosecutors. ``The  
next thing you know, are they going to be writing the sermons? 
Telling us when to pray? When to kneel? When to stand up? This is a 
religious organization. ... It's not up to these prosecutors ... to 
tell them how to run their organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons still faces a federal trial in April on 54 counts which  
include tax evasion, money laundering and extortion.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Warns About Bus Driver Fatigue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board  
renewed its call Friday for better brake inspections of buses and 
warnings about driver fatigue, citing two bus crashes in 1995 and 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters to the transportation secretary, the National Highway  
Traffic Safety Administration and the American Bus Association, 
among others, the safety board said the crashes in Indianapolis and 
Stony Creek, Va., show the need for sleep programs, better 
scheduling and passenger safety briefings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 15, 1995, a motorcoach operated by Hammond Yellow Coach  
Line Inc. overturned on an Interstate 70 exit ramp, killing two 
people and injuring 39. The bus had been carrying a high school 
booster club. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the crash, the driver had been awake 16.5 hours  
and on duty 11 hours and had driven about 7.5 hours over that span.

<P>
	On June 29, 1997, a motorcoach operated by Rite-Way  
Transportation Inc. drifted off the side of Interstate 95 near 
Stony Creek, Va., killing one person and injuring 31 others. The 
bus had been carrying members of a Pathways to Freedom tour group. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, the driver had his duty-sleep periods inverted on  
successive nights of the tour. In the 24 hours before the crash, 
the driver had not had any bed rest and probably obtained only two 
hours of ``split sleep'' -- rest accumulated through naps, the board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, the buses also had brakes with problems so severe  
they met the federal criteria to be placed out of service. 
</P>
<P>
	``These accidents involved factors that the safety board has  
repeatedly identified as issues in accidents and that have the 
potential for catastrophic consequences,'' wrote Jim Hall, chairman 
of the safety board. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, however, Hall conceded that the federal  
government is already moving on the safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Highway Administration has set a goal of educating  
all 7 million holders of the commercial drivers license on 
recognizing the signs of fatigue and getting adequate rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the $203 billion highway bill signed into law last year by  
President Clinton provides for the Transportation Department to 
assess how shippers and others purposely or inadvertently encourage 
drivers to violate hour-of-service rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the federal Office of Motor Carriers and the  
Michigan Department of Transportation had also cited both carriers 
on repeated occasions for faulty equipment or driving practices.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Endures Stormy Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- In one of the snowiest regions on Earth, it's  
been snowing -- A LOT. Maybe enough at Mount Rainier to top the 
record year when skiers could peer down the chimney of the 
three-story Paradise Inn. Mount Baker already has gotten nearly 70 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a number of theories as to why the Northwest has been  
socked by an extended series of storms this winter: La Nina, the 
unusual cooling of water in the Pacific; global warming; a return 
to the wetter and colder winters the region had in the 1950s 
through the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, ``It could be just a random event,'' said Mark Moore,  
director of the Northwest Weather Avalanche Center. 
</P>
<P>
	At lower elevations, the unusually dismal winter has brought  
rain -- and more rain. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, Seattle had endured a record 87 days of rain  
since Nov. 1, and more rain fell this weekend. Forks, an Olympic 
Peninsula town that's one of the rainiest burgs in America, had 61 
inches of rain -- more than 5 feet -- in that period. 
</P>
<P>
	The incessant snowfall, an average of 10 inches a day in some  
places, has created one of the most dangerous avalanche seasons in 
decades, said Moore. So far this year, one person has been killed 
and two are missing and believed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Snoqualmie and Stevens passes, the main routes across the  
Cascade Range, have been intermittently closed as crews battled 
heavy snow and avalanches. Ski areas along those routes have had to 
close because of too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dangerous though the mountains may be, they also are  
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been beyond beautiful,'' said Maria Gillett, a  
staffer at Mount Rainier National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born and raised at this ski area, and I've had the best  
days of my entire life up here this year,'' said Amy Howat, 
marketing manager at the Mount Baker ski area in northwest 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Nov. 20, Mount Baker has had a record 833 inches of  
snowfall -- nearly 70 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the ski area shut down for two days after snow rose  
above the chairlift seats, and Howat, whose parents run the ski 
area, says even the natives are starting to get edgy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, seeing the sun only once or twice in three months just  
doesn't get it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park, 30-foot snowdrifts  
have buried the visitors lodge. For more than a week, crews 
couldn't even reach the lodge because of avalanches along its 
17-mile road. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials can't even tell if the park has had record snowfall,  
said spokeswoman Barb Maynes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a snow-measuring stake -- it's 21 feet tall -- but it's  
been buried for the last five or six days,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A small ski area at Hurricane Ridge has been closed since late  
January. Crews tried to reopen one run there a week ago, Maynes 
said, but the 40-foot-tall towers for the ski lift reached only 
chest-high above the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mount Rainier National Park, Paradise Lodge has received 756  
inches of snow this winter, 200 inches above average, said the 
park's chief ranger, John Krambrink. 
</P>
<P>
	If heavy snow continues into the spring -- Rainier often gets  
storms as late as July -- it could top the 1,122 inches, or 93 1/2 feet 
of snow Paradise received in the winter of 1971-72 -- the world 
record for any inhabited weather station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was here in the regional office at that time,'' Krambrink  
said. ``The three-story Paradise Inn, just the upper roof crest and 
part of the chimney were sticking out, and that's it. And we skied 
across the roof crest, my wife and I. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're wondering whether we will get to do that again.''

<HEADLINE> Theater Director Jose Quintero Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jose Quintero, a Tony Award-winning director  
whose landmark productions of Eugene O'Neill's dramas renewed 
interest in one of America's greatest playwrights, has died of 
cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero, who lived in Sarasota, Fla., died Friday in a New York  
hospital, said his longtime friend and agent, Robert Lantz. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero directed more than a dozen major productions of works  
by O'Neill, who in the last decade of his life had been 
increasingly ignored by critics and audiences. O'Neill died in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero was nominated for several Tonys, winning for a  
production of ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' and 1973's ``A Moon 
for the Misbegotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was also a founder of Circle in the Square, a small Greenwich  
Village theater credited with energizing the off-Broadway movement 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the actors he worked with during his nearly 50 years in  
the theater were Jason Robards, Colleen Dewhurst, George C. Scott 
and Geraldine Page. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his 1952 revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and  
Smoke,'' starring a luminous Page as spinster Alma Winemiller, that 
first brought him and Circle in the Square attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it was as a director of O'Neill plays that Quintero won the  
most acclaim. In 1956, he directed the original Broadway production 
of ``A Long Day's Journey into Night,'' which starred Fredric March 
as the tyrannical James Tyrone and Florence Eldridge as his 
drug-addled wife. Robards and Bradford Dillman played their 
troubled sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The autobiographical drama, produced three years after O'Neill's  
death, is generally considered to be the playwright's finest work. 
Quintero later reflected on his production of the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Success is a terrible thing,'' he said. ``You're not prepared  
to deal with it, especially if you've been educated for failure as 
I'd been. You're afraid they'll find you out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that year, Quintero directed an off-Broadway revival of  
``The Iceman Cometh,'' starring Robards as Hickey, the hale and 
hearty barfly. It had Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times 
proclaiming, ```The Iceman Cometh' is a mighty theater work. 
O'Neill is a giant, and Mr. Quintero is a remarkably gifted 
artist.'' Quintero, Robards and ``Iceman'' were reunited in 1985 
for a second highly praised production, this time on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The director and Robards joined forces on several other major  
O'Neill revivals on Broadway, including ``Hughie'' (1964); ``A Moon 
for the Misbegotten'' (1973); and ``A Touch of the Poet'' (1977). 
Robards and Dewhurst starred as the parents in a Quintero-directed 
Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero did not neglect the lesser-known O'Neill works either,  
directing ``Strange Interlude'' on Broadway in 1963 (with Page, Ben 
Gazzara and Jane Fonda), ``Marco Millions'' at Lincoln Center in 
1964 and ``More Stately Mansions'' with Ingrid Bergman on Broadway 
in 1967. He also did ``Desire Under the Elms'' with Dewhurst and 
Scott off-Broadway in 1963 and a Broadway production in 1977 of 
``Anna Christie,'' starring Liv Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other Broadway productions he directed were two  
Tennessee Williams flops, ``The Seven Descents of Myrtle'' (1968) 
and ``Clothes for a Summer Hotel,'' (1980) as well as Brian Friel's 
``Faith Healer'' (1979), starring James Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed one film, ``The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone'' (1961),  
based on a Tennessee Williams novella. It starred Vivien Leigh and 
Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero was born in Panama City, Panama, and had an unhappy  
childhood, one of several similarities with O'Neill and something 
both men parlayed into their theater work. He attended the 
University of Southern California and the Goodman Theater Dramatic 
School in Chicago before arriving in New York in 1949 to begin 
working with people who would help form Circle in the Square. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1980s, Quintero developed throat cancer and had his  
vocal cords removed. He learned to speak with the assistance of a 
mechanical amplifier that he held to his throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero is survived by a sister. A memorial service was  
pending.

	Kosovo Monitors Tail Yugoslav Army  
</P>
<P>
	SUVA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International monitors in Kosovo  
are riding in trucks to tail Yugoslav army tanks and armored 
personnel carriers to prevent attacks against ethnic Albanians. 
Violence between the two sides has been increasing in the weeks 
before U.S.-led peace talks resume March 15. Observers said the 
police and army of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were 
trying to provoke fighting with ethnic Albanian rebels to sabotage 
a potential peace deal. Ethnic Albanian sources said Yugoslav army 
troops targeted rebel positions in at least five villages about 20 
miles northwest of the capital of Pristina.

<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The head of one of the nation's most  
influential black denominations was found guilty today on charges 
of swindling millions of dollars from companies seeking to do 
business with his followers. The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the 
National Baptist Convention USA, also was found guilty of grand 
theft in the disappearance of almost $250,000 from the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, money intended to rebuild 
burned black churches in the South. Prosecutors accused Lyons of 
stealing more than $4 million from corporations wanting to sell 
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards to the 
convention's touted 8.5 million black members.

	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- More than 1,000 nurses and other union  
workers at Women &AMP; Infants Hospital held a one-day walkout today, 
causing doctors to postpone some non-emergency surgeries. It was 
the second such action in two months in protest of stalled contract 
talks. After the first incident in December, the hospital locked 
the nurses out for 29 days. Despite calling in temporary workers, 
the hospital had to cancel some non-emergency procedures. The 
nurses' union wants more pay and protection from layoffs.

	Clinton Seeks New Child Seat Rules

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton today announced new federal  
rules to make child car seats safer. The new measure establishes a 
single standardized system for anchoring child safety seats in new 
cars and light trucks by the end of this year. Clinton cited 
government estimates that more than 70 percent of children who ride 
in car seats are at risk of injury because their seats are 
improperly installed. All new child seats will have three standard 
attachments, one on top and two at the base. And all new cars and 
trucks will have standard anchors in the back seats to link to the 
seat attachments.

	Iraq Seeks Oil 'Compensation'

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An Iraqi official says his country wants  
compensation from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for profits they have 
reaped from increased oil sales while Iraq was under U.N. trade 
sanctions. In recent weeks, Iraq has threatened to retaliate 
against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey for allowing U.S. and 
British jets to use their territories for patrols over ``no-fly'' 
zones in northern and southern Iraq. The U.N. Security Council 
imposed trade sanctions on Iraq in 1990 to punish it for invading 
Kuwait. The sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic 
mainstay.

the snow slide last week. Scraps of building were visible atop the 
mounds of snow, and a pile of twisted automobiles had already been 
recovered. Roads leading to the region are passable for the first

<HEADLINE> Sugar Ray Singer Admits Arrogance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath is the first  
to admit that his arrogant style set against his band's lightweight 
pop rock can get on people's nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely hateable -- I understand that,'' McGrath says  
in the March 18 issue of Rolling Stone. ``If I wasn't in this band, 
I'd hate it too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After selling virtually no copies of their first album,  
``Lemonade and Brownies,'' Sugar Ray hit it big with their second, 
``Floored,'' which sold 2 million copies thanks to the hit song 
``Fly.'' Their third album, ``14:59,'' a tongue-in-cheek countdown 
of their 15 minutes of fame, is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath doesn't have any illusions about the band pursuing high  
art. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be in your radio speaker,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The singer with a reputation as a Hollywood party animal also  
acknowledges his love for life in the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably been 15 years since I've been to confession,''  
he said. ``You'd have to close down the church for a week.''

<HEADLINE> Rider Suspended for Leaving Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider was  
suspended without pay for Saturday night's game against the 
Washington Wizards and fined $2,500 by the NBA for leaving the 
bench during an altercation Friday night at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	When Charlotte's Bobby Phills and Portland's Greg Anthony went  
face to under the basket after a hard foul, Rider stood and took a 
couple of steps onto the court. He then quickly retreated to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got up off the bench and went a couple of steps and said,  
`Oh, what am I doing?''' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``If 
it's in front of your bench and a guy jumps up and forgets and runs 
right back, it's kind of a natural reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was not assessed a technical foul, and the infraction was  
not cited until the league reviewed the film after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule's the rule,'' Dunleavy said. ``I understand the rule,  
so therefore he's out. I've got no problem with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, whose 18 points per game leads the Trail Blazers, did not  
arrive with his team at the MCI Center and stayed at the team hotel 
during the Wizards game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was suspended four times last season, twice by the league  
and twice by his team, for a total of seven games. The longest 
suspension was three games by the league for spitting at a heckler 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said Jim Jackson would make his first start of the  
season in Rider's place.

<HEADLINE> Life's Back to Normal for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two weeks after his impeachment trial,  
President Clinton's life seems almost back to normal: speeches, 
travel, fund raising, golf. There was even a family reunion at a 
Utah ski resort to celebrate Chelsea's 19th birthday Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons borrowed the gated, multimillion-dollar mountaintop  
home of Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg for the Utah 
vacation, where they will stay until Tuesday. Katzenberg has 
several intermediate ski runs just off his back yard at the Deer 
Valley Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	After a scandal-scarred year, a sense of relief and higher  
spirits has seeped into Clinton's entourage. ``We've come a long 
way in the last six years. We've had a good time,'' Clinton told 
cheering supporters late Friday. He talked about the agenda he will 
pursue ``until the last hour of my last day in office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But troubling problems remain for the president, as he  
acknowledged on this six-day trip in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I've made any progress at all in bringing peace  
to Washington, D.C,'' the president said, only half-jokingly, at a 
San Francisco fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, although the impeachment battle is over, Republicans  
remain angry and distrustful, clouding hopes for legislative 
achievements that could improve Clinton's tarnished legacy. His 
job-approval ratings remain high, but opinion polls show that most 
Americans deplore his personal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like his programs; they don't like him,'' said Andrew  
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. ``I don't think it's 
ancient history in terms of how they feel about Clinton and the 
scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohut said 78 percent of Americans say they want a different  
kind of president than Clinton in 2000. ``They want a different 
kind of person, but they want the same kind of programs and 
policies,'' he said. ``The public wants both continuity and 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks Clinton's poll ratings will start to slip over time.  
But not right now, not while scandal-related stories linger. ``All 
of that keeps that dynamic of supporting the president alive,'' 
Kohut said. ``We're not out of this environment quite yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were angry demonstrators at Clinton's stops in Tucson,  
Ariz., San Francisco and Los Angeles, with signs recalling 
allegations of sexual misconduct against him. ``Resign in '99,'' a 
sign read in San Francisco. Many signs branded Clinton a rapist, 
referring to accusations by Juanita Broaddrick that Clinton 
sexually assaulted her 21 years ago. The president's attorney says 
the charges are false. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the demonstrators, there were other reminders of the  
impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing Clinton in San Francisco, Democratic Sen. Barbara  
Boxer said that Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., one the 13 House 
prosecutors in the president's impeachment trial, is considering a 
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, Jim,'' Boxer said in sarcastic reference to his  
prospects. Clinton laughed heartily. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., one of his  
most ardent defenders against impeachment, as a ``lion on the House 
Judiciary Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter aftermath of the impeachment struggle is likely to  
linger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not over,'' said William Kristol, a GOP strategist and  
editor of the conservative ``Weekly Standard'' magazine. ``It's 
obvious now more than ever that the issue of Clinton, in its 
various aspects, is going to be the subtext of the next two years 
and the 2000 elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have the two parties divide so dramatically on such  
a fundamental issue as impeachment and then have it go away, even 
if lots of people in both parties want it to go away,'' he said. 
``November 2000 is when the real verdict comes.''

<HEADLINE> Listeria Cases Baffle Experts / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lisa Lee, pregnant with twins, had less than  
five months left before the due date when she came down with what 
seemed to be the flu. She was rushed to the hospital last month and 
was cured but lost both babies in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors now say the prospective mother was struck by  
listeriosis, a disease caused by the bacteria Listeria 
monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen often found in hot dogs, 
luncheon meats, soft cheese, even milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's once-rare disease has received tremendous attention in  
recent months, especially since a massive recall in December of 
possibly tainted food from a Michigan plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar Foods Co., a meat processor owned by Sara Lee in  
Zeeland, Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and cold 
cuts after a rare strain of the listeria bacteria was found in both 
opened and unopened packages. 
</P>
<P>
	The same strain, pattern E, has been linked to 12 adult deaths  
and five miscarriages among 82 illnesses in 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from causing stillbirths and miscarriages, listeriosis  
also can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in people 
with weakened immune systems: infants, the elderly or patients with 
chronic diseases, HIV infection or undergoing cancer chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with  
illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country 
have had to recall products after tests detected listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to  
listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs. One recall was for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an increase from the corresponding period a year earlier  
when the Agriculture Department recorded just one listeria-related 
recall. And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly seems like it's on the rise,'' said Dr. Robert B.  
Gravani, professor of food science at Cornell University. He said 
experts are trying to determine whether the incidents are due to 
better reporting or whether the listeria really is appearing more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	Better testing and reporting is the more likely reason, said  
Margaret Glavin, associate administrator for USDA's food safety and 
inspection service. ``We don't see an uptrend in the number of 
positives we're finding,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria was a real problem for the United States in the  
mid-1980s, said Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown 
University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, but the 
government declared zero tolerance for the pathogen. Listeria 
levels dropped sharply, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By 1994, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) was proclaiming  
that this was one of the most successful regulatory actions in U.S. 
history,'' Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the sudden rise in recalls has experts baffled.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have explored whether or not there might be a new strain or  
new characteristics in listeria that's causing it to be more 
difficult to control,'' Crawford said. So far, no evidence has been 
found to support that theory. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts also found no evidence that a new scientific-based food  
inspection program, USDA's Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 
Point, has failed. If anything, they argue, HACCP's inspections, 
which monitor things like temperature in the processing system, 
have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	So, why is listeria suddenly popping up?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're sort of left with no real answer,'' Crawford said.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, he and other experts, remind people to cook hot dogs  
and eat deli meats before the sell-by date. They also say consumers 
should be careful not to reheat leftovers more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	Pregnant women, about 20 times more likely than other healthy  
adults to get listeriosis, should be particularly careful to never 
eat raw meat or undercooked eggs or food, the USDA recommends. They 
also should avoid soft cheeses, such as feta or Brie, and avoid 
food from deli counters. Any lunch meat or hot dogs should be 
thoroughly heated. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lisa Lee, it was a risk she says she never knew existed.  
Luncheon meat in her has been turned over to the local health 
department for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice for other pregnant women is ``ask more questions, be  
more informed.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Defends Massive New SUV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., defending itself from  
attacks by environmental groups, says its hulking, nine-passenger 
Excursion sport utility vehicle will be among the safest and 
cleanest-running SUVs on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Excursion, at nearly 19 feet long and just under 7 feet  
tall, will be the largest sport utility vehicle on the market when 
it arrives in showrooms Oct. 1. Empty, it will weigh 3.5 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Its size and low fuel economy have made it a target for  
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the most polluting truck on the road and will set  
a new low for Detroit,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra 
Club's global warming program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Excursion will get only about 10-12 mpg with its optional  
V10 engine, Ford Motor Co. acknowledges. At best, the optional 
diesel V8 will get 15-18 mpg. To ensure fewer fuel stops, the 
Excursion will comes with a 44-gallon fuel tank -- twice the size of 
tanks on most midsize SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	To address safety concerns, the Excursion will be equipped with  
a 4-foot tubular steel bar under the front bumper to help prevent 
it from riding over a car in a head-on collision. A 3-foot-long 
trailer hitch will be positioned to offer the same protection in 
rear-end crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an innovative product,'' Ford truck chief Gurminder Bedi  
said. ``I hope you can see beyond that it's just big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said all three of the big engines available will meet  
California's low-emission standard for light trucks. The No. 2 
automaker announced last year that it would make all of its 1999 
sports utility vehicles meet the lower standard. 
</P>
<P>
	But the California standards address smog-producing emissions,  
not carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Environmentalists argue 
that with its poor fuel economy, the Excursion will be one of the 
worst highway contributors to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	With annual production initially set at 50,000, Ford will be  
competing in a niche market that has doubled in volume in the last 
eight years. General Motors Corp. has dominated the market with the 
Chevrolet and GMC Suburban; it sold 151,356 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of a mirror image of America at work and play,''  
Bedi said. ``They reflect the American lifestyle, the hobbies and 
toys and the way they live their life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retail prices were expected to range between $45,000 and  
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller sport utility vehicle Ford plans to unveil a year from  
now will get 28 to 30 mpg, Bedi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have what the customers want. We will have the small  
ones with very, very efficient fuel economy and we will have the 
powerful ones that need to carry a load and need to do a job at the 
other end of the spectrum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was considerable debate within Ford over whether to build  
the Excursion, Bedi said. Studies showed a number of customers 
wanted a larger vehicle for specific tasks such as pulling a horse 
trailer or carrying a large number of people.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Wait for Tigers Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- John Rafalski drove seven hours Friday from  
Illinois, then spent another 11 hours camped outside Tiger Stadium 
for tickets for either opening day or the last home game in the 
famed ballpark's last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But just 33 minutes after the tickets went on sale, they were  
long gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafalski, a 30-year-old engineer, settled for tickets to June  
games against the St. Louis Cardinals. But it was worth the travel, 
the hours he spent shivering in a plastic patio chair in 
sub-freezing temperatures, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Guess again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty bummed,'' Rafalski said. ``I had wanted to go to  
the last game more than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it went -- elation for some, frustration for others among the  
hundreds of Tigers fans who lined up Saturday in the misty chill 
outside the 86-year-old stadium. Many sought the handful of tickets 
made available for the April 12 home opener against the Minnesota 
Twins, or the last of the roughly 11,000 tickets for the Sept. 27 
regular-season finale against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Wrobel and Terry Schmidt had better luck: Each landed eight  
tickets to the opener and eight more for the last game at the 
stadium. Being first in line paid off for Wrobel, who staked his 
spot at the line's front about noon Friday, three hours before 
Schmidt arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to miss out,'' said Wrobel, a junior high  
school's custodian ready to attend his 23rd opening day at Tiger 
Stadium. ``I've been doing it so long, it's in my blood. If I'm not 
here, I'm sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been coming here since I was 4. This is family.''  
</P>
<P>
	Said Schmidt, a Carson City prison's corrections officer:  
``People at work think I'm crazy for doing this. But look at all 
these people here -- these are Tigers fans. We're willing to do what 
we need to do to show support, to show what this team means to us. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just something special about being here for opening  
day, especially this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours spent in line for the ticket-targeting throng produced  
nostalgic nods to better days for the stadium that opened April 20, 
1912 -- the same day Boston's Fenway Park opened -- and for a 
franchise that had its great moments and players. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Kaline, Hank Greenberg, Mickey Lolich and, of course, Ty  
Cobb. Temperamental manager Sparky Anderson kicking dirt on 
umpires. Gangly right-handed hurler Mark ``The Bird'' Fidrych, who 
once groomed the pitching mound's dirt like a proud robin tending a 
nest. Or Hal Newhouser, a Hall of Fame winner of two consecutive 
American League MVP awards in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Kirk Gibson and images of his fist thrust skyward after his  
1984 World Series homer that helped propel the Tigers to the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a lot of people realize exactly what's happening  
this year,'' said Schmidt, alluding to Tiger Stadium's swan song. 
``Unless you're one of these Tigers fans who through the years have 
come here, you really can't appreciate what you have until it's 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers and Detroit developers hope to minimize such loss  
with the new 40,000-seat, $285 million Comerica Park being built in 
downtown Detroit about a mile east of the existing stadium and 
scheduled to be ready for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Schmidt, the existing ballpark was good enough to lure  
him 12 to 15 times each summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this ballpark looks, feels, smells -- there'll never be  
anything like it. They're just kind of taking this and casting it 
aside, like they just want to forget about it,'' he said. ``But 
like they say, I guess, we'll always have the memories.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. GOP Tries To Heal Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California Republicans, reflecting the  
party's national split between moderate and conservative activists, 
struggled Saturday to put the disastrous 1998 elections behind them 
and turned with hope to the flurry of presidential candidates who 
came courting for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day party convention brought to a boil in California  
the acrimony and anxieties that simmer within the GOP across the 
country. The activists were torn along ideological lines, with 
abortion as one wedge. They picked at the scabs of November's 
election defeats, wondering what the results mean for the future of 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	And they were hearing from five Republican presidential  
candidates Saturday without a peep from the man many predict will 
be their standard-bearer in 2000: George W. Bush. The Texas 
governor did not attend the convention, which will draw seven 
presidential hopefuls before it ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our big hope in a time of little hope,'' said Jim  
Morrissey of Anaheim, rummaging through a pile of ``Bush-2000'' 
stickers. State lawmaker Bruce Thompson handed out the Bush 
propaganda, rushing to keep up with demand while volunteers for 
candidates Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes sat on their hands at nearby 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tells you something, doesn't it?'' Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
	It speaks volumes about the desire of Republicans to find a new  
leader in the wake of November's elections. Democrats did 
surprisingly well nationwide, but nowhere better than in 
California, where they picked up the governor's office and retained 
the state Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican spirits sunk even lower when President Clinton  
survived impeachment and his supporters portrayed the national GOP 
as nothing but an anti-Clinton party. 
</P>
<P>
	Even bedrock conservatives like Barbara Alby, a state lawmaker  
from Sacramento, now argue that it is time to remake the party's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters like Republican principles,'' she said. ``They don't  
like Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said party leaders failed to communicate to average voters  
and did not produce results for conservatives, many of whom stayed 
home on Election Day. ``Somebody or something needs to turn them 
on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter the presidential candidates.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona warned Friday night that Republican  
principles are too often overshadowed by ``the politics of 
division.'' It was a subtle reference to abortion -- which McCain 
opposes but would rather not interject into the political debate 
because he believes it is too personal and politically divisive. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he focused his address on the need to restore integrity  
to government and swear off attacks against fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, another White House  
aspirant, said Republicans must spend less time fighting over 
abortion and more time fighting over education. ``Why don't we 
focus on things we agree on?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet abortion, not education, was an element in the infighting at  
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Party Vice Chairman John McGraw would ordinarily ascend to the  
chairmanship with a rubber-stamp vote of the delegates. But his 
vocal opposition to abortion prompted a challenge from a more 
moderate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	And conservative commentator Keyes lectured Republicans who want  
to shrink from the abortion fight: ``If you back away from the 
pro-life plank ... there will be no ground for unity in this 
party,'' he said to loud applause, although many of the GOP leaders 
did not clap. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into Sunday's vote, party leaders pleaded with the  
rank-and-file to set their differences aside. Even some 
conservative lawmakers who have carried anti-abortion legislation 
called for the party to focus on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Grand Old Party clearly remains fractured.  
</P>
<P>
	When McCain finished his address, Ed Hurlbutt of Fresno  
complained that the Vietnam war hero didn't mention abortion. ``It 
makes you wonder,'' he said. ``It suggests to me that Republicans 
don't know how to deal with the issue'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Stuart of Palm Springs said Republicans shouldn't deal with  
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something we should be politicizing,'' the activist  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, Keyes, businessman Forbes, conservative activist Gary  
Bauer and former Vice President Dan Quayle were scheduled to speak 
Saturday. Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., was on Sunday's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Their rush to address this convention is another sign of the  
unprecedented importance of California in 2000, which moved its 
primary from June to Mach 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The move favors whoever is the well-funded front-runner heading  
into the primaries. California politics are enormously expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain believes he has an edge, because he hails from a  
neighboring state. His efforts to curb teen smoking and change 
campaign finance laws, though unpopular with party regulars, are 
received well in California, party pollsters say. 
</P>
<P>
	And both Bush and McCain have had success with Hispanic voters,  
a growing California constituency.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Leader Lyons Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The head of one of the nation's most  
influential black denominations was convicted Saturday of swindling 
millions of dollars from companies seeking to do business with his 
followers. The case stemmed from a suspicious fire and a supposed 
mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the National Baptist  
Convention USA, also was found guilty of grand theft in the 
disappearance of almost $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of 
B'nai B'rith, money intended to rebuild burned black churches in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere along the line, he traded the Good Book for the bank  
book. That's what this case is all about,'' Assistant State 
Attorney Bill Loughery told the jury in closing arguments Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons remains free on bail pending his sentencing hearing, which  
was not scheduled. He faces three to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the convention's executive board of directors said  
the board would likely meet next week to discuss Lyons' conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had this experience before,'' said Stuart Cureton.  
</P>
<P>
	Convention bylaws say that if a president is incapacitated he  
can be replaced by the vice president at large -- which is Cureton. 
The bylaws do not explain what incapacitated means, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A candidate for convention president said Lyons should resign.  
``We have no tolerance for a convicted felon to continue as a 
spiritual leader of the churches,'' said the Rev. W. Franklyn 
Richardson, of Mount Vernon, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping Lyons as its leader, the convention had said he  
stole no funds from them and committed no wrongdoing, attorney 
Grady Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, did not react when the verdict was read and would not  
comment to reporters as he left the courtroom holding hands with 
his wife, Deborah. They were surrounded by supporters and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Grady Irvin said Lyons later went to Bethel  
Metropolitan Baptist Church in St. Petersburg, where he remains 
pastor. They have not yet decided whether to appeal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member jury acquitted Lyons' co-defendant and alleged  
mistress, Bernice Edwards, the convention's public relations 
director, on the racketeering charge, the only count she faced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, 42, sobbed after the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go home to my children,'' she said, biting her  
lip. ``I thank God and I thank my lawyer. ... It's been very hard, 
very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated more than 12 hours after a five-week trial.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began investigating Lyons' finances in July 1997  
after his wife set fire to a $700,000 waterfront house bought by 
her husband and Ms. Edwards. Mrs. Lyons told deputies she found the 
deed in her husband's briefcase and believed he and Ms. Edwards 
were having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyons, later convicted of arson and sentenced to probation,  
since has said she supports her husband and does not believe Ms. 
Edwards was his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, a convicted embezzler from Milwaukee, denied having  
a sexual affair with the minister. Convention aide Bonita 
Henderson, however, told jurors Ms. Edwards bragged of having a 
sexual relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons still faces a federal trial in April on 54 counts which  
include tax evasion, money laundering and extortion. Ms. Edwards 
faces similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Lyons and Ms. Edwards of stealing more than  
$4 million from corporations wanting to sell cemetery products, 
life insurance policies and credit cards to the convention's touted 
8.5 million black members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors called the membership figure a hoax and said the  
convention had closer to 1 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the defendants duped the companies by promising a  
membership mailing list that never existed -- at one point, 
according to testimony, even making up lists from $90 computerized 
telephone directories that led one company to send letters to such 
non-Baptists as a grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and a Catholic 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair then went on lavish spending sprees, buying a diamond  
ring ``the size of a dime,'' the waterfront house, a timeshare 
condominium in Nevada, several luxury cars and expensive clothing, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers attacked prosecutors as acting as ``the moral  
police,'' saying the minister's failed business deals were not 
criminal matters and maintaining that the case actually was about 
religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge denied a request for a mistrial sought Saturday by  
Lyons' attorneys after local television stations received e-mail 
messages from a man who claimed he heard a juror discussing the 
case. The juror denied it.

<HEADLINE> Tug Pulling Grounded Freighter Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Amid a rising tide early today, the  
powerful tug boat Sea Victory attempted to pull the oil-laden bow 
of a grounded cargo ship off the beach and past the continental 
shelf for burial at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the peak of a high tide late Friday, Coast Guard spotters  
reported the bow of the New Carissa had begun to pivot on the sandy 
beach where the ship has spilled 70,000 gallons of fuel oil since 
running aground Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The tug is using an 1,100-yard cable attached to the bow  
section. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews hoped another high tide today would free the bow with help  
from winds and waves generated by an approaching storm, said Phil 
Carroll, spokesman at the salvage command post. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the bow section is off the beach and past two sandbars, it  
will be towed more than 200 miles from shore and sunk in water 
thousands of feet deep by gunfire from a Coast Guard cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Since running aground, the New Carissa has been set on fire with  
explosives and napalm in order to consume as much as possible of 
the 400,000 gallons of fuel originally on board. Afterwards, the 
ship broke in two leaving more than 100,000 gallons of unburned oil 
in bow fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	With water temperatures at the proposed dumping site hovering at  
33 degrees, Bill Milwee, salvage consultant to the ship's Japanese 
owners, said the oil would maintain the consistency of a ``parking 
lot'' and should not leak out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some oil burped out of holes in the bottom of the hull as a  
salvage crew blew air into a cargo hold to remove water. The oil 
produced some tar balls on the beach and a sheen on the water 
extending 200 yards north of the ship. Cleanup crews worked to pick 
up the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	State biologists have found 115 dead birds in the area, and at  
least 48 died from exposure to oil. The ship was grounded as it 
waited out a storm to enter Coos Bay for a load of wood chips.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Hit Hard This Past Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton often uses the image of a  
three-legged stool to illustrate his policies. Knock one leg away 
from his program for Social Security or world peace, and it's sure 
to fall down. 
</P>
<P>
	The stool analogy, which The Wall Street Journal says is all the  
rage in Washington, could travel well to Wall Street. While experts 
will argue the specifics, the stock market also can be seen as 
resting on three legs. 
</P>
<P>
	A trio of low interest rates, low inflation, and a torrent of  
investment dollars from baby boomers have provided a sturdy 
foundation for the most powerful bull market in history. 
</P>
<P>
	But the past week's jump in interest rates, even with a  
considerable improvement on Friday, has threatened the stock 
market's delicate balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates climbed after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
signaled that if the economy doesn't chill on its own, the central 
bank will attempt to cool it by raising borrowing rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman's remarks were followed by reports of very strong  
growth in the economy. In January, factory orders shot up at the 
fastest pace in 14 months and sales of existing homes climbed to an 
all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plunged Thursday, pushing the yield on the 30-year  
Treasury bond to 5.65 percent, the highest level since last August. 
Stocks followed. The Dow Jones industrial average slid as much as 
166 points Thursday before the blue chip index trimmed its loss to 
just 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Commerce Department dropped another bomb by  
reporting that the nation's gross domestic product, the sum of all 
goods and services produced, shot up 6.1 percent in the final three 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, bond investors seized not on that number, but on a  
part of the GDP report showing that consumer prices rose only 1 
percent last year, the smallest increase since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation's no-show sent bond prices rallying Friday, pushing  
the 30-year Treasury yield down to 5.57 percent. But long-term 
rates were still up nearly 1/4 percentage point on the week. 
</P>
<P>
	And stockholders, having already seen the dark side of higher  
rates, couldn't bounce back as easily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow skidded 59.76 points on Friday to close at 9,306.58,  
ending down 33.37 for the week. The blue-chip index now sits 336 
points below its all-time closing high of 9,643.32 set on Jan. 8. 
Its gain for the new year is now just 125.15, or 1.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite dropped 38.79 to 2,288.03 on Friday, but  
still managed to gain 4.43 for the week. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
composite dropped 6.69 to 1,238.33, easing 0.89 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates wobble the stock stool on several fronts.  
By raising borrowing costs, they can discourage the corporate and 
consumer spending that is necessary to keep the economy expanding. 
Left unchecked, that could threaten earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This latest rise in bond yields takes some of the zip out of  
interest-sensitive spending on big-ticket consumer items, as well 
as capital equipment,'' said John Lonski, senior economist at 
Moody's Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But stocks are priced as though spending will continue at a  
breakneck speed, and as though earnings will continue to be robust. 
In fact, notes Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS 
Securities, earnings began slipping in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks might have been able to overcome the weight of higher  
interest rates, if it weren't for the fact that they are so 
expensive,'' Dudack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates also threaten equities by sucking investment  
dollars out of the stock market. Baby boomers, many of whom are in 
their fifties, have already begun shifting assets to less risky 
bonds as they near retirement. That trend could accelerate if 
they're getting a higher yield to do so. So much for the third, 
cash-flow leg of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a number of clients who've been after me in the last  
few weeks, saying I'm too heavy in equities,'' said Robert Stovall, 
president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest rates ``have been responsible for a great deal in  
the runup in earnings and in turn, a great deal of the runup in the 
stock market,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist with First Union 
Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. ``With higher interest 
rates, the stock market will get a little bit choppier, probably a 
little bit weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange's market index fell 0.97  
on Friday to 586.46, down 0.10 for the week. The American Stock 
Exchange's composite index rose 4.82 to 698.29, but was up 5.72 for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of mid-sized companies fell 0.46 to  
392.26 Friday, down 0.04 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the combined market value  
of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, ended the week at $11.29 
trillion, up $10 billion from the previous week.

	MIAMI (AP) -- A 15-year-old student was hospitalized after  
sneaking a handgun past high school security guards and 
accidentally shooting himself while playing with the weapon in 
class, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The student, whose name was not released, suffered wounds to a  
hand and thigh after taking the gun to school in his book bag, 
school officials said. He was listed in good condition. 
</P>

	``We all just have to feel relatively lucky today -- if that's  
the word we can use -- because if that bullet had gone in a 
different direction, it could have killed the student or hurt 
someone else,'' said Henry Fraind, spokesman for Miami-Dade County 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has no metal detectors at entrances.

<HEADLINE> Woman Admits Covering Up Baby Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- A woman has gone straight to the media with  
her story that she and her boyfriend cremated her 14-month-old son 
last fall to cover up for an accidental drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Laura Mjelde, 22, who also has a 4-year-old son, nor her  
boyfriend have been charged with any crimes, and police say they're 
shocked at the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're frankly flabbergasted that they've done this -- that  
they've gone to the media,'' said Penny Bartley, a police 
spokeswoman in this Seattle suburb. ``Nobody has been arrested. The 
victim's mother came forth, and it kind of forced our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case may wind up being prosecuted. Investigators believe  
Christopher Hutton was murdered by the woman's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old man is serving a prison sentence on drug charges  
and for violating probation relating to a robbery conviction. His 
name hasn't been released. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman said in Friday's editions of The News Tribune of  
Tacoma that she left the toddler and his brother with her boyfriend 
for a few days last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher was dead when she returned, and her boyfriend said  
he had drowned in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he walked to the store and left (Christopher) in the  
bathtub,'' the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boyfriend had wanted to bury the child but the mother said  
she thought cremation would be better. The boyfriend burned the 
body, she said, though she doesn't know how because she was too 
upset to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, police were tipped to the boy's disappearance by a  
relative.

<HEADLINE> Leaking Ship's Bow Dragged To Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- The broken bow of a cargo ship that ran  
aground and spilled thousands of gallons of oil was slowly dragged 
through the surf toward open water Saturday on its way to a burial 
in the deep Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the New Carissa ran aground in a storm  
three weeks ago, rough weather actually helped salvage crews, 
helping to dislodge the rusty, charred front portion of the ship 
from the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The tug Sea Victory put 106 tons of pulling power on a  
1,100-yard towline connected to the 420-foot-long bow section, 
making progress so slowly it was barely perceptible to the human 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a spectacular thing,'' said Bill Milwee, salvage  
consultant for the ship's Japanese owners. He figured the section 
moved five feet over a half hour, and it was moved only about 40 
feet before the morning high tide dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The bow section still must be dragged over two sandbars. It will  
take two to three days for the hulk to be towed far enough so it 
can be sunk in 9,000 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, carrying 400,000 gallons of heavy oil to fuel its  
engines, ran aground on Feb. 4 while waiting out a storm to enter 
Coos Bay for a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	It eventually spilled an estimated 70,000 gallons of oil. So  
far, 134 birds have been found dead in the oil spill area, 59 of 
them with oil on them. An additional 87 oiled birds were captured 
for rehabilitation and 14 of them died. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy explosives team blasted open the fuel tanks and set the  
remaining oil on fire with napalm to prevent more from spilling. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire, the ship broke in two, leaving 130,000 gallons  
of unburned oil in bow tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The stern section remains mired deeply in the sand and is  
considered free of oil. Salvagers have said they may leave it 
there.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Wait for Tigers Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers signed left-handed  
pitcher Justin Thompson to a two-year deal and signed reliever Sean 
Runyan to a one-year contract Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is guaranteed $3.6 million, and could earn up to $4.3  
million if incentives are reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract took a little longer than I thought it would,''  
Thompson said. ``I've always felt like a part of this team, but it 
took so long to get done that it made it real frustrating. It made 
me wonder, `How much a part of this team are you?' But now that 
it's done, I'm fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 25, has led Tigers pitchers for the past two seasons  
in innings pitched, strikeouts and complete games. Last year he 
compiled a 11-15 record with a 4.09 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous season he had a 15-11 record, a 3.02 ERA and was an  
All-Star selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan, 24, went 1-4 last year with a 3.58 ERA and one save. He  
led the majors in appearances by a rookie pitcher with 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Runyan's contract were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Timlin's Demeanor Belies Toughness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former Baltimore Orioles closer  
Randy Myers used to wear camouflage outfits, store a hand grenade 
in his locker and slice chunks of meat with a glistening hunting 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's new closer eats doughnuts, dresses casually and  
usually wears an engaging smile. Although Mike Timlin is an 
imposing 6-foot-4, he looks nothing like the type of pitcher who 
would snap an inside pitch at a batter's knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great guy in here, but that's definitely misleading,''  
teammate Heathcliff Slocumb said Saturday. ``He's pretty fearless. 
When you're in the batting box and see a 94-mph sinker on your 
hands, that's kind of hard to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Myers left Baltimore for the Toronto Blue Jays, the  
Orioles entered spring training last season without a clear-cut 
closer. Although Armando Benitez eventually landed the job, his 
volatile temperament often rendered him ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	So Baltimore went after Timlin, 33, who in November was handed a  
four-year contract and the closing job. 
</P>
<P>
	Timlin had 19 saves with the Seattle Mariners last season, going  
18-for-19 after the All-Star break. He's not a power pitcher, but 
the right-hander's sinkerball should serve him well within cozy 
Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly why he's here,'' said Slocumb, who played with  
Timlin in Seattle. ``We used to walk across the field and look at 
Baltimore practicing and we'd say, `Can you imagine how much 
success we'd have if we had this infield behind us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Orioles very well might have wondered how they would  
have fared last year with Timlin, 1-0 with seven saves in his final 
eight appearances. He converted his final 14 save opportunities 
from Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big, strong imposing guy who throws groundballs and  
throws very hard,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``I like his size and 
his makeup. There's nothing set in granite but death and taxes, but 
we brought him here to be our closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timlin made his mark in the majors when he saved 31 games for  
the 1996 Blue Jays. But he lost the job after blowing two saves in 
four tries the following year, and was traded to Seattle in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd proven what I needed to do that one year, but  
apparently the Blue Jays didn't see it that way,'' Timlin said. 
``Everybody in the world was shocked, including myself, but what 
are you going to do? I guess they wanted me to get fired up and 
scream, `This is my job!' But I don't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when he's on the mound, Timlin makes an effort to keep his  
emotions in check. It's a valuable tool that Benitez, now a member 
of the New York Mets, rarely utilized during an inconsistent 1998 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	That opened the door for Timlin, who spurned a modest offer from  
the Mariners in favor of testing a booming, player-friendly free 
agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them, `I want to do the best for me because I've been  
doing the best for everybody else for five or six years.' It sounds 
selfish, but people on the other side of this game take care of 
themselves, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners reduced their original offer after signing free  
agent closer Jose Mesa, so Timlin signed with Baltimore, one of 
several teams that expressed interest but the only one that 
guaranteed him the closing job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a better deal. It's nice to know that it's my job from  
Day One,'' Timlin said. ``It allows me to relax and little more, to 
just go out and get myself physically and mentally ready for 
another season.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Meets ToCconsider Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Amid surprising media disinterest,  
an International Olympic Committee panel began a two-day meeting 
Saturday to debate the fate of 13 members embroiled in the Salt 
Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In stark contrast to the first round of expulsions and warnings  
last month, which drew hundreds of frenzied reporters, 
necessitating high surveillance and tight security, the IOC 
headquarters were deserted Saturday. Only an occasional jogger or 
strolling family disturbed the peace of the few guards posted 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry panel, headed by IOC vice president Richard Pound of  
Canada, officially began discussions behind closed doors at 
midafternoon. Several members arrived early in the morning and 
remained holed-up all day and into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks will continue through Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The ad hoc committee has been assigned to review evidence and  
hear from IOC members wanting to defend themselves. It will then 
recommend expulsion or other action to the IOC executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's six-man investigative panel was appointed last December,  
after initial word that Salt Lake bidders gave scholarships to the 
families of IOC members during the city's successful quest for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Salt Lake ethics panel reported that 24 IOC  
members -- a fifth of the membership -- or their families benefited 
from more than $1.2 million in cash, travel, medical care and other 
improper inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members resigned or were expelled last month in the  
first phase of Pound's investigation, and another was given a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend meeting probably will decide the future of three  
members who remained under investigation after the initial round of 
the inquiry, and will look at the cases of 10 others mentioned in 
the Salt Lake City's ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, an IOC member from Australia linked to lavish travel  
and vacations allegedly paid for by Salt Lake bidders, on Saturday 
rested up in the posh Lausanne Palace hotel, awaiting his chance to 
defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is one of the most influential sports officials in the  
host country of the 2000 Olympics. He has denied any wrongdoing, 
and threatened court action against the Salt Lake investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles declined comment, but said he would face the panel  
``sometime Sunday,'' and hoped to be able to return Australia the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking to anyone today and I don't want to say  
anything now,'' Coles told The Associated Press. ``I'll be meeting 
(with the commission) sometime tomorrow and hopefully, if it's 
early enough, I'll fly home afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another prominent case on the table is that of Kim Un-yong, the  
powerful executive board member from South Korea and president of 
the confederation of Olympic sports bodies. He is accused of using 
his influence to get lucrative jobs in television and entertainment 
for his children. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also is expected to make a preliminary examination of  
files from about a dozen cities that bid for the Olympics between 
1996 and 2004. The IOC had asked the cities to give details of any 
wrongdoing by IOC members during their bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound has said that further information will probably be needed.

<HEADLINE> Calif. GOP Tries To Heal Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California Republicans, reflecting the  
party's national split between moderate and conservative activists, 
struggled Saturday to put the disastrous 1998 elections behind them 
and turned with hope to the flurry of presidential candidates who 
came courting for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day party convention brought to a boil in California  
the acrimony and anxieties that simmer within the GOP across the 
country. The activists were torn along ideological lines, with 
abortion as one wedge. They picked at the scabs of November's 
election defeats, wondering what the results mean for the future of 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	And they were hearing from five Republican presidential  
candidates Saturday without a peep from the man many predict will 
be their standard-bearer in 2000: George W. Bush. The Texas 
governor did not attend the convention, which will draw seven 
presidential hopefuls before it ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our big hope in a time of little hope,'' said Jim  
Morrissey of Anaheim, rummaging through a pile of ``Bush-2000'' 
stickers at a popular convention display table. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz was all Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Lou Sheldon, an influential California conservative who  
has been aligned with likely candidate Steve Forbes, has suddenly 
decided to leave his options open. Sheldon said Saturday he will 
soon visit Bush in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just saying that I'm tired of losing,'' Sheldon said. ``I  
want to make sure we get somebody who can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the talk of Bush, a candidate few here know much about,  
speaks volumes about the desire of Republicans to find a new leader 
in the wake of November's elections. Democrats did surprisingly 
well nationwide, but nowhere better than in California, where they 
picked up the governor's office and retained the state Senate and 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican spirits sunk even lower when President Clinton  
survived impeachment and his supporters portrayed the national GOP 
as nothing but an anti-Clinton party. 
</P>
<P>
	Even bedrock conservatives like Barbara Alby, a state lawmaker  
from Sacramento, now argue that it is time to remake the party's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters like Republican principles,'' she said. ``They don't  
like Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said party leaders failed to communicate to average voters  
and did not produce results for conservatives, many of whom stayed 
home on Election Day. ``Somebody or something needs to turn them 
on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter the presidential candidates.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona warned Friday night that Republican  
principles are too often overshadowed by ``the politics of 
division.'' It was a subtle reference to abortion -- which McCain 
opposes but would rather not interject into the political debate 
because he believes it is too personal and politically divisive. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he focused his address on the need to restore integrity  
to government and swear off attacks against fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, another White House  
aspirant, said Republicans must spend less time fighting over 
abortion and more time fighting over education. ``Why don't we 
focus on things we agree on?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet abortion, not education, was an element in the infighting at  
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Party Vice Chairman John McGraw would ordinarily ascend to the  
chairmanship with a rubber-stamp vote of the delegates. But his 
vocal opposition to abortion prompted a challenge from a more 
moderate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	And conservative commentator Alan Keyes lectured Republicans who  
want to shrink from the abortion fight: ``If you back away from the 
pro-life plank ... there will be no ground for unity in this 
party,'' he said to loud applause, although many of the GOP leaders 
did not clap. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, in a subtle criticism of Bush's ``compassionate  
conservatism'' slogan, told the delegates: ``Some say we should be 
the party of compassion. I always thought we were. The first order 
of compassion (is) the protection of the unborn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle said it is the congressional  
Republicans' refusal to pass across-the-board tax cuts, not the 
issue of abortion, that is dividing the party. Quayle promised ``no 
more timid, themeless, issueless, `me-too' campaigns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Saturday's speakers, conservative activist Gary Bauer and  
Keyes, said President Clinton should respond to allegations by an 
Arkansas woman who said she was sexually assaulted by Clinton 21 
years ago in Little Rock hotel room while he was Arkansas attorney 
general. ``He owes us a straight account of what happened in that 
room,'' Bauer told a crowd of more than 1,000 party activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., was on Sunday's agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	Heading into Sunday's vote, party leaders pleaded with the  
rank-and-file to set their differences aside. Even some 
conservative lawmakers who have carried anti-abortion legislation 
called for the party to focus on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Grand Old Party clearly remains fractured.  
</P>
<P>
	When McCain finished his address, Ed Hurlbutt of Fresno  
complained that the Vietnam war hero didn't mention abortion. ``It 
makes you wonder,'' he said. ``It suggests to me that Republicans 
don't know how to deal with the issue'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Stuart of Palm Springs said Republicans shouldn't deal with  
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something we should be politicizing,'' the activist  
said.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Sues Drug Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is suing the distributor of a pain  
reliever, contending the company made false claims that he endorses 
the product and credits its use for enabling him to break the home 
run record last season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's suit is against People First Inc., distributor of The  
Freedom Formula. Its brochure touts the product as an all-natural 
pain reliever derived from rain forest plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The brochure even has a photo of McGwire holding a bottle of the  
product. But he has never endorsed it, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Although former St. Louis Cardinals hitting coach Dave Parker is  
not a defendant, he has a role in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, who promotes The Freedom Formula, distributed the  
product to McGwire and several teammates last season, the suit 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point last year in the Cardinals clubhouse, Parker asked  
McGwire to pose for a photograph of him holding a bottle of The 
Freedom Formula. 
</P>
<P>
	As a courtesy to Parker, McGwire posed for the picture but never  
consented to its use ``for any commercial purpose,'' the suit 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego-based People First got the photo from Parker, the suit  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's lawyer, Michael Kahn, said Friday the dispute with  
People First has nothing to do with Parker's departure as a 
Cardinals coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a dispute between Mark and Dave,'' Kahn said.  
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed a week ago, was made public Friday. In the week  
the suit was under court seal, the lawyers tried without success to 
settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's suit alleges that The Freedom Formula brochure makes  
several assertions without his consent. Among them: that he takes 
the product ``religiously''; that he has a dozen bottles of it ``in 
his locker so that he won't run out before the end of the season''; 
and that after he started taking the product he ``got immediate 
results, and the rest -- as they say -- is history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks a court order awarding McGwire People First's  
profits from the unauthorized use of his name and destruction of 
all material bearing the slugger's name and images. 
</P>
<P>
	No date for a court hearing was set.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Unlikely To Rule on Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark McGwire doesn't have to worry about baseball taking away  
his andro anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	A baseball-commissioned Harvard study on androstenedione, which  
is not expected to be published until at least midseason, will not 
be enough to outlaw it from the game, even if it shows that andro 
raises testosterone levels, according to the No. 2 official of the 
players association. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, whose agreement is needed for any ban, want much  
stronger proof that andro enhances performance before they agree to 
a ban and random testing to enforce it, said Gene Orza, the union's 
associate general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while,'' Orza said. ``No one should  
expect that somehow this study at Harvard is going to definitively 
resolve the question that has to be answered, which is: Does the 
use of a perfectly legal substance give a player a competitive 
advantage? If it doesn't, we don't care what the Olympics thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of andro, which is sold over-the-counter at nutrition  
stores and on the Internet, is not an issue baseball is even 
considering at the moment, despite numerous warnings from steroid 
experts about the hazards of testosterone-boosting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assume the drug is safe,'' Orza said. ``The United States  
government chooses not to regulate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard study by endocrinologist Joel Finkelstein and fellow  
researcher Benjamin Leder is just phase one of baseball's inquiry 
into the effects of andro, Orza said. That study is designed to 
determine simply whether andro converts in the body to 
testosterone, as it is purported to do by manufacturers, and, if 
so, to what degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get that question answered,'' Orza said, ``the next  
question we will decide is: To what degree and what extent does 
androstenedione contribute to muscle mass in the body? 
</P>
<P>
	``The third question is going to be: Does muscle mass in the  
body necessarily constitute a performance-enhancing opportunity for 
players?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separate studies on andro's effect on muscle mass or performance  
enhancement could take months, if not years, and baseball has set 
no deadline on when a decision would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put a timetable on it,'' Orza said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The players share our internal view, which is that nobody  
really knows anything about androstenedione, and until we do, we're 
going to reserve judgment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if andro is proven to boost testosterone and bulk up  
muscles, that would not necessarily mean players would agree that 
it enhances performance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four years ago, I used to have discussions with general  
managers about how weight training was bad for baseball players,'' 
Orza said. ``The best, most competitive baseball players were seen 
as those guys who stayed sinewy and lithe, and the ones with more 
mass were winding up on the disabled list. Now, all of a sudden 
because of the current fashion, no one talks about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's record 70 homers last season focused attention on his  
bulging muscles, which he said benefited from using andro for more 
than a year to enhance his weightlifting and his recovery between 
workouts. When he arrived at spring training for the St. Louis 
Cardinals this week, he said he's still using andro. 
</P>
<P>
	Classified as a dietary supplement, andro is permitted in  
baseball, but is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL, and the 
men's and women's tennis tours. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's revelation that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues, however, will not enter into the union's decision  
about whether to agree on a ban of andro, Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if andro is determined to give some players a competitive  
advantage over others, then the union would consider a ban and, for 
the first time, random testing. At the moment, baseball does not 
have a random drug testing program, while the Olympics, the NFL and 
the tennis tours do. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we opposed random drug testing, we were opposing the  
clubs' request to test for substances that were illegal, and our 
objection to that was a philosophical one,'' Orza said. ``We don't 
believe that in America people are required to give evidence of 
wrongdoing to their employers. Testing for illegal drugs and 
testing for performance-enhancing drugs are quite different.''

<HEADLINE> Trump Proposes N.Y. Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Donald Trump gets his way, cars could soon be  
hitting speeds of nearly 200 mph in one Long Island community. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino impresario and real estate mogul has bid $55 million  
to develop a 2,900-acre site on eastern Long Island for a NASCAR 
superspeedway, a Riverhead town official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump's plan also calls for a golf resort and industrial park on  
the site, which once housed an aircraft test flight facility for 
defense contractor Grumman, said Andrea Lohneiss, director of the 
Riverhead Community Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Navy once owned the Suffolk County property, but turned  
it over to Riverhead officials last September. Grumman, now known 
as Northrup-Grumman, no longer uses the site, located about 75 
miles east of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	A hangar on the property currently houses the reconstructed  
remains of TWA Flight 800, which crashed off Long Island in 1996. 
No decision has been made on whether the Boeing 747 will remain 
there or be moved to another location, Lohneiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	A NASCAR spokesman said Saturday he had not heard about Trump's  
proposal, but noted ``New York is a very attractive market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, NASCAR attracted 11 million people to its tracks and  
252 million television viewers. It has been called America's 
fastest-growing sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Sullivan, NASCAR's manager of communications, warned that  
the organization wants to be careful about where and how it 
expands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to oversaturate a market,'' he said, noting that  
NASCAR already holds a race in Watkins Glen in upstate New York, 
and two each at Pocono International Raceway in Pennsylvania and 
Dover Downs International Speedway in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Pocono, about 100 miles from Manhattan, is the closet of those  
tracks to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	During it's phenomenal growth period this decade, NASCAR has  
completed its transformation to national status from its roots as a 
Southeast regional sport. Several cities from New England to 
Southern California have been awarded races in NASCAR's elite 
Winston Cup division, and several new tracks are being built or are 
in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR races draw crowds as large as 300,000 in Indianapolis,  
and virtually all of the 34 Winston Cup races are sellouts. Still, 
NASCAR, has been conservative about adding races. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main concern is smart growth,'' Sullivan said. ``We don't  
just add a race to our schedule without a good reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of other bidders on the property also have expressed  
interest in developing a racetrack in Riverhead, Lohneiss said. She 
said the town board appears receptive to the idea, but will take a 
number of factors into consideration before giving final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be concerned about noise, traffic and other  
things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the requirements the town has already made is that part  
of the property be used for industrial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to the town that we try to recreate some  
of the industrial high-skill jobs that were lost when Grumman 
left,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Town officials are formulating a deadline for what Lohneiss  
called the developers' ``last and best offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on the future of the property should be made within  
months, and construction could begin ``sometime in 1999,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Trump's representatives seeking comment were not  
returned Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Stars in Lakers' Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Nine months off the basketball court  
hasn't done a thing to dull Dennis Rodman's rebounding instincts. 
His ability to snag loose balls with the zeal of a player half his 
age had the Los Angeles Lakers marveling at their 37-year-old 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't going to be doing that at 37,'' said 26-year-old  
Shaquille O'Neal. ``I can't say enough about how impressed I am. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had 11 rebounds and six assists playing 26 minutes off  
the bench in his season debut Friday night as the Lakers beat the 
Clippers 99-83. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little shy at the beginning because I didn't want to  
mess up, but when I stepped on the court it all just came back to 
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Rodman could describe himself as shy. He certainly didn't  
look it, with tattoos snaking down his limbs and his famous hair 
dyed a muted mix of yellow, purple and black. He would don the 
multiple nose rings and earrings after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt kind of awkward,'' said Rodman, who helped the Chicago  
Bulls win a sixth NBA title last spring. ``In a weird way, I really 
didn't want to put on a Lakers uniform because I've been on three 
different teams and have been a winner on all three. Coming to the 
Lakers is just a different feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of 17,505 put out a welcome vibe as soon as the  
part-time pro wrestler stepped on the Forum floor for warmups. 
Three female fans donned multi-colored wigs in honor of Rodman's 
ever-changing hair color. The fans cheered loudly for each rebound 
he hauled down, arms flailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they love a person that goes out there and works, that  
is not going out there ... to be flashy,'' he said. ``I think they 
really relate to me in that way. I like to think that the people in 
Los Angeles and the state of California have accepted me for who I 
am, and I am just going to go out there and work every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he kept the Lakers dangling for weeks while deciding  
whether to play this season, Rodman easily won them over. 
Especially O'Neal, who wasn't so friendly last spring when he and 
Rodman mocked each other publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a lot of loose balls. That's what I've been looking  
for, a player like that,'' O'Neal said. ``You really don't know how 
good people are until you get a chance to play with them. He's 
pretty good and he's pretty smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's career in Los Angeles began by tipping a loose ball to  
O'Neal for a monster dunk six minutes into the game. Although the 
Lakers were outrebounded by the Clippers, 48-46, no one blamed 
Rodman. Instead, his teammates likened him to a genius. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought a lot of energy and intensity to the game,'' Kobe  
Bryant said. ``Something that I think everyone underestimates is 
his ability to get the ball out after the rebound, his long passes. 
He got us a lot of easy hoops and that's what we're looking for. He 
is so smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal likes the new arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he's my teammate, I've listened to him talk and we've  
had conversations,'' the center said. ``He has a lot of knowledge 
about the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman heaved a couple of 70-foot outlet passes to his teammates  
for baskets, but new coach Kurt Rambis liked Rodman's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had virtually no work with him, but he's already  
communicating. He talks,'' said Rambis, announced as the 
replacement for Del Harris just 2 1/2 hours before tipoff. ``We have 
to pick it up on the defensive end, and that's been his specialty, 
along with rebounding. We're really counting on him to pull 
everybody along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman pulled in the Hollywood crowd, including director Penny  
Marshall, Oscar-nominated actor Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Richard 
Crenna, singer-producer Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds and Dyan 
Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's wife, actress Carmen Electra, soaked up the applause  
when fans spotted her seated several rows above the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a spark for this team, and I'm glad he's  
here,'' O'Neal said.

<HEADLINE> Gaetti Still Going Strong at 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Gary Gaetti's view was unique, the most  
enthralling perspective of any player as Mark McGwire and Sammy 
Sosa waged their historic home run derby last season. 
</P>
<P>
	First, he wore the Cardinals' red, watching McGwire up close for  
the first 4 1/2 months. Released by St. Louis, he was picked up by the 
Cubs and spent the final six weeks in the same clubhouse with Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was amazing, way amazing,'' Gaetti, the Cubs' 40-year-old  
third baseman, said this week. ``Just way awesome. Every time Mark 
went up to the plate, you thought he would hit a home run, and then 
I came over here and it's the same way with Sammy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not Babe Ruth and Roger Maris anymore, it's McGwire and  
Sosa. I was alive to see that. Right now what I say probably 
doesn't mean that much, but in a few years when somebody else is 
chasing the record, they're going to ask me `Well, what was it like 
then?' I'll have an answer.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For the near future, there's a matter of Gaetti answering  
questions about his age and taking some kidding about it as, well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not an old team -- well, Gaetti is old,'' teammate Mark  
Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti's age didn't affect his performance over the final six  
weeks. He was one of the keys to the Cubs' playoff run, hitting 
eight homers and driving in 27 runs with a .320 average in 37 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago signed him Aug. 19 -- his 40th birthday.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of my favorite athletes of all time was George Blanda,''  
Gaetti said of the quarterback who played until he was 48. ``He 
played a long time and was very successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to factor in all those things, not just age, but  
whether you play effectively and contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti, a member of the Minnesota Twins' 1987 World Series  
winner, has always been a steady fielder with good power, and has 
351 career homers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his biggest homers came against the San Francisco Giants  
in Chicago's one-game playoff victory for the wild card last 
September, a win that sent the Cubs into the playoffs for the first 
time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I feel good. Your body changes over the years,''  
Gaetti said, adding he doesn't think it's time to talk or think 
retirement. ``I've talked to different people and they say, `Well, 
you're just going to know when it's time.' I'm not there yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti's performance last season forced the Cubs to shuffle the  
left side of their infield, moving Jose Hernandez to shortstop in 
place of the injured and struggling Jeff Blauser and starting 
Gaetti at third. 
</P>
<P>
	Will he stay as the starter?  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is etched in stone, obviously the manager wants to put  
the best team on the field and there a lot of things to consider,'' 
Gaetti said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at number of games, but if we could get Gary  
around 400-to-450 at-bats, that would be pretty good,'' manager Jim 
Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaetti batted .265 with 11 homers and 43 RBIs for St. Louis  
before he was released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was actually playing pretty good for the Cardinals, but as a  
team it was just not happening,'' Gaetti said. ``I was able to get 
in a place for me that was better than any other place I could have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in Wrigley is just one of those places were I see the  
ball good, and I feel good there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason Gaetti wanted to return to Chicago this  
season, agreeing to a one-year, $2 million deal. Another, he said, 
was a bond he felt with many of his veteran teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Hitting coach) Jeff Pentland said something to me when I  
asked what I could look forward to. He said, `Listen, we're not 
trying to reinvent the game.' And I like that attitude,'' Gaetti 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Stars in Lakers' Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Nine months off the basketball court  
hasn't done a thing to dull Dennis Rodman's rebounding instincts. 
His ability to snag loose balls with the zeal of a player half his 
age had the Los Angeles Lakers marveling at their 37-year-old 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't going to be doing that at 37,'' said 26-year-old  
Shaquille O'Neal. ``I can't say enough about how impressed I am. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had 11 rebounds and six assists playing 26 minutes off  
the bench in his season debut Friday night as the Lakers beat the 
Clippers 99-83. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little shy at the beginning because I didn't want to  
mess up, but when I stepped on the court it all just came back to 
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Rodman could describe himself as shy. He certainly didn't  
look it, with tattoos snaking down his limbs and his famous hair 
dyed a muted mix of yellow, purple and black. He would don the 
multiple nose rings and earrings after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt kind of awkward,'' said Rodman, who helped the Chicago  
Bulls win a sixth NBA title last spring. ``In a weird way, I really 
didn't want to put on a Lakers uniform because I've been on three 
different teams and have been a winner on all three. Coming to the 
Lakers is just a different feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of 17,505 put out a welcome vibe as soon as the  
part-time pro wrestler stepped on the Forum floor for warmups. 
Three female fans donned multi-colored wigs in honor of Rodman's 
ever-changing hair color. The fans cheered loudly for each rebound 
he hauled down, arms flailing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they love a person that goes out there and works, that  
is not going out there ... to be flashy,'' he said. ``I think they 
really relate to me in that way. I like to think that the people in 
Los Angeles and the state of California have accepted me for who I 
am, and I am just going to go out there and work every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he kept the Lakers dangling for weeks while deciding  
whether to play this season, Rodman easily won them over. 
Especially O'Neal, who wasn't so friendly last spring when he and 
Rodman mocked each other publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a lot of loose balls. That's what I've been looking  
for, a player like that,'' O'Neal said. ``You really don't know how 
good people are until you get a chance to play with them. He's 
pretty good and he's pretty smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's career in Los Angeles began by tipping a loose ball to  
O'Neal for a monster dunk six minutes into the game. Although the 
Lakers were outrebounded by the Clippers, 48-46, no one blamed 
Rodman. Instead, his teammates likened him to a genius. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought a lot of energy and intensity to the game,'' Kobe  
Bryant said. ``Something that I think everyone underestimates is 
his ability to get the ball out after the rebound, his long passes. 
He got us a lot of easy hoops and that's what we're looking for. He 
is so smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal likes the new arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he's my teammate, I've listened to him talk and we've  
had conversations,'' the center said. ``He has a lot of knowledge 
about the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman heaved a couple of 70-foot outlet passes to his teammates  
for baskets, but new coach Kurt Rambis liked Rodman's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had virtually no work with him, but he's already  
communicating. He talks,'' said Rambis, announced as the 
replacement for Del Harris just 2 1/2 hours before tipoff. ``We have 
to pick it up on the defensive end, and that's been his specialty, 
along with rebounding. We're really counting on him to pull 
everybody along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman pulled in the Hollywood crowd, including director Penny  
Marshall, Oscar-nominated actor Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Richard 
Crenna, singer-producer Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds and Dyan 
Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's wife, actress Carmen Electra, soaked up the applause  
when fans spotted her seated several rows above the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a spark for this team, and I'm glad he's  
here,'' O'Neal said.

                           *Charles Bates    	
</P>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Bates, a former FBI agent  
who led the hunt for kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst and 
supervised the initial stages of the Watergate investigation, died 
Thursday of a stroke. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates also led the investigation into the 1976 kidnapping of 26  
Chowchilla children and their school bus driver in the San Joaquin 
Valley. The victims escaped without injury, and three men were 
arrested and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the FBI in 1941 and worked for the bureau at various  
times in Omaha, Buffalo, Newark, Washington D.C., and Cleveland. He 
retired in 1977. 

</P>
<P>
                         *John L. Goldwater    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John L. Goldwater, creator of the syndicated  
comic character Archie, died Friday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwater grew up in East Harlem as an orphan and, as a  
teen-ager, left to travel across the country, working odd jobs as 
he went. He returned to New York several years later and worked 
loading magazines at the docks before creating the Archie character 
in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from being a ``superhero,'' Archie is an average teen-ager  
with a penchant for getting into trouble. The red-haired character 
was an instant success and remained popular decades after his first 
appearance in print. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s, Archie made his TV debut. In 1973, Goldwater  
wrote ``Americana in Four Colors.'' ``Archie: To Riverdale and Back 
Again,'' a television movie based on the Archie characters, was 
broadcast on NBC in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwater ran Archie Comic Publications until his retirement in  
1983. The Archie comic books are now published in over 35 
countries. Goldwater also founded the Comics Magazine Association 
of America and served as its president for 25 years. He was also a 
national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League.

                           *Jose Quintero    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony Award-winning theater director Jose  
Quintero, whose landmark productions of Eugene O'Neill dramas 
renewed interest in one of America's greatest playwrights, died 
Friday of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero, who directed more than a dozen major productions of  
works by O'Neill, won two Tonys, for a production of ``Long Day's 
Journey into Night'' and for directing ``A Moon for the 
Misbegotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero was also a founder of Circle in the Square, a small  
Greenwich Village theater credited with energizing the off-Broadway 
movement after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked with Jason Robards, Colleen Dewhurst, George C. Scott  
and Geraldine Page during his nearly 50 years in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his 1952 revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and  
Smoke,'' that first brought him and Circle in the Square attention. 
In 1956, he directed the original Broadway production of ``A Long 
Day's Journey into Night,'' which is generally considered to be his 
finest work. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero and Robards joined forces on several other major  
O'Neill revivals on Broadway, including ``Hughie'' (1964); ``A Moon 
for the Misbegotten'' (1973); and ``A Touch of the Poet'' (1977). 
Robards and Dewhurst starred as the parents in a Quintero-directed 
Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed one film, ``The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone'' (1961),  
based on a Tennessee Williams novella.

</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sol Schoenbach, former principal bassoonist  
of the Philadelphia Orchestra and director of Settlement Music 
School, died Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenbach, born in New York's Bronx borough, began his career  
at age 5 playing the piano. At 10, he played the bassoon in a 
Harlem children's orchestra. At 17, he played in the CBS orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenbach took over Settlement at a time when the music school  
was near bankruptcy and down to fewer than 700 students. When he 
left in 1981, 24 years later, enrollment was up to 3,000. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Glenn Seaborg    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Glenn Seaborg, the Nobel Prize-winning  
chemist who discovered 10 atomic elements including plutonium and 
one that now bears his name, died Thursday night. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg, who worked on the Manhattan Project that unleashed the  
atomic bomb during World War II, served as chairman of the Atomic 
Energy Commission, forerunner to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
from 1961-1971. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with  
the late Edwin McMillan for research into the transuranium 
elements, Seaborg received the National Medal of Science in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``seaborgium'' was officially accepted as the name for  
element 106 in August 1997, it was the first time an element had 
ever been named for a living person.

<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- David H. Smith, who co-developed a  
vaccine that has almost eradicated bacterial meningitis in the 
United States, died Tuesday of malignant melanoma, a skin cancer. 
He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and co-inventor Porter Anderson began developing the  
vaccine while both worked at the University of Rochester. After the 
vaccine hit the market, cases of Haemophilus influenzae Type B 
infections plummeted nationwide from 20,000 in 1987 to 81 in 1997, 
federal statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith formed Praxis Biologics, a company spun off from the  
University of Rochester in 1983. He eventually sold it for $232 
million, and put much of his wealth from the vaccine into a 
foundation that funds conservation and scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in  
Boston in the late 1960s to 1976, and chairman of pediatrics at the 
University of Rochester from 1976 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Anderson were awarded the prestigious Lasker Clinical  
Medical Research Award in 1996 for their work on the vaccine. The 
same year, Smith received the Pasteur Award from the World Health 
Organization.

	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Jeff Terry, an Episcopal Church bishop was  
the spiritual leader of more than 6,000 families in eastern 
Washington and northern Idaho, died Friday from complications 
following a heart transplant. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry had been hospitalized since late September. Until the  
transplant on Jan. 7, he directed the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane 
from his room. 
</P>
<P>
	He presided over his last communion service on Christmas Day,  
around a dinner table with his wife and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry had suffered from cardiomyopathy, an enlargement and  
weakening of the heart, and had waited more than two years for his 
new heart.

<HEADLINE> Movie Tickets Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Moviegoers across the country were hit this  
weekend with increased ticket prices, and the reviews were far from 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Loews, Cineplex Odeon and Sony theaters in 22 states hiked  
ticket prices Friday by 4 to 8 percent, raising the average ticket 
price per adult to between $7.50 and $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manhattan, ticket prices hit $9.50 -- the highest in the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Loews said the price hike was a result of higher operating  
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In comparison to the cost of other entertainment ticket  
prices, moviegoing is still the most economical entertainment 
option,'' Loews said in a statement released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everybody agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nine-fifty? That's insane,'' said Sean Fennick, a 23-year-old  
salesman from New York. ``I'll go get a video and watch it at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price increase is the fourth in less than five years in the  
New York area.

<HEADLINE> Hartwig Sets U.S. Pole Vault Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Jeff Hartwig, a snake breeder, slithered over the  
pole vault bar at 19 feet, 5 inches, breaking his American indoor 
record Saturday in the USA Championships, in which sprinter Maurice 
Greene, high jumper Charles Austin and shot putter John Godina were 
stunning upset victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, who raises boa constrictors and pythons at his home in  
Jonesboro, Ark., for sale to pet stores, erased the mark of 19-4 3/4 
he set last month at Reno, Nev. He then missed three times at 
19-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohsaan Griffin set an American record in winning the mens' 200  
meters in 20.32 seconds, lowering the mark of 20.40 shared by 1997 
world champion Kevin Little and Jeff Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig won a competition in which four vaulters cleared 19 feet  
-- a rare occurrence in a U.S. indoor meet. The others were Nick 
Hysong (19-2 1/4) and Lawrence Johnson and Russ Buller (19-0 1/4 each). 
</P>
<P>
	In winning his first national indoor title, Hartwig credited  
much of his success to Earl Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he teaches pole vaulting, his philosophy is simple,''  
Hartwig said. ``Once you reach a certain level, you feel you can 
retain consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 2 in the world last year, when he established the  
American outdoor record of 19-8 1/4, Hartwig was brilliantly 
consistent. He cleared 19 feet in 22 meets, surpassing the record 
of 20 held by Sergei Bubka, the world indoor and outdoor 
record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Hartwig's performance Saturday was not the best by an  
American indoors. Billy Olson soared 19-5 1/2 in 1986 in East 
Rutherford, N.J., but the mark was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin, the 1996 NCAA champion from LSU, and Little fought a  
tenacious battle over the final 100 meters, before Griffin edged in 
front at the finish. Little was runner-up at 20.41. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... broke the record, although I didn't intend to,'' Griffin  
said. ``It was a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world's top-ranked sprinter, finished second in the  
60-meter dash, while Austin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and 
Godina, the world's No. 1 shot putter, were third in their 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene missed his world record by .01 second in winning his  
semifinal heat in 6.40 seconds, the fastest ever in the United 
States, and appeared poised to break the mark of 6.39 he set at 
Madrid, Spain, last year in the final. But a terrible start, in 
which he was last out of the blocks, cost him the record and the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harden, last year's first-place finisher who later was  
disqualified after testing positive for ephedrine and suspended for 
three months, beat Greene in 6.44. Greene rallied to finish second 
at 6.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he slightly injured his left hamstring during the  
semifinals but decided to run the final, perhaps cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd not press at the start,'' he said. ``I thought  
I'd run on guts and see what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the 1996 Olympic champion and 1997 world indoor  
champion, cleared only 7-3 in tying for third, behind little-known 
Henry Patterson and Stephen Smith. Both Patterson, the silver 
medalist in the 1994 World Junior Championships and a former 
Mid-American Conference champion while at Toledo, and Smith cleared 
7-6 1/2, but Patterson was the winner on fewer misses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been around a while, but I haven't done anything,  
except for today,'' Patterson said after jumping his career best. 
``I came here and told myself that I was focused and ready to 
compete and I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another major surprise was the failure of Godina to win the shot  
put for the fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina was ranked No. 1 in the world the past two years, won the  
silver medal in the 1996 Olympics, won the past two world outdoor 
titles, was unbeaten in 17 meets last year, when his worst winning 
throw was 69-7, and was undefeated in 24 meets since July 1997. In 
addition, he was voted USA Track &AMP; Field's male athlete of the year 
for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he threw only 67-6 3/4, finishing behind Andy Bloom,  
with a career-best 68-3 3/4, and C.J. Hunter, who reached 67-7 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I was ready earlier,'' said Godina, who had  
competed only once before the nationals. ``I'm a month or two 
behind last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's wife, Marion Jones, the world's leading sprinter, said  
her husband, who injured his right shoulder on his final attempt, 
would not go to Maebashi, Japan, for next weekend's World Indoor 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That could put Godina on the team.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gail Devers, inactive from last May until this month  
because of an Achilles tendon injury, won her fourth consecutive 
race, taking the women's 60 in 7.04. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy that I'm healthy,'' said Devers, the two-time world  
indoor champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist at 100 meters. 
``Last year sitting around in a cast while everyone else was 
running was the hardest thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Taylor, a junior at Georgia Tech and the 1998 NCAA  
400-meter hurdles champion, outkicked Milt Campbell to win the 
men's 400 in 45.50, fastest in the world this year. Taylor, 
however, will not make the trip to the World Championships. 
Instead, he will stay home and study. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell finished second at 45.60, while Steve Lewis, the 1988  
Olympic gold medalist and 1992 silver medalist, dropped out after 
100 meters with a left hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Torian remained unbeaten this season, winning the  
60-meter hurdles in 7.38, the best in the world and a meet record. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Deal won his 11th title in the 35-pound weight throw at  
77-11 1/2, becoming the winningest male athlete in meet history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Ellerbe broke her meet record in winning her fourth  
consecutive title in the women's 20-pound weight throw with a heave 
of 74-8 1/4. Melissa Morrison also set a meet record, winning the 
women's 60 hurdles in 7.85, the fastest by an American in 1998. 
Another meet record fell when Stacy Dragila won her fourth straight 
women's pole vault title at 14-3 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Goucher, the 1998 NCAA indoor 3,000, outdoor 5,000 and  
cross country champion for Colorado, took the 3,000 in 7:46.06, the 
fastest by an American this year. Tisha Waller won her third 
women's indoor high jump title at 6-5, the best by an American in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark, the 1997 world indoor champion in the women's  
400, won her third straight national title and fourth overall, in 
51.97. Another 1997 world champion, Stacy Dragila, took the women's 
pole vault at 14-7 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Timber Co. Rejects Forest Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Efforts to preserve a vast chunk of  
Northern California's Headwaters Forest suffered a major blow as a 
timber company rejected a $480 million deal that would have set 
aside majestic stands of ancient redwoods for the public to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal officials approved the proposal after lengthy  
negotiations, pleasing environmentalists by demanding protection of 
streams and wildlife habitat throughout the company's holdings in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Lumber Co. turned it down Friday, saying the deal  
could financially cripple the 130-year-old logging company and 
force layoffs. The proposal is all but dead, since promised federal 
funding is scheduled to expire next week and no new talks are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not agree to a deal that would have made our company  
uncompetitive and uneconomic,'' said Pacific Lumber's president, 
John Campbell. ``We had an obligation to our investors, to the men 
and women who work for the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the deal were furious.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pacific Lumber backed away from the agreement,'' said Sen.  
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who assisted in the negotiations. ``I 
am deeply disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis said he remained committed to the effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the company turned its back on an  
agreement that would have brought an end to 10 years of litigation, 
protest, heartaches and economic uncertainty,'' he said. ``My 
administration, however, will continue its efforts to protect 
redwoods that have stood majestically throughout this entire 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber and its parent company, Houston-based Maxxam  
Corp., have been the object of lengthy court fights and 
demonstrations -- including the nation's largest forest rally, a 
1996 environmental protest in which more than 1,000 people were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell had said that preserving the Headwaters Forest, named  
by hikers who ventured into the rugged area 250 miles north of San 
Francisco in the 1970s and 1980s, would have ranked ``with the 
establishment of Yosemite and Sequoia national parks over 100 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have had Pacific Lumber and an allied logging  
firm sell 10,000 acres of forest -- including about 3,000 acres of 
old-growth redwoods -- to the United States and California. Some of 
the huge trees are 1,500 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Lumber opposed a list of environmental rules the  
state wanted it to follow on the rest of its 211,000 acres in 
Humboldt County as a condition of the sale. The rules would be 
locked in for at least 50 years and remain in effect even if the 
company sells the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said company executives will meet Monday to decide  
plans for logging its acreage in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not rule out logging old-growth timber.  
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber's decision came a day after California made its  
final offer. On Monday, the federal share of the deal, $250 
million, disappears unless all sides agree to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the talks were over. The company's rejection ``is  
not brinkmanship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That angered California Senate Majority Leader John Burton, who  
said ``backing away from this deal leaves Pacific Lumber up a 
tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state, meanwhile, said it intended to intensify its watch on  
the company's harvesting practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor has directed our agency to increase the level of  
monitoring and enforcement,'' said Mary Nichols, the top 
environmental adviser to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Earth First! said it would hold a rally Tuesday in Carlotta,  
near the Headwaters Forest, to protest the ``miscarriage of 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, David Chain, a 24-year-old Earth First!  
activist, died when he was struck in the head by a falling tree 
while trying to block logging in the Headwaters. Investigators said 
a logger sent the tree crashing down, though authorities said the 
death was an accident.

<HEADLINE> Ads Offer $50,000 for Egg Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Advertisements are appearing in student  
newspapers at some of the nation's top colleges offering $50,000 
for a bright, tall woman willing to donate an egg to an infertile 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
	A national fertility registry has been running advertisements in  
Ivy League student newspapers for months. But this ad, which was 
privately placed, stood out because it took up a half-page and 
offered so much money, said Nicole Itano, managing editor of the 
Yale Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty thousand dollars is a good deal of money, especially for  
people looking at graduate school or law school, and that could 
definitely be a factor in some of the decision-making,'' said 
Itano, 21. She said she would not be a donor. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad was printed Friday in the Yale Daily News. It also has  
been placed in student papers at Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, the 
University of Pennsylvania, the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads, which cost about $500 apiece, call for an  
``intelligent, athletic egg donor'' who is at least 5 foot 10, 
scored particularly well on the standard college entrance exam and 
has ``no major family medical issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a huge response -- between 40 and 50 interested  
people,'' said Darlene Pinkerton, a representative of the couple 
who placed the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad did not specify race or ethnicity, but Pinkerton said the  
couple, who wish to remain anonymous, were seeking a Caucasian 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton refused to disclose any details about her clients,  
including whether they attended a top college.

	Fighting Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs and ethnic Albanians  
reportedly engaged in renewed fighting today, disregarding the 
orders of international officials to obey a temporary truce. Ethnic 
Albanian sources said Yugoslav army troops targeted rebel positions 
in at least five villages about 20 miles northwest of the capital 
of Pristina. The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said 
two rebel fighters were killed and another wounded. International 
mediators have asked the warring sides to comply with a cease-fire 
with peace talks scheduled to resume next month in France.

	GOP Pushes School Flexibility Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP Sen. Bill Frist today promoted his  
proposal to increase flexibility and accountability in the nation's 
schools, while criticizing the federal government for onerous 
oversight of local education. The Tennessee Republican says the 
Education Flexibility Partnership Act would get schools out from 
under the thumb of the federal government. Frist says it would let 
them create their own plans for boosting student achievement. 
Schools would be held accountable for following through on their 
proposals. Twelve states already have ``Ed-Flex'' pilot programs. 
The Senate will consider the bill next week.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New federal rules announced today by  
President Clinton will require child safety seats to fit easily 
into standardized anchoring systems in all cars by the year 2000. 
Clinton says as many as 70 percent of all kids riding in car seats 
could be at risk because they aren't properly installed. Clinton 
says all safety seats by next year must have three standard 
attachments designed to fit three standard anchors in the back seat 
of every car. Clinton says the new rule could prevent up to 3,000 
injuries a year.

	Yeltsin Back in Hospital  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Ailing Russian President Boris Yeltsin returned to  
the hospital today for further treatment of an ulcer, just a few 
days after his spokesman had announced the president's full 
recovery. Yeltsin, 68, was hospitalized for two weeks last month 
with a bleeding ulcer. It was the latest of a string of illnesses 
that have kept the president out of his Kremlin office for weeks at 
a time and raised doubts that he is healthy enough to serve his 
full term, which ends in 2000. He has relinquished many of his 
presidential duties to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

American defense officials said. Iraqi officials claim the

new regulations meant to clear the roads of the worst polluters and 
cut dust and smog from construction sites, coal stoves and other 
sources. For at least five months last year, the air pollution

<HEADLINE> Yankees Owner Holds Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Not accustomed to losing, New York Yankees  
owner George Steinbrenner is still not happy that Derek Jeter and 
Mariano Rivera beat the team in salary arbitration decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the first-base dugout during the Yankees' spring  
training workout, Steinbrenner talked about a variety of subjects, 
including Darryl Strawberry's comeback from colon cancer and Roger 
Clemens' presence on the World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The one topic Steinbrenner would not address was Thursday's  
announcement of the merger plan between the Yankees and the NBA's 
New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter ($5 million) and Rivera ($4.25 million) were the only  
players to their arbitration cases against teams this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only one time out of 10 has baseball won in arbitration when a  
world championship team is concerned ,'' Steinbrenner said. ``If 
they want to make popularity part of it, or whether you win the 
championship, I don't know. I've dealt with a lot of arbitrators, 
but I've seen anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Where it's Derek Jeter and where it's Mariano Rivera, they're  
two good young men,'' Steinbrenner said. ``If it had to happen, OK, 
but I do not agree with the decision. I don't think anybody in 
baseball should be comfortable with that decision. It can have a 
bad effect, a long-ranging effect. If this now becomes part of the 
equation, then that throws a whole new thing into arbitration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry missed batting practice Saturday after undergoing  
chemotherapy on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want him well ... whether he's with this team as a  
regular player or whether he's practicing,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I 
don't want anything bad to happen to him. If he misses a day here, 
if he misses a day there or misses five days, he doesn't have 
anything to worry about with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry is expected to work out Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel great this morning. Sometimes you just don't  
feel good,'' Strawberry said. ``Some of the days after will be 
tough. You have to bear with it. I'm doing baseball things. It 
takes a lot of energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his treatment program for colon cancer, Strawberry  
will have a two-week break before before resuming his weekly 
chemotherapy sessions. The chemo is scheduled to through at least 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said he doesn't think the players ``have to be  
convinced'' about avoiding complacency this season and expressed 
pleasure with how Clemens is fitting in following last week's 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have a great team chemistry and Roger brings  
another element in that I noticed a lot of the pitchers are trying 
to run with him and talk with him,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I just 
hope the players are ready and give a good account of themselves 
this year. I think we should.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Andy Pettitte passed an early test, throwing 40 pitches 
during a 10-minute bullpen stint. The left-hander had missed his 
scheduled batting practice session Wednesday with elbow tenderness. 
``It went well. We'll see how it feels tomorrow after I play 
catch,'' said Pettitte, who will likely throw BP Monday or Tuesday. 
... Pitchers throwing batting practice on Saturday included Rivera, 
Mike Stanton, Darren Holmes and Jeff Nelson. None reported any 
problems.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- So much for the high road.  
</P>
<P>
	Two potential rivals for the GOP presidential nomination said  
Saturday they won't abide by Sen. John McCain's challenge that the 
whole Republican field refrain from negative ads or attack-style 
campaigning on each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does he think this is, some sort of tea party?'' sniffed  
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander in an interview Saturday at 
the state GOP convention. He has launched a presidential 
exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander blamed his 1996 loss of the New Hampshire primary on  
his failure to respond to other candidates' negative ads, and 
refused to rule them out this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to defend myself this time if I have to,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we have a good, vigorous contest on the issues, then we'll  
put up a nominee who's tough enough and smart enough to take on Al 
Gore,'' he said. ``If we sit around and sip tea and don't discuss 
the issues, and use borrowed words from Clinton and Gore that don't 
mean anything, why, we'll lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, who is considering a presidential run,  
hobbled the candidacy of eventual nominee Bob Dole in 1996 with a 
blitz of aggressive ads. But he denied ever having personally 
attacked a political rival. ``It's always been based on principles, 
issues and record, and that's what a vigorous campaign and debate 
should be about,'' he said in a separate interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he would refrain from negative ads, Forbes said:  
``It's legitimate to have a debate on the issues. If you don't 
agree with someone on an issue, why should you bite your tongue?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain invoked Ronald Reagan's axiom, ``Thou shalt not speak ill  
of a fellow Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Forbes and Alexander offered commandments of their own.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ``should go on offense, not defense,'' Forbes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Alexander: ``Thou shalt be nice to each other, but have a  
vigorous contest of ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told of the comments by Forbes and Alexander, McCain responded:  
``I'd certainly be interested in the response from average 
Republicans to that. The overwhelming number of Republicans in our 
party are not interested in seeing negative (campaigns) conducted 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush who tried to set up a  
table on the opening night of the convention were politely told to 
take it somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	While seven Republicans who harbor White House ambitions  
attended the convention, Bush did not. 
</P>
<P>
	But backers were loath to miss the opportunity to promote Bush  
in this politically crucial state, so they assembled a table 
alongside those of potential rivals Alan Keyes, McCain and Gary 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: Those rivals are attending the convention, so they  
were allowed to have tables. 
</P>
<P>
	A state GOP official told Assemblyman Bruce Thompson the table  
would have to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush team said they would set up their table at the adjacent  
convention center, and they rented a pizza parlor for a rally that 
drew more than 200 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was McCain's first formal campaign swing, but his team worked  
Sacramento like old pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters swarmed Sacramento early to court the press and GOP  
delegates. Their proudest achievement: convincing the hotel that 
hosted the convention to play a biography of their war hero 
candidate 24 hours a day in every room. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Denying rumors that he is having money troubles, Alexander said  
Saturday that he will raise $1 million by the first-quarter 
reporting period in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some GOP rivals will show higher figures, Alexander said  
he raised the money without a single fund-raiser. He has several 
fund-raisers scheduled between March and June, with commitments of 
$7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put him halfway to his goal of raising $15 million  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have the money to compete,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has added three campaign veterans to his team, though he  
has yet to formally enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Anderson, former political director of the Republican  
National Committee, will be a senior adviser if Forbes runs, said 
strategist Bill Dal Col. Ruth Kistler, former RNC deputy political 
director, would help manage the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	John Maxwell, a Virginia-based consultant considered one of the  
best Iowa strategists, also would be a senior adviser, Dal Col 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes opponents have accused the millionaire businessman of  
paying steep salaries to operatives, hoping to keep political 
talent out of rival camps.

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A heavy thunderstorm passed over  
Indianapolis early Saturday evening, forcing a delay in the Big Ten 
women's basketball tournament when rain began leaking through the 
roof of the RCA Dome.

	Officials halted the game as puddles developed at one end of the  
court. Meanwhile, some fans sitting in the stands opened umbrellas 
to protect themselves from a second leak.

	Penn State was leading 49-34 with 14:42 to play when the game  
was halted about 5:50 p.m. The players continued shooting on the 
court during the delay while workers were wiping the floor with 
towels. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former Wrestling Official Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Bob Dellinger, a former sportswriter  
and director of the U.S. Wrestling Federation, died Saturday of 
colon cancer. Dellinger was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellinger joined The Oklahoman staff in 1952 and spent 20 years  
in writing, editing and administrative capacities in the sports 
department. He was sports editor from 1965 until 1972, when he went 
to the then new United States Wrestling Federation in Stillwater. 
</P>
<P>
	He was director until the organization moved to Colorado  
Springs, Colo., in 1988. By then, he was a director of the National 
Wrestling Hall of Fame in Stillwater, into which he was inducted in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellinger was considered the foremost authority on wrestling  
tournament procedures -- bracketed, pairings and scoring. He 
authored two revolutionary rules, the present-day team scoring 
system in 1959 and the current consolation bracketing in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Arkansas City, Kan., Dellinger graduated from the  
University of Kansas and was sports editor of the Ponca City News 
before joining The Oklahoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellinger was named Amateur Wrestling News' writer of the year  
1960-62 before withdrawing his name from the competition. The award 
then was renamed in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Services were pending at Strode Funeral Home in Stillwater.  
Survivors include his wife, Doris, three sons and 11 grandchildren.
