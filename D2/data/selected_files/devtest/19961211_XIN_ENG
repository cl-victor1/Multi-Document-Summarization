<HEADLINE> Netherlands Economy Draws World Attention: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands is attracting
international attention on account of its strong economic
performance, a senior Dutch official said last night.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Minister for Economic Affairs, Hans Wijers, made the
remark in a speech at the award ceremony held Monday night in
Amsterdam of the Sijthoff Prize for companies with particularly
outstanding financial publications.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the achievement made by the
Netherlands in the economic field is due to its "delta strategy"
aimed at the reorganization of government finances, tax and social
charges relief and adjustments to the social security system.
</P>
<P>
However, the Dutch Cabinet wants to add to this more "deltas"
-- greater efficiency in the labor and goods markets and a
structural increase in government expenditure, with a shift from
consumption to investment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his "ambition" for the coming period of
government was to reduce the number of people aged below 65 who
are still dependent on benefit -- around 2.5 million -- by at
least one percent a year.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Egypt to Strengthen Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Poland in a joint
communique today called for comprehensive economic cooperation
between the two countries and the establishment of just peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued simultaneously here and Warsaw at the
end of Polish Prime Minister Woldzimierz Cimoszewicz's visit to
Egypt, the first by a Polish prime minister in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay, Cimoszewicz held talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri to explore political,
cultural and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Poland have signed many agreements for economic,
technical, cultural, marine transport and investment protection
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There are also accords for security cooperation, preventing
double taxation and establishing a business council.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade relations between Egypt and Poland date
back to 1964, when the two countries signed an agreement for
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also signed a protocol for political
consultations between the two countries, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on regional and international issues
of mutual interest, especially developments in the Middle East
peace process, European security and Poland's demand to join
European organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister also conveyed a message from
President Aleksander Kwasniewski to President Hosni Mubarak on
promoting the relations between the countries, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries stood at 53.4 million
U.S. dollars in 1995. The trade balance was in Poland's favor, as
Egypt imported goods worth 43.6 million dollars from Poland.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's main exports to Poland are textiles, clothes, food and
tobacco, while its main imports are cars, industrial equipment,
paper, glass and equipment for electricity networks.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister, who arrived here Saturday leading a
powerful delegation, also visited the ancient Egyptian cities of
Luxor and Alexandria.

<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Teachers Union
(ZITU) today urged the government to find ways to stem all forms
of discrimination in schools.
</P>
<P>
ZITU President Felix Mafa told the Zimbabwe National News
Agency that while racism is rampant in Zimbabwe, there are many
other forms of discrimination that need to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
''It's not only racism that is a problem, there is
discrimination against religion, region, union affiliation and
worst of all, political opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
His statement comes in the wake of allegations of racism at an
elitist school, the Peterhouse College, where black staff members
are said to be ill treated by both management and fellow white
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Black teachers are said to have been subject of racial taunts
while the school does not respect national holidays, such as
Africa Day, and the National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
ZITU has an estimated 30,000 members with the rest of the
90,000 Zimbabwean teachers belonging to the Zimbabwe Teachedrs
Association.

</P>
<P>
The Environmental Council of Ministers endorsed the
regulations, due to come into effect on June 1, 1997, to improve

BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The economic and monetary
union (EMU), employment and the revision of the Maastricht Treaty
will top the agenda of the Dublin European Union (UE) summit later
this week.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC) said today that at the Friday and

<P>
The unemployment rate of 10.9 percent, or the 18 million people
out of jobs across Europe has been major headache for the 15
leaders. They will focus on the EC-initiated employment confidence
pact.
</P>
<P>
The inter-governmental meeting on the revision of the
Maastricht Treaty, particularly on the policy-making mechanism,
will also be among top priorities at the summit. EU leaders are

Speaking at a large gathering held in the southwestern Kandal
Province, to mark the Human Rights Day, Hun Sen said: "If there is
no food and clothing for children and no school for educating
them, where lie the human rights?"
</P>
<P>
"Our people should differentiate between two kinds of human
rights groups," Hun Sen told the rally attended by tens of
thousands people from different walks of life.
</P>
<P>
"Some have only lip services on human rights, sitting in
air-conditioned rooms, reading and receiving reports sent in from
some organizations and engaging in endless trouble-making," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The others go to the countryside, fields and factories and
help push forward constructions, build canals, dig ponds, set up
schools, open hospitals, and develop businesses to increase the
income of individuals and families," he said. He added: "This is
the real practice of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights are not affairs of certain countries, or certain
persons, or certain political parties, but concerns of everyone of
mankind on earth," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"So the real places to implement and strengthen human rights
are at homes, villages, farms, factories, schools and hospitals
etc.."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all officers to do a good job in implementing
and enlarging human rights in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Approve New Bosnia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from NATO
member countries today approved an operation plan for the
Stabilization Force to replace the present NATO Implementation
Force in Bosnia, on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the 16 member countries of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) made the decision at their semi-annual
meeting today, at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The operational plan for the Stabilization Force (SFOR) should
also be approved by NATO defense ministers who will meet here next
week.
</P>
<P>
Definitive approval should come on December 19, on the eve of
the end to the mandate of the Implementation Force
(IFOR). Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council should vote
for a resolution giving NATO a mandate to continue its mission in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The new force will comprise 31,000 troops and will have an
18-month mandate. It will have its position reassessed every six
months, according to NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
As with the current force in Bosnia, more than 30 countries
will take part in the operation, baptized "Joint Guard".
</P>
<P>
The operation, which is designed in four phases, will start on
December 20 at 11:00 a.m. local time, said a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains the biggest contributor of troops,
with 8,500; Britain will send 5,000 troops, Germany and France
3,000 and 2,500 respectively.
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the present IFOR numbered 60,000 troops.

HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- No significant changes will be
made to the leadership of the ruling ZANU PF Party of Zimbabwe at
its national annual conference at the weekend, a party official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Administration of the party Didymus Mutasa
explained this is because the conferfence has no powers to do so.
</P>
<P>
''We will not look at any of those issues because the conference
has no power to do so. It has a very limited function. Power to
elect new members or officers of the party resides in the congress.
These issues have to wait until 1999 or until an extraordinary
congress is summoned,'' Mutasa said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city, in December 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe is expected to deliver his report of the central committee
when the conference formally opens.
</P>
<P>
The conference on Saturday will hear reports and debates on
the state of the economy, the issue of black economic empowerment
and the controversial land question, Mutasa said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel Asks Egyptian Foreign Minister to Postpone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel has asked Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to postpone his visit here in a move
to reject more active Egyptian involvement in Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior Israeli diplomatic sources as
saying today that Israel did so because it thought Egypt was too
involved in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt initiated Moussa's visit which was aimed at brokering a
final agreement on the long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in
the West Bank city of Hebron. The talks between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority (PA) have failed to produce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Likud government is angered by Egypt's strong
criticism against its hardline policies that have stalled the
Middle East peace process on all tracks. Cairo has warned that
the lack of progress in Hebron talks would possibly lead to a
confrontation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli sources said that there were two reasons for
its move to turn down Moussa's requirement for a visit at the
stage. Firstly, Israel favors the talks with Egypt being held at
a lower level in a bid to limit Cairo's "negative influence" on
the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Israel is doubtful if the Egyptians would secure a
deal on Hebron redeployment. Israel has been suspicious that
Cairo would only urge the PA to take tougher positions in the
Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Israel is sending Dore Gold, diplomatic adviser
to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, to visit Cairo tomorrow to
hold consultations with Egyptian officials on the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the tense relations, Israel is apparently avoiding
escalating the tension with Egypt, the key Arab mediator in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process and a widely regarded leader
of the Arab world. Israeli officials said that they hoped Moussa
could conduct his visit after the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Netanyahu held a telephone talk with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, calling on him to use Egypt's influence
to help break the deadlock in Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of goodwill, Netanyahu praised Egypt's "favorable
contributions" to the peace process, while expressing hope that
Cairo would encourage the PA to take a "realistic and
responsible position in the negotiations."

balance of payment deficit over the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Ethiopian Minister of Finance Sufian
Ahmed at the three-day Third Meeting of the World Bank Consultative
Group (CG) for Ethiopia, which opened today at the United Nations
Confernece Center in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Sufian said, during the period from 1996-99, the bulk of
the requirement, amounting to 1.3 billion dollars, will be needed to
finance development projects, while the remaining will go to support
the balance of payment.
</P>
<P>
''I am highly optimistic that the donors and creditors, who
wish to see Ethiopia move along the development path and the current
democratic governance take deep root, would come to give their usual
sopport and help the country by fulfilling their pledges to their
utmost capacity,'' the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The international community pledged 1.1 billion dollars financial
support to Ethiopia during the second CG meeting in Paris in March,
1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Sufian, Ethiopia has successfully completed a
three-year reform program for 1992-95 and is entering into the
second one which covers the period 1996-99. The average annual
real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for 1992-96 was 7.6
percent. Average annual growth rate of real GDP will reach at
least 7 percent over 1996-99. enditem

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG To Move Liberian Fighters to Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peacekeeping
Force operating in Liberia known as ECOMOG has pledged to assist
in the transportation of factional fighters to disarmament sites
to facilitate the disarmament process to be completed at the end
of January next year.
</P>
<P>
The gesture is expected to help solve some logistic problems
being encountered by the fighters, said ECOMOG Commander Victor
Malu at a meeting on Monday with two of Liberian factional
leaders, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Alhaji G.V. Kromah of ULIMO-k and
Roosevelt Johnson of ULIMO-j in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
Malu said ECOMOG troops had been directed to deploy in two areas
of the southwestern part of Liberia to serve as a buffer between
fighters loyal to the two factions of ULIMO.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia
quoted Malu as advising the factional leaders against undue
emphasis on the control of territory at this stage of the peace
process, which targets at the installation of an elected
government in Liberia in May next year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders should pre-occupy themselves with the
transportation of their fighters to disarmament site to ensure a
successful conclusion of the three-month exercise, Malu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Malu is dissatisfied with the pace
of disarmament at Bo waterside and Tubmanburg, which are occupied
by fighters loyal to the two factions.
</P>
<P>
He said that ECOMOG troops to be deployed will undertake
regular patrols on the highways in the area and will be fully
equipped to handle any act of defiance by the factions as part of
measures to restore public confidence in the security of the
area.
</P>
<P>
In response, the two factional leaders promised to improve the
tempo of disarmament, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Continue Arms Acquisition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will upgrade its
defense capability through continous arms purchase as long as the
Cyprus question remains unresolved, Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a cabinet meeting, Michaelides
said "The Republic of Cyprus cannot remain defenseless when the
massive Turkish military machine continues to remain in occupied
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The minister was responding to Turkey's threats that it
reserves the right to take military action in Cyprus, if Cyprus
keeps boosting its defenses under the joint Greco-Cyriot defense
pact reached three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He described it as "unacceptable" that Turkey rejects President
Glafcos Clerides' proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus
while "insists on telling us what to do with our arms purchase
program."
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Cyprus has made representations
to U.N. Security Council members and European Union (EU)
member-states to protest at Turkey's intent to threaten Cyprus
with military action.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterated our readiness to begin substantive talks with
a view to find a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem,
provided we reach common ground," Michaelides said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to talk as soon as possible about the
demilitarization proposal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit in Current Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit shot
up to 48 billion U.S. dollars in the third quarter of this year,
the worst performance in history.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reported today that the
imbalance in the U.S. current account increased 19.3 percent from
a second quarter deficit of 40.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade performance reflected a small increase of 0.7 percent
in merchandise imports, which rose to 201.5 billion dollars during
the quarter. At the same time, U.S. merchandise exports fell 2.1
percent to 149.9 billion dollars, marking the first quarterly
decline in U.S. merchandise exports since the second quarter of
1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. current account is the broadest measure of foreign
trade, tracking not only sales of goods but also services,
investment flows and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports and drop in exports caused an increase in
the deficit in goods of 9.8 percent to 51.6 billion dollars. The
country also suffered a 7.8 percent pick-up in the deficit in
investment earnings to 4.7 billion dollars, and a 0.6 percent
increase in the category that tracks foreign aid payments, which
rose to 9.42 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. usually had a surplus in services, which include items
such as airline tickets and royalty payments. But the quarterly
17.8 billion dollars services surplus was down 3.5 percent from
the second quarter even though royalty payments, reflecting fees
foreigners paid to broadcast the Olympic games in Atlanta, were
up.
</P>
<P>
The 48 billion dollars quarterly current account deficit was
the highest in history, surpassing the old mark of 43.2 billion
dollars set in the fourth quarter of 1987.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the current account deficit is running at an
annual rate of 164 billion dollars, could surpass last year's
148.1 billion dollar deficit.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President Opens Oil Pipeline to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein today made an unexpected appearance at a pumping station
in northern Iraq and opened the pipeline carrying the first oil
exports to the world market after a six-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
In the control room of the Pumping Station near the northern
city of Kirkuk, Saddam pressed two buttons on the control
board, saying that "we implore the almighty God to bestow on the
Iraqi stability, great achievements and more victories, God is
great and down with the enemies."
</P>
<P>
He said that the flow of the Iraqi oil is an achievement
which will add to the prosperity and stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the president were Vice-Chairman of the
Revolution Command Council Izzat Ibrahim, Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil started flowing to Turkey through a duplex oil
pipeline from Kirkuk city at 11:25 local time (8:25 GMT) today
for the first time since the United Nations imposed crippling
sanctions, including the ban of oil export, on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Through hard negotiations with the U.N. on the oil-for-food
deal signed by the two sides in May, Iraq finally started
resuming its limited oil sales worth 2 billion U.S. dollars every
six months to buy badly needed food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods to alleviate the sufferings of its
sanctions-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
The final go-ahead came Monday night at the U.N. headquarters
in New York, and jubilant Iraqis poured into the streets on
hearing the news, dancing, singing and firing shots into the sky.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 10 U.N. oil inspectors in the country to
supervise the flow of oil under the Iraqi-U.N. deal, six of
them in the southern Iraqi port of al-Bakr and the rest in the
northern city of Zakho at the border with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 150 U.N. food observers will make sure that
humanitarian supplies, which will be bought by Iraq with its oil
revenue, are distributed equally under the deal.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of the food in the Kurdish controlled
northern area will be carried out by the U.N. agencies.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Delay Cooperation in Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany will delay
cooperation in building two military satellites, Helios-2 and
Horus, because of German budgetary constraint, said local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said at the 68th Franco-German
summit in Nurenberg on Monday that politically, Bonn is committed
to the 20 billion franc (4 billion U.S. dollars) project. But he
failed to give a specific date for the German participation, said
reports.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the satellites, first expected in the early
next century, will end Europe's dependence on the United States in
space espionage.
</P>
<P>
France's Aerospatiale space group has begun alone fixing the
optical observation satellite Helios-2, which is expected to be
launched by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the two satellites will be shared between France
and Germany, but Bonn said it could not start funding the project
before mid 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Horus radar observation satellite, which will be designed
by the Dasa group of Germany, is expected to come under
construction by 1998, and be launched by 2005.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon said today that France
does not expect to see Germany's participation into the Helios-2
project before July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that France could have to bear all of the cost
of Helios-2 and spend more on Horus.

<HEADLINE> Israel Approves Controversial Housing Plan in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel approved today a
controversial project to build 132 homes in eastern Jerusalem, a
move expected to provoke strong protests from the Palestinian
residents.
</P>
<P>
The plan was okayed by the Jerusalem District Planning
Commission and will be sent to Interior Minister Eli Suissa for
final approval. A spokeswoman for the ministry confirmed that if
the plan was approved, 132 new homes would be built in the Ras
al-Amud Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinian officials and Israeli opposition figures
warned that an approval of the plan could provoke Palestinian
violence similar to the September bloodshed that killed over 70
people, which was sparked by Israel's opening of an exit to an
underground tunnel near the Al-Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian Authority (PA) minister in
charge of Jerusalem affairs, strongly denounced the housing
plan. He warned that the implementation of the plan "would mean
the destruction of the peace process and the creation of a
popular reaction that would make the tunnel incident a simple
matter."
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Deputy Housing Minister Meir Porush brushed aside
the warning, saying that the Jews and Arabs could live in
coexistence in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason why Jews can't live in the Old City
or in the east of the city. There is no reason not to... it can
lead to coexistence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party's former interior minister Uzi
Baram criticized the housing plan as "a prescription for
trouble." Baram blocked the plan when he was in office in the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely against it. The existing hostility in my
opinion will also cause a very complicated international problem
for the Netanyahu government and it will also cause serious
conflicts between the Jews and Arabs in that neighborhood," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue has been the core of the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The Israeli hardline Likud
government has claimed Jerusalem as its only eternal capital,
while the PA wants east Jerusalem, which was occupied by the
Jewish state in the 1967 War, to be the capital of a future
Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Angola Tries To Resume Production of Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUNDA, December 10 (Xinhua) --The Angolan government will
appropriate 6 million U.S.Dolars for the resumption of the
production of the small and middle-sized enterprises in the
Angolan central city of Huambo.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government is trying to raise to 25 percent their
production capacity of the city's small and middle-sized
enterprises they have maintained before 1992 when the civil war
was re-erupted in the country, said Mendes Teixeira,
representative of the Industry Department in Huambo.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises which need to resume production first are
clothing, timber, food and wheat powder factories which will
produce daily necessities for local people. The reopening of
these factories will also creat 1000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Huambo is the second biggest city of Angola. In 1992 when the
civil war was re-erupted in the country, fierce fightings between
the two warring factions, the government troops and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola,lasted for more than
50 days there, in which 98 percent of the operated 212 factories
were destroyed, leading to over 6000 people unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Urges Farmers to Lift Road Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today stood firm in the face of farmers' demands, setting
as a prerequisite for an "institutional dialogue" their lifting
of road blocks around the country which have caused widespread
disruption to domestic and international traffic for almost two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on television after a four-hour cabinet meeting on the
subject, Simitis said that both he and Agriculture Minister
Stephanos Tzoumakas wished to have a discussion with the farmers'
official bodies of representation.
</P>
<P>
"But there can be no such dialogue when extreme forms of
struggle are being used and the country's road network remains
blocked," Simitis said, promising that as soon as the roadblocks
were lifted, the government would take initiatives for "an
institutional dialogue with all".
</P>
<P>
The subjects for discussion, Simitis said, would be inter alia
the timetable for the realization of the national register of
farmers, the determining of our policy towards the European Union
and the price ceiling for cotton, the restructuring of the Greek
agricultural insurance organization and "the charting of
parameters for a national agricultural policy".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the repercussions of the farmers' protests,
Simitis said the possibilities for tackling the structural
problems of the agricultural sector were being diminished, the
export of farm products such as oranges was being obstructed, a
problem was being created for the economic life of towns and
cities, the distribution of livestock products and supplies to
enterprises were being impeded and "citizens with health problems
are being prevented from traveling."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that the government had only
recently been given a mandate from the Greek people and called on
all concerned "to assume their responsibilities".
</P>
<P>
Among farmers' demands are: higher prices for their products,
especially cotton; lower production costs through cheaper diesel,
fertilizer, seeds and electricity; the settlement of debts that
cooperatives owe to the state-owned agriculture bank, which come
about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. The government responded by saying
it simply has no money to satisfy their demands.
</P>
<P>
With farmers and government hardening their respective
positions, the outlook for a quick resolution of the disputes is
bleak.

<HEADLINE> EU Not to Include New Members before 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Three major problems prevent
the European Union (EU) from being enlarged to eastern European
countries before the year 2000, the UN/ECE says in its 1996
Economic Bulletin for Europe published here today.
</P>
<P>
The issues over the EU enlargement are:
</P>
<P>
--first, without basic changes in the EU's constitutional
arrangements it is likely to paralyze its decision-making process;
</P>
<P>
--secondly, the transition economies of eastern Europe are not
yet so advanced in their transformation programs as to be able to
fully live up to the common acquirements, the core rules and
regulations governing competition in the Single European Market -
failure to do so could disadvantage the existing members in a
number of ways;
</P>
<P>
--thirdly, even if the new members were able to abide fully by
the rules, the costs might prove unacceptable to the present EU
member state if the present transfer programs of the EU,
principally for agricultural support and assistance with
structural change, were to remain in place at the time of
accession. Moreover, the distribution of the increased budgetary
costs and the reallocation of benefits within the EU would be
asymmetric.
</P>
<P>
The ECE believes that there is little question that the
enlargement of the EU towards the countries of eastern Europe is
an objective that is urgently desired by the eastern candidates
themselves and supported in principle by most of the existing
members of the EU. However, those problems suggest that a rapid
accession of the eastern European countries might not be possible
and they underline the need to solve internal EU problems as a
condition for enlargement, the ECE says.
</P>
<P>
"Even for the leading transition economies", joining the EU by
2000 appears "unrealistic", says an ECE economic analyst.

It said Ethiopia's economy rebounded strongly to an average
annual growth rate of 7.6 percent during 1992/93-1995/96, adding
that the latest estimate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
in 1995/96 will be an impressive 10.4 percent.

Non-agricultural GDP grew at an average annual rate of 10.6
percent in the last four years, 1992/93-1995/96, the statement

<HEADLINE> Solana: NATO Has No Intention to Station Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- NATO today assured Russia
that it would not station nuclear weapons on the territory of new
members it plans to admit from Central and Eastern Europe, in the
hope of softening Russia's objections to the alliance's eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"NATO countries have no intention, no plan, and no reason to
deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members nor any
need to change any aspect of NATO's nuclear posture or nuclear
policy," it was said in a Communique issued after the Autumn
meeting of NATO's foreign ministers in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed that enlarging the alliance would
not require a change in NATO's current nuclear posture and that
they did "not foresee any future need to do so".
</P>
<P>
However, it stopped short of a guarantee that NATO would not
station nuclear weapons and forces on the soil of new members
under any circumstances, which means these countries would then
only join NATO's political structure.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly opposed to plans to expand the alliance
eastward. It says that to do so would risk creating a new dividing
line in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are expected to be the
first ex-Warsaw Pact states in line to join, but Slovenia and
Romania are also in the running, NATO diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana is expected to meet
Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov Tuesday evening. And
Wednesday morning, before the ministerial meeting of the North
Atlantic Cooperation Council, the sixteen NATO foreign ministers
would hold talks with their Russian counterpart in the "16 plus 1"
form.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at the foreign ministers' meeting, Mr Solana
said that NATO wished to set up "a strong and durable framework",
in the form of a document or charter, for the NATO-Russia
relationship. But Moscow has not yet reacted to such proposals
which had been raised often by leaders of the alliance.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Final Constitution Welcomed by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson
Mandela's signing into law of South Africa's first post-apartheid
constitution today at Sharpeville is praised by most political
parties as " a milestone" in South Africa's history.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, the ruling African
National Congress said the the event paid shining tribute to the
memory of all those who had sacrificed their lives in the fight
for democracy.
</P>
<P>
It is a reminder that the new constitution belonged not only
to the echelons of power, but to the descendants of those who had
struggled for years to ensure peace, freedom and democracy, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The official opposition, National Party, said it looked
forward to playing a leading role in building a society based on
respect for human rights. It is proud to be an active
participant in the constitution-writing process, the party said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said the signing of the new
constitution is a significant milestone to have passed as a
country and a democracy.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as being one of the most advanced democratic
constitutions in the world, Leon said the behaviour of the
government and its agencies in coming years will determine the
success of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Africanist Congress said the new constitution laid a
basis for creating a non-racial, just and democratic society.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party said, however, the signing of the new
constitution signalled "the end of freedom" for the Afrikaner
Nation.
</P>
<P>
There is no hope for the Afrikaner to attain its freedom under
this government and this constitution, said the party leader
Ferdi Hartzenberg.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Inkatha Freedom Party said that it will abide
by the constitution despite of the fact that it disagreed with
some aspects of the document.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Open First Native Bank Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The first aboriginal bank in
Canada will open in the city of Saskatoon next year.
</P>
<P>
Based in Saskatoon, the First Nations Bank of Canada will
provide services to both native and non-native customers, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank will initially operate as a subsidiary of the
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), which provides 80 percent of the
10-million-Canadian-dollar startup capital but will get only 25
percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
The remaining capital came from the Saskatchewan Indian Equity
Foundation, which will collect 75 percent of the bank's earnings.
</P>
<P>
Within 10 years, TD's ownership will be bought out, and the
bank will become aboriginal-owned, with no owner holding more than
10 percent of the shares, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The first branch will open in Saskatoon in January, with the
other branches eventually expected across the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sound business venture and... the bank is clearly
going to be very profitable," said Chief Blaine Favel of the
Saskatchewan Federation of Indian Nations.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien also endorsed the bank's
mandate, saying it was his government policy to "help the natives
to run their own show."

forgiveness and healing from the traumas and serious injustices of

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete today called for a partnership of
other nations to evolve an efficient and equitable global
economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call while speaking at the three-day
World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA) - African
Region- Agenda 21 seminar being held here.
</P>
<P>
He said measures such as cancelling of official bilateral debts,
increasing of official development asistance up to 0.7 percent of the
Gross National Prouct (GNP) and access to market of the African
agricultural product could help African countries in implementing the
Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that African countries also welcome the idea of the
establshment of the Global Environmental Facility as a major
financial mechanism for the funding of environment programs.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister said African and other developing countries
needed access to environmenally safe technologies to fulfil their
obligations of implementing the Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
"These technologies however are out of reach of most of the African
countries because of their high costs, and even more constraining is
the lack of adequate institutional and professional capacities to
choose and use them," Kikwete said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was regrettable that the modalities of how to
transfer technology from the developed countries to the South
have not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete further said african countries have a real interest in
pursuing and adjusting to sustainable development, saying however
these countries face a serious resource constraint in attaining an
adequate tempo of development.
</P>
<P>
"Without significant improvements in the lives and livelihoods of the
poor majority, environmental policies and programs in africa have
little chance to success," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, opening the seminar, WFUNA Deputy Secretary General
Mike Amua-Asamoah said that population gowth, poverty in rural
areas and refugees problems have been reasons behind failure by
African countries to implement the agenda 21. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Border Incident Staged by Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today strongly
condemned the Greek Cypriots for trying to tear down a Turkish
flag at the cease-fire line dividing the Turkish-Cypriot and
Greek-Cypriot sides on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said: "The Greek-Cypriot side has apparently taken no lessons
from the upsetting events that took place last summer",
referring to the buffer zone incidents in August, when Greek
Cypriot motorists attempted to cross into the Turkish-Cypriot
side on the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that three
men, who crossed into the buffer zone from the Greek-Cypriot
side Monday, attempted to bring down a Turkish flagpole very
close to the Turkish-Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish soldier fired warning shots and the men were seen
running back to the Greek-Cypriot side, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish statement blamed the Greek Cypriot government for
escalating tensions on the island and regarded the action as
"provocative."
</P>
<P>
On august 14, Turkish troops shot dead a Greek Cypriot
demonstrator as he tried to bring down a Turkish flag on the
edge of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Isaac, 24, who was beaten to death on August 11
in clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish
troops in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus and the soldiers are under strict orders to fire on
anyone crossing the Green Line dividing Cyprus into Turkish
Cypriot north and Greek Cypriot south.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partioned since Turkish troops
landed on the island in 1974 following an abortive coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Abolition of Hazardous, Exploitative Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The elimination of hazardous
and exploitative child labor, which endangers children's physical,
psychological, moral and social development, is a fundamental
demand of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Child labor is the focus of the 1997 Report on the State of the
World's Children issued today, as UNICEF celebrates its 50th
anniversary. The child labor issue was described as "a complex and
global problem" in the report, which was issued simultaneously in
different languages in major cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF urges that priority be given to efforts for the immediate
abolition of child labor and to urgent support for education, so that
children can obtain knowledge and techniques that will enable them to
live better lives.
</P>
<P>
"Hazardous child labor is a betrayal of every child's rights as
a human being and is an offense against our civilization," says
the report, calling for a sharp elimination of hazardous and
exploitative child labor, which endangers children's physical,
psychological, moral or social development
</P>
<P>
The report, comprising three chapters, studies and discusses
common fallacies about child labor. It also describes efforts
being made by different countries to stop the maltreatment and
exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
"By working together," says UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros Ghali in the foreword to the report, "governments,
international and national organizations, and all members of the
world community can help protect children from the economic
exploitation so graphically described in this report."
</P>
<P>
He goes on, "Ending hazardous child labor, a priority concern
of the International Labor Organization and UNICEF, now needs
to become the world's shared and urgent goal. The United Nations
must take the lead."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there are about 250 million children
working in the world. These children, deprived of the right to
education, are living in a vicious circle of poverty. Most of
their basic rights, health and even lives are endangered. In some
areas, children make up one third of the labor force. Children
are the victims of 40 percent of all accidents at work.
</P>
<P>
Children are forced to do work that affects their development,
just because of poverty, lack of education and traditional
cultural limitations, notes the report.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF called for free compulsory education and better legal
protection for children. National and international business
companies are encouraged to map out regulations under which they
promise they will not employ children.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Islamist Leader Reportedly Arrested in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A leader of Algeria's outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) living in exile in the United States
was arrested earlier this month by U.S. immigration officials,
said an FIS leader in Paris today.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Said Lablali, a leader of
FIS living in exile in France, as saying that Anouar Haddam,
"president of the FIS parliamentary delegation," was arrested on
November 6.
</P>
<P>
The FIS claimed victory in Algeria's legislative elections in
late 1991, which was canceled by the Algerian army the following
year.
</P>
<P>
Haddam, who has been living in exile in the United States since
1993, was denied the right of permanent residence by the U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government regards Haddam as a terrorist who had
close link with the extremist group Armed Islamic Group.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Inflation Rate Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Latest figures from Zimbabwe's
Central Statistic Office show that year-on-year inflation has
plummeted from 20.2 percent in October to 13.9 percent in
November, the lowest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, market analysts were today wary about the figure,
saying the October fuel price increases seemed to have been
ignored in the calculations, giving an impression Zimbabwe's
economy was made up of fruit and vegetables only.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, market analyst Dataworld Company said the drop
in inflation was well below even the most optimistic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Dataworld said, "Closer analysis of the inflation calculation
shows that this massive drop arose from a substantial two percent
fall in month-on-month inflation.
</P>
<P>
"With most categories unchanged, food was mainly responsible
for this with a 5.1 percent fall month-on-month led by a massive
21.4 percent fall month-on-month for highly seasonal fruits and
vegetables, which according to sources in the industry is
accurate."
</P>
<P>
Chief economist of the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe Danny Dube
said the way the inflation was calculated was misleading as the
weighting was "simply too high".
</P>
<P>
"The fall in prices of fruit and vegetables would mean that
6.3 percent points were taken out as a result. If this is the
case, it would then mean our economy was based on fruit and
vegetables," Dube said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hong Kong Community Supports Selection of SAR Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The selection of Tung Chee
Hwa as the candidate for the first Chief Executive of the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today drew wide
support from the local community.
</P>
<P>
Tung, a shipping magnate, clinched a landslide victory in a
secret ballot this morning, winning 320 votes from the 400-strong
Selection Committee. The other two contenders, Tin Liang Yang and
Peter K.C. Woo, got 42 and 36 votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tung is now waiting for appointment by the central government
in Beijing to become the Chief Executive Designate.
</P>
<P>
Most Hong Kong residents are satisfied with the process of
selecting the candidate for the first SAR Chief Executive and are
becoming more confident of Hong Kong's future. Henry Cheng,
chairman of the Better Hong Kong Foundation, said:" Tung is a man
of vision and integrity, possessing the administrative experience
to lead Hong Kong into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
An old man who wanted to be identified only as He, a Chinese
surname, told Xinhua that he was in favor of the selection
process, which he said is open, fair and just. The fact that Hong
Kong people choose their own administrative leader shows that Hong
Kong people have become the masters of their own affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
A stock dealer named Dong who works at the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange believed that Tung has the capability of governing Hong
Kong. "Judging from his experience and platform, Tung is a
reliable and steady man," said Dong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 150 years, all Hong Kong Governors were sent from
Britain without consulting Hong Kong people; and it was the first
time for Hong Kong people to have a say, said Dong. He also
praised the entire selection process, televised live on the local
circuit, as highly transparent.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 local and overseas reporters covered the historic
event today, one of the most important steps in forming the HKSAR
government. The selection was televised live on the local circuit,
and one satellite TV station even beamed the program live to
30-odd countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few local Chinese newspapers, such as Ming Pao, Wen Wei
Po, Ta Kung Pao and Oriental Daily, rolled out extra issues at
lunch time, hailing the selection of Hong Kong's first Chief
Executive candidate. The newspapers expressed common wishes that
the first Chief Executive will fully implement the principles of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong'
and "a high degree of autonomy", so as to maintain Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tin Liang Yang, who lost the race for the candidate today,
expressed support for the winner in his future work. The former
Chief Justice described his participation in the campaign as a
responsibility to the Hong Kong community. Another contender Peter
K.C. Woo said that he would back Tung for the sake of Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity. Woo called on the Hong Kong people to
work together with the future Chief Executive to create a more
successful Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten promised to
provide all necessary assistance to Tung to help him in
preparation for assuming office as the Chief Executive on July 1,
1997. Speaking on behalf of the 180,000 civil servants, Chief
Secretary Anson Chan also made a similar promise to give every
possible help to Tung.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Speaks on Medical Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000 China will
have basically established a complete health-care network with the
country's own characteristics and be well on the way to realizing
"primary medical service for all", so as to further enhance the
health level of the people.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng made the remark while presiding over a panel
discussion, attended by relevant leading officials from all
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, to discuss the

care Sector.
</P>
<P>
The National health Work Conference now in session, has summed
up the achievements and experiences in the health care sector
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and
it shows the great significance attached to health work by the CPC
Central Committee and State Council, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's economic and social development has
led to new requirements for safeguarding the people's health,
improving the service level of health care departments and
deepening the restructuring of health care administration.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the premier stressed the importance of focussing
on health care work in the countryside, and he reiterated that the
reform of the medical care security system for urban employees is
a must.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Organization for Aviation Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today proposed that the Council of Ministers give it a mandate to
negotiate the establishment of an organization responsible for
civil aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was reported to have been put forward on the
initiative of Neil Kinnock, an EC commissioner in charge of
transport, said a press release issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EC supports the idea of converting the Joint Aviation
Authorities (JAA), an existing informal organization set up in
1990 by the aviation authorities of some European countries, into
an international organization in which the Community would be a
full member.
</P>
<P>
The proposed body would adopt necessary regulations, monitor
compliance with them by its members and perform various
certification tasks, particularly for aeronautical products.It
would aim to establish a high uniform level of safety in Europe
and its promotion throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Europe enjoys one of the highest levels of safety for aviation
-- with one third of worldwide activity, it accounts for only one
tenth of the casualties.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF's 50th Anniversary Marked in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The 50th anniversary of the
founding of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was
celebrated at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF was set up on December 11, 1946 to help solve children's
problems in the post-World War Two period. The UN organization,
headquarted in New York, has dedicated itself to improving the
living environment for children, and promoting children's
development, protection and social participation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, spoke highly of the friendly
cooperation between UNICEF and China.
</P>
<P>
For a country like China, which has 380 million children, it is
of great significance to improve children's health and living
conditions, said Chen, who is also chairperson of the All-China
Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
She said she hoped that the two sides would continue to
increase and deepen their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF and China started close cooperation in the late
1970s. The two sides have shown many successful examples of
cooperation in fully eliminating polio and controlling other major
children's diseases, and basically popularizing primary education.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 50 years," said Keshab B. Mathema, UNICEF area
representative for China and Mongolia, "UNICEF has evolved from a
humanitarian and welfare organization into an effective mechanism
for development cooperation, focusing on women and children."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNICEF's 1997 Report on the State of the World's
Children was released here today. The report is issued
simultaneously in different languages by the UNICEF in major
cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
Officials from UNICEF's Chinese partner departments, such as
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the State
Education Commission, the Ministry of Health and the State
Statistics Bureau attended the celebration this evening. Embassy
officials of some countries based here also joined the
celebration.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Remains at Odds on Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian foreign minister
Yevgeny Primakov today reiterated his country's strong opposition
to the eastwards expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"While agreeing to continue consultations with NATO on security
issues, we continue to be against NATO's enlargement," Primakov
told reporters after his meeting with foreign ministers of the 16
NATO members.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia's stand was based on the firm belief
that NATO's enlargement would "inevitably lead to a new division
of Europe." This was "unacceptable from strategic, military and
any point of view."
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister reaffirmed Moscow's idea of making the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) a "key
player" in building security architecture in Europe. This was
underscored by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the
group's summit several days ago in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana described his
meeting with Primakov as "constructive", saying it helped to build
trust and confidence between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO was working on a charter governing all
aspects of NATO-Russia relations, and would have it ready before a
NATO summit was held next July.
</P>
<P>
Some Central and East European states will be invited to the
summit on July 8-9 in Madrid, Spain, to start negotiations on
their admission to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 applicants for membership of the 16-nation bloc,
which groups most of the rich industrialized countries in Europe
and North America, are front-runnners Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia would like to discuss a new relationship
with NATO, so far as the talks led to a document which was very
specific and had "provisions which deal with our concerns".
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's ministerial session of the North Atlantic Council,
NATO warned Russia that it would start admitting new members next
year whether or not Russia agreed to forge a privileged
partnership with NATO.
</P>
<P>
But in an attempt to calm down Russia's fears, United States
Secretary of State Warren Christopher gave an assurance that
nuclear weapons would not be deployed in Eastern and Central
Europe even after NATO admitted the ex-communist states. But the
statement stopped short of giving a formal guarantee.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: No More Hazardous Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Urgent action should be taken
to protect children's rights when millions of children in the
world are working under conditions of great stress and hazard,
UNICEF says in its annual report, the State of the World's
Children 1997.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, published here
today the annual report focusing mainly on child labor. According
to the report, there are 250 to 400 million children under 14
years old are involved in various types of labor and 73 million of
them are registered employees.
</P>
<P>
The report says that children work all over the world, in both
industrialized and developing countries, although most child labor
takes place in developing countries, refuting the myth that child
labor only happens in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the report gives an example, a high
proportion of children working in agriculture come from immigrant
or ethnic-minority families. In the industrialized world as a
whole, children of ethnic minorities or immigrant groups are those
most likely to do hazardous work, the report points out.
</P>
<P>
"Hazardous and exploitative child labor violates child rights
as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child." the
reports says. "Immediate action to eliminate such labor must be
guided by the best interests of the child."
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF report calls on the international community to
protect children's rights and to ensure that children's best
interests are taken into account when actions are undertaken for
them under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
"Governments must fulfill their responsibility to make relevant
primary education free and compulsory for all children and ensure
that all children attend primary school on a full-time basis until
completion," the report stresses.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Israel to Drop Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- France today urged Israel to
cancel its plan to build a Jewish settlement in an Arab
neighborhood of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the project will not be realized," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt, "The project risks
gravely jeopardizing the geographical make-up of East Jerusalem,
and therefore bringing a new attack to the status quo in the city."
</P>
<P>
An Israeli planning commission Tuesday approved the building of
132 housing units for Jews in the heart of Arab East Jerusalem,
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, The area is
regarded by Israel as its "eternal" capital, but is seen by the
Palestinians as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The plan, the first of its kind, has gained the go-ahead from
the Israeli Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 160,000 Jews living in East Jerusalem amid
about 155,000 Palestinians. The Ras Al-Amud district, where the
new housing units are to be built, has a Palestinian population of
11,000.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians and officials in Israel's former government
-- which rejected the plan -- have warned it could provoke a
violent outburst if implemented.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Resume Operations in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is preparing to fully resume its
operations in Afghanistan's capital of Kabul after the Taliban
militia released all members of its local staff.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia ruling Kabul also gave encouraging
indications that the commission's female employees would be
allowed to resume their work, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The last of UNHCR's four local staff arrested recently have
been released without charge.
</P>
<P>
The release marked the end of a crisis that had brought most of
UNHCR's programs in Kabul to a grinding halt.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has put most of its programs in Kabul on hold since
November 21 because the loss of half its staff meant it was unable
to function.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four arrested male staff, UNHCR's seven
female Afghan staff have not been allowed to work since September.
</P>
<P>
The other three UNHCR local staff, who were seized by armed men
as they left the UNHCR Kabul office on November 12, were released
ten days earlier, also without being charged.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that this marks a new beginning," Sri Wijeratne,
chief of UNHCR's Afghanistan operation, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have now received firm assurances from the Taliban
authorities that they will ensure the security of our staff in
future.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we all cooperate to alleviate the
miserable conditions under which so many of Kabul's inhabitants
are living," the chief said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting with UN officials in Kandahar in southern
Afghanistan, senior Taliban authorities promised to do their
utmost to solve the issue of the arrested staff as well as to
ensure the future security of UN employees working in
Taliban-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Many of UNHCR's programs are aimed at helping widows and
families headed by women, who cannot be properly served without
the help of women staff.

NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- India came from behind to

international exchanges and cooperation in this area.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Electric Car &AMP; Substitutional Fuel

the prospects for electric vehicles and substitutional fuel
vehicles because China is rich in natural gas and coal but has
relatively small reserves of crude oil.

<P>
On display are vehicles that are powered by electricity or burn
natural or liquefied gas instead of crude oil as fuel.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the vehicle manufacturers to continue their

not bring harms to the environment.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Welcomes Iraq's Re-Entry Into World Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today welcomed as a "very good development" the re-entry of
Iraq into the world oil market, saying this might lead to the
reduction of oil prices in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press conference in the Presidential
Palace, Ramos said that the oil-for-food program was resumed today
by the United Nations and Iraq can channel as much as two million
barrels of oil from Iraq alone into the oil market.
</P>
<P>
"There could be some price decline (for petroleum products in
the Philippines) and this is a very good development," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Congress leaders also announced that they
"have obtained" the assurance from the Energy Regulatory Board of
lower oil prices by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Ramos had recently approved a
countertrade proposal according to which the Philippines will
export food and medical supplies to Iraq in exchange for Iraqi
oil.
</P>
<P>
The counter trade, which was prepared by the Department of
Foreign Affairs, was endorsed by the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of foods and medical supplies will be undertaken
by the Philippine International Trading Corporation, which is
targeting 20 percent of the one billion U.S. dollar worth of oil
that Iraq is allowed to export every quarter.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been going up in the Philippines since the
country launched a partial deregulation of its oil industry last
August. According to new rules, local market can adjust oil prices
once a month within the limit of 50 centavos (1.9 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
Ramos said at today's conference that despite recent increases
in the oil prices as a result of the oil industry deregulation,
prices of prime commodities have remained stable in the country.
</P>
<P>
He added the government was able to keep the prices down
through effective monitoring as well as prudent fiscal management
which kept the inflation rate at a single-digit level.

<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- At least six more children died
while 24 others were hospitalized due to a measles outbreak in a
southern Philippine province last week, the Philippine News Agency
(PNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths in three remote villages in Cotabato Province
brought the death toll from measles to 31 in central Mindanao this
year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marlow Ninal, an official at the Health Department, was
quoted as saying the reported measles cases in the country this
year are far more "alarming" than previous years.
</P>
<P>
Department records showed that there were only 13 measles cases
in the country last year. But in central Mindanao alone, a total
of 746 measles cases have been reported this year.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said a medical team was immediately dispatched
to the area to prevent the spread of the disease to nearby
villages.
</P>
<P>
The team will conduct immediate immunization on the Manobo
people, especially children, living in Cotabato Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNA, 85 percent of the Manobo tribal people in
Cotabato failed to submit themselves to proper immunization
despite the country's massive immunization campaigns launched in
the past years.

joining of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, Hong Kong's economy after 1997, and strategic
partnerships between Hong Kong and South Korean companies for
doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of opportunities opening up for
both sides, as (South) Korea reduces its import tariffs and
liberalizes key trading sectors and as Hong Kong further
strengthens its position as Asia's business services hub and
gateway to the China market," Victor Fung, Chairman of the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is Hong Kong's sixth largest trading partner.
Annual bilateral trade stands at about 12 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative direct investment from South Korea in Hong Kong is
also growing strongly, from 79 million dollars in 1991 to 397
million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Business Round Table, jointly organized by the Korea
International Trade Association (KITA) and the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council, is an annual event held alternately between
South Korea and Hong Kong. The next meeting is to be held in Hong
Kong in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Calls for Stronger CPC Role in State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The new situation of overall
bolstering of the socialist modernization drive and speeding up
reforms and development of state-owned enterprises demands
reinforcement of the role of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
these firms.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, today made the remark at an
national work conference on the CPC's role in state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In his speech the senior CPC official urged the state-owned
firms to adhere to the political leadership of the Party and to
fully display the central role of the Party.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental solution to problems related to state-owned
firms lies in substantially pushing forward the reform and
strengthening management, but the key is to have good leadership,
Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier and Politburo Member Wu Bangguo also spoke at the
meeting, saying that the difficult task of retooling state-owned
enterprises can only be fulfiled under the leadership of the Party.
</P>
<P>
He called on officials at all levels to understand that the
ongoing restructuring of state enterprises needs to keep to the
creative road of reforming and developing state-owned firms with
Chinese own characteristics, through a combination of the
characteristics of modern enterprises and special advantages of
socialist enterprises.

Dai said that the state's financial difficulties can hardly be
overcome in a short period of time, and that the deficit is still
large, economic structure reforms are slow, and fixed asset
investments and growth in consumer funds still do not have
effective controls.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural base is still weak, causing inflation when
disasters occur, and with declining efficiency in state
enterprises, production and operation funds have to come mainly
from bank loans.
</P>
<P>
"All these have forced the central bank to increase the money
supply," Dai noted, adding that, "inflation will go up rapidly if
we do not give full attention to it."
</P>
<P>
One study has shown that the retail price index increased by
only 5.4 percent in 1992, but jumped to 13 percent the next
year. Dai urged all finance departments to learn a lesson from
this and to implement the money-tightening policy during the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that streamlining credit and adjusting the
economic structure will be key tasks next year for finance
departments, which should adopt the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Formulating a credit policy for the 1996-2000 period,
guiding finance departments in issuing loans in line with the
credit principle and with industrial, regional and technical
development policies;
</P>
<P>
-- Perfecting banking services;
</P>
<P>
-- Making full use of the state bank, reforming the investment
structure, and curbing lower level industrial construction
projects;
</P>
<P>
-- And banks should stop loaning money to people who have
diverted operating funds to fixed assets, and should gradually
recover that money.

<HEADLINE> International Symphony Year Ends in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Symphony
Orchestra, under the baton of Chen Xieyang, has rung down the
curtain on the '96 International Symphony Year.
</P>
<P>
At the finale last Saturday leading Chinese conductor Chen led
the orchestra to perform Verdi's "Overture to La Forza Del
Destino", Zhu Jian'er's tone-poem "A Wonder of Naxi" and
Shostakovich's "Symphony No. 10 in E Minor", which are very
different from each other in style.
</P>
<P>
In response to the audience's encores, the orchestra added
other Chinese and overseas musical masterpieces such as "Good
Tidings from Beijing".
</P>
<P>
The '96 International Symphony Year, sponsored by the Chinese
Ministry of Culture, has been the longest, largest and
highest-quality musical activity in this country for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the Ministry of Culture, during the
activity the Orchestra Nationale de France, the Philadelphia
Philharmonic, the Amsterdam Royal Concert Orchestra from the
Netherlands, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Chinese
National Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra
held a total of 12 concerts in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
They played to a total of more than 70,000 people in the
concert halls and enthralled tens of millions of TV viewers
throughout the country. Even Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng attended some concerts.
</P>
<P>
"It was meaningful that we held the closing ceremony in
Shanghai," said the officials, noting that Shanghai was the
birthplace of the symphony in China. In addition, the Shanghai
Symphony Orchestra has a history of 117 years, the longest
symphony tradition in China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi, other officials from the municipal
government, officials from the Ministry of Culture and celebrities

<HEADLINE> 10 Drug Traffickers Sentenced in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ten Kenyans charged with
trafficking in hashish have been sentenced to a total of 125
years imprisonment and ordered to pay a total fine of five
million Kenyan Shillings (about 90,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to local news reports today, the 10 people were
found guilty of having trafficked 20 tons of hashish worth about
360 million US Dollars between April 4 and 6 this year at Kinondo
Beach near the coast town of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Mombasa Chief Magistrate Aggrey Muchelule said
on Tuesday that Captain Ali Bin Ali of the hashish ferrying
vessel Al Husna and Co-captain Shee Obo Mohamed got 25 and 20
years of jail respectively, and the remaining accused 10 years of
jail each.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Muchelule decried the "power of the drug barons in
the country", noting that the Mafia-like gangs seem to command a
lot of power and connections.
</P>
<P>
He said there are indications that some senior police officers
were deeply involved in the drug deal and the case had been
interfered with "by the Mafia and riddled with police cover-up".
</P>
<P>
Police officers, administration and even customs officials
were in the pay-roll of drug barons, the Mombasa magistrate
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that drug barons are so powerful that "they
arranged for the transfer of the then (police) officer commanding
Diani station to another police station even after he had been
implicated in the drug trafficking."
</P>
<P>
The ruling by a Mombasa court ended an eight-month trial in
which two Kenyans were unconditionally released for lack of
evidence.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Calls For Spirit of Compromise At WTO MC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore, host of the first
World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference (WTO MC), called
here today on participating WTO members to work in the spirit of
compromise and reach agreement on issues still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, who is
also Chairman of the current WTO MC, said tonight at a dinner
hosted by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, that he hoped the
traditional GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) spirit
of compromise would continue to prevail in the remaining days of
this Conference.
</P>
<P>
The WTO MC started on Monday with trade ministers from the 128
WTO members attending to try to review the implementation of the
Uruguay Round commitments to trade liberalization and conduct
negotiations on the unfinished business and some new issues.
</P>
<P>
Hard bargaining has been going in the last three days of the
meeting and no agreement has been reached in any front as yet. The
Conference is to come to a close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Given that all the WTO members attach "the utmost importance"
to the multilateral trading system, Mr Yeo said, "it is therefore
in our collective interest to ensure the health of the
multilateral trading system as we approach the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
"We must first reach agreement on the issues still unresolved,"
he said, noting the intensive consultations among all the
delegations in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
"We have made significant progress in narrowing our differences
on the outstanding issues, but there is still some way to go
before we can relax," he said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the participating delegations have been working hard
on drafting a final declaration, a document which is intended as a
blueprint consolidating agreements already concluded in the
1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade talks, in areas ranging from
tariffs on industrial goods to services, agricultural products and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, negotiators have been stuck in arduous
multilateral and bilateral talks, which sometimes were conducted
late into the nights, over whether to include a reference to core
labor standards in the document and whether it should include
provision for some discussion in the WTO on investment rules,
competition policies and government procurement.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean firms have invested
less money overseas since the second half of this year, reflecting
difficulties they are facing in raising money because of a
persistent business slowdown at home, the Finance and Economy
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Though the country received a 50.1 percent increase of overseas
direct investments amounting to 2.85 billion U.S. dollars in the
first half of this year, it was disappointed during the
July-October period as the investments grew only 4.6 percent, to
1.78 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the 4.63 billion dollars overseas direct investments
in the first 10 months was 31.8 percent up from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
In October alone, overseas investments came to only 408 million
dollars, down 50.5 percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Direct investments in China, South Korea's largest investment
country abroad, amounted to 1.35 billion dollars during the first
10 months of this year, representing 29.2 percent of the total
investments.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, South Korea's cumulative overseas direct
investments approved had climbed to 17.79 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Reserves Sufficient: Central Bank Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange
reserves are "adequate but not excessive", Dai Xianglong, governor
of the People's Bank of China said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Because foreign exchange has to be purchased with renminbi, an
increase in foreign exchange reserves means a drain on currency.
The result is inflationary pressures, Dai said, in an interview
with Xinhua about China's current financial situation and credit
policy for 1997.
</P>
<P>
China now ranks second in the world in terms of foreign
exchange reserves, standing at 110 billion US dollars. Such an
amount is necessary for China, he said.
</P>
<P>
In talking about the relations between direct fund-raising and
indirect fund-raising, Dai said that the latter has become the
principal form in China and will remain so for a long period of
time, because of historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that China totally rejects the direct form,
however, and the country's state-owned enterprises now lack funds
for development and have a high liability rate.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that it is wrong to rely on increased bank loans to
help state-owned firms get through their difficulties. Direct
fund-raising is a matter of necessity.
</P>
<P>
This has developed rapidly in China in the past few years, and
by the end of October, the country had 466 listed companies with a
total of 102.4 billion shares, with a market value of 980 billion
yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies raised 82 billion yuan by issuing bonds
during the country's Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-95).
</P>
<P>
Direct fund-raising should operate in accordance with the
principle of steady development, strict management and in an
orderly way, Dai emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The major task is to specify exactly how direct fund-raising
should be managed, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up Unified Pension Insurance System Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to set up a
unified pension insurance system in most parts of the country in
1997, Minister of Labor Li Boyong said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry has won the approval of the State Council to
unify the pension insurance system across the country, and try to
complete the collection of pension insurance funds at the
provincial level before the end of the year 2000," Li told a
three-day national conference on labor work, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, the transition to the unified pension insurance
system should be accomplished within 1997, but certain areas can
be given an extension of one year if they can obtain the State
Council's consent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the proportion of individual payments into
the pension insurance fund will also be raised.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997 pension insurance money paid by individuals should be
at least four percent of each person's salary," he explained.
"From 1998 the ratio will increase by one percentage point every
two years, until it reaches eight percent of the individual's
salary."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of proper management of the pension
insurance fund, which he said must not be used for any form of
investment except the purchase of state treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
"Supervisory institutions should be set up in localities to
guarantee the absolute integrity of the fund," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that employees of enterprises of non-public
ownership should be brought under the coverage of the pension
insurance scheme as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 87.4 million Chinese people, 22.74
million of whom are retirees, have joined the pension insurance
scheme.
</P>
<P>
However, one fourth of the country's urban employees still
remain outside it. Most of them are workers in overseas-funded or
private enterprises, self-employed businessmen or rural laborers
working in cities.

MAPUTO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The crops of about 40,000
hectares in central Mozambique were seriously damaged by red
locusts, the local newspaper "Noticias" reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed on Tuesday by Paulino Duamba, an official

locust-plagued zones are spotted, with one in central Mozambique
and another in Niassa Province.
</P>
<P>
But up to now, the plague of locusts in central Mozambique has
been eased and clouds of locusts have almost vanished from the
region after the plan of spraying insecticide by air was
implemented, Duamba said.
</P>
<P>
At present, people in the locust-strickenure areas are preparing
to carry out a plan of killing locusts on the ground, he said,
acknowledging that it is not easy to totally eliminate the
locusts because they have strong reproductive ability.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are seven locust-plagued zones in
southern Africa, including two in Mozambique.

M2 supply to around 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank will continue to reform its macro-economic
controls. It will use interest rates as a lever to control the
currency supply, and will perfect the reserve fund system, develop
the market and the discount business, and use more indirect
controls of central bank capital, in accordance with price changes
and capital supply fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on why China will continue its moderately tight
money supply policy next year, Dai said that although China's
macro-economic conditions are having their best period in recent
years, causes of inflation, and of "low efficiency, excess
distribution, and soft restraints", has still not been removed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The ministries of public
security and civil affairs have issued a new regulation on
compensation for the families of policemen who are killed in the
line of duty.
</P>
<P>
It is China's first specific compensation regulation for

</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Ministry of Public Security said the
adoption of the regulation is aimed at encouraging policemen to
devote themselves to their duties and assisting their families.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Sponsor Stewart-Ford in Formula One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
Wednesday decided to sponsor Britain's Stewart-Ford racing team in
the Formula One world championship for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The sponsorship will cost 8.2 million dollars a season,
Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik said after a
cabinet meeting, according to a report here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia last month tied up with the Stewart-Ford team to
promote the country through the 17-race championship which held
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The team, which is owned by former world champion Jackie
Stewart, will enter the world championship next season, starting
in Australia in March.
</P>
<P>
One of the Stewart-Ford cars with a "Visit Malaysia" logo
displayed on the rear wing and nose cone was unveiled in London on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the first country to become directly involved in
sponsoring motor sport. Sponsorship is largely made by oil and
cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said the government's
backing would boost Malaysia's plans to host a Grand Prix in
1999.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Target for 1997 Labor Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China in 1997 will try to
employ eight million new urban laborers, and help 2.5 million
unemployed people and laid-off workers to find new jobs, so as to
keep the urban unemployment rate at three percent or so, Minister
of Labor Li Boyong said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to a three-day national conference on
labor work that opened today, Li described the promotion of
employment as the first priority of all labor departments across
the country in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
In the latter part of this year, he said, the country's
employment situation has remained stable, with the urban
unemployment rate controlled at under three percent.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, 200 cities in 22 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities have started the so-called 're-employment
project', which has helped 1.5 million laid-off workers to find
new jobs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, the overheated growth of salaries has to
some extent been halted through powerful government macro-control,
while the social security system has enjoyed steady development.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that labor work in 1997 will face more
difficulties, especially with the deepening of state enterprise
reforms and the strengthening of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are four major factors that can have
negative effects on the country's employment situation, and they
include steady increase of urban unemployment, flood of surplus
rural labor, lack of job opportunities in some industries and
regions, and obsolete concepts of job selection among some sectors
of society.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve our target for the next year labor departments at
all levels must spare no efforts to score achievements in
overcoming these difficulties," he told the conference.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Refuses to Sign Anti-Charter Change Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today brushed off a challenge to show his opposition to the
lifting of his term limits by signing a petition against changes
the country's constitution, which limits presidents to one
six-year term of office.
</P>
<P>
"Why should I?" the president asked. "I have said before that I
will not run again. But for me to respond to the call to put it in
writing is, I think, unbecoming of me to do so and unbecoming of
them to ask me to do so."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his top concern in 1998 is not the
presidential elections but "the generation of support" for the
centennial of the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos also said he will not personally meet
with the leaders of the People's Initiative for Reform,
Modernization and Action (PIRMA), which calls for changes in the
constitution to allow Ramos and other elective officials to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
The petition for a plebiscite on such change will depend on the
Commission on Elections (Comelec) that is constitutional "to
undertake and service petitions of this nature that are properly
registered and recognized," the president said.
</P>
<P>
It is now up to the PIRMA and the Comelec "to convince each
other that the petition is valid and must be recognized and given
due process," he said.
</P>
<P>
A group of congressmen Monday launched a signature drive
against the constitutional amendment campaign of the PIRMA and
they challenged Ramos to prove the sincerity of his opposition to
such change by signing their petition.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Preparatory Labor System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to establish
a preparatory labor system, which the government believes will help
ease the pressure of unemployment and improve the general quality
of the country's huge work force.
</P>
<P>
Under this system, all middle school graduates, except those
from vocational schools, must receive one to three years of
vocational training and guidance before they can get job
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaojian, director of the department for developing
vocational skills under the Ministry of Labor, said that the
system will help delay the employment of new laborers, who are
vying for limited job opportunities with laid-off workers from
money-losing state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"It is also an effective way to reduce the employers' training
expenses, and lessen the risk for new workers of losing their jobs
for lack of skills," he added.
</P>
<P>
Experiments in this system are due to start early next year in
30 cities and regions across the country.
</P>
<P>
China currently has over 4,500 technical schools, and more than
2,700 employment training centers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's Brain Exodus Causes Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The ever-continuing
brain drain from South Africa has reportedly caused serious
concern to all levels of the government.
</P>
<P>
The official figures showed that almost as many as three times
people emigrated out of the country compared to those immigrated
in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,600 South Africans, mainly the highly-skilled
white professionals, left the country during the first half of
1996, while the number of immigrants was about 2,500, according
to figures released by the Central Statistical Service (CSS) in
October.
</P>
<P>
The net loss of the economically active people leaving South
Africa was nearly three times more than those who entered the
country to try their luck, a 23.6 percent increase compared with
the corresponding period of last year, said the CSS.
</P>
<P>
Those leaving South Africa to start new lives overseas were
almost all professional, semi-professional and technical people,
including well-trained and good-experienced engineers,
accountants, managerial and clerical staff, technologists,
educationists, doctors and dentists.
</P>
<P>
The ever-increasing exodus of skilled whites, a trend
beginning in late 1993 ahead of of the general elections in April
1994, has caused great concern to the government, with President
Nelson Mandela repeatedly calling on the whites to stay in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mandela time and again urged his black
supporters to make whites feel they belong to the country, saying
pushing whites aside was fatal. "that's suicide," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mandela also called on whites to share
their knowledge and expertise with other population groups, which
denied such opportunities during the apartheid-era, saying they
had an important role to play in building the nation.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the wide and profound effect brought
about by the exodus of skilled Whites, whose skills the country
desperately need, the President stressed that "we must stop this
brain drain of people leaving our country."
</P>
<P>
High crime rate, deterioration in basic service, seeking for
higher salary for the work and better working conditions are
among the main reasons for those skilled professionals leaving
the country, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Citing Johannesburg for an example, with an estimated 52
murders per day, the biggest economic, financial and industrial
center of the country won the title of "capital of murder" in the
world.
</P>
<P>
With car hijacking, murder and rape, armed robbery running the
front pages of the local newspapers, the police seem powerless to
curb the rampant crime that makes South Africa the most violent
in the world outside a war zone.
</P>
<P>
Just as a newspaper comment put it: if people do not feel
safe, if they fear their cars will be hijacked in their driveways
with the hijackers having guns they will not hesitate to use, if
they fear that armed men who break into their homes could kill
them while stealing their jewellery and other valuables and
possessions, they will decide to go away and leave this country.
</P>
<P>
Another major concern for whites emigrating is the Affirmative
Action in the public service and parastatals, introduced by the
African National Congress as a milestone of its policy since its
coming into power after 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
The whites claimed that the blacks were favored in seeking
employment and promotion in government and parastatals, with
lowing standards and under the cloak of job equity.
</P>
<P>
As for their children, parents see a lowering of educational
standards at schools, health-care at hospitals as a main
consideration in making their decision to leave the country.

<HEADLINE> Unit Trust Fund Sales Hit Record high in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The unit trust industry
registered gross sales of 3.78 billion U.S. dollars in the first
ten months of 1996, the highest year-to-date figure on record,
according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
Net sales were also at a record high of 726.48 million dollars,
exceeding the second highest figure, which was recorded for the
corresponding period in 1993, by over 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sales figures, Mr Andrew Lo, Chairman of the
HKIFA said, "We are pleased to note that the industry has enjoyed
substantial growth this year, evidenced by the robust gross and
net sales figures."
</P>
<P>
"Strong sales can probably be attributed to the fact that the
US is enjoying a benign, albeit steady growth. This has instilled
much optimism in the market about the outlook of interest rates
and has led to falling bond yields and the continuous rally in Dow
Jones and a number of the key equities markets.
</P>
<P>
Among the different fund sectors, the international/others
(equity/managed) sector and the two Asian sectors managed to
attract the highest net inflows.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA release also showed that Hong Kong equity funds
represented the best performing Asian equity sector up to
November. It had almost invariably stayed in the top five in
almost all of the first eleven months.
</P>
<P>
At the end of November, it came second with an annual return of
44.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 45 fund companies as full members, and 34
professional firms, which include trustees, accountants and
lawyers as associate members.

<HEADLINE> Financial Operation Remains Stable in China, Says Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of China's central
bank said today that macro control, which lists curbing inflation
as its main task, has basically met its pre-set target after more
than three years' hard work, and that the country's current
financial operation is maintaining a stable development trend.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said in
an interview with Xinhua that the outlook is promising for the
country's financial situation, as money supply is gradually
nearing the target designated for overall financial control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, great improvements in macro control, obvious
adjustments in the credit structure and a sustained increase in
the country's foreign exchange reserve, with a stable exchange
rate, are also on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, the amount of cash floated for all
of 1996 is expected to increase by 13 percent by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, loans from Chinese banks will increase by about
1,000 billion yuan, a rise of 66 billion yuan, or 20 percent over
last year's standard.
</P>
<P>
Among these, loans made by the state banks increased by 800
billion yuan, up 100 billion yuan, or 21 percent over the
corresponding figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, while firmly controlling the
gross volume of the credit scale, the central bank has met its
pre-set goal by actively using many different funding policies and
means to regulate the volume of the money supply, effectively
preventing its over-shrinkage or over-expansion.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has stopped providing subsidies for long- and
medium-term deposits, and has twice lowered interest rates for
deposit savings, reporting good results from the actions. As a
result, enterprises can reduce by more than 100 billion yuan the
funds needed to pay off interest expenditures in a year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also adjusted its money structure and
advanced the sale of commodities.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that an average of 10 percent of the annually
increased loans in the past three years has gone for agriculture,
effectively supporting the production and supply of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the loans for industrial
circulating funds have been given to state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises that report good economic efficiency, Dai
said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's current foreign exchange reserve has exceeded
100 billion US dollars, and the country has realized free
conversion between Chinese currency and foreign exchanges under
regular programs.

<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- About 60 percent of Nigeria's
more than 100 million population are hungry and malnourished,
mostly women and children, "Daily Times", the biggest newspaper
of the country, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Agriculture Minister Alhaji Muhammadu
Gambo as saying that 91 out of every 1,000 children in Nigeria
die of malnutrition yearly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, under five years old mortality and maternal
mortality stand at 100 per 1,000 and 1,500 in 100,000
respectively, the minister told a nutrition workshop held Tuesday
in Katsina, northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is urgent need to redress the situation by
producing more food, reducing post harvest losses and granting
access to all Nigerians to balanced food at affordable prices, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government has intensified
production of roots and tubers, cereals, fruits and vegetables,
fish and livestock in a bid to fight malnutrition due to vitamin
a deficiency, iron deficiency, anaemia and iodine deficiency
disorders.

<HEADLINE> Treason Trial to Start in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Treason trial involving nine
soldiers will begin next week, a magistrate court here ruled on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State radio reported today that the nine including a Major and
one female soldier made a brief appearance in court Tuesday.
They will be put on trial on December 19, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Major was identified as Johnny Paul Koroma while the woman
was named as Omopeh Bangura.
</P>
<P>
State lawyers alleged that the accused conspired to overthrow
the Sierra Leone government by force and attack the presidential
convoy on its way to work on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, the accused planned to blockade
the military headquarters in Freetown, and arrest all senior
military officers to prevent them from foiling the coup plot.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution cited several meetings held by the plotters in
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
One of the accused, warrant officer Idrissa Kamara would have
read a statement on radio announcing the coup.
</P>
<P>
The female soldier, Omopeh Bangura was charged because she
failed to report the coup plot to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The accused were among 17 suspects arrested last September
after the coup plot was leaked to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Six state lawyers are representing the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
One of the accused, Salifu Mansaray, according to the
authoritative Expo Times, claimed he had been tortured during
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The coup plot investigations were undertaken by Nigerian
security officials.
</P>
<P>
All the accused were dressed in military uniforms and
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
Ten names were listed to be charged but one of them, Lamin
Kamara, died in custody in November.

MOGADISHU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and three others wounded during a shootout at Florence
checkpoint in central Mogadishu today.
</P>
<P>
The shooting between militiamen supporting South Mogadishu
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid sparked off after a group of
heavily armed men had tried to dislodge the other militiamen from
the lucrative checkpoint which is one of the main channels
connecting South and North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The shooting died down after the original militiamen who
manned the checkpoint had managed to resist the attackers who
fled the area.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, all the deceased were military
servicemen while the wounded were civilians caught in the cross
fire.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in two days that armed clashes

<HEADLINE> China's "Strike Hard" Campaign Brings Crime Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A nation-wide, seven-month
crackdown on crime by police has brought China's rising crime rate
down and made the public feel "much safer," a senior police
official in Beijing said today.
</P>
<P>
There were 3.1 percent fewer crimes reported to police bureaus
in the first ten months of this year than during the same period
last year, according to Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of public
security.
</P>
<P>
Bai was presenting a report to deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC), who are making an inspection tour of
Beijing in preparation for the Eighth NPC's Fifth Plenum next
March.
</P>
<P>
Major criminal offenses have been on the rise, but the rate was
12 percentage lower than that for the corresponding period of
1995, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "The rising trend in crime has been effectively
controlled by the anti-crime campaign, a large number of criminal
cases have been solved, and a large number of criminals arrested
and crime rings broken."
</P>
<P>
"The toughness of the strike and its powerful impact has
increased the public's sense of safety and put fear in potential
wrong-doers, putting a stop to vice, and once again boosting
public morale and encouraging them to participate in the fight
against crime," Bai told the NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
"A number of surveys in various places show that the public
feel much safer after the anti-crime campaign," he noted. He then
went on to explain how the "strike hard" has been more successful
than the many previous campaigns.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the fact that it was under more unified
leadership by central party and government authorities and because
of the tireless work of policemen and other law-enforcement
personnel, as well as the public's more active involvement.
</P>
<P>
"Strike hard" started in April this year with the goal of
"stopping the deterioration of public order in some places", as a
joint action by the police, procurators and judges under the
direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
This type of campaign is usually characterized by long hours
for law-enforcement personnel, swift reaction to emergency
situations, and harsher penalties meted out in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
However, "In spite of the unquestionable success of the
campaign," Bai noted, "the public security situation is still far
from satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Some hard core criminals will still defy the crackdown and
commit crimes, and public security problems in some places have
not been rooted out, and the successes may be only temporary, he
explained. Therefore, the 'strike hard' campaign will continue
without let-up, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A "winter action" campaign as a part of this has begun across
the country to stop those who might want to take advantage of the
coming Spring Festival to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a resurgence in the crime rate, China is also making
an effort to come up with an anti-crime mechanism, known as
"comprehensive control on public security", which will allow for
faster police reaction, improving safety around public housing,
and wide community involvement in the fight against pornography,
gambling, drugs and other social vices.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Has Second Term in Pocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's incumbent President
Jerry Rawlings already has a second term in pocket, though only
three-quarters of last Saturday's presidential and parliamentary
elections have been out, latest report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Of the votes counted so far, Rawlings won 3,593,221, or 56
percent of the total votes cast.
</P>
<P>
His main rival, John Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party (NPP)
took 2,628,628, or 41 percent of the total votes. The third
candidate, Edward Mahama of the People's National Convention
(PNC), was trailing behind with 189,037 votes, or 2.1 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings' National Democratic Party also won in the
parliamentary election by a majority of 117 seats of a total of
200, while the NPP took 57, and the PNC four.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings' won a majority of votes in all except the Ashanti
region, which is Kufuor's stronghold, but even in that region,
Rawlings won a third of confirmed valid votes. He took an
overwhelming majority of 96 percent in the Vokta region, his own
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings' polices, embodied in his slogan "always for
development, always for people" is believed' to have won the
support of the people for him, while the inability of the
opposition to present a united front in the elections also helped
him, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the election results yesterday, Kufuor told his
supporters to remain calm, though his supporters have faulted the
results, saying under-aged persons and foreigners were among
those who voted, a clear breach of the electoral laws.
</P>
<P>
Kufuor has earlier told the international media that if the
trend of Rawlings' lead continues and he loses the election, he
would respect the traditional ways, meaning he has confidence in
the judgement of the electoral committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral commission, about 80 percent of the
over nine million registered voters voted in Saturday's
elections, while foreign polls observers has praised the conduct
of the election, describing it as one of the best organized in
the region.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to earliers fears that it might be marred by
violence, reports said the elections has been peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity observers
have paid tribute to the organization and conduct of the
elections, saying: "we believe that the conditions existed for a
free expression of will by the electors."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Obtains Export orders From Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Five major Zambian
manufacturing companies have obtained export orders totalling 4.4
million U.S. Dollars after participating in a trade and
investment exposition last month.
</P>
<P>
Trade statistics from the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) shows
that there is great potential for Zambian exports to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border trade between the two countries is expected
to be boosted.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for Zambian exports like foodstuffs,
crops seeds, building materials, telephone and power cables,
garments, sugar and educational books to Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, the current volume of the trade between the two
nations is low because of poor transportation, which has led to
high landed costs of exports. The Benguela railway line was
extensively damaged during the civil war in Angola and was no
longer in use while the road between Kaoma and the port of Lobito
bala in Angola is unsafe because of land-mines and
banditry.
</P>
<P>
Other possiblees export routes through South Africa and
Namibia are uneconomical owing to high transportation costs.

BONN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Olympic sensation Michelle Smith
of Ireland, who won three individual swimming gold medals in
Atlanta, is missing from the European short-course championships
which start in Rostock, Germany Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also absent after a strenuous Olympic year are Russian stars
Alexander Popov andt Denis Pankratov and Germany's Franziska Van
Almsick.
</P>
<P>
Another German, Antje Buschchulte, could shine in their
absence. The 17-year-old, sixth in the Olympic 100m backstroke
final, has been close to both the 200m freestyle and 200m
backstroke world records.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Emiliano Brembilla, 18, will also be looking to make
real progress after finishing fourth in the 400m and 1,500m
freestyle races in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Mark Foster, 26, will be out to make amends for a
disappointing Games. The world short-course sprint champion and
50m butterfly world record holder was last in the B final at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Buschchulte will have been motivated by another

<HEADLINE> Japan to Liberalize Auto, Fire Insurance Rates in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan has proposed to the United
States that Tokyo fully liberalizes premium rates for automobile
and fire insurance policies in 1998, the Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japan hopes the proposal will clear the way for the two
countries to settle their protracted insurance dispute at talks to
be held in Tokyo on Saturday between Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka and acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, the news service said.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsuzuka-Barshefsky talks will take place the day before
the self-imposed December 15 deadline for settlement of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains that Japan would violate a 1994
bilateral accord by opening up the so-called "third" sector of its
insurance market before fully deregulating the primary life and
non-life sectors, which are dominated by domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
Japan should first fully deregulate its primary sectors, the
U.S. side said.
</P>
<P>
The third sector, which covers cancer, personal accident, and
other insurance products that fall into the grey zone between the
two primary sectors, is the major source of earnings for foreign
insurers operating in Japan, although it accounts for only 5
percent of the overall Japanese insurance market.
</P>
<P>
On the deregulation of auto insurance, the Japanese proposal
calls for allowing non-life insurance in principle to freely set
premium rates on the basis of various risk factors, including age,
gender, region and accident records, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
It said the step is expected to lead to lower premiums for
drivers with no accident record and those aged over 30, while
raising rates for younger drivers.
</P>
<P>
Since there remains strong opposition to the proposal in
Japan's non-life insurance sector, it may take some time for the
finance ministry to coordinate views with the industry, Kyodo
said.

NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway All India
Indira Congress (Tiwari) today decided to merge with the Indian
National Congress (the Congress Party) without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken unanimously at its working committee
meeting here, party President N.D. Tiwari and working president
Arjun Singh told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The All India Indira Congress split from the parent body in May
1995 following differences over party policies and programs under

Rao.
</P>
<P>
Tiwari and Singh had made it clear that they would not return
to the party fold so far as Rao was the president.
</P>
<P>
The merger is believed to be a major victory for interim
Congress president Sitaram Kesri who has been carrying out a unity
drive to revive the 111-year-old Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Kesri succeeded Rao a few months ago after the latter resigned
from the Congress Party presidentship over his involvement in a

<HEADLINE> Hyperactive Syndrome Clings to Sufferers in Adulthood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A survey by the Mental Health
Center in Shanghai shows that children who suffer from
hyperactivity are more likely to behave wilfully or act on impulse
when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
Hyperactivity is a minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) that only
occurs in children, causing them to be excessively active.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the center have been following 242 MBD children
for 15 years, making a comparative study between them and
non-hyperactive people of the same age.
</P>
<P>
Study results reveal that 70 percent of the group are still
excessively active, behave wilfully and often can not concentrate
after they enter adulthood. When dealing with problems, they often
act on impulse.
</P>
<P>
In the control group, only 10 percent of the people exhibited
such behavior.
</P>
<P>
Very few of the hyperactive children in the study became
scientists, doctors or engineers later in their lives. Many took
jobs as workers, drivers, postmen and peddlers, according to
"Health News."
</P>
<P>
Surveys carried out in many cities across the country showed
that at least one to five percent of the primary school children
had the symptoms. But most of the signs diminished as the
youngsters grew up.
</P>
<P>
However, 70 percent still suffered from at least one of the
symptoms in adulthood; only one-third of the children were
reported to have shed all of the symptoms later in life.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that parents and school authorities should
encourage children who show signs of hyperactivity to get early
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Japan's October Current Account Surplus Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
for October fell 19.6 percent from a year earlier to 3.34 billion
U.S. dollars, the finance ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In trade of goods and services, the country's surplus plunged
92.8 percent to 102 million dollars, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus dropped amid strong imports of crude oil and
computers as well as a rise in spending by Japanese travelling
abroad, it said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's monthly current account surplus has continued to
fall since December 1994 except in August 1995. October's
19.6-percent fall, however, was the smallest in seven months as
automobiles and other exports rose amid the yen's weakness against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Japan posted a surplus of 6.08 billion dollars in merchandise
trade in the month, with exports surging 12.7 percent to 35.10
billion dollars, and imports advancing 19.7 percent to 29.02
billion dollars, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Service trade, meanwhile, left a deficit of 5.98 billion
dollars, compared with the 5.48-billion-dollar deficit a year
before, it said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns GCC's Stance on Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
Tuesday severely condemned the stance taken by the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) toward Iran at the Doha summit held on
December 7-9, local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government said the "Doha summit has served the
Israeli regime and alien forces to attain their goals in the
Persian Gulf region," according to today's English-language daily
Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
The GCC's final statement expressed concern over Iran's
deployment of missiles in the region, saying "it poses a threat
to the security and stability of neighboring states."
</P>
<P>
In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that
it is the legitimate right of Iran to guarantee security in the
Persian Gulf as an important international waterway.
</P>
<P>
The daily claims "Iran is the main source of stability in the
region. If there is no security for Iran, there cannot be
security for any other state in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iranian Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani admitted at a
press conference that the Iranian army has already deployed
missile bases on some islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in the statement said that Iran is
not only a signatory to international conventions on
non-production and non-proliferation of the weapons of mass
destruction, but also a pioneer for eradication of such weapons
in the region.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran strongly supports the non-proliferation and
total elimination of weapons of mass destruction from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused Gulf states of triggering an arms
race in the region by contracting huge weapons deals with the
western powers and by building military bases on their
soil.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1981, the GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain boycotted the summit due to its long-standing dispute
with host Qatar over the Hawar islands and sandbanks in the
area.

<HEADLINE> MOF to Liberalize Auto and Fire Insurance Premiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan is to fully deregulate
automobile and fire insurance premiums in 1998 in an effort to
clear the way for a Japan-U.S. agreement in the protracted
bilateral insurance row, two Japanese newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service quoted the Nihon Keizai Shimbun as saying
that Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka will propose the plan
during talks with acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky in Tokyo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the deregulation would enable insurers to set
their own premiums for such policies.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi Shimbun said the liberalization plan was presented
at bilateral ministerial insurance talks held Friday and
Saturday. Negotiators of the two countries declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese proposal is in response to U.S. demands for more
deregulation in Japan's life and nonlife insurance markets, in
particular for flexible auto insurance premiums based on age, sex
and region, the dailies said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Papers Hail Tung Chee Hwa's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Local Chinese newspapers
today hailed the selection of Tung Chee Hwa as the candidate for
the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao rolled out an extra at lunch time with a red banner
headline "Chief Executive: Tung Chee Hwa."
</P>
<P>
Two local evening papers also gave frontpage coverage to the
selection of Tung, who won the race with an overwhelming majority
of 320 votes from the 400-strong Selection Committee this morning.
</P>
<P>
Tung is still waiting for appointment by the Central People's
Government in Beijing to be the Chief Executive designate before
assuming office on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tai Kung Pao says in its commentary: "Tung is the first
administrative leader selected by Hong Kong people themselves in
Hong Kong's history."  The entire selection process embodied the
democratic, open and just spirit. "It is the first time for Hong
Kong people to enjoy true democracy in political participation."
</P>
<P>
The New Evening Post says that today's election means that the
150-year colonial rule will soon come to an end, and Hong Kong is
opening a new page in its history. The selection process of the
candidate for the first Chief Executive, which is open, just and
fair, is a good beginning of Hong Kong's move towards true
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Evening News says that from today on Hong Kong people
started to be masters of their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Local papers pin high hopes on the candidate. Ta Kung Pao
expects him to fully implement the principles of "One country, Two
systems", "Hong Kong People running Hong Kong" and "a high degree
of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
The New Evening Post expresses the hope that the Chief
Executive can shoulder the historic responsibility of maintaining
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and work together with the 6
million local citizens to build a better Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Tops 14 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) announced here today that its offshore crude
output has topped 14 million tons since the beginning of this
year, a record high.
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of 66 percent over the 1995 figure
which stood at 8.41 million tons. CNOOC has produced three billion
cu m of natural gas offshore since the start of this year, showing
a seven-fold increase over the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
A senior CNOOC official told Xinhua today that through
large-scale Sino-foreign cooperation and CNOOC'S own efforts,
China's offshore crude production is entering a harvesting season,
which is making the most notable progress in its 14 years of
development.
</P>
<P>
So far, all of the country's 19 oil and gas fields operating
offshore are achieving remarkable results. The Yacheng 13-1 gas
field and Liuhua 11-1 oil field in the South China Sea are the
largest in China, which annually produce 3.4 billion cu m of gas
and 2.5 million tons of crude, respectively.
</P>
<P>
And China has by now discovered over 90 oil and gas bearing
structures and verified oil and gas geological reserves of 1.3
billion tons and 300 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
To date, CNOOC has signed 126 oil and gas contracts with 65
overseas oil companies from 18 countries and regions, absorbing a
total overseas investment of nearly six billion US dollars, which
has given a strong boost to China's offshore oil sector.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Warns Against "Undue Pressure" on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries should
not impose "undue pressure" on developing countries in
trade-related talks, the Malaysian representative said here today
at the ongoing ministerial conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"No undue pressure should be placed on countries to extract
more than what they can offer," Malaysian Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said at the plenary
session of the five-day conference that opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to enable the developing countries to positively
contribute towards the liberalization process, in particular in
the area of extended negotiations in financial services, maritime
transport and basic telecommunications, it is important that the
principle of progressive liberalization be fully adhered to and
respected," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that extraneous issues should not be allowed to
distract the WTO's focus away from the more important work
relating to completing and implementing the unfinished business
and the built-in agenda.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said she regretted to see that certain new issues have
taken the center stage of the WTO's first ministerial meeting at
the expense of the planned review process and the existing work
programs of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the attention given to the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) instead of to unfinished WTO issues,
such as sectoral negotiations on financial services, movement of
natural persons, basic telecommunications, and maritime transport
services.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Saudis to Reduce Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called on Saudi
Arabia to "slash production and stick to its 1990 quota" as Iraq
re-enters into oil market.
</P>
<P>
Local official English-language daily Iran News, in an
editorial today, said that "the most practical solution is to
revise oil production quotas."
</P>
<P>
The daily said "it was Saudi Arabia which in 1990 after an oil
embargo on Iraq pushed its production level up. For a safe and
secure market, Saudi Arabia should slash production and stick to
its 1990 quota."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the over quota production is the biggest
problem and the problem will multiply and the oil situation
could get depressed in the spring when demand drops sharply.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the daily expressed its welcome to Iraq's re-entry
into the oil market, saying "we welcome the long-awaited move by
the United Nations because it helps ease the sufferings of the
ordinary Iraqi people who were not responsible for their
government's blunder."
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal signed by U.N. and Iraq on May 20,
Baghdad can sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every six months
for the purchases of badly-needed food, medicine and other
necessities for its people suffering under the U.N. embargo
imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial noted that Iran should also receive
their due share of Iraqi compensation because Iraq fought a war
with Iran from 1980 to 1988.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Addresses U.S. Military Academy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese General Chi Haotian
spoke today at a top U.S. military academy, elaborating China's
defense policy, views on the so-called "China threat," position on
the issue of Taiwan and stand on the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi, vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission,
defense minister and state councillor, told more than 400 students
of the National Defense University, a cradle for generals, that
China follows a "defensive defense policy."
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy has four major elements, which are:
</P>
<P>
-- To consolidate national defense, resist foreign aggression,
safeguard state sovereignty over territorial land, air and waters
and maritime rights and interests and maintain national unity and
security.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army (PLA) follows a strategy of
"active defense."
</P>
<P>
-- To subordinate defense construction to and serve the
country's overall economic program.
</P>
<P>
-- To build a better force with Chinese characteristics. The
PLA is required to be a force with a high political standard, high
military capability, a fine style of work, strict discipline and
strong logistic support and,
</P>
<P>
-- To commit itself to world peace and human progress.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that China's defense policy with defensive nature is
adopted out of the need for safeguarding state sovereignty and
territorial integrity and maintaining lasting peace and stability
for the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that although China has never invaded any country, nor
has it stationed a single soldier abroad, "there are still some
people around the world who keep spreading the fallacy of 'China
threat', arguing that a stronger China will threaten others and
become a destabilizing factor in the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
"These people have ulterior motives," the Chinese general said,
"and they are not happy to see China in development and progress."
</P>
<P>
Recalling the contemporary history of China, he said that it
"teaches us that the miseries the Chinese people went through in
the recent past must not be repeated either in China or in any
other part of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Even if China becomes stronger in the future, it will never
embark on external aggression and expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan question is the key to and at the heart
of whether Sino-U.S. relations can be stable and grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
"Settling the Taiwan question is China's internal affair, and
the position of the Chinese Government in this regard can be
summed up as 'peaceful reunification based on one country, two
systems'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see a peaceful settlement yet refuse to renounce
the use of force," he added.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Taiwan authorities for their activities to
split the motherland, which caused tension in cross-Straits
relations, Chi said, "I would like to point out here that if those
elements on the island who are eager to see China dismembered and
themselves becoming more important ... cling to their wrong course
and slip further astray, the Chinese Government and people will
not sit idle by."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he expressed the hope that the United States
would abide by its commitments in the three Sino-U.S.
communiques. "I am confident that the American people, having
experienced the Civil War themselves, should and will understand
the resolve and determination of the Chinese people to safeguard
state unity and oppose national separation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chi said China has always attached importance to China-U.S.
relations believing that a stable and sound China-U.S.
relationship not only serves the fundamental interests of the two
peoples but also contributes to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is not surprising for us to have some disagreements, given
our differences in economic development levels, social and
political systems, cultural traditions and value judgment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has proved that as long as our two sides bear in mind
the fundamental interests of the two countries and adopt a correct
attitude of consultations on an equal footing and mutual respect, in
the spirit of 'enhancing confidence, reducing trouble, developing
cooperation and avoiding confrontation,' we will be able to
gradually iron out the specific problems in our bilateral
relations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chi also met with acting U.S. Secretary of State Strobr Talbott
today. They exchanged views on bilateral relations and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese visitor attended a breakfast meeting held in his
honor by David Abshire, president of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by some U.S. senators and
congressmen as well as other distinguished figures.

<HEADLINE> Thai Food Exporters Call for Boycott of EU Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters of frozen food
have launched a drive for a public boycott of imports from
European Union (EU) countries in retaliation against the EU's move
to cut tariff privileges on Thai seafood exports, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, spearheaded by the Thai Frozen Food Association,
reflects an escalation of the row on the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP) between the EU and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's new GSP policies to take effect on January 1
next year, privileges will be halved on some Thai seafood,
including shrimps -- Thailand's eighth largest foreign exchange
earner.
</P>
<P>
The EU also plans to entirely remove the privileges on January
1, 1998, which is expected to increase the price of Thai shrimp by
about five to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Frozen Food Association is urging people to stop
buying European whisky, wine and dairy products and switch to
similar goods from Australia and New Zealand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The association has asked the government to suspend its planned
purchase of Airbus from France and electric trains from Germany
and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Sithichai Kraisithirin, president of the association, said that
it is unfair for the EU to single out Thai products for the
privilege cuts, which has greatly impaired Thai products'
competitiveness on the European market.
</P>
<P>
The EU has argued that Thailand's economy is now among those
sufficiently developed and is not entitled to full privileges
intended for poorer nations.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Stay Longer in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
tourists are staying longer in the Three Gorges area, a tourist
attraction in China, than before.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the tourism department in central
China's Hubei Province, reveals that this year, the per tourist
visiting period in the province increased by a half day longer
than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, the province hosted 80,000 travelers
from China and abroad, down 3.3 percent over the same period last
year. But Hubei's tourism income and the number of nights guests
stayed in the province increased.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed this indicates that tourism in the Three Gorges
region is in the process of maturing. They attribute the change to
the improvement of transportation and the consolidating of tourism
activities in some scenic spots.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians to be Examined for Functional Literacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- About 400,000 people
are expected to be examined for functional literacy in Dar es
Salaam, capital of Tanzania in the first month of next year,
reported a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The exercise follows a directive by Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye to revive adult education classes in order to curb rising
illiteracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye has warned that the tendency would hamper development
efforts if not arrested in time.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Pudencia Kisaka, an officer of city adult
education as saying that among the estimated 700,000 illiterate
persons in the city, about 200,000 are attending adult education
classes in the three districts of Ilala, Kinondoni and Temeke at
present.
</P>
<P>
Kisaka said that only four years back, the city had only about
40,000 functional illiterates, but the figure has now multiplied
to an estimated 700,000 people who do not know how to read and
write properly.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the tremendous increase to migration of people
from villages in different parts of the country flocking to the
city.
</P>
<P>
A heightened pace of dropouts from school and the rise in the
number of street children who may not have been to school have
contributed to the number of the illiterates, she added.
</P>
<P>
She further noted that people who were examined for functional
literacy in the 1970s in the country and then abandoned adult
education classes similarly contributed to the increase in the
number of functional illiterates.

</P>
<P>

China's Guangdong Province will hold economic and trade promotion
activities for businesses attending the event.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu to Build Hi-tech Belt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, on the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, plans to build a hi-tech industrial
belt along the riverbank in eight cities.
</P>
<P>
The province, with comparatively higher economic and
technological levels, set up the country's first high-tech
industrial development belt in 1991, covering the Yangtze River
riparian cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou.
</P>
<P>
It now plans to add to the existing belt a new group of
riverbank cities including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou,
and Nantong.
</P>
<P>
A high-level official predicted that the new belt will become a
driving force for the province's economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the belt will mostly develop sectors
such as electric information, machinery and electrical
integration, new materials, and new medicines.
</P>
<P>
A group of specialized industrial parks will be built and
projects to upgrade techniques will be launched. By the year 2000,
the output of high-tech industries will account for 18-20 percent
of the belt's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province will complete 140 high-tech projects,
with investment of 1.94 billion yuan. After completion, the
projects will help the belt increase its annual output by 13.6
billion yuan, and bring in 1.68 billion yuan in post-tax profits.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Foreign Debts Surpass 100 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross foreign
debts exceeded 100 billion U.S. dollars in November this year, the
Finance and Economy Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's total foreign debts reached 92.6 billion dollars
by June from 78.98 billion dollars at the end of last year,
according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, external assets also recorded historic highs,
surging to 68.3 billion dollars in June this year, up from 60.7
billion dollars at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, South Korea's net foreign debts amounted to 24.3
billion dollars in June from last year's 18.19 billion dollars, a
record high since 32.5 billion dollars in 1986.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's gross foreign debts, which stood at 29.4 billion
dollars in 1989, soared to 56.8 billion dollars in 1994 and 78.4
billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts will continue to surge because the country must
borrow from overseas to pay back the principal and interest of its
debts, a ministry official said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Firm on Tokto Island: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will react firmly to
Japan's claim for sovereignty over the Tokto Island in the East
Sea (Sea of Japan) during the forthcoming summit of the two
countries, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won said today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reportedly said
Tuesday that he will raise the islet issue during the summit talks
with South Korean President Kim Young-sam to be held in Japan next
month.
</P>
<P>
"Should Japan take issue with the Tokto Island, we will firmly
react to it in accordance with our coherent position," Suh said.
</P>
<P>
The Tokto island is the undisputed territory of Korea from the
viewpoints of both history and international law, he said, adding
that the island is currently occupied by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
President Kim is scheduled for a working visit to Beppu, Oita
Prefecture, Kyushu Island of Japan, on January 25-26 next year in
return for Hashimoto's visit to South Korea's southern island
Cheju in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul-Tokyo territory dispute erupted last February when
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said that Tokto, called
Takeshima in Japanese, is part of Japanese territory, triggering
angry response from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it
will build a wharf on Tokto, a rocky islet with an area of 0.186
square kilometers which is about midway between South Korea and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Science Keeps Sustaining Agricultural Development in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Tibet's grain output is expected
to reach 770,000 tons this year, seven percent more than in 1995,
thanks to the widespread use of science and technology in the
region's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
1996 will be the ninth successive year Tibet has achieved a
good harvest.
</P>
<P>
An official from the agricultural department of the regional
government said that 20 percent of the region's grain output was
due to the application of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the first 11 months of this year, the
region held agro-tech training classes for 300,000 people, and
more than 2,000 technicians went to the rural areas to teach crop
production methods to farmers.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the success of Tibet's agriculture depended
mostly on the weather, as the farmers had little or no knowledge
of modern farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the region's agricultural scientists and
technicians focused their research on developing low-cost and
high-yield seeds suitable for the high plateaus, and many counties
have established agro-technology information centers.
</P>
<P>
So far, the region has introduced and developed 95 varieties of
quality seeds and sowed them in 70 percent of its farmland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the wide use of plastic sheeting and other
planting techniques used in crop or vegetable production on one
hectare of land has helped Tibetan farmers increase their income
by 45,000 yuan (5,600 U.S. dollars).

Bosnia-Herzegovina to join the NATO's Stabilization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
The batch comprising 36 officers and 279 men, part of the
908-strong Malcon III, departed from the Royal Malaysian Air Force
(RMAF) station in Subang, near here onboard a DC-10 aircraft
chartered from the Malaysia Airlines.
</P>

part of the outgoing NATO's peacekeeping contingent and whose
members will be returning in stages from Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 593 members of Malcon III will depart to Bosnia
before the end of the month, Army Chief Gen. Che Md Noor Mat
Arshad who saw the first batch off told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Malcon III is much smaller in number compared to the Malcon
II which is 1,533 member strong.
</P>
<P>
The smaller Malcon III was said to be in keeping with NATO's
decision to downsize its force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Malcon III will help the Bosnian government to maintain
peace, Colonel Ab Aziz said, adding the members had underwent a
three-month training in preparation for the tour of duty in

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran will pay a total of 5
billion U.S. dollars of debts in the next fiscal year starting
from March 21, 1997, local English language daily Iran News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt is one of the most serious problems the Iranian
government has faced in recent years. Iran ran into a huge amount
of debts which totaled 35 billion dollars in 1994. Now, most of
them have been rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Hamid Mirzadeh, Iranian Vice President and
Head of the Plan and Budget Organization, as saying that the
government predicts that its foreign exchange revenues from oil
sales would amount to 17.5 billion dollars while the oil-product
export will net 2 billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
"We also estimate to have 5-6 billion dollars of non-oil
exports next year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian vice president predicted a growth of 10 percent in
liquidity and said the amount of cash in circulation would remain
around 8,500-9,600 billion Iranian rials (2.83-3.2 billion
dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government is also expected to earmark a special
fund of 2,600 billion Iranian rials (866 million dollars) for
eradication of poverty and 6,000 billion Iranian rials (2 billion
dollars) for subsidies of basic consumer goods.

TIANJIN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A number of China's artists
plan to auction off their artwork to provide funds in support of a
museum in memory of the late premier Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng
Yingchao.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 paintings and calligraphic works donated by more

<P>
When Tianjin's municipal government recently announced its

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, the candidate
for the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), today called on Hong Kong people to
seek common ground and shelf differences and unite to create a
better future for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at lunch time, Tung said that he was
grateful to the 400-member Selection Committee for the First
Government of the HKSAR as well as to the 6 million Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held half an hour after he won the
race for the Chief Executive candidate at the third plenary
session of the Selection Committee this morning. He obtained 320
votes against Ti Liang Yang's 42 votes and Peter K.C. Woo's 36
votes.
</P>
<P>
Tung, 59, said, "I will not underestimate the difficulty of my
future job and challenges ahead, but I have full confidence in
Hong Kong's future."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will do his best to create a bright future for
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his sincere tribute to Peter K.C. Woo and Ti
Liang Yang, two other candidates in the election. He said that
they have set an example for the future generations in election.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that today's election marks the first step in the
process of Hong Kong's democracy, adding that it is the most
suitable step in Hong Kong's democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is important that we have a good beginning today
and in future, under the guideline of the Basic Law, we will
promote democracy step by step."
</P>
<P>
On the factors that have impacts on Hong Kong's success, Tung
said that in recent years, the Chinese mainland has achieved great
progress in economic development, which provides Hong Kong new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He also listed other favorable factors including Hong Kong's
legal structure, competitive spirit on a fair basis, and 180,000
clean civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"But we can never forget that Hong Kong's success is the result
of Hong Kong people's hard work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are also many problems for Hong Kong to
handle, such as housing problem, education, and welfare policy for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, the most important thing for Hong Kong is how to
ensure a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Now Hong Kong has a sound basis. With the
implementation of the Basic Law and the principle of 'One country,
Two systems', I believe that we can do better than ever."

 here to resume mediation in the Israeli-Palestinian talks,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a top U.S. official as saying that, despite
there appeared to be progress in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on the repeatedly-delayed Hebron redeployment, the
U.S. government has no immediate plan to send Ross back to the
region for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to Washington late October after one month of
fruitless mediation here aimed at finalizing an agreement
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) on the
long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city
of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Israel's position, the U.S. official said the
U.S. viewed the mediating role of Egypt more positively than
in the past. In an apparent snub to Cairo, Israel has just
turned down a request from Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa for a visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel, angered by Egypt's criticism of its hardline policies
that have stalled the peace process, rejects a more active role
of Egypt in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Instead, it
favors the contacts between the two countries to be held at a
lower level.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel is avoiding escalating tension with Cairo
by sending a senior official to Cairo today to discuss the
Hebron negotiations. Dore Gold, diplomatic adviser to Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, is traveling to Cairo to
hold meetings with Egyptian officials over the current deadlock
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, U.S. diplomats based in Israel have
been actively trying to arrange a summit between Netanyahu and
PA President Yasser Arafat in order to close the Hebron
deal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk and Consul-General in Jerusalem
Edward Abinton have held separate meetings with the two
leaders, but failed to secure the summit.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have said that they
expected to reach the Hebron deal before Christmas, but an
Arafat-Netanyahu summit seems to be indispensable to clear the
remaining obstacles blocking the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Yuan Stable After Current-Account Convertibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency has
remained stable in value after becoming convertible under the
current accounts on December 1, according to a spokesman for the
national foreign exchange center.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 days, total transactions on the Shanghai-based
China Foreign Exchange Trading System were valued at 1.63 billion
US dollars, with the daily turnover averaging 230 million US
dollars, down one percentage point from the last ten days in
November.
</P>
<P>
The average trade-weighted value of the greenback against the
Renminbi yuan dipped 18 points to 8.2994 on Tuesday, from 8.3012
at the end of November. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar
has reported a slight fluctuation of only nine points.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen's exchange rate against the yuan has risen 124
points to reach 7.3081, up from the 7.2957 at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the Renminbi yuan indicates that the market
has a strong confidence in the local currency," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that the yuan's current-account convertibility
will not destabilize its exchange rate, with its huge foreign
exchange reserves of more than 100 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, they also urged Chinese banks to improve the
management of their foreign exchange assets to safeguard against
risks that might result from exchange rate fluctuations.

HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- When the name of Tung Chee
Hwa was read out for the 201th time, a prolonged applause broke
out in the large meeting hall housing the 400 members of the
Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
When Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Qian Qichen announced the final
result that Tung had obtained 320 votes to become the candidate
for the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR, the hall resounded
with cheers and clapping.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a very special day for the 6.3 million Hong Kong
people," said Dr. Hari N Harilela, a Selection Committee member
and chairman of the Harilela Group, after the balloting. "We chose
our own leader for the first time in 150 years."
</P>
<P>
The election process -- the third plenary session of the
Selection Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR --
started at 10:00 today.
</P>
<P>
Reporters came to the venue, the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, as early as 07:00 to secure favorable
positions. By 09:30, the deadline for journalists registration,
some 350 local and overseas reporters had checked in.
</P>
<P>
"Every corner of the meeting room would have been packed with
reporters if we did not restrict the number," said an official in
charge of journalists reception. "This is a historic event and no
reporter wants to miss."
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee also arrived early, with
some appearing at the entrance well before the registration time
of 08:00, and most of the 400 members took their seats one hour
before the opening of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
President of Hong Kong Baptist University Tse Chi-wai left
behind the commencement of his students for the first time in his
25-year presidency to come to the meeting. Many other Selection
Committee members brushed aside important engagements to cast
their votes to choose their future administrative chief.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic moment to which all the members have paid
great attention and none of them wanted to miss. They came very
early for fear of traffic jam, and they also wanted to have time
to talk with fellow members about this great occasion," said L. F.
NG, deputy general manager of the Nanyang Commercial Bank Limited.
</P>
<P>
When ballots were read out for counting at 11:15, all the
people present remained quiet, watching attentively the markings
on the standing white boards on the rostrum bearing the names of
the three contenders -- Peter K.C. Woo, Tung Chee Hwa and Ti Liang
Yang. Some of them made their own counting on notebooks.
</P>
<P>
"We are all very sincere about today's voting, because we are
representing all the Hong Kong people to give the sacred vote,"
Said Cheung Wan-fung.
</P>
<P>
"The result of the voting is what the whole Hong Kong people
have expected," said Liang Hing-ying, chairman of the Chinese
Manufacturers Association. "I believe that Mr. Tung is the right
person for the post of our first Chief Executive. It is a very
good thing that he won an overwhelming majority of the ballots."
</P>
<P>
"The whole process of the voting is quite fair and democratic,"
he added. "It is especially worth noting that all the three
candidates behaved very easily in their campaigning. They were
very polite to each other without any mutual attack."
</P>
<P>
Tam Yiu-chung, also a member of the Selection Committee, said
Tung Chee Hwa's strong points are that he is steady and sincere in
doing things, and is experienced in overcoming difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of confidence in Tung before we cast the votes
for him," said Harilela after the voting. "The most important
factor is that Tung is very sincere and a sort of down-to-earth
man. He likes to work hard, and I believe he will do a good job
for Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He described the voting as very democratic, free and impartial.
</P>
<P>
L.F. NG said that this is the beginning of real democracy in
Hong Kong. "We felt not a hang of pressure in any way on the
voting. We made our decision wholly on our own judgment. The
voting is both open and fair."
</P>
<P>
"All the three candidates have opened their thoughts and their
private lives to the public through speeches, interviews and other
campaigning activities as never before, which helped a lot for us
to make the decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the press half an hour after the election meeting, Tung
Chee Hwa said that he will do his best to lead the Hong Kong
people to an even brighter future.

MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign currency deposits in the Philippines' commercial
banks grew by 50 percent to 13.48 billion U.S. dollars as of
November 22 this year over a year ago, according to the latest
figures released by the Philippine Central Bank. The bank said
that the increase is a validation of the success of foreign
exchange liberalization which started in the country four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Export turnover of the Philippine garment and textile
industry in the first 11 months of this year declined by 1.76
percent to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars from 2.59 billion dollars in
the corresponding period of last year. Garment and Textile Board
data showed the overall turnout was influenced by the lower demand
from quota countries, such as the United States and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Argentina has offered to supply 70,000 tons of wheat for the
January 1997 requirement of Philippine flour millers, which will
use soft wheat to make pastries and noodles, local firms said. The
Philippines imports an average of two million tons of wheat a
year, the bulk of them from the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- The Capital Group Companies Inc., an investment firm based
in Washington, said that it plans to increase exposure in the
Philippine stock market if allowed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission to invest in "Class A" shares of listed companies.
Class A shares are reserved for Filipino investors and normally
accounts for 60 percent of a company's total equity to meet the
nationality requirements imposed on certain enterprises. The
Capital Group is one of the world's largest investment management
organizations.

ISLAMABAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Najmuddin Sheikh visited Afghanistan last weekend in a quest for a
faster peace process there and closer bilateral cooperation, the
Pakistan Press International reported today.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Sheikh traveled to Mazar-e-Sharif for
talks with General Abdur Rashid Dostum, chief of major faction
Jumbish-e-Milli Islami, and then to Kandahar for meetings with
Taliban leaders, who control the largest part of the Afghan
territory.

The report said that Dostum agreed to the outlines of a
proposed peace agreement providing for a cease-fire in the
war-torn country, formation of a political commission and security
measures for the capital city of Kabul.

Official sources described Sheikh's talks with Dostum as
"fruitful", the report said.

JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua)-- South Africa has shut
down its embassies in Paraguay and in Mauritius because of
financial constraints, local newspaper "The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Foreign Affairs Spokesman Pieter
Swanepoel as saying that the latest closures followed similar
action taken earlier this year in the embassy in Istanbul, Turkey
and consul in St. Petersburg of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The high cost of keeping an embassy or high commission
operation in the face of the falling value of the Rand, has
dictated our decision," said Swanepoel.
</P>
<P>
Rand, an official currency in South Africa, has suffered
remarkable devaluation against U.S. Dollar dropping from 3.6 in
February to 4.6 in December.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is formally represented in about 100 countries.
It has opened embassies and high commissions in many parts of the
world since a new democratic South Africa was established in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Air-controllers' Go-slow Enters Fourth Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The go-slow of
air-controllers in Kenya entered the fourth day today after they
defied a government order to resume their work by 16.00 p.m.
local time on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Murage, permanent secretary of the Ministry for
Transport and Communications, issued the go-back to work
ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
The government order said that those who failed to report on
duty by that time would have breached contract of service and
tough action would be taken against them.
</P>
<P>
However, by last night, none of the striking air traffic
controllers had resumed their work and there were no official
statement regarding their fate.
</P>
<P>
Aeronautical engineers and communications officers have also
joined their go-slow action, further complicating the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological officers have threatened to join the strike in
a "sabotage campaign" and would stop issuing both landing and
take-off data to the airports if the strike continued till next
week.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport said
that the airport normally handled more than 187 landings and
take-offs every day and this figure had been reduced to less than
80 since last Sunday when the go-slow action started.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation authorities has sent instructors and
administrators of the sector to replace the striking air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
Airline officials complained that international flights were
delayed for up to an hour because the substitute air controllers
could not handle the workload.

<HEADLINE> China Is No Threat: Malaysian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China has never been a threat in
history and trying to stop China from becoming a great power would
be a wrong idea, a newspaper interview quoted the Malaysian prime
minister as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir Mohamad told Yomiuri Shimbun, a mass-circulated
Japanese newspaper: "We are not afraid of China. We think we can
work with the country.
</P>
<P>
"China will become a great power whether the world likes it or
not. To stop it or try to encircle it would be a wrong idea," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
On relations among China, Japan and the United States, Mahathir
said the three nations will be able to maintain good relations if
they do not intimidate or retaliate against one another.
</P>
<P>
On human rights issues, he said people must take into
consideration that each country has got its own system and there
is no use that a country applies sanctions against another because
it is not practicing human rights or because it is not a liberal
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian prime minister was quoted as saying that he
expected Japan to play a leadership role with responsibility in
the economic field.
</P>
<P>
But he urged Japan to acknowledge its past war crimes rather
than repeat apologies to neighboring countries without admitting
them.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister cited Germany as an example. He said that
although the Germans conquered practically the whole of Europe and
huge parts of Russia and committed atrocities there, he does not
see the Germans going to Jerusalem to apologize every time they
form a new government.
</P>
<P>
"What is necessary is that you must admit what you have
committed. To deny that you did it is wrong," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Tung Chee Hwa Faces Historical Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- At noon on December 11, the
Convention Hall of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center
became a spotlight of the world: Tung Chee Hwa, the official
candidate for the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), stood firmly at a big press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Facing hundreds of reporters from all over the world, Tung, in
his usual calm and steady tone, said that he was grateful to the
Hong Kong people for picking him to take on a historical mission.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tung got a total of 320 votes at the third
plenary session of the 400-member Selection Committee to win the
race for the official candidate for the first Chief Executive of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In a closing speech to the session, Qian Qichen, chairman of
the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR and Chinese vice-Premier,
extended congratulations on Tung's success at the historical
moment.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Tung said, "I am confident about Hong
Kong's future and I will try my best to create a better future for
 Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there are many factors in Hong Kong's success,
 but at present, the most important factor is to achieve Hong
Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa is now well known to Hong Kong citizens as well
as international communities. They know him not only for his
achievements in shipping business, but also for his confidence in
ensuring Hong Kong's success in her transition and in the process
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Tung, 59, a native of Shanghai, eastern China, is former
chairman of Orient Overseas (International) Limited and member of
the Hong Kong Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, he succeeded in managing his shipping
corporation to brave ill winds from the global sluggish shipping
business.
</P>
<P>
He leads a disciplined life, arriving at his office at dawn to
do Taiji Boxing exercises on the roof before starting work.
</P>
<P>
Having received education in China's mainland, Hong Kong and
Britain, Tung has a profound love for Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
"In my childhood, my father always taught me to be proud of
being a Chinese," he said. "As Chinese, Hong Kong citizens need to
 continue preserving the virtues of Chinese culture while
assimilating the knowledge and experience of the West."
</P>
<P>
Local media said that with his increasing involvement in the
chief executive campaign, Tung has been gaining popularity among
the local people for his personality featuring honesty, modesty,
wisdom and prudence.
</P>
<P>
Tung's political involvement began in the 1980s as he became a
member of the Basic Law Consultative Committee. At the beginning
of 1996, he was selected as the vice-chairman of the Preparatory
Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Publishing his policy platform, "Building a 21st Century Hong
Kong together", on October 21, he is determined to fulfill the
historical mission for the rest of his life for the sake of
maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and the unity of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the HKSAR will become a stable,
equitable, compassionate and democratic society with clarity of
direction and unity of purpose in the next century, with the
implementation of the principles of "one country, two systems" and
 "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The continued creation of wealth and improved quality of life
for all Hong Kong people must be the HKSAR government's priority,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that his participation in the chief executive
election was just motivated by the mission of doing something for
Hong Kong and his country.
</P>
<P>
Even though the local media almost all predicted that he was
certain to win the race for the official candidate for the first
Chief Executive of the HKSAR after two days of question-and-answer
 sessions held in Hong Kong at the end of November, he went ahead
with his planned visits to local communities to acquaint himself
with the real situation there.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If I win, I will have best opportunity to serve the
people, if I lose, I have learned a lot from the past 10 weeks'
visits and exchanges with people at various levels and sectors."
</P>
<P>
He added that he had found many ways to serve citizens and to
handle the problems that hinder Hong Kong's development.

<HEADLINE> Report on Corruption to Fuel Tanzania's War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa has said the report on corruption presented to him over the
weekend will fuel the government's war against the vice,
according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also said that the war will not take the form of an
on-and-off operation but a sustained exercise under which proven
culprits will dealt with legally.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks here on Tuesday, when formally
releasing his 521-page report for public scrutiny as he had
pledged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the presence of Joseph Waroba, a former Attorney
General and Prime Minister who chaired the nine-member
Presidential Commission on Corruption, Mkapa told a press
conference here that the government will not carry out a
witch-hunt against suspected culprits.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the aim is not to target anyone. The aim is to curb
corruption, by enforcing the laws of the land."
</P>
<P>
The president said that he will hand over a list of allegedly
corrupt individuals to relevant organs to probe them and
prosecute those deemed to have cases to answer.
</P>
<P>
He added the anti-corruption drive will be smoothed by a
scientific analysis that the commission had made of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is also chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Party
(CCM), said linking the ruling party with widespread corruption
would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
He said, the CCM, like its precursors, the TANU and the ASP,
is amenable to self-cleansing, and has never claimed to be an
entity of angels.
</P>
<P>
He blamed corruption on some individual party leaders as well
in government, for either being conscious participants in the
vice, or failing to use their authority to curb it.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed that hence forth, he will consider an
individual's ability to curb corruption as a basic qualification
for effective leadership.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yugoslavia Strives for World Recognition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- At the end of 1995, there
were only a dozen embassies in the Yugoslav capital, a sign of the
country's isolation from the international community.
</P>
<P>
But now, there are nearly 70 embassies reopen in Belgrade and
more than 160 countries have normalized relations with the country
which was formed in 1992 after the disintegration of the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
This was a small but significant step for the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia in its reintegration into the international
community which began in November 1995 with the signing of the
Dayton Peace Accord which ended the near four-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Just weeks after it was formally set up, the rump Yugoslavia,
which comprises Serbia and Montenegro, became a headache in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed economic sanctions
on the country on May 31, 1992 for its role in formenting the war
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade was seen as having provoked Bosnia's ethnic strife as
part of its design to create a Greater Serbia, bringing together
the Serb lands in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
The embargo isolated Yugoslavia from the international
community completely from then on and dealt a heavy blow to the
new state both economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions crippled the country by halting all trade with
Serbia and Montenegro, freezing Yugoslavia's foreign assets and
suspending air links with the country.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the embargo has been estimated at 50
billion U.S. dollars. Factories closed down, output fell by half,
unemployment rose to 50 percent and living standards dropped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of Yugoslavia began in November 1995
when Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic signed the Dayton peace
agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serb authorities who had
objected to the terms for ending the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Its participation in the peace talks and its role in helping to
guarantee peace in Bosnia paved the way for Yugoslavia to return
from its odyssey in the wilderness. In return for signing the
agreement, the United States and its allies agreed to first
suspend the sanctions and then end them completely once elections
had taken place in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The ending of sanctions removed a major obstacle in
Yugoslavia's path toward normal relations with the world. However,
an outer ring of sanctions still remains. Yugoslavia is barred
from re-joining the United Nations General Assembly and other
U.N. bodies and institutions like the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund until other demands are met.
</P>
<P>
These demands include cooperation with the U.N. War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague, reducing tensions in the Serbian province
of Kosovo, which is dominated by ethnic Albanians, and settling
claims and other issues with the former Yugoslav states.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the ending of the economic embargo paved the way
for Yugoslavia's rehabilitation. France was the first country to
establish diplomatic relations with the republic in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
But Belgrade's major diplomatic breakthrough took place two
months later, when it signed an agreement to normalize relations
with its neighbor Macedonia, the only one of the former
Yugoslav republics to have seceded peacefully.
</P>
<P>
This represented a significant step forward not only for
bilateral relations between the two neighbors but also for
stabilization and security in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
In response to this agreement, the European Union adopted a
declaration the following day recommending its members to
recognize Yugoslavia and upgrade their diplomatic relations with
it to ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
From then on, ambassadors from Western Europe and other parts
of the world began to return to Belgrade after a four-year
absence.
</P>
<P>
The precedent set by the normalization of relations between
Belgrade and Skopje has not only further opened Yugoslavia's door
to the world, but also pushed forward the process of normalization
throughout the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
In August, Yugoslavia and Croatia, the two main powers in the
region, signed an agreement to normalize relations, further
reducing tensions in the Balkans and seemingly putting an end to
Serbia's earlier dreams of creating a Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
In October, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic signed a joint declaration in
Paris on mutual recognition, paving the way for free trade and
free movement of people between the two states, the renewal of
infrastructure links.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia is now the only ex-Yugoslav republic which has not
officially normalized relations with Yugoslavia, but it announced
last summer its recognition of the republic as a continuation of
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has made full integration with the world its top
foreign policy priority.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Belgrade has witnessed many visits by foreign
presidents, premiers and ministers. Meanwhile, Yugoslav President
Zolan Lilic has paid official visits to several African countries
and Vice-Premier Jovan Zebic to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia wants to reestablish economic relations and
cooperation with other countries, to rejoin key international
financial institutions to obtain badly-needed loans for rebuilding
its economy, and to be recognized by other states as the legal
successor of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
So far, Yugoslavia has established official relations with 163
countries and signed 138 inter-state agreements, a sign that
"Yugoslavia's international position has grown substantially
stronger," Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yugoslavia's return to the international community is
not yet complete because of the existence of the outer wall of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Fresh doubts have also emerged over Yugoslavia's rehabilitation
following the outbreak of unrest and mass protests in Belgrade
over the government's decision to annul the results of local
elections on November 17 in which the opposition made significant
gains.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations involving up to 200,000 people have been held
daily in Belgrade for the last 24 days in protest at the
annulment.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already refused Belgrade preferential
trade terms granted to other Balkan countries and Serbia was not
invited to attend a conference in Geneva to launch a U.S.-backed
"self-help" initiative for southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
NATO and the United States have also issued strong warnings to
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to recognize the results of
the elections.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said, "The voice of the people should be
heard."
</P>
<P>
These latest events have undoubtedly damaged the progress made
by Yugoslavia over the past year in reversing its position of
isolation and returning to the international community.
</P>
<P>
It seems there is still a lot to do before Yugoslavia can
take its place again in the world.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Reiterates No to Linking Labor to Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia reiterated here
today its opposition to linking social clauses to trade and trade
actions, and rejected any move to discuss such issues at the World
Trade Organization (WTO) meetings.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary session of the first WTO Ministerial
Conference here this morning, Malaysian Minister of International
Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said that discussion and debate on
the issue of labor standards had proven to be a divisive factor.
</P>
<P>
"For Malaysia, we reject any attempt to link labor standards
and other social clauses to trade and trade action, and we also
reject any move to discuss and deliberate labor standards and
other social clauses in the WTO," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Malaysia accepts the fact that countries must
observe internationally recognized core labor standards, but
argued that issues pertaining to labor and labor standards must be
dealt with in the International Labor Organization (ILO), which
she said is the only competent body to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister also expressed her country's rejection
to the use of trade measures to enforce labor standards and
reaffirmed that the comparative and competitive advantage of
low-wage countries should not be put into question in the trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The labor standards issue has been one of the most
controversial topics at the current WTO Ministerial Conference,
which runs from Monday to Friday and is attended by trade
ministers of the 128 WTO members.
</P>
<P>
While the United States and some other western countries tried
to push for a linkage between the labor standards issue and trade,
a number of developing nations strongly opposed the move, calling
it a disguised protectionist attempt.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister Elaborates China's Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting General Chi
Haotian, vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission,
said today that China follows a "defensive defense policy."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.S. National Defense University, the Chinese
defense minister and state councillor said that China's defense
policy consists of four parts:
</P>
<P>
-- The basic goal of China's defense policy is to consolidate
national defense, resist foreign aggression, safeguard state
sovereignty over territorial land, air and waters and maritime
rights and interests and maintain national unity and security.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China follows a strategy
of "active defense," that is, a principle of defense, self-defense
and striking only after being attacked is followed at the
strategic level, the army general said.
</P>
<P>
-- A basic principle for China's defense construction is to
subordinate it to, and serve, the country's overall economic
program.
</P>
<P>
China has persisted in incorporating defense construction in
the overall economic planning of the nation, so that it will meet
the needs of both peace and war time, both civilian and military
use and both immediate and long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
To subordinate to and serve the country's economic development,
China has for years maintained a tight control on its defense
expenditure. Since the beginning of the 1980s, though the absolute
size of defense appropriations has somewhat increased over the
years, its share in both the GNP and state budget has actually
shrunk.
</P>
<P>
Chi disclosed that China's defense appropriations for 1996 were
around 70.227 billion yuan (8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
-- The focus of the military work in China is to build a better
force with Chinese characteristics. The PLA is required to be a
force with a high political standard, high military capability, a
fine style of work, strict discipline and strong logistic support.
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, the Chinese military has gone through several
rounds of streamlining, reorganization and restructuring, cutting
down the size of troops from more than 6 million to less than 3
million today. As for weapon and equipment development, China has,
in actively implementing its military strategy of active defense,
relied mainly on itself in research and development, supplemented
by appropriate import.
</P>
<P>
The modernization level of the weaponry and equipment of
Chinese military is still very low. Constrained by limited
national strength, China can only improve gradually as its
national economy becomes stronger.
</P>
<P>
-- An important component of China's defense policy is to
commit itself to world peace and human progress. Pursuing an
independent foreign policy of peace, China does not enter into
alliance with any country or group of countries, nor does it
participate in any military blocs.
</P>
<P>
China is opposed to any form of hegemonism, power politics and
acts of aggression and expansion. It stands for peaceful
settlement of differences and disputes between countries through
consultations, and against use or threat of force. China has all
along stood for effective disarmament and arms control on a fair,
reasonable, comprehensive and balanced basis while actively
participating in relevant international disarmament and arms
control talks and earnestly fulfilling its obligations under the
treaties it has signed.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Chinese visitor concluded, China is the only
nuclear power that has undertaken not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons under any circumstances and unconditionally not to
use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon
states. China has also actively participated in U.N. peace-keeping
operations, making a positive contribution to world peace and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Accuses U.S. of Undermining WTO System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today accused the
United States of undermining the multilateral trading system by
taking unilateral actions to settle trade disputes with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary session of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) Ministerial Conference, Malaysian Minister for International
Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said that through various rounds
of negotiations in the past, there has evolved a strengthened
multilateral trading system that is rules-based and discipline
oriented.
</P>
<P>
"The recent unilateral action by a WTO member to pass and
attempt to enforce domestic legislation with extraterritorial
application, will undermine the efforts of over four decades to
strengthen the multilateral trading system," she said.
</P>
<P>
She did not mention the WTO member by name. But in an apparent
reference to the U.S. Helms-Burton Act against Cuba, the Malaysian
minister said, "Such an action is also contrary to the aspirations
and objectives of the WTO."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister urged members of the WTO to reject such
unilateral attempts and to reaffirm the primacy of the
multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that the slow pace in formulating
harmonized rules of origin has resulted in some countries
unilaterally imposing arbitrary rules affecting the textile
exports of developing countries, and that such action renders
meaningless the liberalization programs under the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of anti-dumping, she said, "We must address the
flagrant action of some countries to resort to anti-dumping
measures as a tool for trade harassment."
</P>
<P>
She described the unilateral measures as unjustifiable and
negatively impacting upon trade and investment of the affected
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 11 (Xinhua)-- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province is concentrating on building roads and power- and
water-supply facilities to pave the way for its 151 villages to
escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
The poverty-alleviation project is being carried out in the
eastern arid mountainous areas of the province, and aimed at
improving agricultural production and the ecological environment
of the areas, according to Liu Guanghe, vice-governor of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that these areas, along the Yellow River and
the Huangshui valleys, boast two third of the land and population
of the province, and remain the largest crop-growing region in the
province. But there are still more than 700,000 people in these
areas living under the poverty line, including the Han, Mongolian,
Tibetan and other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The vice-governor said the project involves construction of
water conservancy, power and road, and development of forestry,
animal husbandry and agricultural technology, adding that the task
set for this year of transforming 4,000 hectares of hillsides into
terraced fields has been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
He promised the provincial government will focus its efforts on
the poor areas' farmland capital construction and implement a
large-scale comprehensive administration to better the production
and living conditions of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the project by the year 2000, every village
concerned will enjoy the convenience of running water, electricity
and roads, and have about 0.1 ha of level terrace per capita,
producing over 400 kilograms of crops. Meanwhile, 80 percent of
the hillsides suitable for afforestation will be covered with
trees.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary to Congratulate on Election of HK SAR Chief Executive Candidate (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that this is the first time in Hong
Kong's history that an election body, completely composed of Hong
Kong people, has been formed and has recommended the candidate for
the Chief Executive of the region. It is also the beginning of
Hong Kong's true democracy.
</P>
<P>
In the past 100 years, there has been no democracy in Hong
Kong's political life under Britain's colonial rule. All powers,
including executive, legislative, judicial and military rights,
were granted to the Hong Kong governors, who all were appointed by
Britain without consulting the local people, the commentary
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, and the implementation of the principles of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
a high-degree of autonomy that offer Hong Kong the unprecedented
opportunity for its democratic development, it emphasized.
</P>
<P>
From writing up the Basic Law to establishing the Preliminary
Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
SAR, and from establishing the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong SAR to forming the Selection Committee to choose the
candidate for the first Chief Executive and the members of the
provisional legislature, Hong Kong people have been more and more
involved in preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR,
the commentary explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of talented people were found to administer
Hong Kong, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the preparation for the establishment of
the Hong Kong SAR is a process necessary to form a type of
democracy in accordance with Hong Kong's reality, and was done so
with the enthusiastic participation of the Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
When formulating the detailed method of forming the Selection
Committee, a large-scale program was carried out in Hong Kong to
solicit opinions of the local people, the commentary reviewed.
</P>
<P>
As the majority of the Hong Kong people realized the sincere
attitude of the Preparatory Committee to rely on the Hong Kong
people and advance Hong Kong's democratic progress, they began
taking a more active part in the affairs related to the
transition, it said.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary to Congratulate on Election of HK SAR Chief Executive Candidate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
issued a commentary to congratulate the new first Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), saying the
election marks a new era in the democratic progress of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The election is also an important reflection of the principles
of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
Through the election, a type of democracy which is open, fair,
and civilized is gradually being formed in Hong Kong in accordance
with law, the commentary said. Meanwhile, Hong Kong compatriots
are showing their concern about the establishment of the Hong Kong
SAR and are making concerted efforts to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
This provides a strong guarantee for Hong Kong's smooth
transition and its continuous prosperity and stability, and also
lays a favorable foundation for the establishment of a democratic
system in the future Hong Kong SAR, it noted.
</P>
<P>
To implement the "one country, two systems" principle over Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan is an important part of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, the commentary said. It added that
to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong is the first
stop in the process of the national reunification drive, led by
the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's democratic
system is completely new, with its most important quality to be in
line with Hong Kong's reality and to stimulate Hong Kong
compatriots to participate in administering the region themselves,
it said.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary to Congratulate on Election of HK SAR Chief Executive Candidate (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 400 Selection Committee members, chosen through an open
application process, and the careful nomination and election by
the members of the Preparatory Committee, represent various social
sectors and levels in Hong Kong, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
At a question and answer meeting held in Hong Kong for the
candidates running for the Chief Executive, most Hong Kong
compatriots took part in the live televised discussion that
focused on Hong Kong's social development and other issues
concerning the people there. As a result, their understanding of
the "one country, two systems" principle and the Basic Law was
increased, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary emphasized that the smooth election of the
candidate for the Chief Executive demonstrates that the type of
democracy adopted in Hong Kong according to the "one country, two
systems" principle and the Basic Law can meet the needs of Hong
Kong's situation, and have won the common approval by the Hong
Kong people.
</P>
<P>
In the election race, the three candidates all showed their
dedication to Hong Kong, and worked hard to increase mutual
understanding with people in the various sectors of the region,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Though the three candidates are from different social sectors,
and have different personalities and policy outlines, they all
recognize the importance of the implementation of the "one
country, two systems" principle and the Basic Law, and are
proceeding from Hong Kong's overall and long-term interests, it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
As all three met the requirements of the Chief Executive set
out by the majority of Hong Kong compatriots, they were eligible
to be the final candidates for the post of Chief Executive, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee-hwa has become the first choice among the three
candidates, the commentary said, adding that it is not only an
honor for him, but also reflects the wishes of the majority of the
Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
After the recommended candidate is appointed by the central
government, preparatory work for forming the Hong Kong SAR
government body that is to take office will be carried out step by
step, and the concepts of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and a high-degree of autonomy prescribed in the Basic Law are
turning into reality, it noted.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, who won the
race for the candidate for the chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today, says he will make
efforts to enhance public confidence in Hong Kong by upholding the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The point was stressed by Tung in his recent speeches during

<HEADLINE> How to Select Candidate for Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The process for selecting the
candidate for the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has been described as "democratic,
fair and open."
</P>
<P>
An article signed by correspondents from Xinhua News Agency and
issued here today said that the candidate was selected after the
full discussion and extensive involvement of the Hong Kong people
throughout the democratic process, and that the competition
between the three candidates for the first Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong SAR was fair.
</P>
<P>
This significant event illustrates to the world that the
compatriots living in Hong Kong, which has been under the
colonialist rule of Britain for 150 years, have entered the
political arena with great enthusiasm, and are eagerly greeting
the new period of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
To select the candidate for the first Chief Executive is a
large-scale and complicated process, and is unprecedented in world
events. The Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR has always
taken a serious, earnest and responsible attitude toward this
work, and the work was carried out smoothly thanks to the Hong
Kong people's extensive involvement.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the very process of selecting the
candidate for the first Chief Executive illustrates the
painstaking efforts by the members of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law and the decisions made by the
National People's Congress (NPC), preparations for the formation
of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) should first establish the Selection Committee composed of
400 permanent Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee takes charge of two core projects, one
is to select the candidate for the first Chief Executive, and the
other to elect the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee panel under the Preparatory Committee
convened five meetings, discussing in depth ways to formulate the
specific methods for forming the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel held 16 large-scale meetings in Hong
Kong to solicit opinions from the Hong Kong people regarding the
process. More than 1,000 prominent representatives from 366 groups
attended, and actively expressed their views and opinions.

<P>
Afterwards, the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee
compiled a 10,000-character report on the program, which was
published in Hong Kong. Most of the Hong Kong media held that the
program was democratic, open and clear, and was unprecedented in
Hong Kong's history, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the Hong Kong people's opinions, the Preparatory
Committee members held repeated discussions, while examining and
revising the suggested draft of the method for forming the
Selection Committee. They ultimately worked out a specific method
at the Preparatory Committee's fourth plenary session, which was
held in Beijing on August 9-10.
</P>
<P>
According to the specific method, the Selection Committee shall
be composed of people from four sectors: industrial, commercial
and financial sectors; the professions; labor, grassroots,
religious and other sectors; former political figures, Hong Kong
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), and
representatives of the Hong Kong members of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
It also set out four requirements for the Selection Committee
members, who must be at least 18 years old, meet the
qualifications of permanent Hong Kong residents as prescribed in
Article 24 of the Basic Law, support the "one country, two
systems" principle and the Basic Law, and be willing to perform
the two duties of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Following the adoption of this document, work to receive
applicants was first conducted in Hong Kong on August 15. A
continuous flow of people visited the Hong Kong office of the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee to apply for the
membership in the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the application deadline on September 14, the
Hong Kong Office of the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee
had delivered 22,106 application forms and received 5,833.
</P>
<P>
After eliminating the forms of some people who applied more
than once, some 5,798 people from various social sectors in Hong
Kong became applicants for the Selection Committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Undecided Over Local Initiative on Affirmative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that he was not sure whether to enter the legal fray
over California's law against race- and gender-based federal
affirmative action plans.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action is a formal effort to provide increased
employment opportunities for women and ethnic minorities to
overcome past patterns of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Although he thinks the California initiative bad, Clinton is
awaiting final recommendations from the Justice Department and
White House advisers on whether to file a court brief supporting a
ban on the state initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Our people are working very hard to work through the legal and
constitutional issues to give me a recommendation about what we
should do, and how we should do it."
</P>
<P>
"I am eager to get their recommendation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said while he "publicly and strongly" opposed the
California initiative during his campaign, he realizes there are a
myriad of ramifications to consider.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration is studying "all aspects of the
argument," against a Wednesday court deadline for filing briefs in
the case.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was bad policy for the people of California, and
a bad example for America," Clinton said. "Whether it is
unconstitutional is a different question."
</P>
<P>
A Californian initiative prohibiting preferences based on race
and gender in public hiring, contracting and education was
approved by 54 percent of California voters in last month's
election.
</P>
<P>
But Chief U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson issued a
temporary restraining order late last month barring enforcement of
the measure, saying it might be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
A major debate was unfolded in the United States over
affirmative action when the University of California's Board of
Regents voted to drop race and gender as criteria for enrolling
students, hiring staff and awarding contracts.
</P>
<P>
Under the Equal Opportunity Act of 1972, most federal
contractors and subcontractors, all state governments and
institutions, including universities, and most local governments
must initiate plans to increase the proportions of their female
and minority employees until they are equal to the proportions
existing in the available labor market.

At the Preparatory Committee's fifth plenary session on October
4-5, the Preparatory Committee members put forward a list of
possible members for the Selection Committee. Based on this, the
meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Preparatory
Committee determined a list of the candidates, which included 20
percent more names than the actual number of Selection Committee
members.
</P>
<P>
On November 2, the Preparatory Committee members gathered in
Beijing at the committee's sixth plenary session, and voted for
the Selection Committee members by secret ballot.
</P>

Committee, who were determined through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Selection Committee for the first government of the
Hong Kong SAR was created in one day, the articled noted.
</P>
<P>
In the process of preparing for the establishment of the
Selection Committee, the Preparatory Committee also worked hard to
formulate a method to choose the candidate for the first Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
As the Basic Law has clearly defined the qualifications and
election method for the Chief Executive, the article said, the
method for choosing the candidate for the position was soon
approved at the fifth plenary session of the Preparatory
Committee, based on discussions of the three meetings of the Chief
Executive Panel of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the first Chief Executive must be a
Chinese citizen and permanent Hong Kong resident not less than 40
years old, and must have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for 20
consecutive years without the right of residence in any foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chief Executive must uphold the Basic Law and be
willing to pledge loyalty to the Hong Kong SAR, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The document also explicitly stipulated the specific process of
choosing the candidate for the Chief Executive. Members of the
Preparatory Committee agreed that the candidate must be chosen
through nomination and election after consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
November 15 was a date that caused great concern in Hong Kong
and the international community. On that day, the first plenary
session of the Selection Committee was held at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center to recommend the candidates for
the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
The open meeting was covered by more than 300 journalists from
China and foreign countries, while the entire meeting was
broadcast live to Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
After a nomination period that lasted two hours, three persons
were chosen as official candidates for the first Chief
Executive: Tung Chee-hwa, Ti Liang Yang and Peter K.C. Woo.
</P>
<P>
The three candidates then visited dozens of local communities,
meeting with people of various sectors to listen to their opinions
and suggestions on Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, most of the 400 Selection Committee members
gathered again in Hong Kong for the second plenary session of the
Selection Committee. Thirteen of the members had asked to be
excused.
</P>
<P>
During this meeting, the three candidates introduced
themselves, delivered speeches that outlines their proposed
policies, and answered questions.
</P>
<P>
As they explained their policy platforms, Peter K.C. Woo, Tung
Chee-hwa and Ti Liang Yang all expressed their ideas for
administrating Hong Kong, and their sense of the historical
mission that is associated with the region.
</P>
<P>
They also held four meetings to answer questions raised by the
four sectors of the Selection Committee members, covering the
fields of Hong Kong's politics, economy, culture, livelihood and
social security.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong media, the policy platforms of the
three candidates reflected their own wisdom, insight, experience,
talent and sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The article said the 400 Selection Committee members today
attended the third plenary session of the committee to cast their
final official ballots, to the expectation of the six million Hong
Kong compatriots. Selecting the candidate for the Chief Executive
is the choice made by the Hong Kong people, and a significant step
toward the principles of "one country, two systems," and "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Recalling the past ten months, when the Preparatory Committee
was preparing for the SAR government, everyone with a positive
point of view could realize that the candidate for the first Chief
Executive was named in keeping with the principles of democracy,
fairness and openness, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Once again, it has been proved that the principles of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
are essential to settling the Hong Kong question.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Deng Xiaoping's prediction 12 years ago that
the Hong Kong people will administrate Hong Kong well will now
become a reality, and Hong Kong will have a more prosperous
future, the article said.

<P>
After the method of choosing the candidate for the Chief
Executive was adopted, the work to recommend the candidate began.
</P>
<P>
Individuals who intended to run for the post of the first Chief
Executive were required to follow several important procedures,
including the application process, a qualification review, and the
nomination and voting by secret ballot by the members of the
Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
On October 11, the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee
published the process that was to be followed by those vying for
candidacy for the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant stipulations, applicants for the post
were required to express their willingness to be involved in the
race directly to the meeting of chairman and vice-chairmen of the
Preparatory Committee. They also were asked to complete a resume
before the Selection Committee was established.
</P>
<P>
After their qualifications were reviewed by the chairman and
vice-chairmen, those approved were eligible to run for the
post. Of this group, those who won the nomination by at least 50
Selection Committee members would become official candidates for
the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
During October 14-28, some 31 persons sent letters and resumes
to the Hong Kong Office of the Secretariat of the Preparatory
Committee to express their intention to run for the election.
</P>
<P>
During the sixth plenary session of the Preparatory Committee
on November 1-2, the meeting of chairman and vice-chairmen of the
Preparatory Committee conducted the qualification check of the 31
applicants, and confirmed eight as qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
According to the election method, any civil servants who
intended to run for the election were required to leave their
jobs, to guarantee the neutrality of civil servants. All of the
applicants were required to end their affiliation with any
political groups and parties, to ensure the overall interests of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the smooth progress of the election, and
prevent the Selection Committee members from taking bribes or
becoming involved in other illegal interests, a regulation for the
Selection Committee members was also approved at the sixth plenary
session of the Preparatory Committee, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Preparatory Committee designed a unique method
for nominating the candidate, which required Selection Committee
members to write the names of their favorite candidate on an
envelope and place it inside another envelope, on which they were
to write their own names. During the ballot counting, the two
envelopes would be counted separately.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that this method would not only
guarantee a just and fair election process, but also help the
Selection Committee members to choose the proper candidate
according to their own wishes.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Praises Thailand's Economic Fundamentals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- President of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Michael Camdessus has said that Thailand's
economic fundamentals are sound and IMF economists see no signs of
any erosion in the country's competitiveness, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day trip to Thailand on Tuesday, Camdessus said
that the current export slowdown faced by Thailand is a regional
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Demands for low value-added goods have declined while Thailand
has not yet fully developed a capacity to produce high value-added
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that inflation and the current account
deficit remain high in the country, mainly because of the gap
between investment and savings.
</P>
<P>
Domestic conditions, including floods, also imposed a negative
impact on the country's economic performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that it may take two to four years to wipe out
Thailand's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Thai government to establish fiscal discipline by
cutting the government's budget and promote efficiency in tax
collection and the privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On the stability of the Thai currency, Camdessus said that the
baht's stability had been affected more by the gyrations of the
money market than by the country's economic fundamentals.

KIEV, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
signed a decree today firing Dmitry Tabachnik, director of the
Presidential Office, the Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decree said that Tabachnik would be transferred to another
unspecified job, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tabachnik, 32, was believed to be Kuchma's closest aide, who
helped Kuchma win the presidential election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
When Kuchma took office in July 1994, Tabachnik was appointed
director of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted in November showed that Tabachnik was regarded
as one of the country's most influential politicians, just
following the president, the prime minister, the parliament
speaker and the secretary of the State Committee on Security and
Defense.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Tabachnik's departure might be in connection
with power struggles in Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Liberalize Basic Telecom Services in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore today announced
that it will liberalize the basic telecommunications services in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going World Trade Organization (WTO)
Ministerial Conference, Singapore Minister for Communications Mah
Bow Tan said the Singapore government had decided to end the
monopoly for basic telecom services on March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This is seven years ahead of the original schedule and an
improvement of two years over our existing offer," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken to show Singapore's support for the
multilateral trading system and to make a positive contribution to
move the basic telecom negotiations forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This will further enhance Singapore's competitiveness
and our role as a regional telecom hub."
</P>
<P>
Singapore privatized the government-operated telecom service
with a 15-year monopoly licence and listed the telecom company on
the stock market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
At the Negotiating Group on Basic Telecommunications, Singapore
offered to introduce competition into the industry on April 1,
2002, bringing forward competition by five years from the original
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore minister said that his country will play an
active part in contributing to the successful conclusion of the
basic telecom negotiations by the deadline of February 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the liberalization of basic telecommunications is
one of the four issues on the built-in agenda of the world trade
body. The other three are financial services, maritime transport
services and the movement of natural persons.
</P>
<P>
So far, only the negotiations on the movement of natural
persons have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on financial services are scheduled to
conclude by the end of December 1997 and maritime services talks
will resume in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Rebels Accused of Attacking Russian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia today accused Tajik
rebels of attacking its military installations in the region
around the Dushanbe airport in the past few days, calling the act
"banditry."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said that the Tajik rebels -- the Islamic
Movement of Tajikistan -- plotted to provoke large-scale Russian
counter-attacks so as to pull the Russian troops stationed in
Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan, into the country's internal
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops will fight back if they are assailed again
by the rebels, the ministry warned in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Tajik rebels and government forces have been locked in
fightings in the southern part of the former Soviet republic since
peace talks were announced at the end of last month, with each
side trying to strengthen its position at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov met rebel leader Abdullah
Nuri in northern Afghanistan today to discuss a ceasefire
accord. Both men agreed to meet again in Moscow on December 19.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a peace agreement will be signed at the
forthcoming Moscow talks.
</P>
<P>
The four-year civil war in Tajik has left tens of thousands
people dead and many more homeless in the mountainous country
bordering Afghanistan and China.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Retransmission in two parts hke -- Yearender: World Economy Turns for the Better in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The world economy picked up in
most regions in 1996, although the all-round growth predicted by
many failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the improvement in economic activity this year has
laid a solid foundation for further gains in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy, which has experienced continuous growth since
1991, should see an increase in gross domestic product (GDP) of
2.4 percent resulting from higher consumption and investment,
marked growth in exports and a reduction in its budget and foreign
trade deficits, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development forecasts.
</P>
<P>
After three years of erratic growth, the Japanese economy is
forecast to see some revitalization following the government's
passing of a supplementary budget to spur growth.
</P>
<P>
Very low interest rates and the Japanese yen's devaluation have
also encouraged investment and exports. Japan's economy is
expected to grow 3 percent this year, compared with 0.9 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Western European countries, which have been plagued by high
interest rates over the past couple of years and suffered unstable
exchange rates in 1995, have suffered slow growth this year
overall.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the 15-nation European Union is estimated at
around 1.6 percent this year, a full 1 percentage point lower than
in 1995, although more stable exchange rates, lower medium and
short-term interest rates and higher exports this year helped
Germany, the driving force in the EU economy, to recover from
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Economic activity in developing countries remained impressive,
with Asia still leading the world with annual growth of 7.3
percent in 1996. But the momentum has slowed as austerity
policies to avoid overheating and excessive inflation have put the
brakes on high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The African economy, which is highly diverse, saw generally
sound development in 1996, with growth up 3 percent over 1995 and
forecasts of further improvement in 1997 of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some countries entered a new phase of steady development after
adopting reform and readjustment policies.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, economic growth for 1996 is estimated at 3
percent, as Mexico emerged successfully from its financial crisis
in 1994 and 1995 and Argentina pulled out of recession.
</P>
<P>
The economies of central and eastern European countries, which
have been going through dramatic economic and social changes,
recorded 0.4 percent growth in 1996 after five consecutive years
of decline.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the former republics of the Soviet Union,
including Russia, saw a continued, albeit slower, slide in their
economies.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Seek Closer Ties with South American States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will invite ministers from the Mercosur
countries to its next annual meeting scheduled for September in
Kuala Lumpur next year as a move to bring the ASEAN closer to the
South American group.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, trade ministers from
the ASEAN and the Mercosur, which groups Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay, held an informal meeting on Tuesday in
Singapore and Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akraseni said that
the ASEAN hoped to extend preferential benefits to the four
nations.
</P>
<P>
Both groups have expressed desire for closer economic
cooperation and agreed to standardize customs procedures earlier
this year, said Narongchai, who is accompanying Thai Deputy Prime
Minister Amnuay Virawan to attend the first world trade
ministerial meeting in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur is a customs union covering a population of 200
million which formally came into operation on January 1, 1995. Its
four-member nations agreed to apply common tariffs on third
countries beginning on the day.
</P>
<P>
The customs union applies an internal tariff exemption policy
on some 7,650 products and the internal tariff rates on some 1,350
sensitive products are scheduled to be removed by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia to Hold Talks With Greece on Name Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia will put forward a
final option in the next round of its talks with Greece on their
dispute concerning the name of Macedonia, media reports said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian daily Dnevnik said Macedonia wants its official
name to be "The Republic of Macedonia (Skoplje)," the last
possible alternative to be accepted by the Macedonian side.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia and Greece have been negotiating at the United
Nations over the official name of Macedonia with the mediation of
U.S. mediator Cyrus Vance since they signed an interim agreement
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Greece proposed recently that Macedonia be called "Slav
Macedonia," which has been rejected by Macedonia. The two sides
will continue their talks on December 17 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian diplomatic sources said if Greece accepted
Macedonia's alternative name, it would be easier for the proposed
name to be approved by the Macedonian parliament, which has
discussed the matter before.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been strongly opposing Macedonia using "The Republic
of Macedonia" as its official name since Macedonia declared
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Athens charged that the name
implied Macedonia's territorial claims for one of its provinces
bearing the same name.

<HEADLINE> OIC Not Taking Sides in Afghan Conflict: Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) is not taking sides in the conflict in
Afghanistan, said Chairman of the ongoing OIC ministerial meeting
here and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The conference is not the taking side of anyone. This must be
understood, don't misinterpret it," Alatas said after a
closed-door meeting of general debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
OIC foreign ministers have agreed to leave Afghanistan's seat
vacant at their 24th meeting, which runs from Monday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Afghan student militia Taliban and of
ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani are both in Jakarta
now vying for the seat.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban seized the Afghan capital city of Kabul in
September and ousted the Rabbani government. Fighting is still
raging on in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rahim Gaffoorzai, a representative of Rabbani's faction,
expressed disappointment at the meeting's decision to leave the
seat vacant, saying that "it was like stabbing a victim who has
already been attacked."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he could understand the OIC's position.
</P>
<P>
Gaffoorzai met with Alatas Tuesday to discuss recent
developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1969, the OIC now comprises 54 member states after
Surinam formally joined the group Monday.
</P>
<P>
The OIC foreign ministers meeting, the first of its kind hosted
by Indonesia, focuses on current world problems and cooperation
among the member countries, officials said.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Honey production in Mexico will reach 56,000

<HEADLINE> EDS-Retransmission in two parts hke -- Yearender: World Economy Turns for the Better in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists have long advocated a strategy of "non-inflationary
economic growth," which has also been pursued by many
governments. Such an ideal, however, is hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
One approach has been to follow a policy of growth with low
inflation, which has proved possible in some countries.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in many developed countries was kept below 3
percent in 1996, while most developing countries succeeded in
controlling inflation at 13.3 percent on average, compared with
19.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, inflation has been kept between 5 and 6 percent and in
the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe it has been cut
from three-digit levels in 1995 to two-digit growth this year.
</P>
<P>
This trend of economic development with low inflation is
expected to continue in the future.
</P>
<P>
Still, there are many problems standing in the way of economic
development for many countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
While the United States faces a huge budget deficit, increasing
family debt and growing disparity in incomes, Japan is still
overshadowed by economic recession, reforms of its industrial
structure have not been completed, and huge bad loan liabilities
have fettered banks' ability to provide loans.
</P>
<P>
Many European Union countries are faced with the dual problems
of two-digit high unemployment rates and the effects of austerity
policies now in place meet the tough budget deficit, debt and
inflation criteria outlined in the Maastricht Treaty, which sets
out the conditions for EU monetary union.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the slowdown in export growth and the lack of adequate
infrastructure and energy supplies which tend to accompany rapid
economic development, pose a major challenge for the region.
</P>
<P>
Africa, which is thirsty for foreign capital, is suffering from
an unbalanced economic structure and unstable political situations
in some regions, while Latin America faces the challenge of
stabilizing its financial system and sharpening its
competitiveness in international markets to maintain its growth
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Eastern European countries, having experienced social and
economic upheavals, have yet to reform their financial systems,
and political uncertainty still exists in some of these countries.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of these unfavorable factors, most authoritative
agencies are optimistic about the prospects for the world economy
in 1997, believing that it is about to enter a new phase of high
speed development.
</P>
<P>
An autumn report from the International Monetary Fund said the
world economy in 1996 is expected to grow by 3.8 percent, up 0.3
percentage points over last year, and predicts a 4.1 percent rise
in 1997. The economies of Russia and other CIS states are also
expected to recover next year.
</P>
<P>
The agencies say many positive factors exist for sustainable
economic development. They include much more active direct
investment around the globe by multinational companies, growing
trade liberalization, stabilization of the world financial market,
stable exchange rates between the major currencies, more fruitful
readjustment and development policies and strategies and better
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
If these predictions are realized, the world economy is likely
to see healthy growth and development in 1997.

PRAGUE, December (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic and Cuba signed
an accord in Singapore today to boost bilateral trade which has
collapsed since the beginning of the 1990s, the Czech News Agency

</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic's main exports to Cuba were food, machinery
products and leather shoes. Cuba's main exports to the republic

"The Senate will never allow public funds to be used for such
an immoral and unethical move," senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago,
chair of the Committee on Constitutional Amendments, was quoted
today as saying by Manila Standard.
</P>
<P>
She said the sentiment of the Senate was indicated by the
unanimous approval by the chamber of two resolutions opposing any
change in the Charter.
</P>
<P>
The senator presided over a hearing Tuesday on the move which
was attended by, among others, Carmen Pedrosa and her husband, two
leaders of the People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and
Action which is launching a nationwide signature campaign, the
first step to amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The couple said that the Congress was bound to appropriate
funds for a plebiscite if the people's initiative was upheld by
the Supreme Court, admitting that they have difficulties in
raising funds to collect some five million signatures as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said however that the two chambers of Congress have
agreed to insert a provision in the 1997 General Appropriations
Act that would prohibit the use of any government fund for a
campaign to amend the Charter.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, businessman Raul Concepcion, president of the
Federation of Philippine Industries, said that he believed the
drive for constitutional amendments could polarize the country and
set back its economic development.
</P>
<P>
But Carmen Pedrosa argued that their motive is to ensure
Filipinos would again get the right to choose a leader whom they
want to elect. They described the term limits on elected officials
prescribed by the Constitution as an "undemocratic principle".
</P>
<P>
The couple denied charges that the Philippine Presidential
Palace was behind their campaign.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: World Economy Turns for the Better in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The world economy picked up in
most regions in 1996, although the all-round growth predicted by
many failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the improvement in economic activity this year has
laid a solid foundation for further gains in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy, which has experienced continuous growth since
1991, should see an increase in gross domestic product (GDP) of
2.4 percent resulting from higher consumption and investment,
marked growth in exports and a reduction in its budget and foreign
trade deficits, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development forecasts.
</P>
<P>
After three years of erratic growth, the Japanese economy is
forecast to see some revitalization following the government's
passing of a supplementary budget to spur growth.
</P>
<P>
Very low interest rates and the Japanese yen's devaluation have
also encouraged investment and exports. Japan's economy is
expected to grow 3 percent this year, compared with 0.9 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Western European countries, which have been plagued by high
interest rates over the past couple of years and suffered unstable
exchange rates in 1995, have suffered slow growth this year
overall.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the 15-nation European Union is estimated at
around 1.6 percent this year, a full 1 percentage point lower than
in 1995, although more stable exchange rates, lower medium and
short-term interest rates and higher exports this year helped
Germany, the driving force in the EU economy, to recover from
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Economic activity in developing countries remained impressive,
with Asia still leading the world with annual growth of 7.3
percent in 1996. But the momentum has slowed as austerity
policies to avoid overheating and excessive inflation have put the
brakes on high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The African economy, which is highly diverse, saw generally
sound development in 1996, with growth up 3 percent over 1995 and
forecasts of further improvement in 1997 of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some countries entered a new phase of steady development after
adopting reform and readjustment policies.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, economic growth for 1996 is estimated at 3
percent, as Mexico emerged successfully from its financial crisis
in 1994 and 1995 and Argentina pulled out of recession.
</P>
<P>
The economies of central and eastern European countries, which
have been going through dramatic economic and social changes,
recorded 0.4 percent growth in 1996 after five consecutive years
of decline.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the former republics of the Soviet Union,
including Russia, saw a continued, albeit slower, slide in their
economies.
</P>
<P>
Economists have long advocated a strategy of "non-inflationary
economic growth," which has also been pursued by many
governments. Such an ideal, however, is hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
One approach has been to follow a policy of growth with low
inflation, which has proved possible in some countries.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in many developed countries was kept below 3
percent in 1996, while most developing countries succeeded in
controlling inflation at 13.3 percent on average, compared with
19.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, inflation has been kept between 5 and 6 percent and in
the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe it has been cut
from three-digit levels in 1995 to two-digit growth this year.
</P>
<P>
This trend of economic development with low inflation is
expected to continue in the future.
</P>
<P>
Still, there are many problems standing in the way of economic
development for many countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
While the United States faces a huge budget deficit, increasing
family debt and growing disparity in incomes, Japan is still
overshadowed by economic recession, reforms of its industrial
structure have not been completed, and huge bad loan liabilities
have fettered banks' ability to provide loans.
</P>
<P>
Many European Union countries are faced with the dual problems
of two-digit high unemployment rates and the effects of austerity
policies now in place meet the tough budget deficit, debt and
inflation criteria outlined in the Maastricht Treaty, which sets
out the conditions for EU monetary union.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the slowdown in export growth and the lack of adequate
infrastructure and energy supplies which tend to accompany rapid
economic development, pose a major challenge for the region.
</P>
<P>
Africa, which is thirsty for foreign capital, is suffering from
an unbalanced economic structure and unstable political situations
in some regions, while Latin America faces the challenge of
stabilizing its financial system and sharpening its
competitiveness in international markets to maintain its growth
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Eastern European countries, having experienced social and
economic upheavals, have yet to reform their financial systems,
and political uncertainty still exists in some of these countries.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of these unfavorable factors, most authoritative
agencies are optimistic about the prospects for the world economy
in 1997, believing that it is about to enter a new phase of high
speed development.
</P>
<P>
An autumn report from the International Monetary Fund said the
world economy in 1996 is expected to grow by 3.8 percent, up 0.3
percentage points over last year, and predicts a 4.1 percent rise
in 1997. The economies of Russia and other CIS states are also
expected to recover next year.
</P>
<P>
The agencies say many positive factors exist for sustainable
economic development. They include much more active direct
investment around the globe by multinational companies, growing
trade liberalization, stabilization of the world financial market,
stable exchange rates between the major currencies, more fruitful
readjustment and development policies and strategies and better
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
If these predictions are realized, the world economy is likely
to see healthy growth and development in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese central
government will fully respect Hong Kong people's will in the
election of the candidate for the first Chief Executive, said Qian
Qichen, chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third plenary session of the Selection Committee
for the First Government of the HKSAR, Qian said that the Chinese
government is confident that the 400 members of the Selection
Committee will make the right choice according to Hong Kong's
overall and long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Selection Committee members are writing Hong
Kong's history and he urged them to cast their sacred votes in the
spirit of being answerable to history and living up to the trust
of the people of the entire country, Hong Kong people included.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that it is the first time in Hong Kong's history for
Hong Kong people to elect their top administrative leader. This
means that Hong Kong will soon embark on a brand new era upon its
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election is a major issue concerning the
implementation of the principles of "One country, Two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of
autonomy as well as Hong Kong's long-term stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that opinions and views of Hong Kong people were
fully canvassed in the whole process of electing the first Chief
Executive, including the formation of the Selection Committee, the
selection of candidates and the question-and-answer sessions. All
was done in a just, fair and open manner.
</P>
<P>
On the question-and-answer sessions held between the Selection
Committee members and the three candidates at the end of last
month, he said that the candidates were in fact facing the whole
of Hong Kong society and the entire Hong Kong people because the
sessions were televised live on the local circuit.
</P>
<P>
He said that these sessions deepened people's understanding of
the three candidates and also introduced a mechanism of fair and
open competition and embodied the traditional fine virtues of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
This has been acclaimed as creating an election culture in Hong
Kong, he said, adding that this shows that Hong Kong communities
welcome this democratic way of doing things.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO to Cut Budget After Britain Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's decision to withdraw
from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) will force the agency to pare down its budget for 1998,
Director-General Mauricio de Maria y Campos said here today.
</P>
<P>
Campos said today he was surprised and disappointed by
Britain's announcement on Monday that it will leave UNIDO on
December 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO, which was set up to encourage industrial development in
third world countries, has already been forced to cut its budget
and staff by 25 percent for 1996 and 1997 after the United States
quit the agency at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Campos said UNIDO has carried out reforms successfully over the
last few years and its 1,300-strong workforce had been reduced to
817.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his opposition to proposals that UNIDO merge with
other U.N. agencies, such as the United Nations Development
Program or the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
He said other organizations could not fulfill UNIDO's mission
and merging would not make UNIDO more effective.
</P>
<P>
Austria has also complained about London's decision to withdraw
from UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State of the Foreign Ministry, Benita
Ferrero-Waldner, said she regretted and was disappointed that
Britain hadn't consulted her country in advance.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO enjoys the support of the European Union, Japan and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany is expected to remain a member although UNIDO has not
yet received Bonn's confirmation, Campos said.
</P>
<P>
The United States was harshly criticized by other member states
when it announced its departure from UNIDO while in arrears on its
membership dues.

PRAGUE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic and Cuba
signed an accord in Singapore today to boost bilateral trade which
has collapsed since the beginning of the 1990s, the Czech News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed by Czech Trade and Industry Minister
Vladimir Dlouhy and Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Ruiz, who
are attending the first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade
Organization held in Singapore.
</P>
<P>

trading partner. Trade volume between Cuba and the former
Czechoslovakia reached 183 million U.S. dollars in 1989, but has
fallen markedly since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The former Czechoslovakia was divided into the Czech Republic
and Slovakia on January 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between Cuba and the Czech Republic are now
improving. Trade volume rose to 4.94 million dollars in 1995 and
to 5.13 million dollars during the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic's main exports to Cuba were food, machinery
products and leather shoes. Cuba's main exports to the republic
were tobacco, fruit and timber.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is investigating
allegations of dumping against Thai Carbon Black Plc, local
newspaper the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Three exporters -- Thai Carbon Black Plc, Thai Epoxy and Allied
Products Co and Thai-MC Co -- are suspected of dumping carbon
black by Indonesia's Anti-Dumping Committee. But Thai Carbon Black
Plc is the only company being investigated.
</P>
<P>
The committee formally began its investigation on November 7
after it determined that imports of carbon black from Thailand
were hurting local producers.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imports carbon black from more than 20 countries. In
1994 it imported 20.3 million tons, with Thailand having a market
share of 3.54 percent in terms of volume and 5.06 percent in terms
of value.
</P>
<P>
Imports last year were 35.6 million tons, with the Thai share
6.24 percent in terms of volume.
</P>
<P>
This year, Indonesia's Office of Commercial Affairs predicts
that Thailand will have an 11.76 percent share in term of volume
and 13.02 percent share in terms of value.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Forge Accord with Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) said
it expects to reach a deal with its pilots, which would clear the
way for a 4-billion-US-dollar purchase of new jets from Boeing Co.
of the U.S. and Airbus Industrie of France, local daily Business
World reported today.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the PAL management and the 600-member Pilots
Union have brought them closer to agreement on staffing long-haul
flights, the report quoted PAL Chief Financial Officer Jaime
Bautista as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Labor and Employment Department ruled that the
airline must use two first officers on those flights. PAL, which
argued that one would be adequate, said the order would increase
its costs and jeopardize the refleeting plan.
</P>
<P>
"There is progress in the discussions with the Pilots Union now
that they have been made fully aware of the consequences the
decision would have on the expansion program," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
PAL Tuesday announced that it will downsize by 50 percent its
refleeting program as it cannot cover the additional cost to be
incurred by pay rise demands of its pilots.
</P>
<P>
PAL Chairman Lucio Tan said PAL will cancel the purchase of
some of the aircraft it has ordered and has already drafted a
notice informing the aircraft manufacturers of the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
However, Bautista said the decision on whether to scale back
the plane orders will not be made until negotiations with the
union have been exhausted and an appeal of the Labor Department
ruling is heard.
</P>
<P>
According to the refleeting program it had announced earlier,
PAL would buy eight new Boeing 747-400s, four Airbus 340-400s,
eight Airbus 330-300s and 12 Airbus 320s.
</P>
<P>
PAL's Pilots Union is demanding a 10-percent pay hike over a
five-year period. It is also demanding the staffing of two first
officers on long-haul flights.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympics Organizers Have no New Bomb Probe Leads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of the
Atlanta Olympic Games said on Tuesday that they had given all to
federal authorities when responding to an FBI plea for fresh leads
to help the investigation into July's bomb blast at the Centennial
Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said on Monday it would pay up to 500,000 U.S. dollars
for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the July 27
explosion, which caused two deaths and more than 100 injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) said video
tapes from security cameras at the park were turned over to
investigators on the day of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"That was in the hands of the FBI within hours," ACOG chief
operating officer A.D. Frazier said. "Everything we've had has
been turned over long since."
</P>
<P>
Olympic organisers have fully cooperated with the
investigation but have not been briefed on it, ACOG president
Billy Payne said. "We have not been a participant in the
governmental investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal newspaper reported on Tuesday that the FBI
had received more than 300 calls since offering the reward. The
report quoted FBI spokesman Paul Bresson as saying he did not know
how many of the calls were useful.
</P>
<P>
"Typically, when we set up a hotline, we get a lot of calls
that don't have any investigative usefulness," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Zealand Parties to Coalesce for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand First party
announced last night that it had chosen the National Party as its
partner in the next coalition government out of what observers
believe consideration to maintain government stability for the
coming three years.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the move, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters
said the decision had been reached by "massive consensus" of his
party's caucus. But he also admitted that it had been the most
difficult decision in his political career.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that economic and political stability topped the
list of reasons for his party to form a coalition with the
National Party.
</P>
<P>
The decision ended nearly two months of uncertainty in New
Zealand's political life after the general election in October, in
which no party won a majority to form a single party government.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First had been locked in intense talks with the two
big parties, the National Party and the Labor Party, in the past
eight weeks and more, and the end of the exhausting bargaining
process signals the beginning of the first coalition government in
New Zealand's history.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First, a party made up of defectors from both Labor
and National, as well as Maori representatives, found it not an
easy task to choose its coalition partner while maintaining the
delicate balance of power in its own camp. It is understood that
its 17 MPs were divided on whether to work with National or Labor.
</P>
<P>
The difficulty in making the decision found the best expression
in the lengthy meeting of its caucus meeting Tuesday which last
throughout the day. The time to announce the crucial decision was
put off twice before its finally came out by 7:40 in the evening.
</P>
<P>
In the 120-member parliament, the two governing parties will
combine to enjoy a majority of 61 seats. The National Party is
also expected to get support from the United Party MP. In
addition, it could count on the backing from the ACT party so long
as the coalition sticks to the direction of economic reforms,
although the eight MPs of ACT strongly dislike New Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp will consist of the Labor Party and the
Alliance party with a total of 50 MPs.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government is expected to maintain most of the
economic policies pursued in the past few years, with some
spending increases in social areas including health and education.
But the planned tax cuts for this year may be deferred.
</P>
<P>
Though Peters promised not to disclose the terms of the failed
deal with the Labor Party, it is widely expected that Labor will
spend much more than National, which will scare the sharemarket
and investors.
</P>
<P>
As the price to form the coalition, the National Party has
agreed to give the portfolio of deputy prime minister to Peters,
who has also got a new post of treasurer based on the Australian
model.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Reconsider Safeguard on Colombian Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombian
authorities have asked the United States to reconsider the
safeguard imposed on sorghum brooms exported to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Colombian sorghum brooms "are not a threat to
U.S. manufacturers," Colombian Trade Minister Morris Harf was
quoted today by the "La Republica" newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The safeguard, which imposes a 33 percent tariff on Colombian
exports that exceed the quota of 12,000 dozen brooms for 1996,
will choke off the growth of sales to the U.S. market, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the U.S. government to "reconsider urgently"
the application of this safeguard on Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on safeguards
establishes a quota of 12,000 dozen brooms. The quota accounts for
less than half the number of Colombian brooms exported to the
U.S. in 1995 and one-third of what it will sell this year.

WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls suspended
forward Dennis Rodman for two games without pay Tuesday for using
profane language in criticising NBA officials in a television

"Dennis' use of foul and abusive language and the

his profane outburst, cannot and will not be tolerated," said
Bulls vice president Jerry Krause.

Krause said the money withheld from Rodman would be donated to
charity.

Rodman, known as much for his wild hair styles, body piercings

rebounding skills, will miss Wednesday's game against Minnesota

<HEADLINE> Telegram Business Waning in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- About 60 percent of the urban
post offices in China have removed their telegram services, which
have long been a leading money-maker for China's
telecommunications sector, the Beijing-based "Market Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past five years, the business
volume of telegrams has plunged by an average 30 percent annually,
compared with the 43 percent growth in the total business volume
of China's post and telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that such modern communication means as the
telephone, fax, mobile phone, beeper service and computer network,
which have mushroomed since the beginning of 1990's, are squeezing
the telegram service out of the country's telecommunications
market.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the decades-long increase in telegram
service usage came to an end in the late 1980s, when the sector
went into a slump after its record business volume of 150 million
telegrams per year.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the length of time needed to exchange messages by
telegram was anywhere from four hours to three days, but most of
the Chinese people chose the telegram rather than the telephone
due to the small coverage and low technical quality of the
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
But with the rapid development in telephone technology over the
past few years, about 80 percent of the former telegram customers
have switched to telephones and mobile phones, and 10 percent to
fax, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the shrinking number of telegram users is the
telephone boom, which is caused by the country's widespread
promotion of program-controlled telephone switching systems.
</P>
<P>
China's telephone switching capacity hit 90 million lines this
August, nine times the number in 1992, and the number of
family-used telephones accounts for 85 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
However, in the countryside, the telephone density rate is less
than one percent, compared with 15 percent in cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that though the telegram will remain the speediest
means of communication for most rural people in the next 10 years,
the telephone trend will spread to more and more areas.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that the number of telephone owners in China
will increase by 15 million annually, and the telephone switching
capacity will reach 170 million lines by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The telegram service will finally give way to that of the
telephone as the country's telephone density rate hits a new high
in the next century, they said.

<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Traffic through the Channel
Tunnel fell by more than 40 percent in November compared with the
level recorded in October due to the fire in the tunnel on
November 18, Eurotunnel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Eurotunnel, the Channel Tunnel
operator, the number of Eurostar passengers in November was
295,161, about 40 percent lower over October's 488,244, but up
from 283,180 in the same month last year, thus bringing the number
of passengers carried so far this year to 4,605,556.
</P>
<P>
Eurostar said that since the service resumed on December 4
after the fire, ticket sales were "picking up steadily" and that
several trains were full last Sunday.

on the 48,263 lorries carried in November 1995. Up to now the
number of trucks having passed through the tunnel this year has
reached 519,003.
</P>
<P>
The number of cars carried by the Le Shuttle car-carrying

<HEADLINE> Crude Tumbles With Iraqi Oil Set to Flow as US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Most energy futures prices
tumbled today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with Iraq's
imminent return to world oil markets coming just as the U.S.
inventory of unleaded gasoline appears to be easing.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that oil refineries across the country are
producing distillate and unleaded gasoline at near-peak
efficiency, while warm weather over much of the eastern half of
the country appears to have eased demand.
</P>
<P>
Crude for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
fell 88 cents to 24.42 U.S. dollars a barrel; January heating oil
fell 2.51 cents to 69.62 cents a gallon; and January unleaded gas
fell 2.02 cents to 66.86 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
As early as Saturday, Iraq could begin selling about 580,000
barrels a day of crude oil to world markets over a six-month
period to buy food and medicine, under the supervision of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Heating oil and other distillate supplies as of last week were
12.1 percent below levels a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With the acceleration of production, distillate stocks of the
U.S. rose a sharp 2.107 million barrels to 122.17 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Crude supplies rose against expectations to 300.6 million
barrels, as refineries produced at 94.2 percent of capacity.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Votes on Top UN Post With No Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council held its first informal poll for the post of
secretary-general, but reached no decision after two rounds of
straw votes.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that all of the four current candidates
for the post failed to escape negative votes from the permanent
members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The results of one decisive voting today are 10 to four votes
for Kofi Annan of Ghana; seven to four for Amara Essy of Sierra
Leon; five to seven for Hamid Algabid of Niger; and three to seven
for Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Kofi Annan received one negative vote from the
permanent members of the Security Council, Amara Essay two, Hamid
Algabid two, and Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania two.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council are China,
France, Russia, Britain and the United States. Any candidate
running for the post of secretary-general has to receive at least
nine votes in favor, including the concurrent positive votes of
the five permanent members.
</P>
<P>
It means that if happened in a formal meeting, no one of the
four can be recommended by the council to the General Assembly for
the top U.N. post.
</P>
<P>
In the other round of straw voting which did not make any
distinction between the permanent and non-permanent members of the
council, Annan got 12 votes in favor, two against, Essy 11 votes
in favor, four against, Ould-Abdallah seven votes in favor, five
against, and Algabid seven votes in favor, five votes against.
</P>
<P>
Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci told the press that
since there is no decision reached in the meeting, the council
will continue to discuss the issue Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
On November 19, the United States cast the lone negative vote
against the incumbent Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
a second five-year term, saying that he was slow in reforming the
world organization.
</P>
<P>
On December 4, Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council that he
intended to suspend his candidacy for the time being, which opened
the door for the nomination of other candidates.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros-Ghali insisted that he remained a candidate for the
top U.N. post and that he would join in the contest when the
situation is clarified in the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> US TV Industry Works Out Ratings Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. television
industry has worked out a self-disciplinary plan to rate programs
into six broad categories to guide parents in deciding what
programs are suitable for their children to watch.
</P>
<P>
The ratings will include categories of "TV-G," suitable for
all audiences, to "TV-M," for mature audiences only. The system
will also rate children's shows with a "K." News and sports
programs will be exempt from the ratings, an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
The TV industry has said it plans to begin rating broadcast,
cable and public TV shows by January.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, shows will be rated using the
following categories: "K," material suitable for children of all
ages; "K-7," material suitable for children 7 and older; "TV-G,"
material suitable for all audiences; "TV-PG," parental guidance is
suggested; "TV-14," material may be inappropriate for children
under 14; and "TV-M," for mature audiences only.
</P>
<P>
Children's advocacy groups said that the proposed system is too
vague that parents will be difficult to decide what their children
should or shouldn't watch, particularly for the "TV-PG" and
"PG-14" ratings.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NATO Sets Up Agenda for Next Year's Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The autumn session of the
North Atlantic Council Ministerial Meeting ended here today,
setting up an agenda for a NATO summit meeting next year to set
the course of the alliance as it moves to the next century.
</P>
<P>
The other major issue discussed at today's meeting, attended by
foreign ministers from the 16 NATO member countries, was the
situation in Bosnia and NATO's preparation for the follow-on
peacekeeping mission in that country.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told a news conference
after the meeting that "major decisions" would have to be taken by
the time of the summit concerning NATO's internal reform,
enlargement, new role and missions.
</P>
<P>
In the Final Communique issued after the ministerial meeting,
NATO outlined the agenda for the summit next July in the Spanish
capital of Madrid, which includes agreeing a new command
structure, finalizing arrangements for the European Security and
Defense Identity within NATO, inviting "one or more" countries for
accession talks and intensifying relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
As for NATO's operation in Bosnia, the ministers endorsed the
operational plan for the Stabilization Force (SFOR), which is to
replace the current peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, when the
latter's mandate expires on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The plan for this smaller contingent of 31,000 troops with an
18-month mandate also has to be approved by NATO defense ministers
when they meet here next week.
</P>
<P>
This plan will be finally approved when the UN Security Council
provides the mandate for NATO to continue its mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Regarding NATO's structure reform, the ministers reviewed the
progress made in the development of the alliance's future command
structure, but difference remained between the United States and
France over who should take charge of NATO's southern command in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
France has been pushing for the southern command to be headed
by a European, reflecting the desire on the continent to develop
its own security identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, has ruled out giving up the post,
which is currently responsible for the Sixth Fleet and is integral
to Wahsington's Middle East policy.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not compromise on this issue," US State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters today after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There may be other ways to give the Europeans a stronger role
to play, but the AFSOUTH (Command in Allied Forces Southern Europe)
is not the place to start," he said.
</P>
<P>
To soften Russia's objection to NATO's eastward expansion, NATO
foreign ministers stated in the communique that NATO had "no
intention, no plan and no reason" to station nuclear weapons on
the soil of its new member countries.
</P>
<P>
But it stopped short of a guarantee not to deploy nuclear arms
eastward under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers said in the communique that NATO wished
to set up "a strong and durable framework," which could be
realized in the form of a document or a charter, for NATO-Russia
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Russia kept denouncing NATO's plan to expand eastward
and has not yet responded to the above proposal which had been
often raised by NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers are expected to meet their Russian
counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, here in the traditional "16 plus
one" form.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Somalia Inquiry Likely to Drag On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Believing that it's almost
impossible to finish its work by March 31, Canada's Somalia
inquiry has asked the government for another extension.
</P>
<P>
"The request now is before the Privy Council," a spokesman from
the inquiry commission was quoted by local media reports today as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry did not say how long an extension it wants, but it
outlined what it thinks still remains to be done, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Originally supposed to report a year ago, the inquiry has
already received two extensions.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1995, the inquiry has been looking into the
Canadian Airborne Regiment's infamous mission to Somalia in
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is in the middle of testimony about an incident
on March 4, 1993, in which Canadian soldiers shot and killed one
Somali and wounded another.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda are a 1993 incident, in which a Somali
teenager was beaten and tortured to death, as well as allegations
of coverup by Canadian officials during and after the mission.
</P>
<P>
The coverup scandal has resulted in the resignation of General
Jean Boyle, former chief of defense staff, in early October.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Senate to Ratify Women's Rights Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the Senate to approve an international treaty on
women's rights 17 years after its adoption by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women, was adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly in December 1979 and approved by more than 130
nations.
</P>
<P>
The treaty requires that women have equal rights to work, pay,
benefits and safe working conditions. It also prohibits
discrimination against women in political activities and requires
a minimum age for marriage.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed by the then U.S. President Jimmy Carter
in July 1980, but it was not submitted for Senate approval until
November 1980 after Carter had lost to Ronald Reagan. Neither
President Reagan nor his successor, President George Bush, sought
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted today the United States, "where we have worked so
hard to empower women," has procrastinated far too long.
</P>
<P>
"It is, to say the least, an embarrassment that the United
States has not done this," Clinton said. "There is no excuse for
this situation to continue."

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Suspect Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Unabomber suspect Theodore
J. Kaczynski pleaded innocent today via video to charges he sent
the mail bomb killing an advertising executive exactly two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski's plea from California was made through a live hookup
to the federal courthouse in Newark, New jersey, where Judge
Dickinson R. Debevoise presided in a courtroom, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Among those present was Susan Mosser, whose 50-year-old
husband, Thomas, was killed when he opened a package containing a
bomb on December 10, 1994, in his northern New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, California, where Kaczynski has been jailed
since early summer, the U.S. Marshals Service moved Kaczynski to
the county public defender's office for the cross-country
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has
pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January
whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face
for the two California bombing deaths.
</P>
<P>
Debevoise also heard arguments on a defense request to transfer
the New Jersey case to Sacramento, where a November trial date has
been set. Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on
all the Unabomber charges.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, 54, was arrested April 3 at his cabin in Lincoln,
Montana, and is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities believe he used bombs to kill three people
and injure 23 others between 1978 and 1995.

CAIRO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) today signed an agreement on carrying out a project for
sustained development of human resources in Sinai Peninsula, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the UNDP will offer Egypt half a million
U.S. dollars grant to help transfer advanced agricultural
technology to the new communities in Sinai in addition to
implementation of an intensive training program for workers in
the agricultural sector in the area.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Tourism contributions to the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of Egypt will increase by eight folds by the year 2005,
according to a recent International Tourism and Travel Council
report.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian tourism officials said that over the past ten years a
total of 415 projects have been approved at a cost of 22.2 billion
Egyptian pounds (about 7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The volume of foreign investment in Jordan has stood
at around 300 million U.S. dollars, of which 70 million dollars
are invested in the Amman Financial market.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper Jordan Times here today quoted
Director General of the Investment Encouragement Corporation Taleb
Rifai as saying the percentage of foreign investment to the Gross
National Product (GNP) reached 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Rifai denied the existence of any Israeli investment in
Jordan, but conceded that Israelis will be considered like any
other foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
But he said there are joint ventures being carried out as
schemes between the two countries and in implementation of the
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The European Union (EU) will grant Jordan 40 million
European Currency Units (ECUs) (about 50 million U.S. dollars) by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
This was the remainder of the 100 million ECUs (120 million
dollars) in grants agreed upon between the two sides to support
the balance of payments of the Arab state, Secretary General of
the Ministry of Planning Nabil Ammari was quoted by Jordan Times
today as saying
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian-European partnership agreement will be signed
next January, said he.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides, he added, are still
ongoing "at the highest levels" to resolve some points of
difference, mainly on admission of Jordanian products to enter
EU countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes NATO's Enlargement Summit Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today welcomed a decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to hold a 1997 summit to invite new members to join the
Western security alliance.
</P>
<P>
The summit would "carry forward our goal of building a Europe
that is undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time in
history," Clinton said,
</P>
<P>
"We will work to forge a partnership with Russia, adapt NATO to
the demands of a new era, and invite the first aspiring members
from among Europe's new democracies into NATO," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the 16-member NATO foreign ministers meeting in
Brussels agreed that the leaders of the alliance would hold a
special summit in Madrid on July 8-9 next year to invite new
members to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
Clinton set 1999 as the target date to award membership to some
Eastern European nations. But he did not mention which of the
countries would be in the first group to join the Western alliance.
But Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are widely seen as
the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to see them become full members of the alliance for
NATO's 50th birthday in 1999," Clinton restated today.

<P>
Johannesburg, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob today narrowly escaped death when his jet almost
crashed into a car at an airtrip in the southern Kalahari Desert.
</P>
<P>
Radio Namibia said the plane carrying the prime minister, his wife
and child and seven others, including a state-television crew, had to
make a hurried take-off when the pilot saw a car on the run-way.
</P>
<P>
The culprit turned out to be the prime minister's driver, who says
he had been instructed to sweep the airfield before the plane landed.
