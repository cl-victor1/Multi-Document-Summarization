<HEADLINE> Annan: Peace-Building to Be Priority in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Peace-building must be
the common focus of Liberia and its partners in the international
community, Kofi Annan, the U.N. Secretary-General, stressed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Special
Conference on Liberia which was held today at the headquarters of
the United Nations, the U.N. chief said much had sacrificed in the
effort to bring peace to Liberia - in lives, in effort and in
resources.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the primary responsibility for
ensuring that conflict was not re-ignited in Liberia necessarily
rested with the Liberian government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief commended President Taylor for the constructive
and statesmanlike manner in which he had begun to lay the
foundations for long-term peace, reconciliation and development in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Annan also acknowledged and applauded the formation in Liberia
of a broad-based and inclusive Government, as well as the
expressed commitment of the New President to promote the
protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Annan said, the international community must do
all it could to ensure that the conditions for conflict did not
return. It must demonstrate the spirit of cooperation. generosity
and goodwill towards Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that Liberia was facing a long and difficult
road. Economic activities remained modest. Much of the population
remained displaced. Most of the demobilized fighters were yet to
be absorbed in reintegration programs. And basic institutions
and services were not yet fully operational. The Impact on Liberia
of the situation in Sierra Leone also remained a source of
concern.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Liberian Government and the international
society to work together to address the challenges facing Liberia
and ensure the success of the peace process in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Firms Urged to Be Eco-friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A noted industrialist today
urged Zimbabwean companies to manufacture environmentally
friendly products if they are to continue exporting to the
lucrative European market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists, Director of Zimbabwe Trade Peter
Johnstone said the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries and
Zimbabwe Trade were jointly organizing workshops on productivity,
environment and trade.
</P>
<P>
The workshops would be held from October 29 to 31, aimed at
raising awareness among Zimbabwean industries of the new
challenges and opportunities in the field of product related
eco-requirements and increasing co-efficience in the production
process.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwean exporters have to take environmental requirements
on export markets, particularly in Europe, seriously if they want
to increase their market shares,'' said Johnstone, also Director
of the Export Processing Zones.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, had the necessary infrastructure of export
promotion, standardization, quality control and certification
organizations to gain an image as an eco-conscious country where
buyers from Europe could find reliable suppliers for the new and
expanding green market niche.
</P>
<P>
''Adjusting to the new requirements will not impair the
competitiveness of Zimbabwean industries but increase it. On the
other hand, as suppliers of higher quality goods meeting the new
eco-criteria, they will be able to demand higher prices for their
exports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The new focus on eco-management, he said, could lead to
increased efficiency and productivity in turn resulting in
reduced costs and harmful impacts of industrial production on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
He stressed employment creation was a priority in Zimbabwe if
the current downward trend toward poverty was to be reversed and
economic growth and stability were to be fostered.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve significant gains, he said, industrial
expansion had to be based on increasing export in the region and
to the north.

CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
of Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The first two foreign investment funds are set to be
injected in the Beirut Stock Exchange, Lebanon's newspaper the
Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Regent Pacific group, an emerging market specialist based
in London and Hong Kong, has launched a 50 million U.S. dollars
fund to invest primarily in the Beirut bourse.
</P>
<P>
The fund, to be traded outside Lebanon, will also invest in
treasury bills and unlisted over-the-counter shares, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale, the world's 29th biggest bank will launch a
similar fund next Monday to raise a maximum of 150 million
U.S. dollars to invest mainly in the stock markets of Lebanon,
Jordan, Egypt, Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time that wholly foreign firms have
earmarked funds for direct investments into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus Stock Market maintained this week the
shallow, but continuous, sliding pattern exhibited last week,
according to a report issued by the Cyprus Investment and
Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO) today.
</P>
<P>
The report says trading volumes were rather suppressed with
interest remaining focused primarily on banking stocks and to a
lesser extent, insurance and industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed Thursday at 385.6 points,
having shed 4.3 points or 1.1 percent on the week.
</P>
<P>
The total weekly volume of transactions reached 2.3 million
Cyprus pounds (about 4.6 million U.S. dollars) this week,
compared to 4.1 million pounds (about 8.2 million dollars) the
week before.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' trade deficit fell almost 4 percent in the
first five months of this year versus the same period in 1996,
according to a report issued today by the Department of
Statistics and Research.
</P>
<P>
Total exports decreased by 5.9 percent to 253 million
Cyprus pounds (about 506 million U.S. dollars), in the first
five months of 1997, compared with 269 million pounds (about
538 million dollars) in January-May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Total imports (covering items for home consumption and those
placed in bonded storage) fell 4.4 percent, to 765.7 million
pounds (about 1531.4 million dollars) this January-May, versus
801.3 million pounds (about 1602.6 million dollars) over the
same year-on-year period.
</P>
<P>
The result was a 3.7 percent trade deficit drop to 512.7
million pounds (about 1025.4 million dollars) this January-May,
compared to 532.4 million pounds (about 1064.8 million dollars)
year-on-year in 1996.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Strikers Holding, the parent company of Lebanon's
fifth largest insurance firm Strikers Insurance and Reinsurance,
has sold 51 percent of its shares to Bahrain-based Mediterranean
and Gulf Insurance and Reinsurance (MEDGULF).
</P>
<P>
The deal is seen as the start of consolidation in Lebanon's
over-crowded insurance sector, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Strikers, a relative new-comer to the Lebanese insurance
scene, was founded in 1990 and ranks fifth behind Bankers,
Mesir, Lebanon-Suisse and Societe Nationale d'Assurances(SNA).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the company had 14.14 million U.S. dollars in
earned premium. Its total assets stood at 14.06 million U.S.
dollars and shareholders' equity was 1.99 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are currently around 100 companies licensed to provide
insurance cover in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A new border gate along the Turkish-Syrian border is
to be opened later this week for trade between the two countries,
local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Traders will be allowed to buy or sell goods no more than four
times a week through the gate, called Akcakale, in the
southeastern province of Sanli Urfa.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade by one trader must be no more than 200,000
U.S. dollars for one month, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of this new border gate is aimed at sharing the
burden on the heavily used Habur border gate, local officials said.

ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is committed to
eliminate child labor by the year 2000, a government official
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony of the National UNICEF cards
campaign held Thursday in Lahore, Minister of Commerce Ishaq Dar
said that the government was establishing a task force to
eliminate child labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Dar, the task force will consist of high-level

</P>
<P>
A high-powered advisory committee would also be formed to
implement policies and plans recommended by the task force, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that the situation of children in Pakistan was
certainly not satisfactory and there was much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
"The problems faced by our children posed a serious challenge
to the nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle was lack of funding in the social sector, he
said, adding that the business community should come forward and
play an important role.

<HEADLINE> Oman Supports Palestine: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Oman today reaffirmed its
support for the Palestinian Authority position for an Israeli
withdrawal from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Oman has actively participated in supporting peace process in
the Middle East and demands that the relevant resolutions and
agreements be implemented in full, said Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yousef Alawi Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going 52nd session of the United Nations
General Assembly, he said Oman's stance stems from the reason that
peace serves the interests of all the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Oman calls on the international community to enhance the preace
process by rendering support "both financially and logistically"
to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
The support enables the Palestinian Authority to establish the
foundations for peace in territories and to build the economic
necessary infrastructures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Oman also supports the Syrian position for
the resumption of talks with Israel "based on the full and
complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Hights".
</P>
<P>
"We would also like to reaffirm the importance of an Israeli
withdrawal form the occupied Lebanese terrorists to the
internationally recognized borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Oman's "absolute rejection of all forms of
violence and terrorism".

<HEADLINE> Southeastern European Defense Ministers Meet in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from seven
southeastern European nations gathered here today to discuss the
integration of the Euro-Atlantic security structure and military
cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov, who is also
Commander-in-Chief of Bulgaria's Armed Forces, also attended the
opening ceremony, together with Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The president said he hopes that such meetings will help
countries in the region cooperate in restructuring and modernizing
the armed forces and in building joint military formations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the second of its kind for nations not granted
pre-approval for entering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) at the military alliance's Madrid summit in July.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Stoyanov said he is confident that his
country would meet all the criteria for NATO membership by the
spring of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. defense head Cohen said after a separate
meeting with Stoyanov that Bulgaria has made good progress in
military reforms.
</P>
<P>
He also said Bulgaria is "very high" on the list of nations
which are waiting for the NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Most of the seven southeastern European countries, namely
Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia and
Turkey, participated in the Partnership for Peace program,
launched by NATO in 1994 to help foster ties with its former
Warsaw Pact adversaries and other neutral countries.
</P>
<P>
NATO Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Klaus
Peter Kleiber, who greeted the Sofia meeting on behalf of NATO,
said that cooperation within the Partnership for Peace initiative
is equally important.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Set up New Oil Refinery Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pak Arab Refinery Limited
(PARCO) is to establish a new oil refinery near Multan in southern
Punjab province at a cost of 886 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Construction contract of the oil refinery named Mid Country
Refinery Project (MCRP) was awarded today to two Japanese
companies -- Marubeni Corporation and Japan Gasoline Corporation
(JGC).
</P>
<P>
MCRP is the first refinery after the lapse of 30 years of the
setting up of National Refinery Limited and Pakistan Refinery
Limited.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Board of Directors of PARCO gave its final
approval for the award.
</P>
<P>
The oil refinery will have a daily capacity of 100,000 barrels
which is almost equivalent to the combined output of the existing
petroleum refining facilities in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The project will reduce Pakistan's dependence on imported oil
products, saving 100 million dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
The oil refinery is expected to be completed by September 30,
2000 at a total cost of 886 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
There is an acute shortage of refining capacity in Pakistan,
which has dropped to only about 40 percent of its requirement.
Thus a major new refinery is a critical requirement for the
country.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Urges SAARC Countries to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif called on the member states of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to involve their people in
bilateral and multi-lateral economic and political cooperation
between them.
</P>
<P>
"We must now ensure the participation of South Asian people
themselves in the process of regional cooperation and make our
institutions more accessible and more relevant to our people,"
Sharif said today in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city, while
inaugurating a 3-day SAARC Law Conference.
</P>
<P>
South Asian cooperation has emerged as an important dimension
in the foreign policy of each of the seven member states of SAARC
as the world is increasingly moving towards regional groupings,
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, founded in December 1985 and comprises Bangladesh,
India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, is the
world's largest regional grouping in terms of population and
potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he observed, it is a grouping of developing countries
where a large number of people are still living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
"We must give priority to the issues that actually affect the
lives of our people and SAARC will be of relevance to them only to
the extent that we succeed in resolving such issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for the establishment of
professional, intellectual, technical and cultural links between
people of SAARC states and continued exchange of thoughts and
ideas to deal with old problems that have lingered as well as the
new ones that may emerge.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Asset Reporting Rule Stalled in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
shelved its controversial foreign-asset reporting rule for at
least a year under pressure from the province of British Columbia
(B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The rule requiring all Canadian citizens to report foreign
assets over 100,000 dollars (72,000 USD) was to have taken effect
in April of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin and Revenue Minister Herb
Dhaliwal announced Thursday in Vancouver that the rule will be
delayed for a year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said today that the two ministers have also asked the
auditor-general to study the rule and come up with alternatives by
May 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Federal tax officials have said that the law was designed to
bring fairness to the tax system and make it easier to uncover tax
cheats.
</P>
<P>
Yet, since it was announced in March 1996, the rule set off a
torrent of protest in B.C.'s Asian immigrant community and
incurred criticism from tax accountants across the country.
</P>
<P>
"The perception here on the West Coast was that it was
anti-Asian," said Robert Fairweather, chairman of the Vancouver
Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
"This provision, which had never been properly explained by the
government, had created the perception that we don't want people
to come here, that we put hurdles in their way that would make
them conclude there are better places to emigrate to, like
Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The revenue minister conceded that the government has to be
sensitive to concern that tougher rules could scare off potential
immigrants or lead people to shift money out of Canada.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the government remains committed to ensuring
that all Canadians pay their share of taxes and pay them on
worldwide income.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver lawyer Mason Loh, one of the leaders of the move
against the rule, insisted that the damage will continue during
the one-year delay period. Scrapping the law will be the only
answer, he said.
</P>
<P>
The delay came after an organized lobbying campaign against the
rule that was centred mainly in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
A large Asian community was reported to be at the forefront of
the effort; business groups such as the Vancouver Board of Trade
also became involved.

<HEADLINE> Trade Link Between Rival Cypriot Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has suggested
that Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities establish trade links
as a step towards reconciliation on their divided eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The idea was put forward by Richard Holbrooke,
U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, during a meeting in New
York with Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, Cyprus News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 Dayton accords that ended a
three-and-half year ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, was quoted
as saying that "if the borders between the two parts of Cyprus
opened up for international business, it would be mutually
beneficial."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke pointed out "many peoples and countries have trade
when they do not have their political differences settled,"
adding that such business dealings would help increase the per
capita income of the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said it is up to the two sides on the island
to work out the details of the idea.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will be co-convener of a business conference later
this month in Brussels to promote economic cooperation among
businessmen from Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said Thursday before his
departure for New York that he will discuss the possibility of
U.S. investments in Cyprus when he meets Holbrooke in New York.
</P>
<P>
He will be joined by Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou and Central Bank Governor Afxentis Afxentiou, as
well as U.S. business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Radio reported Thursday that the business meeting was
arranged at Holbrooke's initiative. His idea is that business
could play a role in efforts to ease tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. businessmen are urged to participate in joint ventures
between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Cyprus' House of Representatives
debated Thursday a government bill which seeks to legalize trade
across the Green Line dividing the island under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north and
Greek Cypriot-dominated south in 1974 when Turkish troops landed
and took over the 37 percent of the island following a short-lived
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has maintained a boycott of the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" since its
unilateral declaration of independence in 1983. It has also
striven to prevent trade between the breakaway state and the rest
of the world.

process in parliament, will have to be juggled to squeeze in
unbudgeted lump-sum gratuities to be paid to ex-freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to do a juggling act, but I must confess this is
a serious problem," Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa told
journalists today.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the juggling would not impact negatively on
the country.
</P>
<P>
Debate on the vote allocations for the various ministries
would continue in parliament despite the fact that it was now
obvious there would be changes made to whatever the house would
have ratified.
</P>
<P>
Laying down conditions for continued support for the second
phase of the structural adjustment program, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank have said support would continue
once financing of the war veteran gratuity was resolved.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of nationwide demonstrations by ex-fighters
complaining of neglect, President Robert Mugabe undertook to pay
each of the estimated 70,000 ex-guerillas a lump-sum gratuity of
50,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (4,300 U.S. Dollars) by December at an
estimated cost of 3.5 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (310 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ex-fighters would, as from next January, be
entitled to a monthly pension of 2,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (160
U.S. Dollars), including free health and education for their
families.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said, "We would need to look at some cuts
with both recurrent and capital expenditure, and we would also
look at other sources like the outside financial markets."
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said specific areas where the government would cut had
not been identified yet.
</P>
<P>
He said the award to the war veterans who waged Zimbabwe's
guerrilla warfare which culminated in independence in 1980 was
made to quell a volatile situation. Zimbabwe had to incur the
extra cost for the benefit of social stability.
</P>
<P>
Asked if his ministry was consulted in arriving at the high
figures, the minister said, "the issue was brought to cabinet and
was discussed there. Social stability has a cost."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator: Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official has
warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu persists
in his settlement policy, he would find no one to go on the peace
talks with him.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government in the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Saeb Erekat made the remark during an interview
with the Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio today just before the start
of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also a key negotiator with Israelis, said the 34
provisions of the interim stage agreement would be discussed
during the talks due in Washington next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the talks that are scheduled to be held
between October 13 and 19 will deal with the Israeli unilateral
moves such as the settlement expansion and the confiscation of the
Palestinian lands, Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also define a deadline for the work of the nine
committees' charges with carrying out the provisions of the
interim stage agreement of the Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official urged that Israel should implement the
established agreements. Netanyahu has to choose either pursuing the
talks as means of establishing peace or continuing the settlement
expansion and imposing fait accompli, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been in a crisis
since March when Israel started the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. The situation was aggravated in
two suicide bombing attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem in late
July and early September, killing a total of 25 people.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were revived following the visit to the region
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last month.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Italian Envoy Car Accident in Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and seven others wounded after one of the three vehicles
escorting Italian envoy to Somalia Giuseppe Cassini overturned,
witnesses said today.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred near Lego village, 130 km southwest of
the capital, via Baidoa road late last night.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, when the first Toyota pick-up
travelling on high speed swerved, one of the tyres of the truck
exploded, making the driver lose control of the vehicle so that
the car turned over, killing one of its occupants on the spot and
wounding eight others.
</P>
<P>
All wounded were rushed back to Mogadishu for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the accident, the Italian Envoy to Somalia continued
his journey to Baidoa town to probe the alleged massacre there.
</P>
<P>
Baidoa has recently been a focal point for the fighting
between Hussein Mohamed Aidid's forces and those of the Rahanwein
Army (RRA) over the control of the region.
</P>
<P>
Before returning to Mogadishu this afternoon, Cassini has this
morning toured the main hospital of the town, the main market and
several other parts of Baidoa where he met different community
figures including Hussein Aidid's representatives in Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
There is no official word yet from Cassini himself whether
there has been any trace for the alleged massacre in the area.
However, at the time of his visit, the troubled areas surrounding
Baidoa were calm, and there were no reports of any violence.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Italian diplomat was made after Hussein Aidid
accepted the envoy's tour of Baidoa town where, according to the
RRA, an alleged gross human rights violation was committed by the
forces of Hussein Aidid in and around Baidoa early in the week.
</P>
<P>
RRA officials in North Mogadishu have reportedly asked the
envoy to investigate the alleged mass killing in which, according
to them, more than 260 people were killed and 19 villages were
set on fire.
</P>
<P>
Cassini arrived in Mogadishu Monday, Two months after his
mission of reconciling Mogadishu's factions failed following the
visit of Mr. Rino Serri, Italy's Under-Secretary of Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cassini has during this week held separate talks with Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the north Mogadishu faction and Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, head of the south Mogadishu faction, in Mogadishu
over how to promote the reconciliation efforts between the
Somalis.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls for Saving Kids out of Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka foreign
minister called here today on the international community to pay
greater attention to the protection of children who are victims of
armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 52nd session of the General Assembly, the
foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, said that more children were
slaughtered, raped and maimed. And tens of thousands were
exploited as soldiers. Children are starved and exposed to extreme
brutality.
</P>
<P>
The time has come to call a halt, he said, whatever the causes
of modern day brutalities towards children. In 1995 alone, 30
major conflicts raged in different countries around the world,
according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts have all increased the risks for children. He
call the world's attention to the "terrible plight of child
soldiers."
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of a terrorist group called the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in his country, which kidnapped or
lured children at 10 and older in suicide attacks. Their
dependence on child combatants is increasing rapidly, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This barbaric practice of using children for war must be
condemned by all civilized states and be eliminated from our
world," he said.

JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Baruch Austrausky, who was
wounded in the Mahane Yehuda market bombing attack in Jerusalem on
July 30, died in a hospital here today, bringing the death toll of
the explosion to 18, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Austrausky, aged 84, had been unconscious
and in the intensive care unit of the hospital since the bombing
attack, for which Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
have been growing since last March when Israel began building the
controversial Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem, which led to
a prolonged deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombings in Mahane Yehuda market aggravated the
situation by dispelling the optimism about a quick resumption of
peace talks scheduled in early August.
</P>
<P>
Only after two months' peace efforts by international
community, particularly by the United States, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiating committees Monday announced in Washington
the resumption of negotiations during the week of October 6.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Bank Rate May Rise Again, Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada may further
raise its bank rate in coming months to ward off inflation,
according to governor Gordon Thiessen.
</P>
<P>
"The current level of interest rate is highly stimulative and
it is going to have to go up," the bank chief was quoted as saying
by reports today.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came a day after the central bank raised its
overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent, the
second rate hike since June.
</P>
<P>
"How rapidly is going to depend on just how much momentum there
is in this economy and how quickly we approach full capacity,"
Thiessen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that low inflation is his priority, because it
contributes to a more stable and productive economy.
</P>
<P>
The bank chief said he wants to prevent a return to the
boom-and-bust economy of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Canada's economy can withstand interest rates increases, he
maintained.
</P>
<P>
"I think consumers are increasingly feeling better, so I don't
think we have the need for the extremely low interest rates we had
before," he noted.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Urges Donors' Coop in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) has advised international organizations intending
to deliver humanitarian aid to Sierra Leone to always clear with
it.
</P>
<P>
The call was made on Thursday in Monrovia by ECOMOG Deputy
Force Commander, Brigade-General Joe Kwateng on behalf of ECOMOG
Force Commander, Major-General Victor Malu, when a Netherlands
delegation visited the peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Brigade-General Kwateng said the request for such
organizations to get clearance from ECOMOG was in their own
interest, stressing that by liaising with ECOMOG, they would be
abreast of the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
By letting ECOMOG know their humanitarian mission, such
organizations will also be able to get protection and assistance
from ECOMOG, especially as the only international airport in
Sierra Leone was under ECOMOG protection, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG forces went into Sierra Leone soon after the May 25
coup that overthrew the government of elected President Ahemd
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
West African leaders agreed a month ago at their summit in
Abuja to impose sanctions and embargo on Sierra Leone to force
out the military junta that seized power from Kabbah. They
authorized ECOMOG to enforce the blockade.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG jet fighters in early September bombed a vessel docked
in the port of Freetown for allegedly bringing in arms and
ammunition. But the Sierra Leonean side insisted that there was
only rice on board.

<HEADLINE> More Canadian Firms Listed on Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian firms are going public
in growing numbers in 1997 and have found rich, fertile ground in
the capital markets, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
As of September 24, initial public offerings (IPOs) of Canadian
companies totaled 255, up 61 percent for the same period a year
earlier, only two deals short of the full-year record for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Even more dramatic is the rise in the total value of funds
raised through IPOs, according to the Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
IPO financings reached 8.8 billion dollars (6.3 billion USD),
up 175 percent over the amount raised in the same period last
year, and well ahead of 1996's total of 5.5 billion dollars (3.9
billion USD).
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the year, IPOs should at least maintain the
current pace, or even accelerate, the paper predicted.
</P>
<P>
The hottest component of the flood of new issues is income and
royalty trusts.
</P>
<P>
At 4.7 billion dollars (3.3 billion USD), the two accounted for
more than half of the value of all IPOs.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Conveys New Year Greetings to Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the Jewish
New Year, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has conveyed greetings
to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a year of peace,
Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said today.
</P>
<P>
The greetings were expressed during an Arafat-Netanyahu
telephone call Thursday evening, the first conversation between
the two leaders since the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have
been suspended in March when Israel started building the
controversial Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Bazak said Arafat said happy new year to the Israeli people in
the phone call which was made during his visit in Jordanian
capital Amman.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Netanyahu said he wished the next year would be
"a year of peace for Israelis and Palestinians, and a good year
for all residents in the region."
</P>
<P>
Their conversation coincided with the announced resumption of
the peace negotiations for next week, signaling a thaw in the
Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
United States secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
sponsored the meeting in New York between Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen),
announced on September 29 that Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) would resume the talks on implementing the Interim
Agreement in the week of October 6.
</P>
<P>
In a new year interview with Israel Radio broadcast today,
Netanyahu welcomed the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian
talks, terming it as "a good step forward" to advance the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that he would reach a final settlement
with the PNA if Arafat agreed to launch a consistent fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The "key element ... for advancing the peace process in the
Middle East, between us and the Palestinians, is the battle
against terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He demanded PNA's promise of taking concrete actions to fight
terrorism, adding that the PNA had not yet done enough in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the final-status talks which have been frozen
since May last year after Netanyahu came to power, Netanyahu said
he hoped the talks would be resumed soon, and if possible
accelerated to reach a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Again, he conditioned the success of the final-status talks,
which will deal with the most sensitive issues of Jerusalem,
final borders and Palestinian refugees, on the PNA's fight
against militant Islamic groups which have been launching suicide
bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Albright's appeal for a time-out of Israeli
settlement activities, Netanyahu said that Israel and the PNA had
only agreed to discuss the concept of time-out. He reiterated that
his government had a policy on settlements and would not change
it, indicating that the settlement activities will continue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu virtually ruled out the possibility of setting up
a national unity government with the opposition Labor party,
expressing confidence that his government will gain popular
public support for its continuous efforts to fight terrorism
and provide security to its people.
</P>
<P>
The hardline Israeli leader sounded pessimistic about the
prospect of reaching peace with Syria and Lebanon. He conceded
that he had failed to find a "bridging formula" to resume
peace talks with Syria because Damascus refuses to accept the
Israeli demand for unconditional resumption of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria is insisting that the peace talks, frozen since March
last year, should be picked up from where they were left off with
Israel's previous Labor government -- namely on Israeli promise to
fully withdraw troops from the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had found any solution to pull out Israeli troops
from South Lebanon, Netanyahu blamed the unwillingness of
consecutive Lebanese governments to "exert sovereignty" over the
region for Israel's continued military presence in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
For the past 19 years, Israel has been bogged down in a
bloody guerrilla war with the Hezbollah forces in South
Lebanon. The increasing number of Israeli casualties has sparked
heated debate within the Jewish state over the necessity of
keeping the so-called South Lebanon Security Zone.

<HEADLINE> Quelea Birds Make Great Loss to Nigerian Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Rice and millet crops worth of
two billion Naira (about 25 million U.S. Dollars) have been lost
to quelea birds in northwest Nigeria's Kebbi State, the official
News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Samaila Dabo, the state commissioner for agriculture, was
quoted as saying that about 700,000 hectares of farm land in
seven local governments was ravaged by the birds.
</P>
<P>
Quelea birds move in large numbers and could travel to long
distances within a short time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dabo stressed the need for neighboring Niger and the Republic
of Benin to co-operate so as to effectively control the invasion
of the birds.
</P>

According to him, the state government has released 8.4
million Naira (about 100,000 dollars) to fight against the birds.
</P>
<P>
Dabo also warned residents in the affected area against eating
the birds because the chemicals sprayed for their control might
pose health hazards to anyone who eats them.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Improve Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Association for
Educational Assessment (IAEA) today called on African countries
to form linkages with more advanced countries to find out a
workable solution to the problems of quality assessment in
education.
</P>
<P>
The issue of quality assessment is critical and imperative in
the education development as it affects the quality of life of
the individual and society and it is the gateway to future lives
of the students, said Frances Ottobre, an IAEA senior official.
</P>
<P>
According to the IAEA executive secretary, education
assessment in Africa is encouraging but needs a boost, thus she
urged the governments to provide the funds and facilities for
improved quality assessment.
</P>
<P>
"African countries should make educational assessment a
priority in their national policies in order to produce quality
citizens and improve on survival strategies and skills," she
said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Ready to Start Talks with PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) - The Islamic Resistance Movement,
or Hamas, today showed its willingness to put up with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) which detained hundreds of
Hamas members in security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was ready to start talks with the PNA, said Khalid
Mashiel, head of the political bureau of the anti-Israeli militant
group, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Mashiel did not say what would be discussed with the PNA, but a
demand of releasing Hamas prisoners is almost surely expected.
</P>
<P>
Mashiel was giving his first press conference at his home after
hospitalization following being attacked here by two tourists
holding forged Canadian passports on September 25. Initial
investigation showed that the attackers were members of the
Israeli security service "Mossad."
</P>
<P>
The talks with the PNA would not be held within the context of
Israeli or the United States' conditions, but within Palestinian
conditions, said Mashiel.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the U.S. did not really want to act in
accordance with the Oslo peace agreement reached four years ago,
so their conditions were unacceptable to Hamas, Mashiel added.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for a string of suicide
bombing attacks against Israelis for the past few months. And
Israel has constantly pressed the PNA to crack down on Hamas as a
precondition to resume negotiations and loosen sanctions on
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between the PNA and Israel has been stalled
since March this year when Israel began to build Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Arab land. Most Hamas political leaders live in
Jordan.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada's major commercial banks
announced today a drop of 10 to 25 basis points in long-term
mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rate effective tomorrow, the two-year mortgage
rates falls by 10 basis points to 6.05 percent, and the 25-year
rate by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, mortgage rates of six months to one year did not
change at all.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of mortgage rate cut came on the heels of a
positive U.S. employment report today, which sent interest rates
in North America bond markets much lower.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks finance most of their long-term mortgages on
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper borrowing costs usually lead to a drop in the long-term
mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE> Access to Sex Education Vital to Youth: Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A public health professor
appeals that adolescents have the right of access to sex
information and services so that they could manage their sexual
and reproductive life in a responsive and informed way.
</P>
<P>
Fear about family life education (FLE) and access to
contraception would encourage productivity at an early stage,
Professor E. Mhondwa warned at a workshop being held in Morogoro,
Tanzania News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Denial of this right would make most young people ill-informed
about their sexual and reproductive life, Mhondwa said.
</P>
<P>
The professor was presenting a paper on "Adolescent, Sexual
and Reproductive Health" at a five-day workshop on safe
motherhood initiatives and adolescent health.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the Health Education Unit of the
Ministry of Health, is expected to end on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said adolescents are facing a number of risks such as HIV
and AIDS infections, sexually transmitted diseases (STDS) and
unwanted pregnancies, if they are not well informed on sexual and
reproductive behaviors.
</P>
<P>
Profesdsor Muhondwa said health education message in the media
should address such issues as behaviors, beliefs and practices in
the youth community.

<HEADLINE> Economic Recovery in Europe Gaining Pace: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The economic situation in
Europe strengthened in the Summer and firms' assessments of the
economic situation, particularly in industry, have confirmed
growing confidence in the future trend, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
This is reflected in the latest business survey results
published Friday by the European Union (EU)'s executive body, the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The results confirm the upturn in domestic and export demand.
Assessments of both new orders and order-book levels in industry
point to increasing demand for industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Industrial firms are becoming increasingly less pessimistic
about order-book levels. In Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Finland, they are even viewed as being relatively high by the
majority of firms.
</P>
<P>
The increased demand for industrial goods had also been
underpinned recently by more buoyant external trade. This is
reflected in industrial firms' assessments of the level of foreign
orders.
</P>
<P>
While they are still regarded, on average in the Union, as
being too low, the majority of firms in virtually all member
countries, except the United Kingdom, expect an appreciable
increase in the volume of exports.
</P>
<P>
Industrial firms' assessments regarding employment expectations
have again improved. However, an increase in staffing levels is
expected only in Denmark, Spain and Italy. Firms in other member
countries still plan to shed labor.

PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine will visit South Africa, Ethiopia and Cote d'Ivoire next
week, announced French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for the French foreign minister to
visit sub-Saharan Africa since taking office in June.
</P>
<P>
"One should have an African policy of a continental scale,
instead of one limited to a group of countries," said the
spokesman in reference to the new African policy adopted lately by
France.
</P>
<P>
After the overthrow of the power of former President Mobutu
Sese Seko in ex-Zaire and the upheavals in Central African
Republic and Congo Republic earlier this year, France decided to
reduce its military force in Africa and develop relations with
English-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should act on all fronts, think about the new elites (of
African countries), have an open economic policy, have a global
vision of Africa, a modernization, an adaption which is a shared
project of the president and the government," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine will visit Capetown, Addis Abeba, where is located the
headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, and Abidjan on
October 9-11.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Ideal Choice for Overseas Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Policy incentives and years of
development in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai have led to a
surging of overseas banks there.
</P>
<P>
The recent opening of the Shanghai Branch of the Banca
Commercial Italiana in Pudong brought the number of the overseas
banks there to 22, accounting for 43 percent of the total
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Local financial analysts say that the overseas banks have
speeded up their move to this emerging economic zone across the
Huangpu River from downtown Shanghai, mainly because the People's
Bank of China has decided this year that overseas banks in Pudong
can start Renminbi yuan business.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-February this year, nine overseas banks with yuan
business approval have moved their Shanghai branches to the
Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone in Pudong. They include the Citi
Bank NA, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the
Sanwa Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Pudong had only two foreign bank
branches.
</P>
<P>
Other overseas financial institutions such as investment banks
and insurance companies also joined the relocation rush.
Statistics show that more than 90 percent of the newly-approved
overseas financial institutions this year chose to settle down in
Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone has
become the first choice for overseas banks, because of its
advantageous location and favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
Other contributing factors include an accumulation of large
enterprises and markets of essential product means, improved city
infrastructures, and relatively low rent on the commercial houses
in Pudong.

<P>
SINGAPORE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
urged Singapore schools and universities to actively attract
foreign students from Asian countries so as to strengthen
relations among the nations involved and to broaden the horizons
for Singaporeans.
</P>
<P>
This will help build up solidarity with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, the senior minister
said at the Old Rafflesians' Association Dinner tonight.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested a quota for overseas students for Raffles
Institute, Raffles Girls School and the Raffles Junior College,
three prominent schools in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Top foreign universities come here to attract Singapore
students. So, this means schools and universities in Singapore
cannot afford to sit back, Lee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Later in life, after those foreign students return to their
countries, they will be part of the network of influential friends
throughout the region, people who will help each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will build up an old boy network that will increase
solidarity with the ASEAN neighbors, he said. So he proposed that
the Raffles Institute, the Raffles Girls School and the Raffles
Junior College should aim for a 20 percent overseas intake yearly.
</P>
<P>
He said that there will be enough places for Singaporeans. This
extra 20 percent of high-quality overseas students will bring
benefits to the 80 percent Singaporeans, Lee stressed.
</P>
<P>
He believed foreign students will stimulate and challenge their
Singaporean counterparts to broaden their horizons.

BEIRUT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or

the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements in Lebanon,
local weekly Haramoun magazine reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the magazine, Sheikh Naee'm Kassem,

Hezbollah, Israel's most active and dreaded enemy in Lebanon,
threatened in August during a funeral procession for Hezbollah

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt Ventures Auctioned in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The successful sale of a
bankrupt steel venture in south China's Guangdong province has
been hailed as a sign that the city's reform of the state sector
is traveling on a more standardized course.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Special-shaped Steel Plant was sold in just more
than ten minutes at an auction, drawing a smooth close to the
first case of bankruptcy since Guangzhou began to experiment with
the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden firm was sold to a local steel plant for 50
million yuan (6 million US dollars), much of which is expected to
be used to aid the displaced workers and the rest to pay off
debts, according to local legal officials.
</P>
<P>
The assets of the bankrupt firm were evaluated at 55 million
yuan (6.6 million US dollars), including the land-use right, the
factory buildings, machinery, and some products in stock.
</P>
<P>
Managers of the bankrupt firm said that their venture
floundered because of a bad investment, poor management and
limited understanding of market competition.
</P>
<P>
However, numbers of buyers showed an interest in the firm at
the auction, since the company is considered to be well-equipped
and its products still have great market potential.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy is an inevitable result of the market competition
and allows for sound development of the market economy, said the
local leading legal official Deng Guoji, pointing to the fact that
it phases out incompetent enterprises and redistributes the social
assets more rationally.
</P>
<P>
Starting from early 1992, a total of 36 enterprises with
different types of economic ownership in Guangzhou have petitioned
to the local courts to declare bankruptcy, and the figure has been
rising at an annual rate of over 70 percent since 1994, said Deng
Guoji.
</P>
<P>
The local court has so far investigated into 19 such cases, and
settled four.

<HEADLINE> 425 Generals Squeezed out in Russian Military Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 425 generals are going to
lose their ranks in the Russian armed forces if the Russian
military reform goes on as planned, the daily newspaper Segodnya
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an army spokesman as saying that the
numbers of generals in the army will be reduced to 1,500 from the
1,925 generals on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of generals is part of the Russian military
reform, which aims to cut the size of the armed forces by 500,000
to 1.2 million by the end of 1998 while keeping the army's combat
readiness unaffected.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the reform will first involve
personnel in the armed forces' central institutions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for New Governance After 1998 Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
here today called for a new framework for governance after the
1998 polls by changing the Charter to make the country more
responsive to the challenges and needs of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Let us insure that a new framework for governance is put in
place without further delay after the May 1998 elections by
amending the 1987 Constitution so that our people can be armed
with a fundamental law that will be responsive to their needs in
the 21st century and beyond," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the remarks when enumerating eight unfinished tasks
that have to be tackled. Other uncompleted tasks include electing
the best officials in the 1998 elections, enhancing productivity
and sustaining the country's competitiveness, celebrating the
centennial of national independence and fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
He also urged everyone to unite as a people in the fulfillment
of the urgent missions that still need to be done.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos' supporters tried in vain to extend the term of
the president through amending the Constitution which allows Ramos
to serve only a single term of six years.
</P>
<P>
Ramos announced that he would not run for re-election just
before the September 21 rally in which former president Corazon
Aquino warned him not to cite unfinished tasks as an excuse to
seek a second term.

<HEADLINE> Renovation of Famous Tibetan Buddhist Monastery Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The renovation of a famous Tibetan
Buddhist temple, the Gandain Monastery, was completed here today.
</P>
<P>
Located some 60 km to the east of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, the Gandain Monastery is one of the three
largest monasteries in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1409 by Zong Kaba, founder of the Gellug (Yellow) Sect
of Tibetan Buddhism, the monastery was listed among
state-protected cultural relics in 1961 by the State Council,
China's cabinet, but was destroyed during the turmoil of the
Cultural Revolution period (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s,
China has kept funding the renovation work of the Gandain
Monastery. In 1993, the central government allocated more than 26
million yuan (3.13 million US dollars) for a comprehensive
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years and four months, more than 40 experts of
ancient architecture and over 900 workers were involved in the
grand-scale project, rebuilding an overall area of 11,192 square
meters of housing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more than 1,660 square meters of the monastery's
original murals were restored, and 41 kilograms of gold were used
to regild the monastery's golden roofs.
</P>
<P>
The renovation team also completed a project to send drinking
water to the monastery, which was built on mountains with an
elevation of some 4,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they helped the monks to build 29 mini solar power
stations and replace the old butter lamps in temple halls and
monks' residences with nearly 500 solar energy lights.
</P>
<P>
"The renovation project has once again proved the Communist
Party of China's adherence to its policy of freedom of religious
worship in Tibet, as well as the Party's dedication to protecting
and carrying forward the traditional culture of the Tibetans,"
said Lieque, executive vice-chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous
Regional government.
</P>
<P>
The project was declared "a fine piece of work" in today's
quality assessment. It was said that a book on the complete
process of the renovation is to be published shortly.

YICHANG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have dug a canal
in the Three Gorges area for ships chugging through the Yangtze
River, which will be dammed early next month.
</P>
<P>
The country's navigation department today began to supervise
operation on the canal, which is 3,726 meters long, 350 meters
wide and 58 meters deep. It is said to be deeper and wider than
the Suez and Panama canals.
</P>
<P>
Starting on October 6, normal navigation will be stopped on the
main stream of the Yangtze in the dam area and all the ships
will change their courses into the canal.
</P>
<P>
The canal is capable of releasing 79,000 cubic meters of
floodwater per second.
</P>
<P>
However, engineers said that if the flow volume exceeds
20,000 cubic meters per second in the flooding season, a lock will
be used to help the navigation.
</P>
<P>
The canal will be operating for six years during the dam
construction till a permanent lock is completed in 2003.

(KSE) market index hiked 200.5 points in the third quarter to
close at 2602.4 points on September 30, according to the bourse
report of the quarter today.
</P>
<P>
The report said total shares in trading amounted to 6.6 billion

</P>
<P>
It said share values of 42 companies out of a total of 72 in

<P>
Average daily trading was 96.2 million shares for 30.5 million
dinars (100 million U.S. dollars) and over 2000 deals.
</P>
<P>
It said the investment sector topped the trading, followed by
the industrial sector and the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
The bourse's Director General Hisham Al-Oteibi said last week
that the KSE market capitalization was at 26 billion dollars for
the listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait bourse has been operating well since last year and only

<TEXT>
<P>
The act bans all companies throughout the world from investing
more than 40 million dollars in the oil and hydrocarbon sector of
Iran and Libya, which Washington has accused of backing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The EU has regularly expressed its opposition to the act,
saying it has extraterritorial effect such as the Helms-Burton
Act, which is aimed at punishing foreign companies doing business
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to sign a contract to develop an oil field in
Iran is a commercial decision for Total alone. The company is
legally entitled to take such a decision," Leon Brittan,
vice-president of the European Commission, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the specter of a full-blown trade war with the EU
appears to have prompted a more conciliatory approach from the
U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the fact that the threats have failed to ward
off major investment projects has also shattered Washington's
containment policy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials now talk of looking for "greater concerted
action" with European governments on how to deal effectively with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
One possible solution would be for President Bill Clinton to
waive his right to punish Total, extract a cosmetically tougher EU
line and deny Teheran a significant tactical victory. A measure
already suggested is the EU's postponement of the return to
Teheran of its ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has confirmed the
U.S. is seeking a way out of applying sanctions against the
companies.

wrong. They are injecting money into a terrorist system."

YICHANG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers have made
headway in dealing with leftover debris from the Three Gorges
area, as they prepare for the blocking of the Yangtze River early
next month.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the damming of the river, some 400,000 people have
been evacuated from seven countries, namely Yichang, Zigui,
Xingshan and Badong of Hubei province and Wushan, Fengjie and
Yunyang of the newly-founded Chongqing municipality, which will be
affected by the flooding.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement work has left 1.65 million square meters of
empty housing in the area, together with a large number of
toilets, warehouses, rubbish dumps, bridges, scattered graves and
cattle pens. All of this will be submerged, creating navigational
blocks and spreading pollution.
</P>
<P>
The workers have been disinfecting polluted material, or moving
it to distant and outlying sites. So far, they have dismantled
900,000 square meters of building structures, removed leftover
debris and done sanitation and anti-epidemic work in 13,000
places.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. refugees agency today
said its members are ready to leave Goma in eastern part of the
Republic of Democratic Congo as Congo's Interior Ministry has
ordered them to leave.
</P>
<P>
In a press release here today, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) said it was regrettable that the Congolese
authorities have "ordered all agencies dealing with refugees to
leave the Goma area with immediate effect."
</P>
<P>
It disclosed that the same instruction from the Ministry also
ordered the local authorities to close the border between North
Kivu and Rwanda, telling them to "expel any Rwandan refugees who
have entered the area."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, over a million Hutu refugees of Rwanda cross via Goma
into Congo Kinshasa after the massacre occurred following the
murder of its former president. About 600,000 of the refugees
returned in October last year after the Rwandan authorities said
they welcomed them to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Tribal conflicts between Hutus and Tutsis compelled the Hutus
to leave their country to avoid fighting.
</P>
<P>
L. Kabila led an uprising in October last year in eastern
Congo or former Zaire and toppled former President Mobuto Sese
Seko in March. He became President of Democratic Congo this May
under the help of the Rwandan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The release said, "we are deeply concerned about the
implications this announcement will have for Rwandan refugees who
have begun crossing the border again in recent days to avoid
renewed fighting in western Rwanda."

<P>
TEHRAN, October (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
today called for South-North dialog and international cooperation
to find ways to meet the technological and financial needs of the
developing countries for the health issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 44th session of the
Eastern Mediterranean Regional Committee of the World Health
Organization, Khatami said that access to health for all people
was the primary responsibility of each country.
</P>
<P>
The extraterritorial nature of health and their moral and
spiritual importance demonstrated the need for broad cooperation
at world level among nations, governments, governmental and
non-governmental organizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said such cooperation would help find solutions to the
existing problems, defuse social crises, as well as promote
international understanding and strengthen the world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president voiced Iran's readiness to make efforts
to eradicate poverty and promote international scientific and
technological cooperation in a bid to safeguard health of the
society.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran's health development plans have been carried
out in line with the national five-year development plans and
within the general framework of Islamic social justice.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the World Health Organization Hiroshi
Nakajima warned at the meeting that major diseases as malaria and
tuberculosis had made a deadly comeback in many parts of the world
in recent years and that previous unknown diseases had spread
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the situation to poverty, armed conflicts,
industrial pollution, budget cuts and the degradation of basic and
public health infrastructures.

Government officials and specialists from 22 eastern
Mediterranean countries attending the four-day meeting will
discuss draft proposals for "Health for All in the 21st Century."

construction of the Beijing-Kowloon railway started.
</P>
<P>
The map has since been revised three times in three years in
line with the construction progress of the railway.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the map cannot keep up with the changes," said Ren
Zhongnan, deputy director of the Shanxi Publications
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Just five years ago, Ren noted, a person could easily travel
across the country with a single map in hand.
</P>
<P>
New railways, highways, new ports, airports and nuclear plants,
as well as the Three Gorges Dam, are posing new challenges to
China's map-makers.
</P>
<P>
"Previously, it was our job to make a map. Today it is the
laborers who are creating the new look for the country," said Qian
Tianjiu, chief editor of the Xi'an Map Publishing House.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. warned on Friday that
bush fires raging on Mount Kilimanjaro had now devastated about
5,000 hectares, according to a news release issued here today by
the U.N. DHA International Regional Information Network.
</P>
<P>
The fires, said the report, at an altitude of between 2,800
and 4,000 meters, currently pose no major threat to local
populations, but are destroying rare and endangered habitat.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. which is appealing for international help to combat
the fires, said government troops lacked adequate equipment.
</P>
<P>
There is no details however, on the cause of this latest fire.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said that the fire on Kilimanjaro was put
out on September 18 after two weeks' ravages.
</P>
<P>
Lorivole Moirana, chief warden for the Kilimanjaro National
park Authority said the fire was put out owing to concerted
efforts of the local residents and specialized fire fighting
personnel.
</P>
<P>
That fire, which affected an estimated 109 square kilometers
of bush and forest and represented 10,900 hectares of forest
cover, could have been started by campers since it started at the
Machame tourist camp, Moirana added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is now hard hit by a drought which may enable to fire
to resume under strong winds.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today hailed the passage of the anti-poverty bill by the House of
Representatives on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the passage of the bill was a major step towards the
implementation of the government's poverty alleviation program
which was called the Social Reform Agenda.
</P>
<P>
The bill seeks to directly finance and support pro-poor
projects, particularly those in the country's 20 poorest provinces
and 1,000 municipalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 35 percent of the country's
population were poor people. To fight poverty, the Ramos
administration has set up a special council and allocated a total
of 1.6 billion pesos (61 million U.S. dollars) in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
The anti-poverty bill must be also approved by the Senate
before being signed into law by the President.

<TEXT>
<P>

every point by returning his opponent's big shots and forcing some
long rallies.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that easy, but I think I was a bit more solid on the
big points," Courier said.
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, now ranked 47th in the world, played a solid match
and took the control of the contest through his powerful
forehand. Carlsen failed to overtake Gustafsson upon his big
serves as he did in his previous matches.
</P>
<P>
"I have the battle when I am concentrated through," said
Gustafsson after his win. "I am sure to beat Courier if I am
concentrated like this."
</P>
<P>
"But Courier is a player who never give up in the match," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Approves Lebanon's Austerity 1988 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beirut, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese cabinet Thursday
night approved Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's austerity budget for
1998, ending nine days of political wrangling and relaxing a run
on the U.S. dollar, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut Times quoted Hariri as saying that the budget bill
put next year's expenditures at 7,925 billion Lebanese pounds
(about 4.6 billion U.S. dollars) and revenues at 4,956 billion
pounds (about 3.2 billion dollars) with a deficit of 37.46 percent
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The figures represent nearly a 6 percent rise in expenditure
over last year's budget and a drop of more than 16 percent from
the current deficit, which is expected to be around 15 billion
dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The new budget ended the controversy over Hariri's previous
plan to raise 1 billion dollars for emergency development projects.
</P>
<P>
The plan was rejected by the cabinet because it included an
unpopular increase of up to 50 percent in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
The new budget bill promises improved ways to collect taxes
and imposes additional duties on services such as car
registration, passports, and residence permits for expatriate
labor.
</P>
<P>
The budget will be debated by the parliament next week.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Kenyan Officials Meet on Border Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- High-level officials from
Uganda and Kenya held a one-day meeting on peace, security and
trade across common border Friday in Mbale district, eastern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to set up bilateral peace monitoring
committees in their countries, Radio Uganda reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wajusi Wasieba, Ugandan State Minister for Works, Transport
and Communications, assured the Kenyan officials at the meeting
that the Uganda government and people have no hidden agenda
against its sister country, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Tension remains high in the border areas as cross-border
cattle rustling often happens. On September 20, Ugandan cattle
rustlers crossed the border in raids in northwestern Kenya,
taking away thousands of domestic animals and killing 46 Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 people have died in clashes between security
personnel and Ugandan cattle rustlers in Kenya's Turkana and
Pokot districts alone over the past three months, Kenyan paper
reports said.
</P>
<P>
But Wasieba noted, Kenya should reciprocate this assurance by
denying platforms to anti-government dissidents operating in
Nairobi in order to fulfill the east African cooperation spirit
of good neighborliness, mutual respect and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
He accused Kenya of backing Ugandan dissidents but Nairobi
denies the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting agreed that the peace monitoring
committees would meet quarterly every year starting from the end
of October or early November this year, and meet regularly when
critical issues arise.

WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading American newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Sweeping away dozens of campaign finance abuses involving
President Bill Clinton that Republicans had cited to demand an
independent prosecutor, Attorney General janet Reno absolved
Clinton of any misuse of his office or impropriety in raising
money or in allowing contributors to stay overnight at the White
House and said there was no evidence that he sought contributions
in exchange for political favors.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration has sent the aircraft carrier
Nimitz rushing to the Persian Gulf in hopes of deterring
bellicose acts by Iran and Iraq, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The booming U.S. economy whittled the federal budget deficit
for the fiscal year that ended Tuesday to 23 billion dollars, the
smallest shortfall in 23 years, the Congressional Budget Office
said. The latest estimate is certain to spur debate in Congress,
where legislators from both parties already are arguing about how
to divvy up possible future federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
-- Facing the clearest test so far of its commitment to punish
foreign companies that invest in Iran, the Clinton administration
has decided to hold off on sanctions against a French energy firm
in an effort to avert a trade war with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times
</P>
<P>
-- The space shuttle Atlantis and its crew Friday pulled away
from Mir and flew dome, leaving a U.S. astronaut and a new
computer that should make his four-month stay safer and more
productive.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Calls for Release of Russian Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko today asked the republic's prosecutor-general to
release the jailed journalist Pavel Sheremet whose detention has
aborted the president's trip to Russian cities of Lipetsk and
Yaroslavl
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Lukashenko made the
remark at a congress of teachers, saying,"I'm asking
for Sheremet to be released on condition that he does not leave"
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Journalist Pavel Sheremet was kept in prison in Belarus' Grodno
and charged with illegally crossing the Belarussian-Lithuanian
border.
</P>
<P>
Grodno regional prosecutor Leonid Tereshchenko told reporters
on Friday that Sheremet, who has been in detention for more than
two months, could be released in one or two weeks after
"investigation materials come to the prosecutor's office."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin denied on Thursday a visit to
Russian cities of Lipetsk and Yaroslavl by Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
The Lukashenko's call was seen as a gesture to ease the row
between Belarus and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said in his address that after Sheremet's release, "he Won't
be of any use to anybody."

In an interview with Xinhua before an unofficial visit to
China, the first since he became premier in 1994, Mocumbi said
China's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong Kong was a great
success with historic significance to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the political aspirations of the Chinese people
could not be renounced at any time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The premier said, "I very much appreciated China's method of
taking back Hong Kong, and I congratulated the Chinese people on
their success."
</P>
<P>
He said his forthcoming visit to China is aimed at
strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the two
peoples. And as foreign minister, Mocumbi had paid a visit to
China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see with my own eyes the profound changes China
has been undergoing in recent years so that we can learn from it
and apply its experience to the ongoing reforms in Mozambique,"
said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said China and Mozambique can cooperate in the fields
of farming, processing agro-products and industry, and that China
can invest in these aspects or run joint ventures in Mozambique
so as to provide products in local markets or export them to its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with local reporters Friday, the Mozambican
premier said he hoped to meet Chinese Premier Li Peng during his
China visit.

ALMA ATA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev held talks today with visiting Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin. Both sides agreed that problems would not
become hurdles to developing good bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin arrived here today for a two-day working
visit; trade between the two former Soviet republics plunged
by 30 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister said the plunge should be attributed
to the taxation policies of the two countries, which, he said, could
be solved through mutual efforts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite divergences and problems, relations
between his country and Kazakhstan are solid.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed Russia's rent for the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed agreements after the meeting on
strengthening environmental protection in the Baikonur region and
on the rational use of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Describing Russia as a country with important political and
economic influences in the international community, Nazarbayev
stressed relations with Russia will take a priority in
Kazakhstan's diplomacy.

He said a joint committee will be established to negotiate

<HEADLINE> Nepali Coalition Government Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's seven-month-old
coalition government headed by Lokendra Bahadur Chand collapsed
Saturday afternoon after the Lower House passed by 107-94 votes a
no-confidence motion against the government tabled by the main
opposition Nepali Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
Though the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) has asked all its 89 MPs to vote
against the no-confidence motion, Chand's efforts to save his
government failed after ministers tendered resignations one after
another.
</P>
<P>
One day before the vote, Chand had only five votes from his own
National Democratic Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
The key sealing the fate of the three-party government lay in
the divisive RPP itself.
</P>
<P>
The faction led by RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa, who asked
the NC to lodge the no-confidence motion against the government on
September 22, held a parliamentary party meeting without the
presence of its parliamentary party leader Chand and directed all
RPP MPs to vote in favor of the motion.
</P>
<P>
The minor ruling partner Nepal Sadbhavana (goodwill) Party and
other parties also decided to vote for the motion.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa is expected to head the next government as
promised by the NC.
</P>
<P>
Chand's government is the most short-lived among the five
governments seen in Nepal since 1990.

BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China's advertising industry has
enjoyed a rapid and sustained development in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The trade was among the country's fastest growing sector with
the number of advertising firms tripling and their business
turnover increasing by nearly tenfold in the five-year period from
1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
So far, 300 firms are Sino-foreign joint ventures or operating

advertising groups, namely, the China Union Advertising Corp. and
China Foreign Trade Advertising Group, took on some one third of
the business of the trade.
</P>
<P>
The business turnover of Shanghai and Beijing municipalities
and south China's Guangdong Province made up 46 percent of the
national total, estimating at 16.7 billion yuan (two billion US
dollars) in the 1992-97 period.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the amount of profits gained by advertising on

<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The force commander of the west
African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) has warned Liberian citizens
to desist from further molestation of ECOMOG soldiers or face the
consequence.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by Major-General Victor Malu, some
rogues and miscreants have formed the habit of "raising false
alarms, claiming a loss of their genitals on shaking hands with,
or being touched by their enemies".
</P>
<P>
The false alarms are being targeted at ECOMOG soldiers who
were manhandled and molested by these individuals, the Tribune
reported today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops have been assaulted and lynched through these
false allegations, General Malu claimed, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The force further warned the trouble makers to stop their
nefarious activities or face the wrath.
</P>
<P>
"Any such future attempt to molest any ECOMOG soldier would be
strongly resisted by the force and all those involved would be
severely dealt with," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the force has promised to parade a culprit before
journalists for raising false alarm.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national peace keeping force was sent by the
Economic Community of West African States after the civil war
broke out in Liberia seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has successfully disarmed and demobilized the warring
factions and ensured the elections which produced a new
government in the country.
</P>
<P>
The force now remains in Liberia to help keep social security
and re-build the country's armed forces and police force.

has appointed Anna Wu as chairman of the Consumer Council for two
years as from October 1997, a government spokesman announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
John Ho Dit-sang has been appointed by Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen as the council's vice-chairman for the same
period, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Wu joined the Consumer Council in 1989 and became its
vice-chairman in 1993. She is very active in the council's affairs

<HEADLINE> No Policy Change Toward Demonstrations: HK Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- There is no change in the
government's policy in handling demonstrations and police will
always exercise maximum restraint and use minimum force only when
absolutely necessary, a Hong Kong SAR government spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful demonstrations have remained pretty much a way of
life after July 1 and Hong Kong people's freedom of expression and
assembly have not been curtailed in any way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in response to press inquiries in
connection with the concern expressed by representatives of the
Democratic Party and the Frontier at their meeting with Secretary
for Security Peter Lai this morning on police handling of recent
demonstrations outside the venue of the World Bank/International
Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that some 150 demonstrations had been held
since the handover and that the majority of public processions and
meetings were held lawfully and peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a free and open society where freedom of
expression and assembly are guaranteed by law, but the community
would expect people to express their rights in an orderly,
peaceful and lawful manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it is necessary to regulate public
processions and meetings because police have statutory duties
under the Police Force Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance to
preserve public safety and order.
</P>
<P>
"If demonstrators are dissatisfied with any decision of the
Commissioner of Police, they can always lodge an appeal with the
independent Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the World Bank/IMF conference, the police have
an additional duty to protect the participants in accordance with
the Internationally Protected Persons and Taking of Hostages
Ordinance. We need to fulfill our international obligation," he
went on.
</P>
<P>
"Decisions as to what appropriate action to take in regulating
public processions are best made on the ground by the police
officer in charge of the operation having regard to the
circumstances of each case," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Kenya sea ports
are competing in expanding their business in Uganda, The Monitor
reported today.
</P>
<P>
As the annual volume of Uganda's cargo passing the Tanzanian
port of Dar-es-Salaam had risen rapidly to 95,000 tons now from
40,000 tons two years ago, Uganda's cargo to Kenya's southern
port city Mombasa is still maintained at 1.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) is
planning to open its office in Kampala, capital of Uganda, on
October 8.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Mboya, KPA's resident representative in Kampala, said
the agency also plans to organize a seminar on the facilities
offered at Mombasa port.
</P>
<P>
According to KPA, cargo transporting from Mombasa enjoys an
advantage of shorter routes and better roads with
telecommunications with Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzania Harbor Authority (THA) is to guarantee a
transit time of 10 days from the date of cargo arrival at the
Dar-es-Salaam port to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
A cargo usually spends at least 15 days from Mombasa to
Kampala, but Ismail Mboya promised to shorten the time of the
service.
</P>
<P>
The THA also established an office recently in Kampala.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Industry to Grow by 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China's rural and township
industry has entered a new stage of development after two decades
of rapid expansion and will continue to grow by an annual average
rate of 15 percent over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Liang Shusheng, an official with the Rural Industrial
Enterprises Department under the Ministry of Agriculture, offered
the prediction during a recent visit to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Liang was in Shanghai to attend an international symposium
on the comparative research of China's rural enterprises
and small to medium enterprises of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Rural industry is expected to generate 3,000 billion yuan in
gross domestic product by the year 2000, in addition to
exporting products valued at 1,000 billion yuan and providing
employment for 30 million surplus rural laborers, according to
Liang.
</P>
<P>
Rural and township enterprises, which appeared in China in the
early 1950s, have expanded at a rate of over 20 percent since 1978
when the Chinese central government introduced the reform and
opening-up policies and increased support to promote the vigorous
development of rural industry.
</P>
<P>
China now has over 23 million rural and township enterprises
with a total 135 million employees. Rural industry has become a
pillar of China's rural economy and an important component of the
country's national economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, rural industrial enterprises in China
contributed 26 percent of the nation's GDP, created 44 percent of
the total industrial output value and 35 percent of the total
earnings from exports.

Joint Ministerial Working Committee (JMWC) Meeting ended here
today with the two countries concluding agreements to step up
maritime transport and trade cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement after the meeting, the two countries noted
that the Maritime Transport Agreement is the first such bilateral
agreement for Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"It will usher in a new ear of cooperation between Singapore
and Myanmar in bilateral shipping and maritime relations as well
as in related activities such as trucking, warehousing and
container freight stations," the two countries said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the private sectors of the two countries
signed an Agreement of Cooperation between the Union of Myanmar
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UMCCI) and the Singapore
Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SFCCI).
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the agreement will "foster greater
trade and investment ties between the two countries," and under
this agreement, "both sides will exchange market information and
provide assistance to each other's businessmen."
</P>
<P>
Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, First Secretary of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC) and Co-Chairman of the
Myanmar-Singapore Joint Ministerial Working Committee, said at the
end of the JMWC meeting that he believed that the agreements
signed today between the two countries will "further enhance trade
between the two countries" and will "serve as a firm foundation
for the strengthening and closer ties between Myanmar and
Singapore business communities."
</P>
<P>
Lee Yock Suan, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry who
co-chaired the JMWC meeting, described their discussion at the
meeting as "constructive". He said that officials of both sides
have been forthcoming with their ideas and suggestions.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, we should transform these ideas into
initiatives which can be implemented over the coming months," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Singapore signed their Economic Cooperation
Agreement in 1995 in Singapore. In the light of that agreement,
the first JMWC Meeting was held in Yangon in January 1996 to
enhance and promote economic and technical cooperation programs
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Raises Funds from Diversified Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, a new
powerhouse of Shanghai's economy, has raised funds from
diversified channels.
</P>
<P>
Pudong has drawn a total fixed asset investment of 120 billion
yuan over the past seven years, with some 10 percent coming from
the central, municipal and local governments, according to a
recent survey by the Pudong New Area Administrative Commission.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds accounted 32 percent of total investments, with
bank loans and funds raised by enterprises making up 28 percent
and 30 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pudong has been a focal point of foreign investment since its
establishment seven years ago and, and attracted contractual
foreign funds of 5.8 billion US dollars for real estate and
infrastructure development by the end of 1996, according to
research carried out by Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have expressed confidence in Pudong's future
prospects as a leading economic, financial and trade center, and
its position as one of the world's most favorable investment
environments.
</P>
<P>
Pudong has introduced the BOT (build, operate and transfer)
method to encourage foreign investment in infrastructure
development. The method enables foreign investors to invest,
manage and operate the projects prior to transfering same to the
local government when contracts expire.

<HEADLINE> Atlantis Astronauts Find Leaking Impact Points in Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Astronauts aboard U.S. space
shuttle Atlantis have visually pinpointed two impact points that
damaged the air-tightness of Russian space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
The finding, said a report from the Russian ground mission
control, was relayed back on Friday night Russian summer time
while Atlantis was hovering around Mir more than 70 meters away.
</P>
<P>
Both Atlantis and Mir were flying some 400 kilometers above the
ground then, and the crew of the space station ejected a burst of
air into the damaged and sealed-off module to help the discovery.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a shuttle astronaut and a Mir cosmonaut were able
to report seeing small particles, presumably of the protective
thermal insulation materials, floating away from the space station.
</P>
<P>
One of the two holes was later identified as near the base of a
damaged power-generating solar panel, and the other at the docking
area between the Soyuz transport craft and the space station.
</P>
<P>
The module, one of the several structures permanently attached
to Mir and designed to serve lab research purposes, was punctured
during a collision with a runaway cargo ship on June 25.
</P>
<P>
Russian experts said the finding confirmed their theory about
where the leakage areas could be.
</P>
<P>
They were also confident that Mir is safe, as Atlantis had
already supplied it, during the five-day docking with the space
station, with equipment for patching up the holes.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Hiring Adolescents in Nuclear Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- France today denied allegation
that it had hired adolescents below 18 for jobs at its two nuclear
testing sites in the Polynesian Islands of the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The allegation was contained in a report written by two Dutch
sociologists in the Archipelago of Society in the South Pacific
and in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Out of 737 Polynesian employees of nuclear sites they
interviewed, the report said, 10 percent were below 18 and 6
percent below 16 when they worked there.
</P>
<P>
The official Direction des Centres d'Experimentations
Nucleaires (DIRCEN) of France said in a communique that it had
"never employed adolescents... or children on these sites" in
Mururoa and Fangataufa in the Polynesia.
</P>
<P>
The two investigators also said half of the employees in the
nuclear sites had not undergone medical examination on effects of
radioactivity when they left the site after completing their
contracts.
</P>
<P>
They published the report, entitled "Mururoa and Us," at the
request of a local Evangelist church in French Polynesia.
</P>
<P>
The DIRCEN said its employees have always been given medical
examinations "in conformity with the French legislation, which is
one of the most strict on the world level."

<HEADLINE> NPC Delegation Ends Visit to Estonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TALLINN, Estonia, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of China's
National People's Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature,
today ended a five-day visit to Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Winding up the tour, NPC Standing Committee Vice-chairman Tomur
Dawamat said the Chinese group had achieved all of its goals
through exchanges with leaders of the Estonian Riigikogu, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The better understanding between the two legislatures would
further the friendship between the two peoples, the head of the
Chinese delegation told the Estonia, a national newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
Tomur also expressed thanks, through the news outlet, for the
hospitality offered by his Estonian hosts.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Tomur met Estonian President Lennart Meri at a
reception hosted by the Chinese embassy to mark the 48th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with President Toomas Savi and Vice President
Tunne Kelam of the Estonian parliament about continued efforts to
promote the NPC's interchanges with its Estonian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Estonian trade ties, he noted in his interview with
the Estonia that there are still great potentials yet to be tapped
after the notable growth of bilateral trade volume in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The delegation left for Minsk this afternoon for a five-day
visit to Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges Tension Reduction Between West, Islam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today stressed the need to promote a better understanding
between the West and the Islamic world by reducing tensions,
surfacing owing to "presumptions and deep-seated biases."
</P>
<P>
"Once we succeed in developing a proper perspective for mutual
understanding we shall ipso facto enhance our ability to come out
of our cocoons of isolation," Leghari told a seminar here on
"Western Perceptions of Muslims; Muslims Perceptions of West."
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar has been organized jointly by Islamic
Research Institute and International Islamic University.
</P>
<P>
The president said it is ironical that despite latest
communication in the post-Cold War era, the ability of the West
and the Islamic world to understand each other is "strikingly
limited and deficient."
</P>
<P>
Leghari said cross-cultural interaction has always been
beneficial as no civilization or society could progress in
isolation. Rather the people of one culture can understand
themselves by knowing the cultures of others, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said history would verify that all the civilizations that
seek to thrive on cultivating the myths of superiority or absolute
monopoly of knowledge and wisdom are doomed to perdition sooner or
later.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said there are people who talk of the impending clash
of civilization but there is also a silver lining on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to observe cordiality and empathy emerging
out of the various initiatives for inter-religious and
inter-civilizational dialogues organized in recent years, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Leghari believed that a great deal of suffering faced by
humanity could have been averted if sincere effort had been made
to understand the others and appreciate the positive elements in
their cultures, religions and heritage.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Form Agency to Deal With Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is going to set up
a national agency to tackle drug abuse in the country,
Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor said today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is also the home minister,
will himself chair the agency whose membership will include
various relevant agencies, the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies dealing with drug problems have always been
committed and there has never been any slackening of interest, he
told reporters after opening the Third International Private
Sector Conference on Drugs in the Workplace and the Community
(Asia Pacific Region) in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
In the case of police, he said, they now have a separate
narcotics department which indicates how serious they regard the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a lack of commitment from the people at large
toward combating drug-related problems and measures should be
taken to overcome that.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a solution has not been found for a complete cure
or an effective method to prevent relapse is a threat to the
resilience of future generations, he said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysian authorities are determined to make this country
a difficult hunting ground for drug traffickers and have taken the
utmost stringent steps in curbing both the demand and supply
through the enactment and enforcement of tough laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdul, addicts in Malaysia as a whole spend nearly
1.25 billion ringgit (about 380 million U.S. dollars) a year on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
More alarmingly, the younger generation is increasingly
affected by drug usage, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that from 1995 to August this year, more than 30,000
people have been arrested on drug charges and various drugs were
seized including 55,987 kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly organized by the U.N. Drug Control
Program, the International Labor Organization and the Malaysian
National Association for the Prevention of Drugs, is attended by
more than 200 participants from various governmental and
non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> Talks to Be Held on Teachers' Pay Dispute in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government and the
Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) are scheduled to resume
negotiations on salary increases Monday in a bid to end teachers'
strike which entered its fourth day today.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union was quoted by today's Kenya Times as
saying Friday that negotiations were to resume next week.
However, it maintained that the strike would continue until a
breakthrough was achieved.
</P>
<P>
KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo said the meeting was
expected to discuss how to implement the new higher salary
structure as demanded by the teachers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss a return-to-work formula which
must be agreeable to all parties concerned, the KNUT official
added.
</P>

of the man of iron remains a myth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia Presses for Disaster-Coping Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President
Brigadier-General Godfrey Miyanda has stressed the need to have
well-trained professional disaster managers and progressive
policies to combat natural and artificial calamities effectively.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Friday at the close of a two-week international
disaster management foundation course with participants from
Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, Miyanda said advance planning,
preparation and intelligent anticipation are vital pre-requisites
for disaster management, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Since the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) came
to power, he said, Zambia has been beset with severe droughts
which have forced the government to put in place a structure for
responding to emergencies effectively and timely.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent fires in Zambia, including the big fire
which gutted the 19-floor house of Zambia National Building
Society on September 18, are a clear indication that Zambia is
not exempted from calamities experienced in other parts of the
world, Miyanda said.
</P>
<P>
The latest disasters have exposed some aspects of disaster
management which needed to be strengthened in order to put the
country in a state of constant preparedness, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice president challenged participants of the course to
come up with tangible and clearly spelt-out policies to help the
government contain calamities, saying governments alone will not
make it.
</P>
<P>
The British government has pledged to support Zambia in its
efforts to combat disasters by joining relevant training programs
during the next three years, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Measures Blueprinted to Attract Zambian Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has put
in place measures to attract the country's secondary school
teachers working abroad to come back.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye told parliament here
on Friday that his ministry is improving conditions of service
for teachers to attract those working abroad, according to Zambia
Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will study conditions of service offered by
neighboring countries before the Zambian packages are prepared,
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Syamujaye said the ministry has been poorly funded
for a long time which has thereby affected its operations.
</P>
<P>
A hardship allowance is about to be introduced for teachers
working in rural areas where conditions are not favorable for
them, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
As from next year communities wanting to put up schools will
be expected to build teachers' houses to ease accommodation
problems for teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, community have been building schools on self-help
projects without a provision for teachers' houses, said
Syamujaye, adding this will no longer be entertained as from next
year.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Exports Over 3,000 Tons of Seaweed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has exported
3,253 tons of seaweeds worth about 353 million Shillings (about
560,000 U.S. Dollars) in the last financial year, Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government has also earned 16 million Shillings
(25,397 US Dollars) as taxes from the sale and export of the
crop, which was introduced in the country in 1990, said Deputy
Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Natural Resources Mwalimu
Haji Ameir.
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints about low price of the crop, grown on the
east coast of Pemba and Unguja islands, seaweed growers have
earned 400 million Shillings (634,921 US Dollars) from the sale
of more than 4,000 tons of the crop.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of seaweed has gone up from 45 to 100 shillings,
Ameir said.
</P>
<P>
The crop's price would further go up after the construction of
a semi-processing seaweed plant in Zanzibar, he said, hinting
that plans were underway to look for an investor to set up the
proposed plant.
</P>
<P>
Seaweed farming is considered as the most viable economic
venture to date since the 1964 revolution.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysian CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
higher.
</P>
<P>
During the week, CPO price on the physical market passed the
1,600 ringgit level to end at 1,680 ringgit (about 509 U.S.
dollars) per ton, 100 ringgit higher over last week's close.
</P>
<P>
Speculative covering dominated the market as the ringgit
remained soft against the U.S. dollar. The ringgit was traded
within a wide range of 3.1925/75 and 3.4550/50 throughout the week
with scattered short covering arresting any further decline. The
currency factor fueled interest in the local palm oil.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals price is expected to move higher on further
strong buying support next week, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) this week, the metal
price advanced on continuous buying support, surpassing the
20-ringgit mark to close at 20.22 ringgit per kg, an eight-year
high.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the local currency, which hovered within the 3.34
level against the greenback, attracted buyers to the KLTM.
</P>
<P>
Trading was moderately higher in the week with accumulated
turnover amounting to 476 tons against 470 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
Heavy demand was received from local, European and Japanese
buyers.
</P>
<P>
The local tin, traded in the U.S. dollar, was relatively
cheaper for buyers since the dollar's appreciation against the
local currency.
</P>
<P>
At the week's close, the KLTM's price differential to the
London Metal Exchange (LME) recorded an extremely higher premium
of 340 U.S. dollars against a premium of 20 U.S. dollars last
week.
</P>
<P>
The local metal market is likely to remain steady next week on
follow-through buying support, one trader said.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Malaysian rubber market was steady with RSS One
edging up 30 sen to 290.5 sen (about 88 U.S. cents) per kg and SMR
up 29.5 sen to 288.50 sen (about 87 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for October 2 was quoted higher at 212.23
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg this week against 197.92 cents on
September 25 last week.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 206.07 cents per kg
compared with 197.41 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
The rubber market is expected to remain steady next week, with
the next psychological level for SMR grades likely to pass the 300
sen-level on price adjustment, a market player said.
</P>
<P>
The player expected a recovery in demand from European and
local traders soon, ahead of year-end holidays.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Lifts Ban on Cattle Semen, Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
lifted the ban on importation of cattle semen and embryos, local
daily The New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kezimbira Miyingo, state minister of agriculture, was quoted
as saying here on Friday that the two products will be imported
only from countries free from mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of agriculture will intensify efforts to
sensitize the public on mad cow disease, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government banned the importation of ruminants and
their products last year due to the mad cow scare which happened
in Great Britain. The ban has been maintained on the importation
of exotic cattle, but indigenous cattle from east Africa
countries are allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of regional cooperation, the ban on importation
of beef, beef products and animal feeds containing ruminant
material has also been maintained.
</P>
<P>
Miyingo said the meat of non-ruminant animals like pigs and
poultry will be subjected to species identification tests before
they are allowed into the country.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the government prohibited the importation of
pork sausages, fearing that it might provide a cover for people
to smuggle in beef sausages whose imports were outlawed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Suffers from Grave Shortage of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- With water falling to the
lowest level ever in the history of Tanzania, this east African
nation is confronted with a power crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the water level at the main electricity-generating
Mtera dam, which fuels the major Mtera and Kidatu power stations,
was only 0.63 meters above the minimum, latest reports said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the lowest water level ever in the history of Tanzania
and the situation is very bad," Guardian paper said in a report
today, quoting an official with the state-run Tanzania Electric
Supply Company (TANESCO).
</P>
<P>
"We are now finishing the last drops of water from the dam and
after it there will be no more water to draw electricity from,
because the turbines will automatically switch off at the minimum
level," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Low water levels have been caused by a severe drought
influenced by the El Nino weather phenomenon sweeping most of
East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Power outage -- which in some areas can last for up to 15
hours a day -- are also likely to be increased to up to four
times a week, the official said. "It's very serious and it's bad
for business."
</P>
<P>
The TANESCO official said most parts of the country would be
affected by the electricity crisis, but the impact would be
hardest in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing which may last until the arrival of short
rains normally due in November or early December, could severely
affect the economy, the paper said, adding that the slow-down of
industrial production is certain to depress income levels and
push fuel prices up.
</P>
<P>
Decrease in industrial production also means lower tax income
for the government and a lower average household income.
</P>
<P>
The electricity crisis in Tanzania also has roots in
government debts to TANESCO and in unpaid bills -- mostly from
parastatal institutions -- of some 14 billion Tanzania shillings,
or more than 20 million U.S. dollars, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
This debt has made TANESCO unable to buy fuel and spare parts
for diesel generators supposed to be used amid severe water
shortages.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's army will soon go into
Congo (k) and launch a joint operation with Congolese government
troops in an effort to flush out the rebels of Ugandan Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) in Congolese side of Rwenzori mountains.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Charles Angina, zonal operations
commander in western Uganda as saying that part of the 3,000
soldiers of Ugandan army had arrived who will join the Congolese
forces in the operation.
</P>
<P>
President Y. Museveni promised last month to send 3,000
soldiers to beef up security in west Uganda where the ADF, with
bases in Congo, often crosses the border to mount raids on
government facilities and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The locals are happy with this operation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group which often launches attacks on western
Uganda. It had some 1,500 fighters in its ranks last November,
but under the offensive launched by government troops recently,
the number of the rebels has been reduced to around 450, said a
recent report.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Parties to Clash Over Road Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Awami League (AL) is
set to be in conflict with its arch rival Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) over a countrywide railroad barricade plan, to be
enforced by the latter on October 5.
</P>
<P>
The planned countrywide barricade is part of a series of the
opposition's street agitation, announced by BNP Chairperson
Khaleda Zia at a public meeting in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The barricade was called to protest the "repression" of
opposition activists and the price increases for petroleum
products, fertilizer and essential commodities and to demand fair
prices for jute, the key product of the country's peasants.
</P>
<P>
"The present government has completely failed to run the
country and become isolated from the people due to its subservient
policy and inefficiency," Zia said in a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the BNP has issued instructions to all its
front organizations, particularly the labor organizations and
leaders in different parts of country to enforce the rail and road
barricade at all costs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling AL is reported to have made preparations
to resist the railroad barricade plan. General Secretary Zillur
Rahman of the party told the press that the people would resist
what he called the undemocratic program of the opposition

<HEADLINE> How A Chinese Village Gets Rich (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The village head of Dongdian in
the southern outskirts of Beijing neither looks nor behaves like
an old-fashioned stereotype: a bare-footed peasant cadre wearing a
straw hat and talking about the fulfillment of quotas.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Zhao Jinfu wears leather-shoes, an all-cotton golf
shirt and discusses market prices from a mobile phone in an
air-conditioned office. On his name card he is titled "General
Manager".
</P>
<P>
This professional image has an approach to match if the
village's economy is anything to go by. Located in Daxing County,
less than an hour's drive from Beijing, Dongdian is a booming
village-corporation, calling itself rather long-windedly the Da
Dong Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial United Company. Zhao
is in charge of it.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it produced farm and industrial products worth 75
million yuan (nine million US dollars). Its operations include a
150-ha farm yielding wheat, corn, fruit and vegetables, a
10,000-head pig farm plus a slaughterhouse, a chicken farm, a feed
factory and an instant-noodle factory.
</P>
<P>
Besides contributing substantially to Beijing's larders,
Dongdian also has an artificial diamond plant, an auto parts
factory and a dozen other businesses.
</P>
<P>
Not only has Zhao become rich, the villagers have also. In
1996, the average per-capita income was 6,500 yuan, doubling the
average earnings of other farmers elsewhere in the Beijing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
"We still consider ourselves' an agricultural economy, but a
modern one," said Zhao Jinfu. "Our entire business is structured
on the basis of farm production, but at the same time we have
complementary processing industries for added value -- basically
we cater to the market."
</P>
<P>
What's happening in Dongdian is termed "Chan Ye Hua", or
industrialization of farm production, a new trend found in some of
China's most prosperous rural areas, particularly the east and
south.
</P>
<P>
Farmers here have moved away from just growing, harvesting and
selling. To maximize their profits, they are mass-producing farm
products, processing them and setting up wholesale firms to
channel their value-added products to markets.

<P>
In all Beijing's six suburban counties, "chan ye hua" is
developing quickly with support from local governments. In Shunyi
County, northeast of the city, for instance, the local government
has invested some 40 billion yuan over the last five years to
improve land quality, build irrigation facilities and lay power
cables to villages.
</P>
<P>
Shunyi is now Beijing's vegetable basket, a huge green-house
county with two processing plants. It sold more than 800 million
kg of vegetables to Beijing in 1996, earning 529 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Dongdian's core products are grains, vegetables and meat. Its
fields are beautifully vast, with two-meter high corn stalks
reaching for the sky in mid-summer. But strangely, all is
quiet. There's nobody in sight.
</P>
<P>
Mechanization has taken the backache and blisters out of
farming, leaving many more villagers to concentrate on farm
management and factory work.
</P>
<P>
More than 850 locals once worked in the fields. today, only
eight people take care of them. In 1996, the village harvested
more than 900 tons of wheat and corn, and one million kg of
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
This year, farmers are trying something new: they bought seeds
from a nearby space science institute which had been flown in
space and brought back by recoverable satellite. They harvested
green peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers which were indeed out of
this world -- huge, juicy, sweet. And they sold for suitably
astronomical prices.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are always looking for ways to add value to their
harvest. "It is true that farm production is the basis of our
livelihood, but without industry, we can't really get rich, and
without the market, we can't get the money," village
head-cum-general manager Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, factories have been built. They now contribute more
than 60 percent to the wealth of the village.

<P>
New operations have created jobs, employing those hands made
idle by tractors, planters, sprayers and harvesters. Today more
than 300 villagers work in factories and two trading companies.
</P>
<P>
Sun Shuhui, a 40-year-old peasant woman, is one of them. She
has a full-time job as a warehouse keeper in the village's animal
and poultry feed factory. She works eight hours a day, five days a
week, enjoying a full weekends' rest just as urban residents do.
</P>
<P>
"But I help out in the fields for two weeks or so over the busy
harvest seasons," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Chan ye hua" requires Dongdian Village to pool its natural and
human resources together under collective management. The
villagers seem to be proud of this.
</P>
<P>
"It is more efficient and economical and allows us to achieve
an optimum-scale farming," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government welcomes this method, but would like to
see it being propagated in a gradual process. Considering that
most parts of China's countryside are still economically
undeveloped, the government says a household-based farming system
still props up the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, China's Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang
said that this system will probably continue for at least another
30 years.
</P>
<P>
He also conceded that fact that "chan ye hua" is here to stay
and is farming's future niche in the market economy currently
under assembly in China. The government should "guide" farmers, he
said, to pursue farming on a rationally large scale and establish
processing industries of farm produce in places suited to the
system.
</P>
<P>
With Beijing as its market, Dongdian village is clearly such a
place.

<HEADLINE> Manila Submits Truce Rules to Muslim Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators from the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebel
group today ended their eighth round of low-level talks in
Cotabato City, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the government panel submitted its version of
the ground rules for a general cease-fire in the southern
Philippines. The rebel group had rendered its version earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs,
failed to give specifics. But he said that among the conditions
raised by the government are that no MILF flags will be hoisted
in tolerated areas, no future rebel training conducted and no
sanctuary or assistance provided to lawless elements. MILF
elements are also asked to refrain from committing hostile and
provocative actions against government forces.
</P>
<P>
To give time for the MILF to study the government's truce
scheme, Jaafar said both panels have decided to meet again on
November 12 and 13 with the agenda still focusing on the general
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jaafar said the MILF is pushing for an assessment of
the redelopyment or withdrawal of government troops in Rajah Muda,
Pikit and other areas in Cotabato Province as the two sides had
agreed earlier.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member separatist group of the mainstream
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, which signed a
peace agreement with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, the MILF has begun a series of peace
talks with the government, but made little progress toward forging
a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Military Co-operation Between China and Kazakhstan Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- General Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, held talks
with Muhtar Alteinbaev, defense minister of Kazakhstan, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that China and Kazakhstan are neighbors closely linked
by waters and mountains, and have maintained a long-term and
profound friendship.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations, their
co-operation in various sectors has witnessed smooth progress
through joint efforts, Chi said, adding co-operation between the
two armed forces has been expanding along with the growth of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
At present, military co-operation is developing in different
sectors at different levels, said Chi, who is also state
councillor and defense minister. He expressed the conviction that
Alteinbaev's current visit will surely unveil a new chapter of
military co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China, as a developing socialist country, will build its army
along a course with Chinese characteristic and will never seek
hegemonism, nor join any military alliance, nor deploy a single
soldier abroad, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He cited President Jiang Zemin's announcement at the recently
concluded 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party
that China will cut another 500,000 armed personnels in addition
to the one million military personnel cut in the 1980s, saying the
decision serves as a good proof.
</P>
<P>
China firmly sticks to the independent foreign policy of peace,
and is willing to establish a good-neighborly relations oriented
to the 21st century together with Kazakhstan, in a bid to jointly
safeguarding the world peace, stability and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alteinbaev said that Kazakhstan is paying attention to learning
from other countries in its own national defense construction, and
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with a history of 70 years,
has rich experience worth drawing on.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and China share a boundary line of 1,700 km, and the
co-operation between their border areas is an important reflection
of their good-neighborliness, Alteinbaev said, adding it is of
great significance for the two armed forces to strengthen their
contacts.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the friendly co-operation between
the two countries as well as the two armed forces will be advanced.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Alteinbaev. Alteinbaev and his party arrived in Beijing
yesterday to begin their China trip as guests of General Chi.

NEW DELHI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian customs officials have
seized here 125 gold biscuits valued at 6.7 million rupees (about
190,000 U.S. dollars) in the local market, the local press said

biscuits in a pair of shoes.

<HEADLINE> China's Agriculture: Feeding 1.2 Billion People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture show that in 1949 China, with a
population of just 400 million, produced food grains weighing
113.2 million tons, or 283 kg per capita, while in 1996, the
average per capita production was 400 kg.
</P>
<P>
In particular, they say, food production has rocketed since
1995, recording consecutive increases of 4.8 and five percent. The
latter figure, they predict, will be bettered this year.
</P>
<P>
But the proof of the pudding is in the eating: what is the
situation in food markets across the country?
</P>
<P>
Taking food supply in Beijing, the capital of China, as a
measure of agricultural production would be a little
misleading. Capitals do tend to have the best of
everything. Indeed, off Beijing's main avenues there are markets
in every neighborhood, each one a parking area for
tricycle-trailers.
</P>
<P>
They are piled high with fruit, vegetables, grains, fish, meat,
poultry and eggs.
</P>
<P>
The supply at just one such local market would easily outweigh
an entire town's supply of the same produce in Europe or North
America, where people eat more processed and fewer fresh and dried
foods.
</P>
<P>
Provincial larders too seem equally oversupplied. That's good
for shoppers: they can bargain. And in the countryside there
actually seems more food than farmers can deal with.
</P>
<P>
They spread out their produce along the road: grains are
drying; baskets of apples, peaches and plums wait for
transportation. Grain silos are full. China seems to be bulging at
its seams with food.
</P>
<P>
It's a far cry from the days of rationing and queuing of just
15 years ago. The early 80s in turn were brighter than the dark
days of the 60s and early 70s when ideology harnessed the plow.
</P>
<P>
Peasants were bogged down studying political directives and
attending collective meetings. Nowadays, Chinese farmers are more
likely to be reading pamphlets on crop rotation, pesticide
application or drip irrigation techniques. Meetings have become
courses at which experts teach the nitty gritty of the latest
agrotechnology. Directives do still come from the government, but
they are practical, not political.

<HEADLINE> China's Agriculture: Feeding 1.2 Billion People (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things started to change in 1979, with the advent of reforms,
which actually started in the countryside in the form of the
household contract responsibility system. Peasant families
contracted use of land. They were no longer obliged to turn all
their produce over to the state. Instead, once they had fulfilled
their quota, they were free to sell off any surplus, or grow cash
crops.
</P>
<P>
During the 80s, farming required less brawn and more
brains. New techniques have boosted yields. Under the
responsibility system and by adopting scientific techniques, grain
production averaged an annual two percent increase between 1979
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
China will hit its agricultural goal set for the year 2000
three years early if it can harvest 500 million tons of food grain
this year. Barring major natural disasters, the ministry is
certain that the target will be broken, making 1997 the third
bumper year in succession.
</P>
<P>
The future augurs equally well concerning policy, unswerving
not swinging. Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture, has said that
the family-based farming system will remain and be improved upon
over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the string of bumper harvests, the government is not
resting on any laurels. It continually reiterates the paramount
importance of agriculture at national, provincial and even
municipal levels. National purchasing price on food grain has been
lifted for years to make planting food crops a more profitable
business.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is on the offensive, making dry lands
productive by the construction of irrigation facilities and with
measures to halt the spread of deserts.
</P>
<P>
More stunning is the fact that China feeds itself, 22 percent
of the planet's population, to previously unknown levels of
contentedness by farming on just seven percent of the world's
arable land. Hunger is now history for all but a minute fraction
of Chinese, with cries about a hungry China drowned by the roar of
combine harvesters reaping record yields in all of the nation's
breadbaskets.
</P>
<P>
The call for a good harvest will be answered, but it's outcome
rests no longer entirely in the hands of the gods. While they do
unleash the occasional flood or hailstorm, China's food production
is, in the main, dependent on sound policies, market incentives,
science and technology. All that's really needed from nature is
the sun and rain.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Central, Eastern Europe Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The direct foreign investment in
Central and Eastern European countries has dropped from 14 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995 to 12 billion dollars in 1996, according to a
local report.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and the Czech Republic, which are two of the main
receivers of foreign investment in the region, have witnessed a
fall in foreign investment from 4.6 billion dollars and 2.6
billion dollars in 1995 to 2 billion and 1.2 billion dollars
respectively, said the newspaper "International Market" in an
article based on data released by the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to the decrease of investment from West
Europe and the United States in the privatization programs of
those countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said the investment in Poland, which is
also a major regional money absorber, has increased from 3.7
billion dollars in 1995 to a record 5.2 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the service industry and improvement of
competition mechanism in economy are the main reasons for the
rise, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Astronaut Expresses Optimism Over Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A seasoned Russian astronaut has
expressed optimism over the fate of Russian Mir space station,
saying that as long as Mir's equipment is regularly replaced with
new spare parts, it will continue to work for many more years.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Titov, who was on board the space shuttle Atlantis,
said that Mir is currently functioning well, though it is aging as
human beings are.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Atlantis brought Mir a new central computer which
was installed and then programmed with the information needed to
keep the station on a correct orientation.
</P>
<P>
Mir has suffered a serious of mishaps recently, including
repeated computer breakdowns, power outages and a severe crash
with a cargo craft in June.
</P>
<P>
But Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin reassured
earlier this week that adequate measures have been taken to ensure
the safety of the astronauts on Mir.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old station, which has a designed operational life
of only five years, was launched in 1986 and had overworked in the
space for six years.

COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels are allegedly forcing school children
into their ranks despite the pleading of their weeping parents.
</P>
<P>
"The children forcibly recruited are brainwashed by showing

then undergo military training," reports reaching here today
quoted L.D. Alias Ashok, former leader of the LTTE's Rum Base in
Batticaloa District, as saying.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports to Philippines Under Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to sell 100,000
tons of white rice to the Philippines under a
government-to-government contract aimed at boosting rice exports,
according to the Thai Commerce Ministry's Foreign Trade
Department.
</P>
<P>
The price is still under negotiation, but the deal is expected
to be finalized next week, Pracha Jarutrakulchai, director-general
of the department, was quoted today by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines wants to import 3.5 million tons of
rice this year and Thailand is among rice exporting countries
including China and Vietnam seeking to fulfill the order.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand's rice export performance is expected to
recover next year as many export rivals, including Vietnam, India
and Myanmar, have suffered severe flooding, resulting in lower
rice production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines will
need to import more rice for domestic consumption next year as the
El Nino effect has affected their rice yields.
</P>
<P>
Pracha said both Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to
buy more rice from Thailand. "We are not being seriously impacted
by the El Nino situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand plans to submit 70,000 tons of rice for export
to Japan, and another 20,000 tons and 40,000 tons respectively to
South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The
sales will improve the rice export performance this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai chicken exports are
expected to reach 190,000 tons this year, compared with 145,000
tons last year, according to the Poultry Promotion Association of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export volume increased by 16 to 17 percent to
70,000 tons in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices causing by the baht's devaluation have importers
worldwide shift their orders to Thailand, Sa-nguan Jantaranukul,
president of the association was quoted today by the local press
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the value of chicken exports are forecast to reach 17
billion baht to 18 billion baht (485 million to 514 million U.S.
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the baht's depreciation also helped narrow the gap in
production costs between Thailand and China to 10 percent from 30
percent, making Thailand's exports more attractive.
</P>
<P>
Sa-nguan said China's export competitiveness has fallen because
of higher production costs resulting from technological
developments and raw material imports.
</P>
<P>
Japan is still the main export market of Thai chicken,
accounting for 80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Sector Achieves Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China's post and
telecommunications industry kept its rapid and steady growth in
the first eight months this year, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sector registered a total 111.01 billion yuan (about 13.37
billion US dollars) in traffic turnover during the period, an
increase of 33 percent over the same period last year, according
to sources with the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT).
</P>
<P>
It earned a total of 108.87 billion yuan in business revenues,
a rise of 37.7 percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging news comes amid growing pressure imposed upon
the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications in recent months, with
many government officials and experts urging the opening up of
China's telecommunications sector, which has been an MPT monopoly
for decades.
</P>
<P>
President and Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said in his
15th National Party Congress report that industrial monopolies
should be gradually phased out.
</P>
<P>
According to MPT sources, China's mobile telephone subscribers
totaled 10.93 million by the end of August, a dramatic jump from
the 10 million recorded in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
China has the world's third largest mobile phone network, after
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992-96 period, the country's total number of mobile
phone subscribers expanded at an average annual rate of 170
percent.
</P>
<P>
The country has an average urban telephone coverage rate of 25
percent at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Its total telephone switching capacity had reached 100 million
lines by that time, the second largest telephone network in the
world, and not very far behind the United States, according to the
the Post and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Seeks Close Cooperation With International Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said here today that Kazakhstan hopes to boost
cooperation with international organizations in all fields,
especially in economy.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing cooperation with international bodies will be
beneficial to Kazakhstan's economic integration with the
international community, said Nazarbayev while meeting Iva
Bertelo, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for
Europe (ECE), and Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of the U.N.
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president also voiced his support for an
international exhibition of the Asia-Pacific region to be held in
Alma Ata in October 1998, saying that the exhibition mainly on
daily consumer goods and food industry will help promote
Kazakhstan's global economic integration.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Bertelo told a press conference that the
United Nations had spoken highly of Nazarbayev's initiative to
establish the SPEKA -- a U.N. development commission for
Central-Asian independent countries. He said the initiative will
score the United Nations' support and the International Monetary
Fund's assistance.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the ECE and ESCAP, together with experts from
Kazakhstan, formulated a SPEKA development program a year after
Kazakhstan's president proposed the establishment of the SPEKA at
the U.N. Assembly in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The four-year program, which consists of 32 projects in
technical assistance in infrastructure, industrial transformation,
energy, foreign investment and protection of trade and environment
and other fields, will be implemented beginning 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank Tries to Support Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, has introduced a new foreign exchange trading facility for
export-oriented companies in its latest move to shore up the
falling rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The facility includes arrangements for swaps and forward
purchases for the country's 580 registered exporters, Bank
Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono said when announcing the
new policy here Friday, Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The swap facility is aimed at encouraging these exporters to
unload their dollar holdings," Soedradjad said.
</P>
<P>
The new swap facility allows export companies to buy dollars
through forward transactions with 11 foreign exchange banks
appointed by Bank Indonesia. These appointed banks can then
continue the transactions with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the export-oriented companies can also sell
their foreign exchange earnings through forward transactions with
Bank Indonesia. Previously such transactions could be carried out
only outside the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor did not say how effective the new
move would be in stabilizing the local currency, but he noted that
the new facility would protect exporters from the sharp
fluctuation of the rupiah against the dollar and ensure that they
would get the dollar they need from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia issued early last month a ruling limiting
forward foreign exchange trading by domestic banks to non-resident
customers to 5 million dollars in a bid to confine speculative
dollar buying.
</P>
<P>
But the move was unsuccessful as the rush for dollars continued,
with the rupiah further losing ground.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah plunged to a new historic low of 3,725 against the
dollar in mid-day trading Friday before recovering to 3,395/3,405
at close. It has lost about 50 percent of its value against the
American greenback since January this year.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad said this week's plunge was partly due to a sharp
increase in demand for the dollar from local companies either to
finance their offshore debts or imports.
</P>
<P>
However, economists here said the dramatic fall by the rupiah
showed the country's economy was going through its toughest time
since the oil crisis in the 1980s.

<P>
BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- About 300,000 people in Thailand
may lose their jobs by the end of this year, the Thailand
Development Research Institute has predicted.
</P>
<P>
A large number of cash-strapped companies and factories have
closed or reduced their operations at a time of economic slowdown,
and others are expected to follow suit during the last three
months of the year, leading to mass lay-offs, according to the
Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The layoffs will include not only blue-collar workers, but also
white-collar workers, graduates from secondary and tertiary
educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
Yongyuth Chalaemwong, director of Labor Research of the
institute, urged relevant government agencies to take the issue
seriously and provide workers with training to improve their
skills.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to encourage foreign investment so
as to create more job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Breaks 3,700 Mark Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah broke the
3,700 barrier against the U.S. dollar Friday, a fall of 8 percent,
as the rush for the American currency continued on the local
foreign currency market, dealers here said today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah plunged to a new historic low of 3,725 against the
dollar in mid-day trading, but it managed to recover in the
afternoon to close at 3,640/50, a 7-percent drop from its
3,395/3,405 opening.
</P>
<P>
The dealers attributed the drop of the rupiah's value to a
continued increase in the demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the rupiah's dramatic fall Friday showed that
the country's economy was going through its toughest time since
the oil crisis in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad Djiwandono, governor of Bank Indonesia, the
country's central bank, said earlier that many companies bought
dollars to pay their dollar-denominated debts.
</P>
<P>
According to data from a business consulting firm, the Castle
Group, Indonesian private offshore debt reached 55.52 billion
dollars last year, of which about 34.24 billion dollars would
mature in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad said Friday that the central bank would intervene in
the market if conditions allowed.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's value has declined by more than 50 percent against
the dollar since the beginning of the year, especially since early
July when the rupiah came under speculative attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index lost
about 4 percent to close at 515.47 points.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts and brokers blamed the plunge of share
prices on the weakening rupiah in the currency market.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno said she has begun a preliminary investigation into White
House fund-raising phone calls made by Vice President Gore, a
process that could lead to an independent counsel probe.
</P>
<P>
Reno told the three-judge panel that because she has been
unable to determine "whether there is sufficient specific and
credible evidence to suggest a violation of federal law," she must
begin the probe under the provisions of the independent counsel
law.
</P>
<P>
In a court document filed with the panel Friday, the attorney
general cites the brevity of a 30-day review of Gore's phone calls
and "the complexity of the factual and legal issues presented by
this matter."
</P>
<P>
At the end of what will be a 60-day investigation, she must
either ask for an extension, drop the probe for lack of evidence
or ask the panel to appoint an independent counsel to investigate
the case.
</P>
<P>
Gore made between 40 and 50 calls from the White House in 1995
and 1996 to raise fund before the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A 1883 federal law bans the solicitation of campaign funds on
federal property, but the law has only been used when the person
being asked for money was on federal property.
</P>
<P>
It has never been used to prosecute someone on federal property
making a phone call to a potential contributor elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Private Funds for Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government plans
to modify its successful build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme to
attract private funds for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Trade and Industry Undersecretary Ernesto
Ordonez, who also chairs the Presidential Committee for Flagship
Projects, the newspaper The Philippine Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Since an entire project may not be financially attractive to
the private sector, the government will have to divide the project
to interested private investors and with a portion of it to be
funded by the government, Ordonez told a press conference on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This way, major infrastructure projects which would require
massive investments will be assured of funding and thus will be
implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ordonez added that President Fidel Ramos has agreed to take on
the innovative approach on the BOT scheme.
</P>
<P>
The BOT program has been proven an effective way to attract
both local and foreign investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, investors build their businesses with tax
break and other incentives provided by the government. After
several years of operation, they transfer the ownership of the
enterprises to the Philippine government.

friendly relations which would be further cemented through joint
efforts.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a six-member Senate delegation from
France Leghari said Pakistan values its relations with France with

</P>
<P>
"We look forward to enhancing our relations with France in all

more vested interest than Pakistan to see an end of the fighting
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan fully supports UN efforts aimed at restoring peace in
Afghanistan, he said, adding that durable peace cannot be achieved
in Afghanistan without the participation of all parties concerned.

stand on the Kashmir issue, saying the Kashmir issue has been a
destabilizing factor in the region and has also led to an arms
race.

<P>
Pakistan, Leghari said, wants peaceful resolution of all issues
with India including the core issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the French delegation, Senator Andre Egu,

<P>
QUITO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Congress of Ecuador
has reorganized the Supreme Court of Justice with the election of
its 31 judges, including two women and 29 men.
</P>
<P>
The new judges were elected Thursday night for an indefinite
period and a five-year renewal, according to the last
Constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
They must get together in a plenum next week to elect the new
president of the Supreme Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
President Fabian Alarcon described as positive the
reorganization of the Supreme Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision dictated by dismissed Supreme Court
president Carlos Solorzano against him is the proof of the
juridical insecurity in the country resulted from the existence of
a politized court.
</P>
<P>
Solorzano dictated a decision three days ago, indicting Alarcon
in a penal trial on alleged irregularities in the National

Scientists confirmed that the fields store some 200 million
tons of crude oil. The output is expected to reach four million
tons yearly when the project is completed in 2004, according to
sources from the China Offshore Oil Corporation.

Their failure to appear meant the trial may be postponed until

<HEADLINE> WTO Calls for Advancement in Multilateralism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
General Director Renato Ruggiero today called on Latin American
and Asian-Pacific rim countries to advance more rapidly in the
implementation of a multilateral commerce system.
</P>
<P>
The WTO chief made this call in his speech at the meeting of
economy and commerce ministers of Latin America and the
Asia-Pacific rim countries being held here, where the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Cepal) is based.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at getting both regions more closely
linked.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero considered "erroneous" the opinion that globalization
will provoke a wider gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the correct procedure to be successful in
the new international commerce scenario is to combine efficient
macroeconomic policies with the globalization process promoted by
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, he said, the present trend toward regionalism
must be considered complementary to global multilateralism.
</P>
<P>
He said if the world does not advance on this line, instead of
"globalizing regionalism, we are going to regionalize
globalization."
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero also highlighted interest shown by both regions to
publicize their economic data at the WTO Internet sites.

<HEADLINE> Truancy in US Relates to Rising Juvenile Crime Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 3 (Xinhua) -- An interactive voice
response system has been installed in six public high schools in
Oakland, central California of the United States, as an effort to
curb rampant truancy.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the first day when the School Calling
System was operational, 2,500 parents received automated calls at
home and were told that their children were not in school.
</P>
<P>
The computerized message, personalized with the truant
student's school and grade level but not the student name, is
offered in Chinese, Cambodian, English, Laotian, Spanish and
Vietnamese. Parents are given the opportunity to excuse their
child absence by phone, using a confidential personal
identification number. Parents or guardians are required to obtain
their personal identification numbers by signing up in person at
the child's school.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being notified when kids are absent, parents are
also able to call in and get a child's attendance records for the
past 20 days. The Oakland Unified School District plans to expand
the phone system by giving parents and guardians the latest
school news as well as a teacher hot line offering specific
message about home work assignments, test schedule and class
projects.
</P>
<P>
Of 53,000 students enrolled in the district in the 1995-96
school year, 18 percent were habitually truant who had at least
six unexcused absences.
</P>
<P>
Oakland's efforts to abate truance is aided by local law
enforcement. Habitually truant students can be subject to
prosecution in Oakland. The juvenile court has the authority to
order them to perform 40 hours of community service, pay a fine of
100 dollars and suspend a student driver's license or eligibility
to apply for one.
</P>
<P>
What Oakland is doing is part of nationwide efforts to find new
ways to keep young people in school and avoid drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
Truancy is the "red blinking light that tells us that a young
person may be going down the wrong road," said Secretary of
Education Richard Riley, acknowledging that the fact that while
the nation's crime rate is going down, the juvenile crime rate is
continuing to go up.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Department of Education announced a 10 million
dollar discretionary grant program to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1996 manual to combat truancy worked out by the
department in cooperation with the Department of Justice, while no
national data on the extent of truancy exists, in some cities
unexcused absences can number in the thousands each day.
</P>
<P>
The manual cited Pittsburgh, where each day approximately 3,500
students or 12 percent of the pupil population are absent and 7
percent of those absences are unexcused. In Philadelphia, 2,500
students a day are absent with an excuse. And in Milwaukee, on any
given school day there are 4,000 unexpected absences.
</P>
<P>
"Truancy is a gateway to crime," said the manual, which had
been sent to every schoold district in the nation. "High rates of
truancy are linked to high daytime burglary and high vandalism."
</P>
<P>
During a sample period in Miami, for instance, more than 71
percent of 13 to 16 year-olds prosecuted for criminal violations
had been truants.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to offer parents, school officials, law enforcement
agencies and communities a set of principles to design their own
strategies to combat truancy, the manual stressed that parents
play the fundamental role in the education of the children and
that school districts should communicate to their students that
they have zero tolerance for truancy.
</P>
<P>
Several states in the United States have daytime curfews during
school hours that allow law enforcement officers to question youth
to determine if their absence is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department also urged schools to develop
initiatives to combat the root cause of truancy, including
turoring programs, added security measures, drug prevention and
mentorship through community and religious groups.

NEW YORK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar approached a
five-month high against the yen today, lifted by a jump in oil
prices after the situation in the Persian Gulf got intensified.
</P>
<P>
Japan's dependency on imported oil makes its economy vulnerable
to any supply interruptions. More investors believed that Japan
would sell yen for the dollar to buy more expensive oil.
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost ground against the German mark on stable U.S.
jobs figures that suggested Germany will be raising interest rates
before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 122.03
Japanese yen, up from 121.65 late Thursday. The dollar bought
1.7572 German marks, down from 1.7725.
</P>
<P>
Oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 99 cents to its
highest level since February.
</P>
<P>
Germany's central bankers have said a lot in recent weeks to
cause expectations of an interest rate hike there, making the mark
and mark-denominated securities more attractive.

ATHENS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The annual consumer price
inflation in Greece dropped sharply from 5.6 percent in August to

The CPI increase in September was shaped as a result of a 0.5

ATHENS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today that it would
choose "the right place, method and time of responding to the
report claiming the existence of Kurdish terrorist training camps
in Greece, which appeared in the British newspaper The Observer
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, government spokesman Dimitris

Meanwhile, the Greek Foreign Ministry said tonight in a

and described as "totally unfounded."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the Observer report, based on the claims
of some Kurd (Seydo Hazar) who lived in Germany until the
beginning of the year, was of course "beyond the ethics of
journalism," and it was deplorable that a serious British
newspaper was drawn into it, adopting "a classic provocation."
</P>
<P>
"Of the fabrications which comprise it nothing is new, some of
these inaccuracies have already appeared since 1991, and have, at
various times, been promoted by circles wishing to increase the
tension in Greek-Turkish relations," the ministry said.

NEW YORK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks seesawed today,
first rallying on a positive jobs report, then retreating on
concerns over tensions in the Middle East, before bouncing back by
the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 11.05 at 8,038.58. The
index rose as much as 116.89 points in early trading, and then
slipped over 71 points by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 619.42 million
shares as against 472.71 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also closed higher today, extending
Thursday's record-breaking gains.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 4.57 to 965.03, and
the NYSE composite index rose 2.26 to 505.69.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.45 to 1,715.86, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.96 to 709.92,
setting a new record.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rallied this morning, following bonds higher after the
Labor Department reported the unemployment rate was unchanged at
4.9 percent in September, remaining near a 24-year low.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices immediately shot higher after the jobs report was
released, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to a
20-month low of 6.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the early gains in stocks and bonds were mostly erased by
mid-afternoon on concerns that turmoil in the Middle East could
disrupt oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices shot up about 1.20 U.S. dollars per barrel
higher on the New York Mercantile Exchanges on reports of
tension in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, the Treasury yield was down to 6.28 percent,
slightly lower than 6.29 percent late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures soared today
to an eight-month high in New York after the situation in the
Middle East got intensified.
</P>
<P>
There were U.S. reports saying that the Clinton administration
dispatched an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf following
"violations of an Iraqi no-fly zone" Monday. The move heightened
tensions in a region that supplies a third of the world's oil.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rose 99 cents to 22.76 U.S. dollars a barrel, the highest
since February 19. November unleaded gasoline jumped 1.56 cents to
62.99 cents a gallon and November heating oil rose 2.21 cents to
62.01 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver futures also rose sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as investors sought a safe haven for their
money in the event of military conflict.

<HEADLINE> Saint Lucia Calls for WTO Procedure Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- There must be fundamental
reform to the system of dispute settledment if the World Trade
Organization (WTO) was to be of any value to developing countries,
Dr. Kenny D. Anthony, prime minister of Saint Lucia, stressed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, the prime
minister said the small banana producing countries of the
Caribbean Community last month received a particularly harsh and
crushing blow, when the Apples Board of the WTO upheld an earlier
finding that the preferential treatment accorded in the European
market to bananas of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
contravened WTO rules on free trade.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the reform to the WTO was essential
because the implications of the scope of the ruling on bananas
were not confined to bananas only. The ruling raised the question
about other import agreements for agricultural goods as well as
the future of trade and development of cooperation agreements
between the rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Anthony said that the real challenge to the WTO was not how
effective its Dispute Settlement Body could be in rigidly applying
the letter of its regulations, but rather whether the process by
which decisions were arrived was perceived as being fair.
</P>
<P>
He said the system must be reformed so that it took account of
the consequences of the implementation of its ruling. It must of
necessity consider the impact of its decisions, particularly in
the case of the ruling of the banana regime, the affected
countries had small, vulnerable and fragile economies.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the WTO would establish a standard of arbitration
premised on fairness, civilized negotiation of vital interests and
the calculation of equity in international trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added trade and development must be about
the development of people and the WTO criteria for settling
disputes must be redesigned to take account of social, health,
cultural and environmental issues.

<HEADLINE> US Airports Gear Up for Cargo Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles International
Airport, the world's busiest, is undergoing a 12 billion dollar
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, when the plan is completed, the airport will increase
passengers by 60 percent, from last year's 58 million to 93
million. Meanwhile, it will handle 420 million tons of air cargo,
as compared with 172 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 cargo flights depart and arrive in the world's
largest airport every day, nearly 80 percent of which are shipping
commodities between U.S. and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles International Airport expansion is but part of a
trend in the U.S., where airports are improving their facilities
as a growing number of industries rely more and more on the rapid
movement of their products from factory to market by air.
</P>
<P>
Walter Johnson, ex-president of the Miami-based International
Air Cargo Association, said in a recent interview that air cargo
currently moves approximately 36 percent to 40 percent of the
world's trade. This drives airports around the world, particularly
in the U.S., to supply new facilities to decrease so-called ground
delay issues that inhibit the movement of goods by air.
</P>
<P>
Miami International Airport, the second busiest airport in the
world handling 171 million tons of air cargo last year, is putting
into effect a smaller plan to improve capacities for flights
between the U.S. and Latin American states. The implementation of
the 10-year-old plan needs 4 billion dollars and increases its air
cargo by 134 percent in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of facilities in Denver International Airport
is aiming to accelerate trade and economic cooperation from Canada
in the north through the U.S. Midwest to Mexico in the south. The
so-called "city-sized airport," occupying a land of 53 square
miles, will complete in eight to 10 years and become the center of
air cargo flights for the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Any improvement in air cargo capability into the next century
"must include airports and, above all, include government, which
today plays a major role in establishing the benchmarks of
process," Johnson said, adding that for individual air carriers,
air cargo operations are the key to their survival.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the International Air Transport
Association, cargo operations account for as much as 20 percent of
an air carrier's annual revenues, and even as much as 35 percent
in the Asia-Pacific region.

<P>
YAOUNDE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The French defense ministry
says it has begun withdrawing 400 troops from the Bouar base in
the Central Africa Republic, according to Radio Cameroun here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
It says the operation is expected to go on for several weeks.
The details for withdrawing 1,100 French troops from the
country's capital Bangui was still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
France has two military bases in the Central Africa Republic.
The bases were set up in accordance with the defense agreement
signed in 1960s between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last July, France announced that it would be reducing
the number of French troops stationed on the African continent
from 8000 to 5000.
</P>
<P>
The cut includes the closure of Bouar base which has served
for many French military operations in central Africa.

<HEADLINE> UN Financial Situation Continues to Be Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Management Joseph Conner today
described the world body as resting "on a precarious financial
perch."
</P>
<P>
He told the Fifth Commission (Administrative and Budgetary) of
the General Assembly that there are high arrearage levels,
deficits in regular budget cash, prolonged borrowings from
peace-keeping budgets and continuing inability to liquidate debt
to member states for peace-keeping troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid dues amounted to 2.417 billion U.S. dollars at the end
of September 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid dues exceed current year dues by a ratio of 1.07 to 1,
the highest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ratio stood at 0.79 in 1995 and 0.61 in 1992, he said,
adding that "the warning flag is waving now."
</P>
<P>
"The major contributor," referring to the United States,
accounts for 60 percent of all amounts owed to the organization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the U.N. has been on a deficit position, with
deficits periods of four or so months as usual, he said.
</P>
<P>
A negative balance cash position of 261 million dollars is
forecast for the end of 1997 and the negative situation will
persist for five months in 1998, Cannor said.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that at year end we will owe 907 million dollars
to troop and equipment contributing countries up from 838 million
dollars at the end of 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform package made by Secretary-General Kofi Annan does
not hold the immediate prospect of alleviating the U.N. financial
situation, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Deficit Expected Down to 23 billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) said today that it expected a federal deficit in
fiscal 1997 of about 23 billion dollars, 11 billion smaller than
it estimated just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The new estimate is the latest unexpectedly favorable twist in
a year that began with the Clinton administration and the CBO
projecting shortfalls of about 125 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The final figures for U.S. fiscal 1997, which ended September
30, should be available late this month.
</P>
<P>
The CBO said that the biggest reason for this year's shrinking
estimates has been unexpectedly high revenue collections.
</P>
<P>
But it said the declining of the U.S. government deficit seemed
to have little to do with the budget deal President Bill Clinton
and Congress enacted in August. The spending cuts in that measure,
which are aimed at eliminating all the U.S. federal deficits by
2002, will not take effect until 1998.
</P>
<P>
A 23-billion-dollar deficit would be the smallest since the 6
billion shortfall of 1974. The U.S. federal deficit hit a record
290 billion dollars in 1992 and the budget gap has shrunk every
year since President Clinton took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Last month, President Clinton's Office of Management and Budget
projected a deficit of 37 billion dollars in fiscal 1997.

<HEADLINE> London, Paris Shares Set New Record Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Europe's two major stock markets
London and Paris staged strong gains today and ended the week with
fresh closing highs, boosted by Wall Street's early rally and
benign US economic figures.
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the London market rose sharply to hit a new
closing high of 5,330.8, up 34.7 points on the day and 104.5
points higher over the week as the Dow rallied on the back of
subdued US jobs figures.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index was already boosted by a subdued purchasing
managers' survey of UK services earlier in the day, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Leading French shares also made big gains today, with the
CAC-40 index surging to a new closing high of 3,094.01, 41.94
points higher, breaching the earlier closing record of 3,075.67
set on July 31 and a rise of 108.38 points on the week.
</P>
<P>
The market was boosted by good corporate results and fresh
strength on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market was closed today for a public holiday. The
DAX-30 index ended 76.73 points higher at 4,273.71 Thursday.
Trading will resume Monday.

<HEADLINE> Judge Keeps Jury Anonymous in Mail-Bomb Terrorist Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The names, addresses and
employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the
Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on
November 12 in Sacramento, California.
</P>
<P>
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and
injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995. The suspect, Theodore
Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math
instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to
the Unabomber, two of which are fatal. He is also charged with a
third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order today
in denying a news media motion to make juror names public,
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Media Attorney Charity Kenyon argued there isn't enough
evidence showing they will be harassed, endangered or influenced
if the public and news media knew who they are.
</P>
<P>
But Burrell disagreed, saying that threats to witnesses in the
18-year Unabomber case "raise the specter that juror safety is
potentially at risk."
</P>
<P>
He also said reports of harassment against witnesses --
submitted by attorneys on both sides of the case -- meet the test
for juror anonymity spelled out by the 9th U.S. Circuit, which may
be asked to overturn his order.
</P>
<P>
One report by federal defender Quin Denvir said the names and
addresses of 18 supposed Unabomber witnesses were publicly
distributed in July with the suggestion that they be contacted and
scared as a game.
</P>
<P>
Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last
up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to
an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the
trial to another city.
</P>
<P>
The court has contacted about 600 prospects for the 12-member
jury, with six alternates, so far.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Needs Transparency in Evaluating Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Former president of the
World Bank Robert MacNamara has urged the Tanzanian authorities
to be transparent in checking graft during the process of
privatizing parastatal organizations.
</P>
<P>
MacNamara, who was speaking to Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission (PSRC) officials in Dar es Salaam today, said
transparency would curb corruption especially at the stage of
evaluating bids.
</P>
<P>
Civil society should also be involved in bid evaluation
process, MacNamara, who is co-chairman of the Global Coalition
for Africa, told PSRC officials.
</P>
<P>
"Civil society should be active and well organized to address
various issues like corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that experience has shown that corruption was rife
during the process of evaluation of bids and offers.
</P>
<P>
"I think you have very terrible problems, but please do not
misunderstand our views on this, " said the former world bank
president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, briefing MacNamara and his delegation, PSRC Chairman
George Mbowe said the whole process of privatizing parastatal
organizations was one hundred percent transparent.
</P>
<P>
Mbowe said since the privatization process started in 1992, a
total of 158 parastatal organizations have been divestured,
earning the government 200 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission has listed a total of 308 such
organizations to be privatized. But he could not give projections
of the remaining public firms to be divestured.
</P>
<P>
The PSRC chief informed MacNamara and his delegation that a
number of public utilities, like telecommunications sector,
water, power company, harbors and railways would soon be
privatized.
</P>
<P>
He said strategic investors would soon buy 35 percent shares
in the telecommunications sector, while 20 percent other shares
would go to some institutions, few would be sold to local
institutions and the government would only retain 20 percent
shares.
</P>
<P>
On water sector, Mbowe said they have already identified four
firms which are interested in investing in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Mbowe said they have decided to invite investors in the water
and power sectors because of the urgency of the two sectors and
their importance in people's daily life.

<HEADLINE> US Sends Aircraft Carrier to Gulf as Warning to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
ordered the aircraft carrier Nimitz to sail at top speed toward
the Persian Gulf on the pretext of Iran's violation of the no-fly
zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the 73,000-ton carrier, which usually carries
about 50 F-14 and f/a-18 combat aircraft, has skipped a port call
in Singapore and hurry to the Gulf for a show of strength.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the carrier, accompanied by guided missile
cruisers and destroyers, should reach the Gulf in about 10 days,
four or five days earlier than originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon indicated the Nimitz's mission was connected with
the recent Iranian raids on bases of the Mujahideen Khalq, the
main Iranian opposition group. One of the bases was inside
southern Iraq where the United States and its allies self-claimed
to be a no-fly zone since 1992.
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said, "Is this a warning to Iran? Of course
it's a warning."
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq was
originally aimed at Iraq's air force, and the United States has
not previously taken a strong stand on Iranian attacks on the
Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon Tuesday said the United
States had told Iran it could shoot down its planes if they
entered the no-fly zone. White House spokesman Mike McCurry today
reinforced the warning, saying, "We've made clear we will continue
to vigorously enforce the no-fly zones."

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Atlantis Separates from Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Shuttle Atlantis
separated from the Russian space station Mir today after six days
of linked flight during which the Mir was replenished with a new
central computer and a fresh American astronaut, the NASA's Space
Center in Houston said.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle slowly pulled away from Mir at 1:28 p.m. EDT (1728
GMT) as the spacecraft soared 250 miles (420 km) above
southeastern Russia, leaving David Wolf behind for a four-month
stay. His American predecessor, Michael Foale, was aboard Atlantis
to back Earth after a stressful four and a half month mission on
the Mir.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis arrived last weekend and brought for the Mir a new
central computer, spare batteries and repair equipment it needs
because of a collision with a cargo ship in June.
</P>
<P>
Undocking was delayed by one and a half hours to allow the Mir
crew time to replace a data-relay device that malfunctioned a
month ago and test a new one.
</P>
<P>
The electronics box provides data to the automatic docking
system that will be needed Tuesday for the arrival of an unmanned
resupply vessel.
</P>
<P>
The Mir crew has had trouble locating the punctures caused by
the crash, so NASA agreed to have the shuttle crew help out just
after undocking.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis is due back to Earth Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls for Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is calling for
the world's attention to the eradication of poverty, which has
become the "cornerstones of Ethiopia's development strategies and
democratic reforms."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum Mesfin, foreign minister of Ethiopia, said in his speech
at the 52nd session of the General Assembly that international
cooperation, whether through bilateral or multilateral means,
could not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to
ensure sustainable development and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But it was critically important that the international economic
environment provided a level playing field, particularly for those
who had failed to put their countries on the track of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the prediction that the level of poverty would continue
to grow in Africa was a challenge to the international community
as it reflected on the dire condition of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had made important progress in building the basis for
food security for its people, he said. The country registered a 10
percent gross domestic product rate of growth in 1996. But there
could be no guarantee as long as production was totally dependent,
as in Ethiopia, on rain-fed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
On the debt relief measures outlined by some developed
countries, he said they found it difficult to meet conditions that
could not even be absorbed by far more advanced economies.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Saint Lucia has to shape
its foreign policy to meet the challenges in a changing world,
Prime Minister Kenny Anthony said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd session of the United Nations General
Assembly, he said, "The changing characteristics of the
international system have necessitated that we redefine the
boundaries of our alliances."
</P>
<P>
He said, "In this process, we must be guided by the imperative
of finding and mobilizing new sources of investment that are
predicated on creating new paths of sustainable growth."
</P>
<P>
"For us, foreign policy is about building bridges to other
people, other cultures and other markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Consistent with these basic principles, Saint Lucia has
proceeded in a direction which the majority of the states of the
world have already trod by establishing diplomatic links with the
People's Republic of China," Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
The East Caribbean nation established diplomatic relations with
the People's Republic of China on September 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the U.N. reform, the prime minister said his country
firmly believes that if the U.N. is to adequately address the
challenges of the coming century, it should become more responsive
to the needs of all its members states, especially the majority of
the member states' needs for sustainable development.
