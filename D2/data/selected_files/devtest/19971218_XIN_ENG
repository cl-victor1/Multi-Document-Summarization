<HEADLINE> Pre-divorce School Helps Mend Endangered Marriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A newly opened "pre-divorce"
school in the Chinese capital tries to help estranged couples mend
their broken marriages by providing courses or counseling service.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists have said the school's efforts in saving marriages
are very worthwhile since the rising divorce rate in China,
especially in urban areas, can lead to many social problems,
according to a report in today's "Beijing Youth Daily."
</P>
<P>
The school was opened by the Marriage Registration Office under
the Civil Affairs Bureau of Chongwen District.
</P>
<P>
"We make the last effort to save ruptured marriages," said He
Xuemei, director of the office and one of the founders of the
school. She said divorce results in social problems such as
custody disputes and division of property.
</P>
<P>
The divorce rate in Beijing, whose population is now 12
million, rose to 23.8 percent in 1995, the newspaper quoted
sociologist Chen Yiyun as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's very worthwhile and urgent to open such agencies to
provide legal and psychological counseling to these couples," said
Chen, a researcher at the Sociology Institute under the Chinese
Academy of Social Science.
</P>
<P>
Students of the school are couples who have applied for
divorce. Teachers are volunteers from the district Trade Union,
the Federations of Women and court system.
</P>
<P>
Among the first eight pairs of graduates, one has withdrawn
their divorce application, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested providing scientific knowledge about marriage
and family to the public, and educating engaged couples to be more
aware of their responsibilities for families and children.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Authority Rules Out Dollar's Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) said Wednesday that the country's economic
fundamentals are strong and it saw no reason for the Singapore
dollar to weaken.
</P>
<P>
"The MAS intervenes in the foreign exchange market from time to
time to iron out short-term fluctuations. We do not publicize our
exchange rate operations," local television quoted the MAS,
Singapore's central bank, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As Singapore's economic fundamentals remain sound, we see no
reason why the Singapore dollar should weaken," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore dollar firmed above the 1.68 level to the U.S.
dollar Wednesday, partly on talks that the MAS had intervened
after the Singapore currency fell to a six-year low of 1.717 in
London trading overnight.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said speculation that the MAS had been selling U.S.
dollars again on Wednesday added to the Singapore dollar's gains.
But most agreed that such an operation would have been aimed at
smoothing sharp movements.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia to Beef up Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia today
approved their 1998 work program that aims at enhancing the
security of NATO, Russia and all the countries in the
Euro-Atlantic area.
</P>
<P>
The approval was taken at the second NATO-Russia Permanent
Joint Council meeting at foreign ministerial level. The first
such meeting was held on September 26 in New York.
</P>
<P>
The work program sorted out a number of priority issues for
consultations and information exchange between NATO and Russia,
such as measures to promote cooperation, transparency and
confidence, strategy, defense policy, military doctrines of NATO
and Russia, budgets and infrastructure development program, as
well as disarmament, arms control and peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
At a post-meeting press briefing, Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said that Russia-NATO military cooperation will
not be confined within peacekeeping operations but on a more
permanent basis like the NATO-led Combined Joint Task Force
(CJTF).
</P>
<P>
The CJTF is a multinational, multi-service task force
constructed to cope with crises and conflicts triggered off by
nationalism, religion, environment and socio-economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a Russian proposal was discussed and approved by
the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) foreign ministers to
forge a disaster-response capability. Russia also proposed to
host next year an exercise of the EAPC-sponsored disaster-response
capability.
</P>
<P>
EAPC now consists of 44 countries in the Euro-Atlantic area
including Russia and Ukraine and most of the former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russian foreign ministers today also discussed their
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and reiterated their
determination to continue their close cooperation under the Dayton
peace accord to help bring peace and security to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers endorsed the conclusions of last week's
Peace Implementation Conference in Bonn and called upon the
parties involved to the peace accord to cooperate fully toward the
fulfilment of their commitments.
</P>
<P>
NATO is consulting non-NATO troop contributors on a possible
military presence in Bosnia beyond June next year when the current
U.N. peacekeeping mandate expires.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's foreign minister meeting of NATO, a consensus
had been reached on politico-military guidance which would in turn
allow NATO military authorities to work out options of the
possible continued military presence in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
NATO politicians will gauge after the Christmas break the
options ranging from total withdrawal of ground forces to a
deterrent force with different force levels and with different
tasking.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Promoting Partnership of Good Neighborliness, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An editorial, to be carried by
China's leading newspaper People's Daily on Thursday, hails the
just-concluded ASEAN-China-Japan-South Korea and China-ASEAN
informal leaders' meeting in Kuala Lumpur as a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin attended the two meetings held on
Monday and Tuesday respectively. It was another diplomatic move
taken by Jiang following his recent visits to the United States,
Canada and Mexico, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
During the two meetings, 12 heads of states in East Asia looked
into the prospects of regional development, discussed regional
economic cooperation, and reached broad consensus on strengthening
good-neighborly friendship among East Asian countries, broadening
mutual-beneficial cooperation and promoting common development.
</P>
<P>
During the China-ASEAN meeting, President Jiang exchanged
in-depth views with ASEAN leaders on the development of the
China-ASEAN friendly cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
All the participants of the meeting agreed to establish a
partnership of good-neighborliness and mutual trust oriented to
the 21st century, and issued a joint statement in this regard,
said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that the holding of two meetings at the turn
of the century was a great pioneering work in the history of
development in the East Asia. It was of profound significance to
the future development of the East Asia and the China-ASEAN
friendly cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Viewed from the aspects of politics, economy, culture and
geopolitics, East Asia is a force which should not to be ignored
in today's international arena, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new circumstance of world multipolarization and
closer links between world economies, East Asian nations
surmounted all kinds of obstacles and difficulties through
development and mutual cooperation, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
With the wealth of experience they accumulated, East Asian
nations will set an example of smooth economic cooperation for
other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
They will also play an increasingly important role in promoting
the establishment of a new international political and economic
order of peace, stability and justice, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has a direct bearing on the development of East
Asian nations. China offers numerous trade opportunities and a
large market for the region.
</P>
<P>
In return, the editorial said, the sustained and stable
economic development in East Asia is crucial for China's
development.
</P>
<P>
Having the region's prosperity and stability in mind, China
stressed that cooperation between East Asian nations should base
upon the principles of mutual respect, equal participation, mutual
benefit and common development, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
China always maintains that to guarantee a regional peace,
countries should seek common interests and iron out differences
through dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, strengthen good-neighborly relations
with other East Asian countries and promote reciprocal
cooperation, the editorial stressed.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN are both important forces in maintaining peace
and stability and promoting cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable progress in its relations with ASEAN
and ASEAN members over the past decade, and notably so since they
established a comprehensive dialogue partnership. China and ASEAN
have been building up mutual confidence and strengthening their
cooperation in safeguarding peace and promoting development, said
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN have both agreed to build a 21st
Century-oriented partnership and had the commitment written into
the Joint Statement.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that Both sides have decided to make full
use of the dialogue mechanism to coordinate with and support each
other on significant regional and global issues, and to safeguard
the justified interests and rights of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They will continue to seek common ground and iron out their
differences and disputes through friendly consultations. China and
all the ASEAN members will be good neighbors, good partners and
good friends forever, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
To develop a trusting good-neighborlyness with ASEAN countries
is an important part of China's foreign policy, said the
editorial. "Even if China becomes developed in the future, it will
treat all countries as equal, will build its relations with all
countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
co-existence and will never seek hegemony. This stand has won high
praise from leaders of the ASEAN countries", the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
In all, the ASEAN-China-Japan-South Korea informal leader's
meetings have opened a new chapter in cooperation between East
Asian countries and between China and ASEAN. They reflect the new
trend of the world towards multipolarity, further embody the Asian
countries' common will to work together for regional peace and
development, and represent a new stage of the development of ties
between China and ASEAN countries, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"We can believe that through our joint endeavors and unremitting
efforts, China-ASEAN cooperation will be further strengthened in
the 21st century. The good-neighborly and mutually trusting
partnership between China and ASEAN will further develop on a new,
higher level", the editorial said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Zouebi announced today that Syria will make more efforts to create
appropriate climate to attract domestic, expatriate, Arab and
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint meeting presidents and secretaries general
of Arab and foreign chambers of commerce, Zouebi promised to take
necessary measures to encourage capitalists to invest in Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said political and social stability in the country ever
since the correction movement in 1970, as well as the prevailing
security and safety, have helped Syrian economy to achieve positive
results.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi pointed out that Syria will endeavour to extend further
facilities to augment and diversify exports, and will ensure the
production of high quality goods with competitive prices that will
enable the flow of Syrian commodities and products into world
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian premier also highlighted the importance of
activating Euro-Arab dialogue in search of formulas that would
enchance economic, trade and technical cooperation that would
serve their common interests.
</P>
<P>
Syria enacted in 1991 an Investment Law aimed at wooing capital
in new investment ventures that would meet the country's needs for
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The number of projects implemented under this law reached 1,494
by the end of 1996 with investments totaling 363 billion Syrian
pound (about 8.4 billion U.S. dollar). These projects have created
over 100,000 job opportunities for the country.

<HEADLINE> Levy Boycotts Netanyahu-Albright Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy today decided to boycott Thursday's meeting between
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
This was to protest the Cabinet's failure to map out a further
troop redeployment in the West Bank and guidelines for the
impending Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the decision after today's Cabinet session failed,
for the third time in a week, to make a substantive decision on
the two issues that are to feature the Netanyahu-Albright talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had invited Levy, a moderate within the rightwing
coalition who favors advancing the peace process, to accompany
him at his meeting with Albright in Paris Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Levy criticized the cabinet for failing to give Netanyahu "any
freedom of movement" in his talks with Albright. He warned that
Netanyahu could not go empty-handed to see Albright.
</P>
<P>
The wide divisions between moderates and hard-liners
incapacitated the government from reaching a final decision on the
redeployment and permanent talks after a series of marathon
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Levy said earlier that the government should at least decide on
the percentage of the second-stage pullback in order to win
diplomatic points to ease the international isolation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will present Albright the Israeli general national
interests when they meet in Paris rather than give a specific
percentage of the second-stage pullback and the areas that Israel
will retain control in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's cabinet meeting, Netanyahu stressed that
he would tell Albright the need to preserve the Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and their "breathing space."
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to present Albright a document outlining
the Palestinian National Authority's (PNA's) obligations
unfulfilled under the Note for Record accompanying the Hebron
accord signed last January. At the cabinet meeting, all ministers
were given a draft document of the PNA's obligations, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
A final decision by the cabinet was not expected before
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
The major differences centered on the two maps drawn by
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and the hawkish National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon proposed creating a 10-15 kilometer security zone east
of the Green Line - the 1949 armistice line - to divide Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas, and another 20 kilometer zone
along the Jordan Valley. He also called for retaining control over
the water sources and all Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharon's proposal, Israel will maintain control over 70
percent of the West Bank in the final settlement. His plan was
supported by Science Minister Michael Eitan, Agriculture Minister
Rafael Eitan, Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, and
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu, together with David Levy, was reported to favor
the plan proposed by Mordechai, who recommended narrowing the
width of the two security zones to three to six kilometers and
seven to 10 kilometers respectively. Under Mordechai's proposal,
Israel will retain control over 50-55 percent of the territories
of the West Bank in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai and Levy insisted that Israel's holding on to less
territories would help promote the chance of advancing the peace
process. Both favored earlier withdrawal in order to win
diplomatic points for Israel to get out the international
isolation caused by the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio has said that Netanyahu is gaining understanding
from the United States that he needs more time to delay the
second-stage redeployment until mid-January after winning the
Knesset (Parliament) approval of the 1998 Budget, which is facing
strong opposition from both the ruling and opposition camps due to
massive budgetary cuts.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has to rely on the rightwing parties' support to get
the budget through the Knesset at the end of the month, otherwise
his government will fall. If he pushes hard now for the approval
of the controversial redeployment, the rightists will take
advantage of the budget vote to pressure Netanyahu to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Labor party said it believed that
Netanyahu had in fact decided to withdraw troops from 12 percent
of West Bank in the second-phase redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Labor's coordinator of reaction in the Knesset Dalia Itzik
said Netanyahu only refrained from committing himself to any
percentage of the second-phase redeployment at the stage to
prevent rightist hard-liners from voting against the budget.
</P>
<P>
Some settler leaders and the rightwing lawmakers have
threatened to topple the government over the redeployment. But
Labor and the coalition party The Third Way have signed an
agreement to provide security net for the government if it
carries out a serious redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola to Invest in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd. said
it will pour 400 million dollars (280 million U.S. Dollars) into
capital investments in Canada over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The money will be spent on infrastructure -- such as trucks,
vending machines and distributing centers -- to reach customers
and get them to drink more Coke, according to today's Financial
Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The company makes about 95 percent of Coke's soft drinks in
Canada, including Sprite, Barq's root beer, Minute Maid fruit
juices and Fruitopia iced teas.
</P>
<P>
The latest move is seen as another step to win back sales lost
to other beverages makers like Cott Corp.
</P>
<P>
Part of Coke's new strategy in Canada will be to focus on
people who don't drink regularly by making it more accessible.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Warns of German "Infection" of Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank warned
Wednesday that the serious financial turmoil in Asia could
undermine the economy upswing now underway in Germany.
</P>
<P>
In its December economic report issued Wednesday, the
Bundesbank noted that although the recent Asian financial crisis
has not affected Germany's exports so far, it could pose "an
infection danger" for other countries and thus undermining the
world economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"This would in turn put a damper on the German export chances,"
said the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the Bundesbank saw a positive outlook for
the German economy, mainly thanks to the continued export boom
which is boosted by improved competitiveness of German companies
and a favorable German mark exchange rate against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Germany's exports in the third quarter of
this year expanded by a real 14 percent from the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
With imports growing more slowly and the traditional high trade
deficits in the services sector remaining stable, Germany's
current account balance has once again swung back to surpluses
after "virtually uninterrupted deficits since the 1990 German
reunification", the Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
Germany's current account surpluses, which include trade both
in goods and services, were 2.3 billion marks (1.3 billion
dollars) in the second quarter and 5.0 billion marks (2.8 billion
dollars) in the third quarter, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that the consistantly declining unit labour
costs in Germany since 1996, combined with the favorable
development of foreign exchange rates, have apparently enabled
German companies to improve their international competitiveness
and regain their lost markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to booming exports, western German factories achieved an
average capacity utilization rate of 86 percent in October, higher
than the 83.3 percent in the United States, 84.7 percent in France
and 77.8 percent in Britain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to export, Germany's domestic demand still
remains sluggish, resulting from a general consumers' worry about
the security of their jobs, the Bundesbank said. Germany is now
plagued by a post-war record jobless level of about 4.3 million,
or more than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while the western German economy continuing to
expand, the economic outlook for the eastern half of the country
remaind bleak, mainly due to its sluggish construction sector and
its minimal share in the country's export boom, the Bundesbank
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, eastern Germany will face further job cuts while
unemployment in western Germany appears to touch bottom, said the
Bundesbank.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves New Loans for Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) has extended loans totalling 78.1 million U.S. dollars to
the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and the Posts
and Telecommunication Corporation (PTC), ADB said in a statement
today.
</P>
<P>
The 48.06 million U.S. dollars approved for ZESA would help
finance an electrification project in Harare which is expected to
benefit 15,000 new consumers.
</P>
<P>
The project, electricity III project, is meant to ensure
adequate and reliable supply of electrical power to various
sectors of economy in the capital city and promote economic
development as well as improve the quality of people's life.
</P>
<P>
The ADB also approved a loan of 30.04 million dollars to
finance the telecommunications III project in Zimbabwe. The
project formed part of an integrated development and upgrading
program of the PTC, which aims at increasing the availability,
coverage, quality and efficiency of telephone, data services and
television broadcasting in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The project was expected to commence in January next year and
would take two and a half years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The ADB started its operations in Zimbabwe in 1982 and to date
its commitments in the country add up to 698.69 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Income Gap Widens in U.S.: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The income gap between the
rich and the poor has widened in the United States in recent years
and New York has shown the highest gap among the country's 50
states, the New Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the wealthiest 20 percent of families and the
poorest 20 percent grew over the last decade in 37 states
representing a combined population of 87 percent of the country,
the paper quoted a study report of a Washington-based research
center as saying.
</P>
<P>
The growing U.S. economy has produced vast benefits for the
wealthiest but done little to improve the income of the poorest
and lower middle-income earners, the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities has found.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1996, the top 20 percent of families in New York
State earned an average of 132,399 U.S. dollars a year, against
the 6,787 dollars for the bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 19.5 to 1 ratio, well above the nation's 12.7 to 1, or
117,499 dollars vs. 9,254 dollars, was the largest for any state.
</P>
<P>
New York was the only state whose 20 percent of families
recorded over 50 percent of all the income earned in the state.
</P>
<P>
The report said the statistics are incomplete as it did not
cover salaries surpassing 100,000 dollars and capital gains earned
primarily by those who are fairly well off.
</P>
<P>
The study attributes the widening gap to the increase of
high-end income professions such as those working in the financial
industry, lawyers, doctors and computer people and the decline of
low-skilled jobs like manufacturing and construction.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not Fit for EU Membership: German Institutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Three leading German economic
research institutes Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a
European Union membership for Russia in the near future, saying
that the country's current economic conditions still keep it far
behind that goal.
</P>
<P>
Whether it is possible for Russia to achieve a medium- or
long-term integration with western Europe would first of all
depend on the country itself, said the institutes in a joint
report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assessment by the German institutes came after calls made
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin
for EU consideration of a possible membership for Russia.
</P>
<P>
According to prejections made by the German institutes, the
Russian economy would at best expect a stagnation this year,
mainly due to its failure to achieve major progress in economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The economic outlook for 1998 is a little bit more optimistic
for Russia, with gross domestic product expected to grow by two to
three percent provided that the Asian financial turmoil remain a
temporary phenomenon, said the institutes.
</P>
<P>
But they also suggested that the establishment of a free trade
zone between Russia and the EU "could send an importance signal
for the future integration of Russia in the world economy".
</P>
<P>
The three German institutes are: German Institute for Economic
Research (DIW) in Berlin, the Kiel Institute for World Economy,
and the Institute for Economic Research in Halle.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Sales to Decrease in Zimbabwe This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Lower yields and prices
coupled with higher tax have affected the 1997 grower returns
from tobacco, the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) said today
in its yearly review on tobacco trends.
</P>
<P>
The gross value of sales this year stood at 4.9 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars (about 306 million U.S. dollars), 15 percent
lower than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The five percent levy on both buyers and sellers was estimated
to have cost the industry 497 million Zimbabwe Dollars (31.1
million U.S. dollars) compared with 429 million Zimbabwe Dollars
(about 42.9 U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The period under review also saw a decline of nearly 17
percent in flue-cured exports compared to the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997/98 season indications show that close to 92,000
hectares of tobacco will be planted.
</P>
<P>
With a return to normal yields, 225 million to 230 million
kilograms of crops should be achieved nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.

HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president
Kenneth Kaunda, who is back in Zimbabwe from Malawi, today said
he is not in exile and plans to go back home soon despite threats
of arrest in connection with last October's failed coup to which
the opposition has been linked, the Zimbabwe News Agency ZIANA
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am not in exile. I am visiting my son and two daughters
here. I may have Christmas here but I am certainly going back
home soon. Chiluba (Zambian president) will not stop me from
going home," Kaunda told ZIANA as he played golf at the police
grounds in Harare.
</P>
<P>
But Kaunda supporters say Kaunda risks being locked up by the
government of president Frederick Chiluba under the state of
emergency regulations introduced following the coup attempt by
dissident junior army officers.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's own United National Independence Party has advised
him against returning.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, whose government has
allowed Kaunda to stay for as long as is necessary, and South
African president Nelson Mandela have unsuccessfully appealed to
Chiluba to guarantee Kaunda's safety, ZIANA reported.

<HEADLINE> Kinshasa Requests Extradition of Former Zairean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo has applied for the extradition
of three former Zairean generals arrested in South Africa last
Saturday, South African police said today.
</P>
<P>
Investigating officer Thethiwe Ntjana said she had received a
letter earlier today from Congo's embassy in Pretoria, asking for
the generals to be handed over to stand trial in their home
country, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"I had arranged a meeting with embassy officials for today,
but they never showed up," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ntjana said her investigation had to be finalized before a
decision on extradition could be made.
</P>
<P>
The three former generals of Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
-- Mavua Madima, Kpama Baramoto, and Ngbane Nzimbi -- were
arrested at the Rand Airport near Johannesburg following an
extensive South African investigation into their activities.
</P>
<P>
There are allegations that they planned to overthrow the new

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Orders Former Nazi Guard Deported to Slovakia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal immigration
judge has ordered a former Nazi guard deported from the United
States to his homeland, Slovakia, said reports reaching here from
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Johann Breyer, 72, a retired tool and die maker, was found once
serving as a guard at Auschwitz and Buchenwald Nazi camps during
World War II, an Associated Press report today quoted the Justice
Department as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Breyer's involvement with the Waffen-SS service made him a
member of a movement hostile to the United States, rendering him
ineligible to emigrate to this country, U.S. Immigration Judge
Craig DeBernardis ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
Breyer admitted in 1991 that he served as an armed perimeter
guard at both camps _ with orders to shoot escaping prisoners _
and escorted slave laborers to work sites.
</P>
<P>
He said he served involuntarily with the Death's Head Battalion
and denied he was a Nazi, adding he never abused prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Breyer was stripped of his citizenship in 1993 and deportation
proceedings were launched in January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. immigration authorities have stripped 60 former Nazis
of U.S. citizenship, removed 48 from the country while about 300
remain under investigation. Endite

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Assistance for 3 African Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Tuesday three credits and a loan totaling 123.3 million
U.S. dollars equivalent to Egypt, Eritrea and Guinea for their
development projects.
</P>
<P>
A credit of some 15 million dollars and a loan of 20 million
dollars are earmarked for Egypt's Pollution Abatement Project.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of this pilot project are to strengthen the
monitoring and enforcement capabilities of the environmental
institutions and establish technical and financial mechanisms for
pollution abatement investments in Greater Cairo, Alexandria, and
the two Suez Canal cities of Suez and Ismailia.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of some 18.3 million dollars will be used for
Eritrea health project.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to contribute to reductions in infant
and under-five mortality rates, maternal mortality ratio, and
total fertility rate as well as prevalence rates of malnutrition
in women and in under-five children, tuberculosis, malaria and
some other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Third credit of some 70 million dollars equivalent is provided
to help Guinea's public expenditure management adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The project is an integral part of the World Bank's strategy to
help Guinea ensure financial sustainability and improve public
service effectiveness in sectors which benefit the majority of the
poor. Another objective is to help this west African country
overhaul the whole management of its budget as a serious first
step towards improving governance.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending wing for developing countries.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake with a

Island in the Aleutian Island chain off the coast of Alaska
Tuesday night, the United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Paul Whitmore of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer,

Tuesday night (0339 GMT Wednesday). The epicenter of the quake was
about 320 kilometers southwest of Adak Island.

Because it happened in a remote area, there were no reports of
damage or injuries.

<HEADLINE> EU to Treat China, Russia as Market Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
announced that it has proposed to remove the label of "non-market
economy" as applied to China and Russia in EU anti-dumping policy.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made during Tuesday's commission meeting held
at Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The move updated the EU executive's anti-dumping rules which
protect the 15-nation union against unfair pricing of imports.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that with the substantial advances toward a
market economy in both China and Russia, the present EU
anti-dumping rules which stemmed from the 1950s need to be
modified.
</P>
<P>
The new rules recognize both countries' efforts to transform
their economies by allowing domestic price information to be used
in cases where existence of market economy conditions can be
verified.
</P>
<P>
The commission also proposed to show flexibility by allowing
decisions on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
In each case, Chinese and Russian exporters are obliged to show
that they operate in genuine market economy conditions.
</P>
<P>
European Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said: "The
purpose of this proposal is to introduce specific adjustments to
EU anti-dumping practice based on an objective assessment of
existing economic conditions in Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
"Changes have already been introduced for the countries of
central and eastern Europe. This proposal does nothing to weaken
our anti-dumping instrument. Rather it recognizes that with the
substantial advances toward a market economy, the situation on the
ground (in China and Russia) has changed and our policy should
reflect that."
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, unlike its predecessor that was based
anti-dumping calculation on prices and costs in a comparable third
country, will resort to domestic price information where it can
clearly show that market conditions prevail, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are both important trading partners for the
EU. The volume of EU trade with these two countries has increased
rapidly over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, only 1 percent of imports from China and Russia was
affected by anti-dumping measures, according to EU figures.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Support for Monarchy Plummets: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The support for the British
monarchy among Canadians has reached an all-time low, according to
a new poll published today.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 80 percent of Canadians hold little
attachment to the monarchy, and only 18 percent oppose replacing
British Queen Elizabeth with a Canadian head of state.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 41 percent wanted the monarchy abolished outright
and 39 percent were indifferent.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows the lowest support for the monarchy ever
recorded in a poll in Canada, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
An Angus Reid poll in early 1996 indicated that Canadians
evenly split on the issue of whether to keep or scrap ties with
the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
It showed that a majority wanted to retain the monarchy outside
the French-speaking Quebec province.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll showed that support in English-speaking Canada
has eroded: 32 percent favor scrapping the monarchy, 45 percent
don't care and only 21 percent support it.
</P>
<P>
In Quebec, a strong 70 percent favor the abolition of the
monarchy, while 18 percent said they are indifferent and only 7
percent still support it.
</P>
<P>
The poll surveyed 1,410 adults across the country between
November 28 and December 2.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects Positive Results from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government expects
some kind of positive outcome from Friday's meeting between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Turkey's Premier Mesut Yilmaz, a
government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides said
"we anticipate some results as the U.S. President's comments on
Cyprus were crystal clear. He reiterated his resolve to contribute
to a settlement of the protracted Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Cyprus government shared the
U.S. President's view that economic growth and prosperity should
not be impeded by other differences between states.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told a press conference Tuesday that he want a
resolution of the Cyprus issue "very badly".
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a grave error for Greece and Turkey to
allow the potential they have for future economic growth and
political and security cooperation to be broken on differences
over Cyprus and other territorial disputes in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Christofides also welcomed recent statements by some world
leaders who refuted Turkish threats to integrate Cyprus' northern
part with Turkey, following a European Union decision which
excludes Turkey from the enlargement process and reaffirms
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus and Greece are monitoring the developments and we are
ready to deal with all eventualities in a cool and responsible
manner," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Trade Union Calls for Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Trade
Union for Agricultural, Animal Husbandry and Forestry Workers
(SINTAF) has accused the government of inaction when some private
entrepreneurs fail to keep their promises on transferring the
companies.
</P>
<P>
SINTAF have 340 registered enterprises in the country with
over 64,000 workers, 14,000 of whom lost their jobs in the
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambique News Agency, Eusebio Chivulele,
general secretary for SINTAF revealed here today that about 50
percent of the organization's enterprises could not operate
normally after privatization.
</P>
<P>
The main problem, he said, is the lack of capital and
managerial skills on the part of the new entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new heads for the enterprises resort to sacking
the workers as a way to solve difficulties facing the companies,
said Chivulele, adding that some even start to sell equipment,
which is in violation of the agreement on enterprise transfer.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to interfere in some enterprises which
are on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if no measures are taken by the government in
this regard, SINTAF might organize a peace demonstration and
demand a better explanation from the National Commission for the
Appraisal and Transfer of Enterprises on workers' difficulties as
a result of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said Monday in the
parliament that the country's large-scale enterprises will be
privatized by next year.
</P>
<P>
By early this December, 864 out of the total 1,254 enterprises
have been privatised in Mozambique since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Seven Iraqi Diplomats Expelled by Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven Iraqi diplomats left here
today for home, a week after Jordan made the decision to expel
them in response to Iraq's execution of four Jordanians on charge
of smuggling car parts.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was apparently annoyed by the Iraq's December 8
execution. Officials claimed that Iraq had not informed Jordan on
the trial of the Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued shortly after the execution
insisted that the accused should be punished with only fine or
prison term for what they did, namely, smuggling car parts worth
878 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, Jordan decided to reduce the number of Iraqi
diplomats in the embassy in Amman from 15 to eight. The seven
diplomats were told to leave in a week.
</P>
<P>
Amid wide accusations from the kingdom, Iraqi Vice President
Yassin Ramadan promised to secure the release of 140 Jordanian
prisoners jailed in Iraq on Jordan's demand.
</P>
<P>
Later, Iraq declared that it commuted the death sentence of the
fifth Jordanian charged of smuggling car spare parts.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Jordan confirmed that the Iraqi authority on
December 10 executed another Jordanian on charge of murder.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein expressed perplexity over Iraq's contradictory
moves. Speaking at a ceremony today marking the arrival of four
U.S. F-16 jet fighters as aid for the kingdom in Azraq, some 80
kilometers southeast of Amman, the king said he could not
understand the Iraqi authority.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
1990-91 Gulf Crisis. But after that, bilateral ties suffered
setbacks as Jordan tried to distance itself from Iraq to end
international alienation.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties hit the lowest level in 1995 when Hussein agreed
to grant asylum to top Iraqi defectors. In 1996, Jordan expelled
three Iraqi diplomats on charge of espionage. The current
expulsion was the second in history.
</P>
<P>
However, the relations picked up recently as Iraq began to
provide the kingdom with more oil at discount prices and kept
increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq piped to Jordan oil worth 625 million dollars this year, a
7 percent increase from 1996, and the two sides have been
discussing ways to increase Iraqi oil supply to the kingdom in
1998.

LAGOS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- About 23 million Nigerians, or
roughly 20 percent of the population in the west African country
is now under severe threat of erosion and desert encroachment,
the official News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>

This represents about 16.6 percent of Nigeria's land
territory.

<P>
According to him, Nigeria has serious desert encroachment in
the northern part while erosion is now eating up most of its
states in the east.
</P>
<P>
Adegoroye noted that Nigeria has achieved a 60 percent
reduction of lead in gasoline in line with the requirement of the
Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances.
</P>
<P>
But he also regretted that 28 percent of gases flared
worldwide was carried out in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Adegoroye called for a comprehensive approach to tackle the
environment problems, rather than placing emphasis on engineering
solutions.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Iran to Restore Ambassadorial Level Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain and Iran will
soon restore their diplomatic representation to ambassadorial level,
Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Muhammad Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was making the remarks in an interview with local
Kuwait News Agency on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting
of the Gulf Cooperation Council states which concluded here
earlier today after completing preparations for the forthcoming
GCC summit in Kuwaiti Bayan Palace.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini government recalled its ambassador from Tehran and
ordered the Iranian ambassador to leave the country in 1996 after
accusing Iran of supporting subversive activities in Bahrain
against the government. Iran denied the charges and said it was
not involved in anti-government unrest in Bahrain which started in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "we decided to raise to ambassadorial
level the already-existing diplomatic representation between the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The latest talks we held with Iran were serious and we
reached agreement on some steps to boost cooperation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the results of the Eighth Summit of the Organization
of Islamic Conference held in Tehran last week "gave a boost to
joint Islamic action."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates
Rashed Abdullah Al-Nuaimi said here that his country sought
immediate start of negotiations to end the problem of Greater
and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Moussa islands which are occupied
by Iran but also claimed by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
He said "there are new political indications from Iran and
we hope they would be reassuring. We will react to all
these indications and will work on materializing them."
</P>
<P>
The latest summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference
in Tehran reflected an optimism in the UAE and among the GCC
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
All the GCC states, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Bahrain,
Qatar and Oman, sent delegations to the meeting in Tehran
which was seen as a favorable chance for pushing forward the
process of improving bilateral ties between the GCC as a
whole on one side and Iran on the other.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Iran and the Gulf Arab states
have been warming up since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Relations with Iran are expected to be one of the most
important issues to be dealt with at the GCC summit to be
held here from 22 to 24 this month.

BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz again refused access of U.N. weapons inspectors to
presidential palaces that arms experts doubted as covers for
Iraq's biological and chemical weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
The presidential sites are not related to the business of

He said the issue of presidential sites "has been used

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge today
ordered Cuba to pay nearly 185 million U.S. dollars to the
families of three Americans killed last year when Cuban jets shot
down two small private planes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King, ruling in a damage
lawsuit filed by the victims' families, said the Cuban government
should pay 49.9 million U.S. dollars in compensatory damages while
its air force should pay 134.7 million U.S. dollars in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
On February 24, 1996, the three men were shot from the sky by
Cuban fighters. The Cuban government insisted that the planes had
entered the Cuban territorial sky.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, the U.S. approved the Helms-Burton Law
to tighten its economic and trade blockade against Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Romania Wishes to Join NATO by 2001, EU by 2005,  President Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- President Emil Constantinescu of
Romania said here today that his country wishes to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by the year 2001 and will seek
admission into the European Union (EU) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake not to include Romania in the first-wave
enlargement of NATO," said Constantinescu one day after NATO
foreign ministers signed documents in Brussels formally inviting
the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland as the first group of
eastern European countries to join the 16-member western military
alliance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the end of a visit to Bonn,
Constantinescu said he now expected NATO to start talks on
Romania's membership in 1999 and to admit the country as a full
member in 2001, one year after the presidential elections of the
United States in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Romania has also been excluded from the first group of mainly
eastern European countries with which the EU would begin
membership negotiations early next year.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made by the EU leaders during their Luxembourg
summit last weekend, Romania and other four nations were placed on
a slower negotiating track to enable them to make further efforts
to meet entry conditions. However, no date has been set for their
membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said today that it would take Romania six to
seven years to make the grade for the EU entry, and therefore the
year 2005 could be a "reasonable" date for a final admission of
his country into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu already met German President Roman Herzog and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday. Both German leaders have
expressed support for Romania's bid to join the NATO and EU.
Constantinescu will continue his German visit in Munich and
Hamburg.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vows to Continue Resisting Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
today said that national resistance to Israeli troops is sacred
and will continue as long as a span of the country's territory is
held in Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi made the remark when meeting delegates from the
Association of Arab News Agencies, which is holding its 25th
session here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he had told the United States Assistant
Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs Matin Indyk, who left
Lebanon for home Tuesday night after a Middle East tour, that
Lebanon will be the last Arab country to sign peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon holds the same position as Syria in the process of
seeking a just, comprehensive and last peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
The current work for Arabs should be shifted from making
speeches and shouting slogans to implementing what has been
decided in their interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Arab power can be reflected through cooperation, not
separation, and Arab countries are capable of becoming the third
polar in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to abide by the United Nations Resolution
425 and withdraw its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I have told U.S. President Bill Clinton that Lebanon does not
like to gain humanitarian aid from his country, but (Lebanon
needs) political support of the implementation of the Resolution
425," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Israeli troops are occupying a self-styled
security zone of 1,200 square kilometers in south Lebanon with the
declared aim of preventing Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks on residents in northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Gold Volume Cleared in London Remains High in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The volume of gold
cleared in London last month stood at an average of 40.8
million ounces each day, near the record set in October,
according to figures from the London Bullion Market Association.
</P>
<P>
The amount of gold cleared each day last month in London,
worth 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, was less than the record of
42 million ounces, worth 13.6 billion dollars, established
in October.
</P>
<P>
The association said that in October producers rushed
to hedge their gold output as the price of gold fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
However, November's volume was still 31 percent higher
over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The association's chief executive Chris Elston said
that although there was perhaps less forward activity last
month in the gold market than in October, physical demand
remained strong and the speculative side was still active.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, last month's silver daily turnover was 327.9
million ounces, worth 1.7 billion dollars, less than the
average of 345.5 million ounces recorded in October, which
was also worth 1.7 billion dollars due to the price rise of
silver in November.

<HEADLINE> German Telecom Announces Big Cuts in Telephone Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's still state-run telecom
company, the Deutsche Telekom, today announced big cuts in its
telephone charges in preparation for heated private competition
after the liberalization of the country's telecom market from
1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the tariff-reduction package announced by company leader
Ron Sommer today, the Deutsche Telekom would cut its international
phone call charges by up to 45 percent beginning next March.
</P>
<P>
Major cuts would also be made in domestic long-distance calls
lasting more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the starting signal for a to-be-continued service
offensive of the Deutsche Telekom," Sommer said, indicating that
the company would offer further tariff reductions as well as
product innovations in the course of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Telekom is currently under huge pressure from
private telecom operators which will be allowed to compete with
the state-run company up from January 1 next year when the German
telecom market is due to be finally liberalized.
</P>
<P>
In a relevant development, Germany today also formally
dismantle its 125-year-old ministry for post and
telecommunications as part of the government's deregulation
policy.
</P>
<P>
A new regulatory agency will be created under the German
economics ministry to ensure fair and free competition in the
country's liberalized post and telecom market.
</P>
<P>
"The beginning of a new era for post and telecommunications is
an important and internationally recognized signal that Germany is
setting out for the 21st century," said German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in a ceremony in Bonn today marking the end of the post and
telecom ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is expected to delay tough deportation rules covering some 20,000
Haitians who fled the military regime that was forced from power
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"They're still exploring different ways to address this issue,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the concern of the administration is well known but
there is not at this point any decision on how to proceed on the
issue," He said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will grant protection to the Haitians through a rarely
used executive authority, providing "the legal basis for the
temporary stay for these individuals," an Associated Press (AP)
quoted a senor administration official as saying.
</P>
<P>
That will allow them to remain in the United States for at
least a year. The decision will be announced by Clinton within the
next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
With U.N. peacekeeping forces withdrawing from Haiti,
administration officials argued that sending thousands of Haitians
back home would destabilize an already fragile government.
</P>
<P>
The Haitians were not included in legislation exempting
hundreds of thousands of refugees from civil wars in Nicaragua and
El Salvador from deportation rules under a strict immigration law
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Privatize More, Retain Strategic Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Showing its seriousness towards
privatization, Egypt said today it will speed up the economic
restructuring program by selling at least 56 public sector
companies next year.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that Egypt is fully committed to the acceleration
of privatization," Egyptian Minister of Public Business Sector
Atef Hohamed Ebeid told reporters today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The 56 companies in the fields of industry, import and export,
investment and consultancy will be privatized by selling either on
stock markets or to individual investors, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Egypt plans to sell some of state-owned hotels and
tourism facilities valued at 6 billion Egyptian pounds (about 1.76
billion U.S. dollars) in January 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started its privatization drive in 1991 with the support
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under a 1996 agreement
with the IMF, Egypt pledged to restructure 500 or so of its
state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
So far, 82 out of 314 state-owned companies on the ministry's
list of privatization have either been liquidated or sold to
private sectors and individuals on the stock market, according to
Ebeid.
</P>
<P>
"The (privatization) of the rest is just a matter of time,"
depending on the response of investors and the appetite of the
market, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the Suez Canal and Aswan High Dam are "files
closed" to foreign partners, and made it clear the state will
control the majority of such strategic industries like the oil
sector, pharmaceutical companies and flour mills.

<HEADLINE> Lagos to Offer Free Treatment of Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaria patients in Lagos, the
largest metropolis of Nigeria, may no longer be worried about their
lack of money for treatment as they will be treated free in state
government hospitals beginning January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Blood test for malaria parasites will equally be free, the Nigerian
television authority reported today, quoting state administrator
Mohammed Marwa.
</P>
<P>
Marwa disclosed this while announcing the establishment of Sani
Abacha Center for malaria research here with an aim to discover,
either by its own or by joint efforts, the most effective
treatment for malaria by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a take-off grant of one million U.S. Dollars to
the center and a cumulative budgetary provision of at least 10 million
dollars spread evenly over a period of 13 years beginning next year
for the funding of research in the production of malaria vaccine.
</P>
<P>
To support the funding effort, Marwa said tht all contracts entered
into with the state government as from January 1998 would attract a
one-percent levy payable to the center.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has remained the country's number one killer disease, which
is responsible for the death of 200,000-300,000 Nigerian children
annually.
</P>
<P>
The disease was more prevalent in Lagos as a result of its high
population, the administrator noted.
</P>
<P>
The population of Lagos is estimated at around 10 million. Of the
total, about 91 and 90 percent of the urban and rural dwellers are
living below poverty line respectively, a report on the socio-economic
problems of the state revealed.
</P>
<P>
The report, the result of a nine-month study which was submitted to
the state government Tuesday, attributed the poverty trend to
"inadequacy in government policies and programs".
</P>
<P>
The study was initiated to work out the state's long-term
socio-economic development blueprint to guide in the determination of
policy direction and choice of programs to improve the living
conditions of the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An Inter-Party Committee
(IPC) was formed today to formulate guidelines for the
state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) on how to allocate
air time to all the registered political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The IPC standing committee comprises representatives of
registered political parties, the Electoral Commission and KBC,
according to minutes of a consultative meeting held here today
between the Electoral Commission and representatives of
registered political parties.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants raised their views in support of
equitable air time, balanced reporting and allocation of free
air time to all registered political parties in the East African
country.
</P>
<P>
The minutes said that the registered political parties were
requested to appoint a representative each for a meeting to draft
guidelines for the KBC during the electioneering period.
</P>
<P>
Under a new law effective from last month, the KBC is required
to keep a fair balance in covering any presidential,
parliamentary or local government elections, allocate free
air time to registered political parties participating in the
elections to expound their policies.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting appealed at the meeting to all political parties to
have their own public address system as the KBC does not have an
adequate supply.
</P>
<P>
With regard to equal air time, the Permanent Secretary said
that with the registered political parties standing at 24, it
may not be possible to have equal air time but equitable air time.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Urges to Build More Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today called for more new infrastructure, and new housing and
shopping center schemes.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when unveiling of corner stone for the Manda
Hill Shopping Center.
</P>
<P>
He said "I am aware that a number of rehabilitation projects are
currently going on as an effort to restore the run-down
infrastructure. commendable as these efforts are, we cannot stop at
mere rehabilitating infrastructure. We need to constantly break new
ground."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged professionals in urban development, town planners,
architects, engineers and others to be more forthcoming in
their professions.
</P>
<P>
He also called on district councils to redouble their efforts to
ensure that cities, towns and villages develop in well managed manner.
</P>
<P>
He urged foreign entrepreneurs to come and invest in his country,
saying that "We have provided the necessary enabling environment for
investment in Zambia."
</P>
<P>
Developments such as this shopping centre are common place and they
are essential and convenient to the people because one-stop shopping
centers not only provide a greater choice of goods under one roof but
also cut down on travel time and create savings in fuel, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Those of us who have had the opportunity of visiting other
countries, are aware that most of their town and cities are generally
beautiful and pleasant to live in because of facilities such as
beautiful shopping malls like the one whose construction I am
commissioning today."
</P>
<P>
"This type of development is not beyond us in Zambia. We can, with
proper planning, good workmanship and proper enforcement recapture the
vision of making Lusaka the garden city that it was meant to be," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said some flyover bridges will soon be constructed
around the capital city to make it safe for shoppers and other
pedestrians.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Nurse Charged of Murder to Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A 25-year-old nurse accused of
premediated murder of a patient and attempted killing of 29 others
in a hospital in Alexandria, Egypt's second largest city, will be
tried, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Aida Noureddin Mohamed was arrested in August on suspicion of
murdering patients at a public hospital in Alexandria over a
six-month period. But the nurse denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
She is also accused of stealing toxic medicines which she
administered to the patients under intensive care in the brain and
nerve center where she worked.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations in the past four months have linked the
mysterious deaths of dozens of intensive care unit (ICU) patients
in the hospital to the nurse.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that the accused was seeking revenge on
her ex-lover, a doctor in the same hospital, by killing patients
under his care.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that if convicted by the Criminal Court of
Alexandria, Noureddin could face the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Women Dropouts Plague Ethiopia's College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Female students dominate
those who interrupt their education from Ethiopia's Kotebe
College of Teachers Education due to various reasons, a
psychology instructor in the college said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency, At a
symposium organized with a view to look for a solution for the
cultural, psychological and academic problems faced by women,
instructor Semira Al-Hadj said women students are still far
behind in building their self confidence.
</P>
<P>
She said, women seemed to be unable to properly attend their
education due to a feeling of inferiority caused by various
environmental and cultural influences.
</P>
<P>
The participation of women in class activities is very low and
they seem Ato be fearful and shy, Semira said, adding that
consequently they would score very low results.
</P>
<P>
Another instructor, Taitu Ali, said some women students
believe that their comprehension is less than that of men. With
such understanding they turn to men in need of some help, but
would unfortunately be subjected to seduction, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said many such cases have been reported by women students.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the symposium, the head of women affairs
department with the Ministry of Education, Yelfign Worku, said in
order to resolve the problems faced by women students, the
readiness and initiative should first come from the women
themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the head, women should realize the existence of
the problems and are expected to fight it and come out as
winners. In this respect they would be provided with all the
necessary assistance, she added.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian's inter-party dialogue will
be held on schedule even if some parties fail to confirm their
attendance by Thursday, the country's ruling party said here today.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Sata, Ntional Secretary of the ruling Movement for the
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and government minister without portfolio,
told a news briefing that out of 31 parties which attended the
preliminary meeting early last week and drew an agenda for the
inter-party dialog to be held on January 10 next year, 17 parties
have confirmed their attendance.
</P>
<P>
Sata, who was co-chairman of the preliminary meeting, said most
major political parties have been among the 17 parties including the
United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president
Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Sata said it was wrong that some parties were sending complete
lists of delegates to attend the talks because the talks are not
for party cadres but for the leadership.

They started visiting the sensitive sites in March 1996 and

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz again refused access of U.N. weapons inspectors to
presidential palaces that arms experts doubted as covers for
Iraq's biological and chemical weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
The presidential sites are not related to the business of
disarmament and they are not within the mandate of UNSCOM - the
United Nations Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, Aziz told a press conference this
evening.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of presidential sites "has been used
specially by the Americans as a pretext to dramatize the
situation" and use that drama in order to prepare a military
aggression against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> US Industrialists Warn Britain on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. manufacturers with large
production sites in Britain have warned that they would reconsider
their investment strategies in Britain if London remained outside
of the European Monetary Union (EMU) indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
This group of American industrialists, who employ some 10,000
people in Britain at more than 30 plants, were quoted by today's
Financial Times as saying if Britain remained outside the single
currency for the foreseeable future, their investments in Europe
would tend to favor countries, which would sign up to the euro.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason to do so, they noted that the absence of
currency risks in euro countries would make the trading of parts
and finished goods easier.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Rosso, Chairman of Case, the world's big four
tractor makers, said that if Britain failed to join the EMU in the
early stages of next decade, "this would be negative from an
investment point of view."
</P>
<P>
"The temptation would be to favor the euro zone in investment,"
Rosso said.
</P>
<P>
Bill Hudson, Chairman of AMP, the world's biggest electronic
connectors, said the rise in sterling over the past year had
contributed to his company's decision early this year to close
some operations in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hudson made it clear that the sterling staying outside the
single currency would involve further "risks" to AMP increasing
its British investments.
</P>
<P>
Other American industrialists also expressed similar concerns
and called on the British government to reconsider its EMU policy.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government announced in late October that
Britain would not sign up to the single currency over the next
five years.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Set up Crisis-Prevention Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders today agreed in
principle to set up a permanent mechanism for conflict prevention,
management, resolution and peace keeping in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders therefore directed their Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
Internal Affairs and Defense to examine the modalities for the
establishment of the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of a one-day extraordinary summit of heads
of state from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
convened in Lome, capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary summit was attended by 12 heads of state, with
the absence of the ECOWAS executive chairman, Nigeria's head of state
general Sani Abacha, on ground of ill health.
</P>
<P>
The summit was earlier expected to dwell on the slow pace of peace
process in Sierra Leone and the future of the sub-regional
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
But neither issue was mentioned in the communique though the summit
was said to be proceeding "very smoothly".
</P>
<P>
However, according to sources, the ECOWAS committee of five will be
meeting next week in Abidjan, Cote D'ivoire in a bid to resolve the
impasse in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising Foreign Ministers from Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea, Cote D'ivoire and Liberia, is mandated by ECOWAS to deal with
the Sierra Leonean crisis in the wake of the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord signed in Conakry, Guinea, the military junta
in Sierra Leone is to hand over power to ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah next April.
</P>
<P>
However, agreement has not yet been reached on some major issues
and the peace process in that country seems to be deadlocked.

<HEADLINE> EU Set on Ban on U.S. Meat Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union may ban
United States imports of fresh meat and poultry on the grounds
that they contain high-level residues of hormone and anti-biotics.
</P>
<P>
EU veterinary inspectors are warning that they will recommand
such a ban unless U.S. authorities improve methods for detecting
"medical products and contaminants" in food from animals.
</P>
<P>
An EU ban on fresh meat would stop tens of millions of dollars
worth of U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
Though the 15-nation union has already halted the import of
hormone-treated beef, it still buys a substantial amount of pork
and poultry from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The threat of the ban, coming less than a week after Washington
restricted imports of European beef and lamb, is expected to
intensify a growing dispute between the EU and the United States
over food safety.
</P>
<P>
An EU spokesman today said that the ban proposal was carried in
a report supposed to be circulated among officials of the EU
member states but it was leaked to the press and had stuffed a
news story published by today's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
The report, drawn up by four senior inspectors following a
10-day trip to the United States in November, found that there
were serious deficiencies in the U.S. testing program for residues
of anti-biotic, anti-bacterial and other substances in live
animals and animal products.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not say whether the level of residues of
hormone and anti-biotics was higher in the United States than in
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the union, has
expressed that it would take into serious account the views of the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has taken a more cautious approach toward
food safety than the United States, especially since the outbreak
of madcow disease.

BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal
Government is willing to back a Sino-foreign real estate project
in the heart of the city, Mayor Jia Qinglin said in a meeting here
today with Charles Maikish, president of the World Trade Center of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The trade and commercial complex will be erected in the Qianmen

Square. A general development plan has been approved by city
planning authorities.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment for renovation projects of Beijing's old
downtown area will be welcome. However, designing modern buildings
should be associated with the city's traditional architectural
styles, Jia told Charles Maikish.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing-based transnational corporation, China International
Industries and Commerce, will be the exclusive developer of the
Qianmen project, which will cover a total floor space of 3.5
million square meters.

JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's demand for housing
fell by 20 percent in 1997, one of the worst years for the
property industry of the country, the Jerusalem Post daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by Israeli Geocartography Institute for
Spatial Analysis shows that the families intending to buy
apartments in the next two years drop to 11 percent of the
respondents, from 14 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent of the surveyed who have wished to buy a
flat are looking for a 2.5-3-bedroom apartment, while 60 percent
want to spend a sum of money less than 125,000 U.S. dollars on
housing.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Minister of Construction and Housing Meir Porush
said recently that housing prices plunged by 19 percent during the
first 11 months of 1997 compared to the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the decrease to the slowdown of Israel's economic
growth, declining numbers of new immigrants and a rise of interest
rates paid on mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Tung Stresses Need of Mother-Tongue Teaching in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa Thursday
stressed the necessity of mother-tongue teaching in Hong Kong and
urged more local schools to adopt such a practice.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Pui Ching Middle School in Kowloon City in
the afternoon, Tung said mother-tongue teaching will help students
 enhance their language proficiency and become "biliterate and
trilingual," which is one of the education goals of the SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
Both overseas and local studies indicated that mother-tongue
teaching is the most effective means for students, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chief executive continued, students with good
Chinese language ability can, in the long term, help forge good
economic and trade relationship between the SAR and the motherland
 and strengthen the SAR's role as a bridge linking China's inland
areas to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Proficiency in the Chinese language will become a prerequisite
 for further study and job-seeking," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that the SAR government is to provide an
appropriate environment and adequate resources for students to
become "biliterate and trilingual," so that they would be
proficient in writing English and Chinese and could speak fluent
Cantonese, English and Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
In his view, mother-tongue teaching is complementary rather
than contradictory to improving students' English language
standards and overall academic performance.
</P>
<P>
"The provision of good-quality education depends on the
educational methods adopted by schools. The academic results
achieved by schools are determined by a number of factors, such as
 the goals they set, their experiences, the quality of the
principals and teachers and the teaching environment," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the widespread implementation of
mother-tongue teaching, more schools using Chinese as a medium of
teaching will become elite schools in the SAR.

<HEADLINE> China, Congo Presidents Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called the visit by President Laurent-Desire Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) "very significant" to
sustainable development of bilateral relations during their talks
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese people cherish deep feelings for the
Congolese people, and for a long time the two peoples sympathized
with and supported each other, cooperated sincerely and forged a
firm friendship.
</P>
<P>
Great change has taken place in the Congo's political scene
this year, he said, adding that China appreciates and supports the
DCR government's efforts to explore a development path suited to
its national situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "President Kabila attaches great importance to the
friendship with China. I believe the current visit will help
increase mutual understanding and be very significant to the
sustainable development of bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
China considers DCR an important partner in Africa, he said,
and added that on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, China is ready to consolidate and deepen the
friendship between the two peoples, expand mutually beneficial
cooperation in economic and trade areas, promote exchange through
various levels, strengthen consultation and cooperation in
international affairs, and work with the DCR to forge a long-term,
stable and all-round cooperative state-to-state relationship.
</P>
<P>
Appraising bilateral economic and trade cooperation, Jiang said
China encourages its enterprises to invest in the DCR, and will
continue to promote trade between Chinese and DCR companies in
various forms and channels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said he is very glad to visit China at the invitation of
President Jiang. It is a proof of deep friendship between DCR and
China that his China trip occurs only several months after he took
his post, he noted, and added he hopes the visit would further
strengthen and develop friendly cooperative relations between his
country and China.
</P>
<P>
He said for more than 30 years his country's economic
development has been blocked, and that the DCR government has
mapped out a three-year plan of national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
China's development has been remarkably fast, he said, adding
that he hopes China will actively participate in the Congo's
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said he invites Chinese enterprises to invest in the
DCR, and that the Congo is willing to forge a just, cooperative
partnership with China.

<HEADLINE> EU to Aid Baltic Cross-border Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
Thursday adopted a program worth 46.9 million ECU (56.8 million
U.S. dollars) for cross-border development in the Baltic region.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to support European Union (EU) member
states involved and their neighbors of Central and Eastern Europe
in development across borders in Denmark, Germany, Finland and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Other countries involved are Poland, Estonia, Lithuania,
Latvia, Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The fund is to go to assisting transitional cross-border
planning projects up to 1999, including coastal radio systems,
rescue systems, coastal protection against erosion and development
of thematic tourism, said Monika Wulf-Mathies, the EU commissioner
in charge of regional policy.
</P>
<P>
The importance of this program lay in the fact that it was a
new ground for European structural policy and an important step
towards the integration of Central and Eastern Europe, she said.
</P>
<P>
The money would go into a joint funding pool while a
transitional steering and monitoring committee would decide on
individual projects and be responsible for implementation.

<HEADLINE> Resignation of "President" of Somaliland Refused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the break away
Republic of Somaliland indicate that the resignation forwarded by
Mohamed Hagi Ibrahim Egal, president of the unrecognized
republic, was not accepted following an emergency session by the
two houses in Hargeisa.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Hargeisa said 129 members from the House of
Elders and the House of Representatives, met and voted for
whether to accept Egal's resignation or refuse. As a result, 124
members voted against Egal's move, while three accepted and two
others, the two chairmen of the houses, abstained.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Egal is left with no choice other than working as the
president of the republic. The two houses said this is the most
crucial moment for Somaliland when a great deal of developments
and peace were achieved during his incumbency in the office,
therefore his resignation is inappropriate and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the two houses on Tuesday, Egal forwarded
his resignation complaining about what he called lack of
collaboration by his people. He said he was disappointed by the
people who just elected him as a president but did not want to
work for the development of their country.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Egal has been widely talked about in
Somaliland and in Somalia in general. Conservatives in Hargeisa
believe that this is the worst time President Egal could resign
because it would prove the existence of improper administration
and foreigners would start pressuring Somaliland to join the
on-going peace talks in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
However, people opposed to Egal's secessionist policy said
this is the best time he could resign since it is coinciding with
the continuation of the Cairo peace deal between the major
political factions. They believe it is time to integrate with the
rest of Somalia and participate in the continuing power sharing
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Other non-aligned groups classified Egal's move as merely
power consolidation and that he intends to attract more
supporters in his pretext of showing no ambition for power.
</P>
<P>
People in Mogadishu also received the resignation news with
different reactions. Supporters of Hussein Mohamed Aidid believe
that Egal's move would destabilize the on-going reconciliation
talks in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"If his resignation is from the heart and he intends to join
the rest of Somalia, it will mean that everything should be
restarted from the beginning," said Abdi Ahmed Dhuhulow, an
influential politician in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
But the people of north Mogadishu simply welcomed Egal's
resignation. Some political analysts said Egal is merely playing
a game to attract the international attention from Cairo and to
remind the world of his existence and that the cause of
Somaliland is unnegotiable.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Management of Skilled Personnel (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He went on to say that three major shifts must happen in
China's personnel work before the management of skilled personnel
could improve substantially.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, personnel departments must expand their service
coverage from the state-owned sector and the cities to the entire
national economy and the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Second, personnel management should no longer be confined to
managing only the so-called "state cadres," or government
employees, but should include the management of all types of
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, and most important of all, every personnel official
must have it in mind that you are no longer merely handling some
simple paperwork on personnel distribution. You're tapping our
country's resource of skilled personnel," Song stressed.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that in the next three years, the Ministry of
Personnel would enhance the training of officials across the
country, annually sending 200 local personnel chiefs abroad to
study.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also cooperate with the U.S. Hughes Company
and the Siemens Corp. of Germany to train 40 personnel managers
from major state-run enterprises each year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Ministry of Personnel worked out a general
plan for the development of China's skilled-personnel resource
through 2010. The ministry also started an ambitious program to
foster a contingent of world-class elites in science and
technology for the next century.
</P>
<P>
To date 29 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as
well as 15 cities that enjoy provincial status in the economy,
have come up with their own plans for improving the management of
local skilled personnel.

<HEADLINE> 3-Percent Rise Predicted for 1998 HK Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's merchandise
exports are expected to grow 3 percent in 1998, slower than the 4
percent estimated for this year, the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the TDC's annual trade outlook, TDC Chief Economist
Edward Leung said Asia's financial crisis and economic downturn
have clouded the prospects for trade growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the total trade picture for Hong Kong will be better
than statistics are able to indicate because many local companies
are involved in offshore trade.
</P>
<P>
"Offshore trade is expected to develop further. So the growth
of total export business managed by Hong Kong companies should be
around one to two percentage points higher than the value increase
 captured by trade statistics," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the global trading environment, he said the basic
 ingredients for world trade expansion are still intact and the
current hardship is not expected to be long-term.
</P>
<P>
Driven mainly by domestic demand, the U.S. economy is expected
to continue its balanced growth next year while the European Union
 economy will be slightly firmer, with a broader base for trade
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Once financial stability is restored to Asia, Leung predicted,
the region's economies should be able to export their way out of
their present economic straits. High savings rate and the region's
 commitment to trade liberalization will help facilitate their
economic revival.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry today
issued a statement accusing the United States of pursuing a
policy of foot-dragging in the approval of contracts Iraq has
signed for the import of food, medicine and other humanitarian
needs.
</P>
<P>
The United States had rejected 43 contracts under the first
phase of Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program which ended last June,
and 25 contracts under the second phase of the program which
expired more than one week ago, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also provided a list of the contracts held
by the U.S. representative in the U.N. Sanctions Committee, of
which most are water treatment equipment, agricultural machines
and spare parts and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
It called on the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. Sanctions
Committee to respect the letter and spirit of U.N. Resolution 986
and terms of the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal to ensure swift
delivery of humanitarian supplies to Iraqi people hit hard by the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Substantive and concrete facts have been testifying day by
day to U.S. administration's persistence in obstructing the smooth
implementation of the oil-for-food deal and tightening the grip
of the embargo on the people of Iraq," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can only be lifted when U.N. weapons inspectors verify
that Iraq is free from weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Albright Talks with Netanyahu in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright held talks with visiting Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here Thursday on the prospects of
relaunching the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Albright left for London to meet Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
She did not reveal any details about the two-hour talks held in
the Israeli embassy in Paris, which she described as "pleasant."
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Israeli officials said that Albright would
not obtain from Netanyahu details on the scale of redeployment of
Israeli troops on the West Bank, as the Israeli cabinet is yet to
decide on it.
</P>
<P>
The United States has called on Israel to "concentrate on the
substance of re-deployment" and on three other issues which
Washington considers essential for renewing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The three issues are the freezing of building Jewish
settlements in Palestinian territories, cooperation between
Israeli and Palestinian security officials, and definition of the
final status of the Palestinian territories, including that of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television said that Israeli could announce in January
a spaced out withdrawal from more than 10 percent of the
Palestinian territory under its control.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian autonomous authorities only control three percent
of the territory in the West Bank, and jointly control 27 percent
with Israel.

<HEADLINE> 3-Percent Rise Predicted for 1998 HK Trade (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Undeterred by the financial turmoil, China will continue to
pursue state enterprise reforms and trade liberalization, Leung
said. "The mainland's economic stability will help cushion the
fall elsewhere in the Asian region," the chief economist said.
</P>
<P>
He advised Hong Kong traders and manufactures to further
increase their added value through improving product quality,
design and customer service, to maintain a competitive edge in a
tougher world market.
</P>
<P>
By sector, Leung predicted that electronics export will remain
healthy, casual wear will continue to do well within the clothing
sector while for toys, higher-end exclusive items will perform
better than lower-end ones. But the export value of watches and
clocks will continue to be down due to worldwide decline in
movement prices.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong's services sector, he said exports of
financial services will continue to be adversely affected by the
region's turmoil, but the outlook will remain steady for trade
supporting services.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the services sector recorded a 5.3-percent increase
in the first half this year but came to a slowdown in the second.
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration in the region's business climate will
inevitably dampen the growth of Hong Kong's financial services,"
he said. "However, enterprises from the Chinese mainland are
likely to continue raising equity capital in Hong Kong, given the
priority attached to reforming the state-owned enterprises."
</P>
<P>
The volume of transshipment cargo will enjoy steady growth,
whereas offshore services trade and certain trade-related business
 services, such as freight forwarding, trade finance and export
insurance, should be able to achieve modest gains, he forecast.
</P>
<P>
Another boost to services export next year is the expected
bottoming-out of the sluggish tourism sector, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports this year are expected to generate 1.448
trillion HK dollars (186 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, trade in services went up by 5
 percent to 231 billion HK dollars (30 billion
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nagano to Ban Portable Phones in Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Spectators will not be allowed
to use portable phones on their seats at the Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan, the organizers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Portable phones and pagers are on a list of 19 items banned
from spectator seats at the games starting Feb. 7, said Hirofumi
Isogai, an official of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The use of such phones in trains, restaurants and some other
public places sometimes leads to complaints in Japan.
</P>
<P>
At Olympic sites, the sounds of ringing and conversation could
disrupt sports like figure skating, which need silence, Isogai
said.
</P>
<P>
If Olympic spectators must use their portable phones, Is seats
and find a place where they won't disturb others.

BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai troops in Surin province
Wednesday fired warning shots against the warring factions in
Cambodia, cautioning them not to spread fighting onto the Thai
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Thai army's 23rd infantry regiment fired the shots as
mortar and artillery shells from the Cambodian side strayed onto
the Thai border district of Kap Choeng in Surin province.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting reportedly resumed on Wednesday for the third
day as Cambodian co-premier Hun Sen's troops launched a fresh
offensive against those forces loyal to deposed co-premier prince
Norodom Ranariddh near the town of O'smach in northwestern
Cambodia, which is opposite to Surin province.
</P>
<P>
Stray shells fell onto rice fields in Thailand two kilometers
from the border, but so far, no farmers were hit, the Thai
military said.

Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, met today with participants of national conferences on
finance and taxation.

During the meeting, Li Peng thanked the country's financial and

In the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1996), major

fields have proven a success, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the financial and taxation workers to understand
the current difficulties and problems existing in the fields,
stressing that in 1998 the country will stick to a moderate
financial and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to protect legal income and crack down
on illegal earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reminded the officials that they will face arduous work in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Tung Calls Year 1998 Period of Adjustment for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa Thursday
called the upcoming year a period of adjustment for Hong Kong's
economy after the recent financial turmoil, which has swept some
major economies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tung told the Hong Kong Exporters' Association Christmas
luncheon that he shares the view that Hong Kong's economy will be
growing at about 4 percent next year because of the effects of the
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
However, he believes that "when Asian countries rebound, Hong
Kong will rebound faster than anywhere else." "By 1999, there is a
great hope that we will be well on our way back again to a more
normal growth."
</P>
<P>
The chief executive emphasized that the SAR's economic
fundamentals are very strong with huge fiscal reserves and good
financial resources and that the economy in the inland areas
continues to expand in a very orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Hong Kong is a service center, with 84
percent of its gross domestic product coming from the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
"So certainly I feel that after the adjustment next year, (Hong
Kong's) economy will start to grow well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung also reaffirmed the SAR government's determination to
defend and maintain the 14-year-old peg system between the Hong
Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Resumption of Talks With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday reiterated
its willingness to resume talks with India, provided that the core
issue of Kashmir is addressed in a "specific, substantial and
comprehensive manner."
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a weekly briefing, Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed said Pakistan has already made some proposals to
India for overcoming the procedural bottlenecks in dealing with
outstanding issues, adding, "We are waiting for their response."
</P>
<P>
He said the operation of a mechanism for handling the issues in
a substantial manner has been held up, primarily owing to the
reversal of India's stand on an understanding the two countries
arrived at in Islamabad in June.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said some progress was made on the question of
substantial talks between the two countries last month when he met
with his Indian counterpart in Male, the Maldives. But the two
sides remain divided on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan wants the core issue of Kashmir to be discussed in a
substantial and specific manner and the procedural hurdles in this
connection to be removed at the earliest, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian government may not be moving forward for the
resumption of the talks because of political uncertainty in the
country, but Pakistan is ready for talks "whatever government is
there."
</P>
<P>
In answer to a question about the settlement of the Afghan
issue, Ahmed said hectic efforts are in progress to explore
possible avenues for having intra-Afghan dialogue for the
establishment of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, is willing to cooperate with the United
Nations in evolving the necessary mechanism for an immediate
cease-fire, enforcing an arms embargo and stopping foreign
interference in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He called Pakistan and Iran the two most affected countries,
saying they have agreed to work together to promote intra-Afghan
dialogue, thus enabling Afghan leaders themselves to decide their
future.

people to curb extravagant activities during the coming Chinese
lunar new year period.
</P>
<P>
The next Spring Festival, a traditional Chinese gala, falls on

</P>
<P>
Local governments are also urged to take good care of poor
families. Funds should be allocated to help poor people spend the
festival merrily, it says.
</P>
<P>
The number of meetings should be cut so as to let leading
officials have enough time to deal with problems in the grass-root
levels, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
It also asks to step up supervision on taxation and financial
activities, and to prevent local departments from making big
expenditures with public funds at the year-end.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Life-long Banker Confident of HK Financial Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- From bottom to top, chairman
of the Hang Seng Bank Lee Quo-wei has seen Hang Seng growing from
a gold trading house to the No. 2 locally incorporated bank in
Hong Kong over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
For half a century, his career and his bank have developed in
tandem with the emergence of Hong Kong as an international banking
center. No others could be in a better position than Lee, now 79,
to witness the ebb and flow of the evolution of Hong Kong's
financial industry.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Asian currency turmoil, the financial crises
became a topic issue in Lee's interview with Xinhua. "The crises
in the past were unilateral, while the uncertainty now is
multilateral," said Lee, who became chairman of the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong (SEHK) after the 1987 stock crash.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hong Kong stock market melted down in 1973 and
1987 both as a result of overheated speculative trading on the
local market, but this time external shocks triggered volatility
despite Hong Kong's sound economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong cannot be immune to the regional instability in an
increasingly integrated financial market, but there is no
fundamental problems in the economy," said Lee.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the local banking industry, the life blood of
Hong Kong's economy, remains healthy and well-capitalized thanks
to banks' conservative management and the authorities' strict
regulation.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has done very well in
keeping a close watch on the local banks," said the life-long
banker, who started as a bank trainee at the age of 19. In his
memory, Hong Kong had only a two-page bank ordinance in the 1950s,
while now the regional financial center has established an
effective and efficient set of regulatory and monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
Since a minor run on the International Bank of Asia in early
November was repulsed in a day, the HKMA has stepped up its check
on local banks, which are required to report their key statistics on
a daily basis rather than once a week or a month.
</P>
<P>
The capital adequacy ratio for local banks stood impressively
at 17 percent at the end of 1996, far exceeding the eight percent
Basel statutory requirement to be one of the world's highest. High
liquidity levels also make local banks well-prepared for sudden
customer withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Taking Hang Seng as an example, its capital adequacy ratio
stood at 22.9 percent and the liquidity ratio, at 40.5 percent in
June this year. "The strong capital and liquidity base explains
why we could weather the tough times, " said Lee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's economic prospect, the Chinese banker
said firmly: "It will depends on how fast China's economy will
grow in the next few years." The eight to nine percent annual GDP
growth in the inland areas will continue to be a powerful engine
to push Hong Kong's economy forward, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Building Infrastructure for Better Future in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- By bringing a
20-billion-U.S.-dollar international airport into shape, building
up new port facilities and enhancing network of highways and
cross-border links, Hong Kong is laying a solid foundation for its
continued prosperity in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Shrewd Hong Kongers are aware that every single penny spent in
infrastructure is worthy, particularly that invested in one of the
world's largest airport projects at Chek Lap Kok, Lantau Island,
to replace the overcrowded one at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
When it is commissioned in April 1998 with the first runway put
into operation, the state-of-the-art airport is capable of
meeting ever increasing air traffic demands, with an annual
capacity of 35 million passengers and about 3 million tons of
cargo.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is urgently needed because Kai Tak is already
operating at capacity -- in 1996, over 29.6 million passengers
passed through Kai Tak while some 1.56 million tons of cargo were
handled.
</P>
<P>
Good Progress has been made with the 10 Airport Core Program
(ACP) projects. By mid-1997 eight projects, including highways,
bridges, reclamation, new town and cross-harbor road tunnel, had
been completed on schedule. The 34-kilometer Airport Railway is
planned to be operational in June next year.
</P>
<P>
The grand new airport, starting in early 1990's, represents as
a massive investment in Hong Kong's future, one that will yield
substantial returns in overall economic benefits.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Trade Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The trade deficit of Cyprus
for the first seven months of this year increased by 4.2 percent
compared with that a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The deficit during the period reached 744.3 million Cypriot
pounds (1,488 million U.S. dollars), said a Department of
Statistics and Research report released today.
</P>
<P>
The higher red figure was largely due to a drop of 6.1 percent
in exports which stood at 368.7 million pounds (737.4 million
dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decrease in exports was attributed to a 45 percent
shrink in agricultural exports, which recorded only 25.6 million
pounds (51.2 million dollars) in the first seven months of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Pass on Great Wall to Open for Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- An ancient mountain pass which
served as part of Beijing's northern defense will open New Year's
Day to sightseers just like its world-famous neighbor, the
Badaling Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
A five-year-long renovation of Juyong Pass on the northwestern
outskirts of the capital has been completed, a spokesman for the
local tourist administrative department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Juyong Pass, about 60 kilometers northwest of downtown Beijing,
includes part of the up-and-down wall on rolling hills and an
enclosed complex of military facilities, government offices,
warehouses and temples.
</P>
<P>
"The buildings reproduce the scene of political, military,
cultural and religious activities inside the pass at that time,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Like other passes along the 6,700-kilometer-long Great Wall,
Juyong Pass has a strategic location and difficult
access. Ministers of the Board of War, or Defense Ministers, in
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) considered it the last defense of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Known in China as "the 10,000-li wall," the Great Wall was
constructed during the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.) and
was expanded until the Ming Dynasty.

Besides strengthening Hong Kong's position as a trade and
finance center and a tourist attraction, the ACP projects will
bring other benefits: improved road and rail facilities ease
congestion in West Kowloon and Kwai Tsing areas, and new land is
being provided for community and commercial development.
</P>
<P>
The ACP projects also provide job opportunities, having
generated over 28,000 jobs for local workers during the
construction period. It is estimated that, upon completion, the
new airport and the Airport Railway alone, will create around
15,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a regional hub of aviation, Hong Kong also ranks
among the world's busiest container ports, handling 13.4 million
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 1996, up 7 percent over
1995.
</P>
<P>
Handling containers and other cargoes add significantly to Hong
Kong's economy. Official studies indicate that port-related
industrial and commercial enterprises contribute some 20 percent
to Hong Kong's GDP and employ 600,000 of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
The latest port cargo forecasts by the Port Development Board
predicted, along with the economic development of Hong Kong and
the Chinese inland areas, there would be a demand for Hong Kong to
handle 39 million TEUs per year by 2016, or five TEUs every four
seconds, representing an annual growth of 5.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Uses Cyberspace to Expose Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Keeping up with the high-tech,
Egypt has taken its war against Islamic militants to the Internet,
local English weekly Al-Ahram reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Information Service (SIS) is using cyberspace
technology to expose militant leaders living abroad, whom the
Egyptian government accuses of planning and financing terrorist
acts back home.
</P>
<P>
It has recently added to its Internet web site the names and
pictures of 14 more fugitive terrorists together with some
background information after the massacre in the southern city of
Luxor in November.
</P>
<P>
The attack, claimed by the Gamaa Islamiya and suspected of
foreign masterminding, killed 62 people, including 58 foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Cairo's call for cooperation from European countries in
combating terrorism, the SIS web site has declared "terrorists do
not recognize any boundaries. The international community is under
an obligation to work collectively to deny such terrorists any
safe haven."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the idea behind putting the names of the
wanted terrorists on the web site is an attempt to expose them
rather than catch them as the site virtually provides no guidance
of action or hot lines.

Building this new port, on a series of artificial islands
stretching southeast from Lantau Island, will be one of the
world's biggest civil engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
The new port is vital, not only for Hong Kong but also for the
Chinese inland areas, as some 70 percent of cargo passing through
Hong Kong is entrepot trade with the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as south China occupies a prominent slice of entrepot
trade, the natural highway of the Pearl River is being
increasingly used, with more container barges seen on the river.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Hong Kong's first River Trade Terminal (RTT),
specifically designed to handle river cargoes, got under way near
Tuen Mun in north-west "New Territories". The first phase is
operational in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1, no
one doubts that trade and economic links between Hong Kong and
south China, in particular, the Pearl River Delta region, will be
further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
But, in parallel with the bilateral economic integration,
cross-border traffic has turned more and more congested.

Now Connecting Hong Kong and its next-door neighbor, Shenzhen
city, are three roads and one single railway. Combining together
the three road crossing points, Sha Tau Kok, Man Kam To and Lok Ma
Chau, around 24,300 vehicles passed through per day in 1996, 91
percent of them goods vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR) plays a notable role in
passenger traffic. Some 48 million passengers crossed the border
by rail at Lo Wu in 1996, plus 2 million tons of goods. On
weekends and holidays, the cars are filled with Hong Kongers for a
family reunion on the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
To cater to increased cross links, the transport authority is
considering integrating Hong Kong's network of highways with that
of Guangdong province. An extension of the planned Western
Highway, or Route 10, is being considered to link directly with
the proposed Deep Bay Crossing.
</P>
<P>
Rail traffic will also be more closely integrated. The West
Rail, a new south-north railway starting construction soon, is to
run from the urban area straight to the border. Phase II of the
rail includes a new border crossing at Lok Ma Chau where
passengers will be able to change to an underground rail system
currently planned in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to meet demands arising from the development of new
towns, it has recently been announced, construction of the Mass

Rail Link and the KCR Extension from Hung Hom to Tsim Sha Tsui
will commence soon for operation early next century.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Insurance Information Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Insurance Information
Network, a special Web site for Chinese companies on the Internet,
makes it possible to sell policies on-line.
</P>
<P>
The network was jointly established by the China Insurance
Institute and the Weixin Investment Consulting Company to promote
Chinese insurance companies and their services.
</P>
<P>
"This will help improve the information exchange among insurers
in China, and Chinese people's awareness about the importance of
insurance in their lives," said Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the
People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China's total sales of insurance policies
reached 201 billion yuan between 1991 and 1995 at an annual growth
rate of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
China resumed operation of insurance companies in 1978, and the
industry has been developing rapidly during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
About 20 Chinese insurance companies, jointly-established
ventures and overseas insurers now are selling 600 kinds of
insurance services in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, China's fledgling insurance industry still has some
defects and shortcomings, such as few channels for sharing
information, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua Insurance (Life) Co., Ltd. reportedly sold the first
insurance policy through the Internet on China's mainland right
after the network opened. The insured, Zhang Sumian, works for the
Beijing Commerce College. She bought her son, a university
student, a life insurance policy valued at 100,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Management of Skilled Personnel (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that personnel departments across the country next year
should focus on improving their management of skilled personnel to
assist economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day conference of provincial officials in
charge of personnel, Song Defu, minister of personnel, said the
issue of skilled personnel is of strategic importance to China's
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that personnel officials should help skilled personnel,
who are urgently needed in the national economy or engaged in
advanced study, obtain preferential treatment in daily life and
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
"We should also encourage higher-education institutions and
enterprises to jointly recruit post-doctorate students to ensure
these young elites work for the enterprises after graduation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the state has decided to guarantee the
research funds of a number of scholars studying overseas who have
returned home with impressive academic records.
</P>
<P>
He analyzed that China's current policy of developing multiple
ownership, restructuring industries and reforming the state
enterprises would surely add momentum to the flow of skilled
personnel and lead to a new high in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
"We must seize this opportunity and step up building the
special labor markets for skilled personnel, to guarantee an
orderly flow and a reasonable distribution of skilled personnel
across the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged personnel departments at all levels to improve
their services and set up a complete and up-to-date system for
personnel proxy, skilled-personnel appraisal and arbitration of
personnel disputes.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam made great achievements
in foreign trade in 1997 despite regional monetary and financial
crises.
</P>
<P>
Reports from relevant agencies said Vietnam's export turnover
reached 8.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, a 20 percent increase
over the year.
</P>
<P>
The country's total imports stood at 11.2 billion dollars in
1997, up 0.5 percent compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from raw material and semi-processed products
accounted for over 70 percent of the country's total export
turnover.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's main exports including crude oil, rice, coffee,
rubber, tea, aquatic products, and footwear continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a lack of investment in new technology,
Vietnamese industries could not turn out many high quality
internationally competitive products.
</P>
<P>
Only the garments, textiles and leather and shoe industries
are maintaining high technological renovation, with an export
turnover of between 960 million and 1.2 billion dollars.

</P>
<P>
While the main industries maintained a growth momentum, the

</P>
<P>
The country's exports continued growing as the government
stepped up controls on imports, and the inflation rate was low.

<P>
While the country's scientific, educational and cultural
activities have kept developing, people's living standards have
improved steadily, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
On economic difficulties, the minister pointed out that
"productive quality and economic efficiency are low and
competitiveness of domestic goods is weak".
</P>
<P>
He cautioned about the existence of a number of social
problems, including corruption, fraudulent trade and the
incapability of authorities at different levels.

MOGADISHU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Fresh reports indicated
that the level of water in Jubba river is again rising as the
Deyr rainy season is about to end by the beginning of January
next year.
</P>
<P>
Local aid workers in lower Jubba region said following heavy
rains in the mountain lands of Ethiopia and southern Somalia,
Jubba river is further bursting its banks near the town of
Jamame, about 100 km north of the southern port town of Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
Community elders in Jamame spoke about a fresh evacuation of
the inhabitants in the Jubba Valley in the past two days when
water started to reach new areas. In Jamame town, the waters
from Jubba River have covered one quarter of the already besieged
town, creating uncertainty and forcing the people to flee their
houses before it is late.
</P>
<P>
According to the aid workers, the people of Jamame have
started to flee towards Kismaio by the only open road which is
the coastal line. They would walk at least two days to reach
Kismaio without having adequate food.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwait-based aid agency, Africa Muslims Agency, has just set
up a clinic center in the town of Jamame to deal with the deadly
malaria and diarrhoea caused mainly by the rains.
</P>
<P>
Abdulkarim Hussein Guled, a local worker for the agency said
his agency has distributed 120 tons of rice, sugar, maize, flour
and cooking oil to 2,000 families in Qoryoley and Muddul Barawe
towns of Lower Shabelle.
</P>
<P>
Not only Jubba river is bursting its banks, but Shabelle river
is further wreaking havoc in the area surrounding Ballidogle
Airport. Reports from the town of Wanlewein, 90 km southwest of
the capital, said the inhabitants of eight villages have been
displaced by new waters from Shabelle River.
</P>
<P>
Hodon Moham Hashi, a coordinator for the relief agencies in
Wanlewein, said the International Committee for the Red Cross
(ICRC) has delivered 40 tons of beans, sorghum, cooking oil to
the area early this week.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that cultivation seeds were among the aid
assistance provided by the ICRC. However, she said, the food
supplies are far behind the needs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has
sent a convoy of 70 food trucks to the flood affected victims in
the southwestern towns of Baidoa, Burhakaba, Qansahdhere and
Dinsor.
</P>
<P>
The convoy which was carrying a total of 939.6 metric tons of
sorghum and wheat got stuck in the mud just after they passed
Baidoa, however the food reached its destinations late last week.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,700 people are believed to have died in the rain
disasters that hit southern Somalia since October this year and
more than half a million others are made homeless.

be their punishment now? Their punishment will be the island's
Taksim (partition)."
</P>
<P>
He also told the United States to keep out. "What we want from
the USA is not to bother us. That's all we want from it," Denktash
said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's remarks came in the wake of furious Turkish Cypriot
reaction at the European Union (EU) decision last weekend to open
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a spokesman from the U.N. Peace-Keeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) today, Denktash canceled a meeting with
U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel which was
originally scheduled for last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP spokesman Waldemar Rokoszewski said Denktash's office
gave no reason as to why the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Denktash said inter-communal talks were
dead, and he would no longer discuss the subject of
inter-communal talks with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of a U.N.-sponsored direct peace talks
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in August due to the
EU's planned accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community object to the
EU's decision to start accession talks with Cyprus, insisting that
Cyprus can join the EU only after a political settlement on the
island.

<P>
HOHHOT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Water of the Yellow River will
be diverted into Hohhot, capital of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, to tackle the shortages of water.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a water diversion project was approved by the
the State Planning Commission last March and will start in April
next year.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of two parts: a diversion project and a
water treatment project. When completed in 2003, its daily
supplying capacity will be 400,000 cu.m. of water.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.7 billion yuan (204.8 million U.S. dollars)
including 5.44 billion yen of Japanese loans will be used for its
construction.
</P>
<P>
Hohhot, a historic city in north China, covers an area of 60.8
million sq.km. and has a population of 1.3 million. Wool textile,
light and heavy industries in the city have developed rapidly in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the city is facing an increasing water deficiency. It
has reportedly built a daily water supplying capacity of 211,000
cu.m. but the city needs 350,000 cu.m. each day.
</P>
<P>
An estimate says that by 2000, 700,000 cu.m. of water will be
needed daily to satisfy the expanding population and
industrialization of the city.

proper protective measures if they have to.
</P>
<P>
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the
health department said that residents should avoid contacting
birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird
flu known as H5N1.
</P>
<P>
Although several cases were reported in Hong Kong, none was
found in Macao so far. It is still unclear in which way human
being catches the virus.
</P>
<P>
The department said that people who have to contact birds
should wear disposable gloves and protective suits, and wash their
hands thoroughly after finishing their work.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it reminded people to avoid staying with birds for
a long time in a closed space where ventilation is poor.
</P>
<P>
People should also see doctors immediately for proper treatment
if they have fever or respiratory diseases. They should tell
doctors of their contacts with birds.
</P>
<P>
But it said the risk of infection is low because the H5N1 virus
was only found in imported chicken so far.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM: Convention Must Agree on Republic Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
said Thursday that next February's Constitutional Convention must
agree on the kind of republic Australia would become if it is to
replace the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
"What the convention has got to do above everything else is to
settle on a republican alternative," Howard told SBS television.
</P>
<P>
"We all know what the status quo is, we don't know what the
alternative is. And what I want republicans and non-republicans
alike to do at the convention is to make up their mind what kind
of republic Australia should be if it decides to become a
republic."
</P>
<P>
All the four candidates declared elected to the convention so
far endorse a republic while monarchists said they will not
discuss a republican model at the convention and will only argue
for the retention of the existing system.
</P>
<P>
Both delegates declared elected from the Australian Capital
Territory are from the Australian Republican Movement (ARM). They
will join the two republicans elected yesterday from the Northern
Territory.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, only a handful of votes have been counted in most
states.
</P>
<P>
ARM continues to lead the count in New South Wales, Victoria
and Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
The counting in Victoria saw the position of Australians for a
constitutional monarchy slip marginally while in Western Australia
ARM's big lead was cut slightly.
</P>
<P>
The results of the voting should be declared in South Australia
Friday while those in the remaining states will be announced next
week.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Judges should ensure that
judicial work contributes more to overall social and economic
progress during the country's reform and opening process,
according to Zhu Mingshan, vice-president of the Supreme People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the past five years show that the average annual
increase rate for cases adjudicated by people's courts across the
country was 14.73 percent. The average rate for cases concerning
economic disputes grew by 23.36 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In the future, people's courts will be required to handle even
more social and economic relations cases which tend to be more
complicated, and judicial means will be required to adjust various
relations, said Zhu, adding that courts will face even heavier
tasks in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a national conference of senior judges from
provincial people's courts, Zhu urged participants to establish a
good image for courts, safeguard social stability and promote
sustainable, rapid and sound economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years since China initiated reform and
opening, the total number of staffers for people's courts at
various levels has grown from less than 100,000 to over
280,000. The courts have handled an average of five million cases
of first instance annually over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also pointed out that the number of judges receiving
improved professional training will be increased.

<HEADLINE> Large Groups of While Fin Dolphins Found in Jiangxi Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
that the river section of the Yangtze and the Boyang Lake in
Jiangxi Province, East China, are the home of white fin dolphins
(Chinese river dolphins).
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey, large numbers of white fin dolphins were
located in the 151.9-kilometer river section and the Boyang Lake.
</P>
<P>
The survey, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, was
conducted in early November in the lower and middle mainstream of
the Yangtze as well as in the waters of the Boyang and
Dongting lakes, the first and second largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The dolphins were first found in the river section in Jiujiang
County on November 5, and large groups of dolphins were found in
the waters at Balijiang and Laoyemiao of the Boyang Lake in the
following days.
</P>
<P>
Based on the survey, the experts believed that the
Jiujiang section of the Yangtze River and the Boyang Lake are
ideal natural preserves for dolphins, for the waters are less
polluted and rich in feed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
edged higher in fluctuating trade today, with improvements in
resource stocks offsetting falls among major industrials.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index moved one point higher to 2563.1 with
the early expiry of December options being the most important
factor.
</P>
<P>
"The main influence was option expiry. You saw that was the
main activity. You can never really tell if that's bullish or
bearish but it's come out fairly square on the day," Stuart Smith
from Henderson Charlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the mid-year budget review presented by Federal
Treasurer Peter Costello today had little impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the strength in resource stocks came as buyers took
advantage of their oversold status, with foreign institutional
interest emerging.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 9.0 points lower at 4400.1,
with newspaper company Fairfax losing nine cents in trade of 15.71
million shares.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin

metals supplier, as well as one of the world's leading suppliers
of flat steel.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations and Western experts inspecting disarmaments in
Iraq have found that the bacteriological arm stocks of Iraq were
ready to serve, in contradiction to the claim by the Iraqi government
that it had unilaterally destroyed these arms. They also found that
the chemical arms program of Iraq had been relaunched very fast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Iraq have again raised their
tones over access by arms inspectors to presidential sites in Iraq,
and the United States ordered the vaccination against anthrax,
a disease of sheep and cattle transmissible to humans, on 150,000
American troops stationed in the Gulf, as Washington is afraid of a
biological arms attack by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- It is highly possible that the 32 million South Korean voters
will vote today Kim Dae-jung, the eternal opposition leader and bete
noire of the military regime in 1970s and 1980s. The next resident
of the Blue House presidential palace in Seoul will inherit a
country in full economic crisis and under the joke of financial
austerity.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- South Koreans today will vote the successor of President Kim
Young-sam. However, stunned by the unprecedented economic and
financial rout, they are not interested in a voting which promises
to be the most transparent in the political history of the country.
The effect of the psychological shock of the crisis on the voters is
the big variant in the voting, while the rate of abstention could
attain 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- The restructuring of the insurance market of France is
entering an effective phase. The French insurance group Assurances
Generales de France (AGF) will ratify on Friday several operations
to be jointly launched with the Italian group Generali and German
group Allianz. This will result in the increase of the sharing of
the French market by foreign insurance groups from the present 6
percent to 16 percent.

URUMQI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shixi Oilfield in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is expected to produce
870,000 tons of oil this year.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, located in the Junggar Basin, has verified
reserves of 120 million tons of oil and 29.8 billion cubic meters
of gas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, 155 oil wells in the oilfield had been

day. Shixi entered trial operations in March, 1995.
</P>
<P>
An oil pipeline currently links Shixi with Karamay City and a
147-km highway has opened to traffic. Work on other
infrastructure projects such as waterworks, power plants and
telecommunications networks are nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
Oil output in the Junggar Basin is expected to reach

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Women Playing Bigger Role in Social Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Only four years ago, Li Ruilan
was just an ordinary farming woman on the Altay prairie at the
north of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, taking care of her own
family.
</P>
<P>
Today, as the first woman in charge of a small multi-ethnic
village located about 1,000 km from Urumqi -- the regional
capital, Li is doing her best to help all the 200 fellow villagers
get rid of poverty and become well off.
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1994, Li was elected by fellow villagers as
head of the village, becoming a grass-root official at the most
basic administrative unit recognized by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
After years of hard work led by the mother of two, the per
capita annual income of the village has jumped from less than 800
to 1,200 yuan. Enjoying a better-off life, the villagers cannot
help thinking what a right choice they had made to elect Li Ruilan
as their leader.
</P>
<P>
"On the Altay prairie, it used to be unthinkable to have a
woman as a cadre," said Boqui, a Kazak farmer in the village. "Now
we know that we made a good choice, since she has proved herself
able to lead us to prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Li is by no means an isolated case in northwest China's
Xinjiang inhabited by many ethnic minority people. Xinjiang women
are playing increasingly bigger roles in society. Now, women make
up 42.5 percent of Xinjiang's government-appointed officials,
totalling 260,000, and about 60 percent of county and city
government and Communist Party bodies have female leading
officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinfeng, an official in charge of the regional women's
and children's work committee, explained that Xinjiang women have
an increasing awareness of participating in social affairs, thanks
to the improvement in their social status and educational levels.
</P>
<P>
In the region's current people's congress and people's
political consultative conference, women deputies and members
respectively account for 24 percent and 16 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Recover on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
recover on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index rose by 21.9 points to close at 1591.41 points
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the share prices moved higher as continued
firmness in the regional currencies saw investors seek out
"safe-haven" blue chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
The focus was on property stocks which rallied on rumors that
the government might relax the 20 percent cash downpayment
requirement for private property purchases and allow buyers to use
their CPF (Central Provident Fund) savings.
</P>
<P>
The CPF was set up in 1955 to provide financial security for
workers upon retirement or when they are no longer able to work.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased slightly to 197.34 million
units, valued at 372.8 million Singapore dollars (223.23 million
US dollars). Advances overtook declines by 215 to 124, while 267
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering was the most actively
traded counter as it registered a turnover of 15.53 million units.
It was followed by M Resources which had 14.06 million shares
traded. Rekapac was next with 8.24 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.3 dollars to finish at 23.4 Singapore
dollars. The United Overseas Bank (UOB) Foreign increased by 1.2
dollars to end at 10.8 Singapore dollars. The Overseas Chinese
Banking Corporation (OCBC) Foreign grew by 70 cents to close at
10.4 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, City Developments Warrant98 was the biggest
loser as it declined by 85 cents to end at 5.05 Singapore dollars.
Creative 50 lost 70 cents to close at 32.8 Singapore dollars,
while BerLand fell by 41 cents to finish at 1.2 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ban on Indian Fish Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua)-- Indian Commerce Minister of
State B. B. Ramaiah announced Thursday that the European Union
(EU) has decided to lift its ban on the import of Indian fish and
fishery products.
</P>
<P>
A formal notification by the EU will be issued shortly, he told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The EU banned the import of Indian marine products in August
this year on grounds of certain deficiencies in hygiene in some of
the fishery units in the country. A team of EU experts visited
India in June this year and proposed the ban for alleged lack of
hygiene and low standard of production.
</P>
<P>
India exported 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of sea food in
1996-97, of which 20 percent went to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, the Indian government has revamped export
inspection procedures and systems and strengthened the export
inspection council and its agencies. Detailed additional
guidelines have also been prescribed for the marine exporting
units wishing to export to the EU.

<HEADLINE> California Avocado Industry Faces Mexican Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Growers of avocado in
California have felt the pressure from their Mexican counterparts
as harvesting began this week.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the U.S. avocado market sources are from
California, where more than 57,000 acres of land are devoted to
the dark green pear-shaped fruit. San Diego County, in southern
California bordering Mexico, alone produces 40 percent of the
country's avocado or 140 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
Although avocado acreage has dropped 24 percent over the past
decade in California, it still generated an income of 259 million
dollars this year as compared with 203 million in 1987.
</P>
<P>
California farmers often have the capability of setting prices
themselves thanks to their virtual monopoly over the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation began to change since last month. For
the first time in 83 years, Mexico was permitted to market its
avocados in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
After heavy lobbying from the California avocado industry, the
Mexican imports are limited to a test market of 19 states in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican farmers, armed with the North American Free Trade
Agreement, have been pushing to expand the territory. They
harvested 1.7 billion pounds of avocados this year, while
California produced 340 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Although it would take some time for Mexican exports to expand
market shares, they have already presented a competitive threat to
San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
California farmers are in an inferior position in the
competition with their Mexican counterparts because of their
higher cost of labor and water.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Mexican farmers do not have to pay minimum wages,
workers' compensation and unemployment insurance as the
Americans.

BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will discuss the Middle East peace
process with leaders in the Middle East in an effort to promote
peace and development in the region, according to Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang today.
</P>
<P>
Tang responded to a question during today's regular news
conference by noting that China has good relations with countries
in the Middle East. China, a permanent member of UN Security
Council, has long been concerned with peace in the region and made
unremitting efforts to promote the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said China is deeply concerned about the stalled peace
process and noted that neither Arab countries nor Israel will
benefit from the continuing deadlock which is further complicating
the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
The international community should extend greater efforts to
promote peace and advance the Middle East peace process, according
to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Qian will also hold wide-ranging intensive talks with leaders
of Mideast countries on further developing relations between China
and these countries in order to deepen mutual understanding and
friendship, and increase cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian left Beijing for the Middle East earlier today.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Four emergency clinics are
being established around Kampala to fight cholera that claimed 23
people so far, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Kaggwa, the director of State Mulago Hospital which
is the most prestigious one in Kampala, told "The New Vision"
that the make-shift clinics in tents are set up in Mulago, Banda,
Ggaba and Ndeeba areas in the city where the situation is most
serious.
</P>
<P>
The number of the registered suspected cholera cases is 192 in
the capital and its adjacent areas, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Kaggwa said an arrangement was worked out by Health Ministry
of Uganda, World Health Organization (WHO), the French Medecens
Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Frontiers), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, the monitoring clinics are established
near the scene of outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
Mulago Hospital had received 100 patients by yesterday, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mayombwe, a medical officer in Kampala District, said
the local authorities have spent on each patient about 150,000
Ugandan Shillings (some 150 U.S. Dollars). The situation is under
control, he added.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has already spread to central Mpigi and Luwero
districts. An earlier report said the epidemic also appeared in
eastern Mbale and Kapchorwa Districts.
</P>
<P>
And 23 people so far have been killed by the disease, which
was caused by contaminated water sources in the wake of rains in
recent weeks. Earlier reports said floods destroyed drainages in
the city of Kampala.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Heilongjiang Reclamation
Area, the largest of its kind in China with 103 state farms, has
earned three billion yuan over the past six years by applying
modern agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
The area, also known as "Beidahuang" (vast wasteland in the
north), is located in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The
former wilderness is currently one of the country's most important
production bases for grain and other farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of 144 new techniques has enabled local
farmers to increase the per unit grain output, with the per
hectare output of soybeans growing from less than 1,500 kg to
1,950 kg.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of new technology has been a major factor
contributing to the development of the agriculture.
</P>
<P>
This year's total production of grain and soybeans is expected
to hit 8.5 billion kg, a dramatic 3.5 billion kg rise over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government has backed cultivation programs in the area, one
of the nation's largest plains, since they started some 50 years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
continued to show signs of improvement today, consolidating gains
at the 66.00 US cent level.
</P>
<P>
In subdued trading, the currency was unable to push above
resistance at 66.25 US cents but did retain its positive tone.
</P>
<P>
It settled at 66.07 US cents, up from yesterday's close of
65.77.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia manager Paul Macarounas said the
Australian dollar had received a boost in afternoon trade. The
strengthening in the local currency occurred at the same time as
the release of the federal government's mid-term economic review.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, Federal
Treasurer Peter Costello said the forecast Commonwealth 1997-98
underlying budget deficit had been revised to 2.746 billion
Australian dollars (1.81 billion US dollars) from 3.807 billion
Australian dollars (2.5 billion US dollars) in the May budget
papers.
</P>
<P>
The review also maintained that Australia's average gross
domestic product would increase 3.75 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar had started the session higher, buoyed by
a degree of optimism following Japan's announcement of a rescue
package to prop up its ailing economy but some traders suggested
caution.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese tax announcement surprised the market and
strengthened the yen." Macquarie Bank foreign exchange manager
Mark O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't readdress everything - bigger picture, nothing
has really changed. There are still problems in Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended at 84.15 yen
from 83.74 previously and at 1.1719 marks, from 1.1661.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Impoverished Area Eliminating Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Xihaigu area of China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is known as China's most
impoverished area, plans to completely eliminate poverty by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Ma Qizhi, the region's acting chairman, made the statement in a
recent interview with Xinhua. He said, "The area's remaining
760,000 people will live a better life at the end of the century,
with 600 yuan in per-capita annual income and 300 kg of grain."
</P>
<P>
Xihaigu is in a mountainous area in southern Ningxia. It has
2.2 million people and is burdened with difficult geographical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
China has 58 million poor people, about a 20th of the world's
total. The central government promised in 1993 that it would help
them get out of poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
So, the central government is allotting 30 million yuan for
Xihaigu annually, to improve infrastructure, because the
elimination of poverty there will be significant to the rest of
the nation in the anti-poverty campaign.
</P>
<P>
A railway has been opened in the area, there are roads to every
township, and all villages have electricity.
</P>
<P>
A new irrigation method -- rainwater irrigation -- will be used
there, the chairman said, adding that the region will participate
in a water diversion project, from the Yellow River, that will
irrigate 140,000 ha of land, as part of a resettlement program for
740,000 poor people.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Loans Upgrade Infrastructure in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Intensified inflow of overseas
funds, overseas government loans in particular, has helped north
China's Tianjin Municipality improve the investment climate in its
coastal New Area, the city's economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Preferred for its long duration and low interest rate, the
overseas government loans helped upgrade the infrastructural
facilities in the New Area, which comprises the Tianjin Economic
and Technology Development Zone, the Tianjin Port Bonded Zone, and
some other areas along the coast.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Economic and Technology Development Zone, for
instance, has introduced 14.5 million US dollars in foreign
government lendings for projects in heat supply, sewage treatment,
waste water processing, garbage incineration, and environment
protection.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the Tianjin Port Bonded Zone said his
zone welcomes foreign government loans to further promote its
investment environment. The zone has a total of more than 3,000
tax-free ventures and foreign trade companies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Tianjin used a total of 1.2 billion US
dollars in overseas funds between 1982 and 1996 and reported good
repayment records.

<HEADLINE> China Making Progress in CD Copyright Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Now it is difficult to find
pirated CD and VCD makers in China, a State Copyright
Administration spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the closing down of at least 50 illegal
production lines since last year, he said, adding the country has
confiscated several million smuggled CDs and VCDs this year.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental way to curb piracy is to encourage factories
to churn out more products welcomed by the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of the people, China has since October
reopened 15 closed-down production lines. And the country has
planned to create three CD and VCD conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
Camcorders are now commonplace in urban homes, and half the
world's sales volume of VCD machines are sold to the Chinese. The
lack of quality, cheap CDs and VCDs is the main reason why
copyright infringement is so out of control.
</P>
<P>
China in the first half of the year opened its first state-run
chain of stores that lease audio and video products and it plans
to set up at least 60,000 shops in the chain.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture has also opened wholesale markets in
some large cities as a move to limit copyright violations usually
done by private business people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that things are better for the audio and
video industry, and foreigners have more opportunities to enter
the Chinese market. Companies from the US, Britain and Japan
attended an international audio and video fair last
August in Beijing, and Warner Bros has agreed to allow a Chinese
VCD company to re-produce its Oscar winning films and to sell them
on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese CD and VCD producers should make an effort to
increase output, improve quality and lower prices, he said, adding
that the government's main target next year will be CD and VCD
smugglers.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Detains Two Bosnian Croat War Crime Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) detained two Bosnian Croat war crime
suspects earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The duo, identified as Vlatko Kupreskic and Anto Furundzija,
were detained in central Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kupreskic, indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for
former Yugoslavia for a 1993 massacre in which women, children and
old people were killed, was wounded during the capture as he
returned fire with an automatic weapon, according to NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
NATO chief Javier Solana announced the SFOR move by saying that
the action was taken in accordance with SFOR's mandate which
authorizes it to detain such persons when encountered in the
course of its duties.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR mandate, the NATO chief added, was given by the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's executive agency, under authority
contained in the relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"As has been the case throughout the IFOR and SFOR missions, we
will not tolerate any behavior by any party contrary to the
(Dayton) peace agreement," said Solana. "As confirmed this week by
NATO foreign ministers, SFOR will continue its firm and
even-handed approach to implementing its mandate and supporting
civil implementation."
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers endorsed during their Tuesday's meeting
the conclusions of NATO defense ministers of keeping SFOR at its
current force levels in Bosnia until next June to further
implement the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers argued that peace and the civil
implementation to uphold it are still fragile in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Solana said, "This action by SFOR stands as a warning to all
those indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they,
too, will be held accountable."
</P>
<P>
"They should take steps immediately to surrender themselves
voluntarily to the International Criminal Tribunal for former
Yugoslavia," Solana added.

<HEADLINE> Good Year For China's Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China has "achieved successes
in diplomacy this year", China's Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said in a recent interview with People's Daily, and
called it "an extraordinary year" for China.
</P>
<P>
China's Good-neighborly relations of friendship with
surrounding countries have increased and unity with developing
nations strengthened, and at the same time, relations with the
Western countries have improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Especially, he pointed out, there has been overall improvement
and increase in China's relations with the major powers.
</P>
<P>
China has called for a new type of state-to-state non-aligned,
non-confrontational relations that are not directed at a third
party, Qian said, adding that China is advocating a new security
concept of increased trust through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
China has been active in international and regional diplomatic
activities and economic co-operation, Qian said, and in this way,
has played a unique and active role in promoting world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
He attributes these successes to Deng Xiaoping's ideas on
diplomacy and China's independent foreign policy of peace. In the
future world structure, he said, China will be an active force for
maintaining peace and stability of the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, he said,
China fully recognizes its responsibilities and obligations and is
playing a constructive role and striving to establish fair and
reasonable international political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
It is ridiculous to regard China's economic development as a
"threat", he commented, pointing out that, in the past China was
bullied by the big powers and well remembers the ancient proverb
of not imposing on others what you yourself do not desire. China
will never be hegemonic when it is developed in the future, he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Launches Guangxi Project to Help Rural Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) will participate in an integrated and participatory
project to help 4,500 poor families in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region to overcome poverty, according to a UNDP
official in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will provide 1.5 million US dollars in grant, with
autonomous regional and county governments set to provide 4.72
million yuan as part of the governmental contribution program and
396,000 US dollars as part of government cost-sharing to support
the project implementation.
</P>
<P>
Targeted households, with approximately 22,500 people in total,
will be selected from five poor counties in the region, namely
Dahua, Debao, Duan, Longlin and Tianlin counties. These five
counties have high proportions of minority populations and are
poor, with the current annual net per-capita income of the farmers
ranging between 200-400 yuan only.
</P>
<P>
The targeted households will receive in-kind productive inputs
and technical training and services from the project for
income-generating activities.
</P>
<P>
The project will help increase the average annual net
per-capita income in targeted areas to reach 1,000-2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The project will also integrate social development dimensions
to improve the living conditions of the farmers in a sustainable
manner. Technicians, teachers and medical personnel will provide
farmers from targeted households, especially women, with training
in functional literacy and basic health care.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, various other training activities will be carried out
in the project to strengthen the capacity of autonomous regional
and county level staff members managing poverty alleviation
programs or projects. From a long-term point of view, other poor
farmers in the region will benefit from demonstrations,
dissemination and replication of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project will run three years through the year 2000. The
China International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges
will serve as the Executing Agency.

<HEADLINE> Rains in Tanzania Wreak Havoc on Major Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 18 (Xinhua ) -- Lasting rains have
damaged roads and bridges in various parts of Tanzania, adversely
affecting traffic during the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Roads in the Ministry of Works, Humphrey Urio,
told a press conference in Dar es Salaam Wednesday that 632
kilometers of roads have been damaged by rains.
</P>
<P>
Urio said 250 kilometers of highways and 208 regional roads
are currently impassable, adding that 174 kilometers of highways
are passable with difficulties, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The government is not in a position to repair the damaged
roads and bridges and is only putting up a temporary bridge over
Msimba River to connect Morogoro and Iringa regions. Construction
of the bridge will take between 10 and 15 days to complete, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, almost the whole country is inaccessible, he said,
adding that the ministry is looking for ways to improve the
deteriorating communication network.
</P>
<P>
He said roads such as Dodoma-Mwanza, Nangurukuru-Mandawa,
Sumbawanga-Tabora and those in the regions of Coast, Mwanza and
Arusha have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
Urio said the ministry is making emergency repairs on some of
the damaged roads including construction of Bailey bridges.
</P>
<P>
The government has also initiated a program to pull out all
vehicles stuck in mud along the affected roads which are causing
long queues.
</P>
<P>
The director, however, said it is not immediately known how
much money is required for the exercise as they are still
collecting data on the damages.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, regional engineers had been directed to use
available funds for the emergency repairs in their respective
areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite the unexpected rains caused by El Nino weather
phenomenon this year, Urio said human activities, especially
construction of houses and agricultural activities on hills, can
also be attributed to the damages.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fog Slowed down Pace of Beijing-Tianjin Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Beijing's
Tian'anmen Square viewed the imposing Tiananmen Rostrum as if it
were a misty "castle in the air" early this morning, as the city
was enveloped in this winter's heaviest fog.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing International Airport, the Beijing-Shijiazhuang
Expressway, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway were closed
temporarily because of the fog, which began to descend on most of
Beijing Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
An Air China official said that there were no flights in or out
of the International Airport from 8:00 PM yesterday to 10:00 AM
today. A total of 120 flights ertr suspended and nearly 10,000
passengers stranded. Most of them stayed in hotels arranged by the
airport.
</P>
<P>
In downtown areas this morning, traffic slowed to a snail's
pace and drivers turned on their fog lights, while police patrol
cars cruised the streets. One policemen on duty on the Second Ring
Road in the city's central part said they were holding the speed
of cars around there to 30 kilometers per hour in a bid to reduce
the chance of traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Traffic Control Bureau officials were out on
major streets early this morning to help keep maintain traffic
order.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fog has brought inconveniences to local residents. Many
bus commuters were late for work today. One young man hurrying by
on his bike was out of breath and said he found it hard to breathe
on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Meteorology Administration, all of
northern China was shrouded in heavy morning fog, and visibility
at the Meteorological Observatory at eight o'clock this morning
was merely 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Around 8 AM Wednesday, heavy fog caused two traffic accidents
on the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway with a chain of reactions, each
involving more than 40 vehicles, and leaving nine passengers dead
and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Tianjin, approximately 120 km east of Beijing,
the fog was reported to have lingered on for three consecutive
days, and the port operation came to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Some cases of carbon monoxide poisoning have been reported in
Tianjin, and the number of colds has sored to a new high because
of pollution levels in the city. Weather forecasters were advising
people to stay home if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
Back in Beijing, the fog was lifting by noon today, and the
first flight, headed for Kuwait, left the airport at 11:45 AM. And
seven flights left within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, meteorologists noted that the fog will become even
heavier this afternoon, but northern China is expected to be

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Probe Multi-Million Rand Heist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The South African police
this morning were combing the scene of a 10 million Rand (roughly
2 million U.S. Dollars) cash-in-transit robbery in Mpumalanga
Province in which six security guards were killed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association reported today that a gang
of 20 robbers attacked two armored vehicles belonging to SBV
Security, a company which transports cash for the country's major
banks.
</P>
<P>
The robbers used a stolen truck to force the armored vehicles
off the road between Kwaggasfontein and Siyabuswa, some 80
kilometers northeast of Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The truck crashed into the two security vehicles, causing one
of them to overturn. Three guards were killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The other three security guards were shot dead by the robbers.
</P>
<P>
One survived long enough to give police some information about
the attack. He later died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Bank robberies and robberies of cash in transit are
commonplace in South Africa, which is among countries with the
highest crime rates in the world.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Groups Playing Bigger Role In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises with different forms
of ownership in east China's Shandong Province have formed several
hundred industrial enterprise groups this year to increase their
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
They have combined assets of 100 billion yuan and pre-tax
profits that account for a fifth of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The Linghua Group, a township-run gourmet powder company
started in 1980 with 80,000 yuan, and has now acquired and
purchased eight medium-sized state-run enterprises with combined
assets of 280 million yuan. Further expansion and reorganization
have raised the group's annual production capacity to 80,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The China Light Motorcycles Group is now controlling six
different companies with total assets of six billion yuan, after
having set up joint ventures through mergers, acquisition and
other forms of co-operation. It produced 1.45 million motorcycles
and earned 835 million in pre-tax profits last year, making it the
largest motorcycle manufacturer in China.
</P>
<P>
Forms of mixed ownership have helped change the economic
structure of Shandong, improving overall economic performance,
according to one provincial government official. In the first
three quarters of this year, industrial output of enterprises at
or above the township level increased by 15.6 percent to 406.7
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fog Slowed down Pace of Beijing-Tianjin Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Beijing's
Tian'anmen Square viewed the imposing Tiananmen Rostrum as if it
were a misty "castle in the air" early this morning, as the city
was enveloped in this winter's heaviest fog.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing International Airport, the Beijing-Shijiazhuang
Expressway, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway were closed
temporarily because of the fog, which began to descend on most of
Beijing Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
An Air China official said that there were no flights in or out
of the International Airport from 8:00 PM yesterday to 10:00 AM
today. A total of 120 flights were suspended and nearly 10,000
passengers stranded. Most of them stayed in hotels arranged by the
airport.
</P>
<P>
In downtown areas this morning, traffic slowed to a snail's
pace and drivers turned on their fog lights, while police patrol
cars cruised the streets. One policemen on duty on the Second Ring
Road in the city's central part said they were holding the speed
of cars around there to 30 kilometers per hour in a bid to reduce
the chance of traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Traffic Control Bureau officials were out on
major streets early this morning to help keep traffic order.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fog has brought inconveniences to local residents. Many
bus commuters were late for work today. One young man hurrying by
on his bike was out of breath and said he found it hard to breathe
on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Meteorology Administration, all of
northern China was shrouded in heavy morning fog, and visibility
at the Meteorological Observatory at eight o'clock this morning
was merely 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Around 8 AM Wednesday, heavy fog caused two traffic accidents
on the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway with a chain of reactions, each
involving more than 40 vehicles, and leaving nine passengers dead
and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Tianjin, approximately 120 km east of Beijing,
the fog was reported to have lingered on for three consecutive
days, and the port operation came to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Some cases of carbon monoxide poisoning have been reported in
Tianjin, and the number of colds has soared to a new high because
of pollution levels in the city. Weather forecasters were advising
people to stay home if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
Back in Beijing, the fog was lifting by noon today, and the
first flight, headed for Kuwait, left the airport at 11:45 AM. And
seven flights left within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, meteorologists noted that the fog will become even
heavier this afternoon, but northern China is expected to be
assaulted by a cold front on Friday morning, which will help
disperse the fog in the area.

<P>
HARBIN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, capital city of China's
northernmost province of Heilongjiang, is witnessing the third
warmest winter since 1949.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial meteorological station, the
temperature for November averaged -2.5 degrees centigrade, 3.2
degrees higher than that of an average year and the third highest
one for November in the city since 1949.
</P>
<P>
The previous highs were -2.1 degrees centigrade for November of
1990, and -2.4 degrees centigrade for those of 1975 and 1994, said
Cai Yunqi, a senior meteorologist with the station.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of December, the average temperature
remained nearly two degrees higher than that of an average year,
and the higher temperature is expected to last throughout the
month.
</P>
<P>
Cai explained that the direct cause for the warm winter is that
cold eddies from the north pole, having stayed in the region above
60 degrees north latitude, has not exerted its influence on Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Reputed to be the coldest provincial capital in China, Harbin
has its biggest winter attraction in the annual ice and snow
festival. Due to the warm winter, the four snowfalls so far this
year has left few traces.

<HEADLINE> African Economic Growth Slowed Down in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Africa in
1997 slowed down to three percent from 4.4 percent in 1996,
today's Zambia Daily Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a United Nation's report published Monday as
saying that economic weakening in Morocco and South Africa as
well as in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe
also contributed to the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "The World Economy at the Beginning of
1998", said the economic expansion is nevertheless widespread and
relatively strong in over one-third of the countries monitored.
</P>
<P>
The two most significant factors behind the surge in growth
that Africa enjoyed in 1996, namely, high oil prices and improved
agricultural output, contributed much less to growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said oil prices declined and agricultural
production fell in many countries, including in Ethiopia, South
Africa and Zambia, after bumper crops raised agricultural output
to record levels in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Africa, said the report, is forecast to rebound to
about four percent in 1998, as the weather-related factors that
slowed growth in 1997 are expected to be temporary in most
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the El Nino weather phenomenon raises the likelihood
of poor rains for the 1997-1998 crop season, particularly in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa's economic growth could also be adversely affected in
1998 if export growth is held back by the currency crisis and
economic slowdown in east Asian countries, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Projects Backed by Thai Investment Board Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The value of projects promoted
by the government's Board of Investment (BOI) is likely to drop by
almost 19 percent in terms of the baht this year, according to BOI
Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon.
</P>
<P>
The total value of BOI-supported investment projects for this
year is likely to be only 430 billion baht (9.42 U.S. dollars
calculated at the present exchange rate), compared with 529.4
billion baht (20.76 billion dollars calculated at the exchange
rate of last year) last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline reflects the overall slowdown in the domestic
economy and the investment climate is expected to be even weaker,
Staporn said on Wednesday at a BOI meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is also the BOI chairman.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, applications for promotional privileges have
come from 970 projects worth a total of 500 million baht, while
last year applications came from 1,197 projects worth 834.6
billion baht (32.7 billion dollars).

A report at the meeting said that 24 large projects worth 116
billion baht, granted BOI privileges between 1993 and 1997, had
canceled their plans, and another 40 large projects have been
temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
However, Staporn said he is optimistic that the depreciation of
the baht would help boost growth in some investment sectors,
especially export-oriented and supporting industries such as
electronics, auto parts and agribusiness.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Detains Two Bosnian Croats Indicted for War Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO chief Javier Solana
Thursday announced that the NATO-led multinational Stabilization
Force (SFOR) had detained two Bosnian Croats indicted for war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's secretary general said that the capture of
Vlatko Kupreskic and Anto Furundzija was made during the night of
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The duo were indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal
for former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that the action was taken in accordance with SFOR's
mandate which authorizes it to detain such persons when
encountered in the course of its duties.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR mandate, the NATO chief added, was given by the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's executive agency, under authority
contained in the relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"As has been the case throughout the IFOR and SFOR missions, we
will not tolerate any behavior by any party contrary to the
(Dayton) peace agreement," said Solana. "As confirmed this week by
NATO foreign ministers, SFOR will continue its firm and
even-handed approach to implementing its mandate and supporting
civil implementation."
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers endorsed during their Tuesday's meeting
the conclusions of NATO defense ministers of keeping SFOR at its
current force levels in Bosnia until next June to further
implement the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers argued that peace and the civil
implementation to uphold it are still fragile in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Solana said, "This action by SFOR stands as a warning to all
those indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they,
too, will be held accountable."
</P>
<P>
"They should take steps immediately to surrender themselves
voluntarily to the International Criminal Tribunal for former
Yugoslavia," Solana added.

<HEADLINE> National Housing Bank Proposed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
been urged to set up a national housing bank to put together
financial resources to facilitate housing provision, according to
weekly Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
Zambia University, the highest learning institute in the
country, proposed that the funds from government, the community,
the private sector and the international community be put
together in one basket and then be channeled to the construction
industry at affordable interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The university said in a study that houses, especially for the
low-income and medium income groups, should be constructed either
partially or completely externally while the occupants can
complete the houses after occupying them, thus making houses more
affordable.
</P>
<P>
The local weekly quoted it as further recommending that
concessions and fiscal incentives such as the reduction of duties
on equipment, machinery and capital goods required by the
construction will do a lot of good to the provision of housing
stocks.
</P>
<P>
These concession should also be given to companies which
assist their employees in acquiring their own houses, said the
study.
</P>
<P>
During the survey by the university, most respondents said
that the government should give loans to those wanting to build
houses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Promotes Shareholding System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang, China's
northernmost province and a leading industrial center, is actively
deepening the reform of state and collective enterprises by
introducing shareholding enterprises and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial official, the province has already
established over 8,000 shareholding enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the developed areas in China,
shareholding enterprises in Heilongjiang are small in both number
and scale, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to deepen the reform, the province has called
for all enterprises with a sharp competitive edge to gradually
become sole proprietorships or shareholding companies in which the
state equity share exceeds 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
This will include industries producing special goods or
enjoying special state support.
</P>
<P>
The province has also called for well-equipped debt-ridden
enterprises to resort to diversified methods of reform, including
transforming debt into shares and turning revenue or unpaid taxes
into state-owned share capital.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises and institutions are encouraged to purchase shares in
the new enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shareholding cooperatives have been suggested for numerous
small to medium-sized state and collective firms.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has called on
law enforcers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to come up with a concerted plan of action to address
transnational crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert
Barbers made the call here Thursday when he inaugurated the
Experts Meeting of the First ASEAN Conference on Transnational
Crimes.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven participants representing police, prosecution and
interior offices from the nine ASEAN countries are taking part in
the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
"I challenge all of you attending this meeting to draw up a
concerted plan of action to address this problem," Barbers said.
</P>
<P>
Barbers called on the delegates to practice the ASEAN spirit of
unity, cooperation and solidarity in the fight against
transnational crimes, especially the newer forms -- phantom ship
frauds, product counterfeiting, piracy and fraudulent travel
documents.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said that the nature of transnational crime today has
become more complicated, prevalent and destructive, that the time
has come for an integrated ASEAN effort to effectively combat
these criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The Experts Meeting will last until Saturday when the Ministers
Meeting will take place.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from the nine ASEAN countries are expected to
sign an ASEAN declaration against transnational crimes, a document
which will serve to hasten the formation of an integrated body
which will deal with transnational crimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier On Hong Kong, Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has said China is confident
about Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, despite the
impact of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a recent interview with People's Daily,
China's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Administration by the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) has remained in good order over the
past five-odd months since China resumed the exercise of
sovereignty in Hong Kong on July 1 this year, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and "a high-degree of autonomy" have been
implemented in a substantive and effective manner, he added.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR has maintained prosperity and stability, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis which has affected Southeast Asia
has imposed some danger on the HKSAR, with the region's stock
exchange fluctuating by a wide margin and the Hong Kong dollar
unable to avoid related influences, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that measures adopted by the HKSAR
government, as well as the region's huge volume of foreign
exchange reserves, mature financial supervision and sound
financial policies have enabled Hong Kong to be in good
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China is fully confident about Hong Kong's future,
and noted that the central government and all the Chinese people
will offer powerful backing for the HKSAR and Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Hong Kong will continue to be a free harbor
and a center for international finance, trade and transportation,
and will maintain long-term prosperity and stability", said Qian.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's "practical diplomacy", Qian said that
reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of
the Chinese people throughout the world, and that relations across
Taiwan Straits have gained greater attention since Hong Kong's
return.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Qian, the trend for splittism which has
developed inside Taiwan has severely hindered the progress of a
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Taiwan authorities, faced
with pressure from various circles, has adopted a pose of
willingness to negotiate with the mainland. On the other hand,
however, they adhere to a position of splittism and make the
recognition of Taiwan as an "independent and sovereign state" a
precondition for negotiations. "This is completely counter
to the aspirations and demands of the Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian cited President Jiang Zemin's words in his report to the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party that as the
first step the two sides should conduct negotiations and reach an
agreement on formally ending hostilities in line with the "one
China" principle and then they should shoulder common obligations
to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and
draft plans for the future development of the relations across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the Taiwan authorities will follow the
historical development trend and seize the opportunity to make an
active reaction and wise choice regarding political negotiations
between the two sides", said Qian.

KAMPALA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 African
journalists from 16 countries have converged in Kampala to
discuss their role in the conflicts in the continent and
development of their countries, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Ruhakana Rugunda, Ugandan Information Minister, advised the
journalists to report the development in the continent correctly
and accurately.
</P>
<P>
Products of journalists will influence the decision-makers, he
noted in his opening address Monday.
</P>
<P>
African journalists must be aware that they are working under
the circumstances that Africans are made to perceive reality in
western terms, so African must be liberated in their mind first,
the minister reminded the participants of the conference.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants not only to assist in the resolution
of conflicts and the promotion of peace but also to identify the
fundamental causes of such conflicts with a view to preventing
them.
</P>
<P>
African journalists responded to the minister warmly.
Uncorrect reports are retarding development and deepening anarchy
in the continent, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Adbulraheem Tajudeen, the Secretary General of the Pan-African
Movement, said African media should be sources of information to
local people but not to be perpetrating unconfirmed sources from
imperialists.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the Center for Conflict
Resolution, will end its deliberations today.

<HEADLINE> Australia And Fiji Join To Fight Child Sex Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian and Fiji
governments will work together to stamp out child sex abuse in the
Pacific area following ministerial talks between the two countries
held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said, there had been
allegations of Australians committing child sex abuse in Fiji and
he hoped the joint action would discourage Australians from
looking to Pacific island countries as a paedophile destination.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's incumbent on the Australian government to do
everything it can to stamp that out," Downer was quoted by
Australian Associated Press from Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
"The way to do that is to enhance substantially the cooperation
between the various law enforcement agencies exchanging
information with each other, working together in a number of
different ways.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to make a big difference that we'll work
together much more closely in this area than was the case in the
past."
</P>
<P>
According to Downer, the discussions provided a framework to
strengthen cooperation on child sex abuse and other serious
crimes, but final details of an agreement would have to be
approved by the Fiji Cabinet later.
</P>
<P>
At today's talks, Downer and his counterpart Fiji Foreign
Affairs Minister Berenado Vunibobo also discussed an agreement to
negotiate advances in trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he wanted to encourage Australians to invest in
Fiji which had fixed up constitutional problems, making the
country more attractive to investors, and cited tourism as a key
growth area.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's trade with Fiji is in the vicinity of a billion
dollars so it's quite a substantial trade. Nevertheless, we want
to continue to develop that trade and where there are obstacles,
particularly administrative obstacles to that trade, we want to
try to remove or diminish those obstacles," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade and economic agreement is expected to be
finalized by June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Reform Not to Drive Whites Out: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 white
commercial farmers have been invited to come forward and work out
modalities on how the land redistribution program could be
speeded up for the benefit of all interested parties in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The Herald" today quoted Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
as saying in an interview with Cable News Network (CNN) Wednesday
that the land redistribution program was not meant to drive the
white commercial farmers out of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government wanted to fairly distribute the land to
landless Zimbabweans who did not have enough land to fend for
themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Zimbabwean government has decided to acquire
about 1,500 farms or five million hectares for resettlement and
commercial farming for the landless indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told CNN it was unfortunate that only about 4,000
farmers in the country owned about three-quarters of the best
land at the expense of the majority of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was determined to carry the land
apportionment program forward despite reservations expressed by
Britain over compensating the farmers for the lost land.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled rumors that the government ministers owned most
of the under-used farms that were not designated. This was
"nonsense" since only a few of the 22 cabinet members owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
He assured the nation that the landless people of Zimbabwe
would definitely get a piece of land as the government wanted to
answer the people's grievances on land and ensure that peace and
stability prevailed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Responding to whether the white community still have a place
in the country or not, Mugabe said, "surely, yes. There is a lot
of land in Zimbabwe. They still have a place to live."
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that the land apportionment exercise was
not meant to drive them out but to create an atmosphere which was
conducive to the majority.

<HEADLINE> Gas Negotiations Between Bulgaria, Russia in Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-Bulgarian
negotiations over Russia's supply of natural gas to Bulgaria have
been stranded as a result of the indefinite suspension of a joint
stock company operated by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was announced during a meeting of the
shareholders of the Topenergy Joint Stock Company in Moscow on
Tuesday, which also discussed the possible reincorporation of the
company.
</P>
<P>
In the session, the two Bulgarian private giants Multigrup and
Overgaz failed to sell their shares to Bulgaria's Natural Gas
Company (NGC), the official shareholder of Topenergy as required
in a contact signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The NGC, in return, announced on the same day, its retreat from
Topenergy. As a direct consequence, the Russian-Bulgarian
negotiations over the contracts on Russia's supply of natural gas
to Bulgaria have to be postponed until next year.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government decided this July to have the NGC buy
8.25 percent of shares of Multigrup and Overgaz in a bid to help
the NGC own an equal share in its business with its Russian
counterpart by holding 50 percent of Topenergy shares.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Russian natural gas company to
Topenergy refused Tuesday to meet with related Bulgarian energy
officials on the issue after Topenergy's full session "failed" to
provide conditions for breaking the current deadlock of bilateral
gas supply negotiations, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Afraid of the business deadlock's possible harm to
Russian-Bulgarian relations, Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister
Yevgeny Bakardzhiev criticized the two private companies for
breaking their promises.
</P>
<P>
Bakardzhiev said on behalf of his government, Bulgaria will
hold direct talks with the Russian government or Russia's natural
gas company, keeping clear of the "intermediary."
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian energy officials said that if Russia stops its gas
supply, Bulgaria will "look for support from the West."
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian official newspaper "Democracy" Wednesday also
criticized Multigrup and Overgaz for their business perfidy,
saying that it is "blackmail" to the country.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian state TV reports said Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
is trying to contact his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin
on the issue.

Germany, Netherlands, Indonesia, Greece, Belgium, Australia,
Sweden, Ethiopia, the U.S., Czech Republic, Italy, Norway, Japan,

</P>
<P>
It was expected the observer arrangement could help maintain
peace and order on the election day.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people were injured and a number of cars stoned in
Kenya's third-largest city of Kisumu on Wednesday when supporters
of presidential candidates Daniel arap Moi, Charity Ngilu and
Raila Odinga met face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
Two Kenyans have been killed and at least 50 arrested over
election-related violence countrywide since November 15.

BANGKOK -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said on Wednesday
that Thailand's economy would start to recover after four to five
months.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on revision of the Eight National Development Plan
(1995-1999), he indicated that the worst times for the economy are
anticipated in the next four to five months, adding that matters
would remain critical for five to six months, particularly if the
country fell short of revenue targets. The situation has changed
dramatically since the Eighth National Development Plan was made
and now it is a good opportunity to review strategy and the
direction of development and adopt appropriate guidelines for the
rest of the plan period, he added. (Thailand-Economy-PM)

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on International Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently noted that the overall trend
of the current international situation is gaining speed towards
multi-polarization.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with People's Daily, Qian pointed to many
changes in the international situation and relations between major
powers during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the demand for independence, self-reliance and
coordinated development is on the rise both on a regional basis
and in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Relations between major powers have been reshaped from a
strategic perspective, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that various regional and multilateral cooperative
mechanisms are expanding, and developing countries are becoming an
undeniable force in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that economic elements have become
increasingly prominent in international relations and countries
are becoming more interdependent.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia has affected many
nations and areas, and the governments of all countries are faced
with the task of strengthening coordination in the process of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that partnerships established between major powers
signal the fact that such relations are gaining greater stability
than even before.
</P>
<P>
Qian said frequent contacts between the United States, European
nations and Russia on European affairs, and bilateral meetings
between leaders of China, the United States, Japan and Russia have
attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
He said readjustments in relations between different countries
will help to build an international environment conducive to the
development of their respective countries and are their strategic
choice geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that a common characteristic of the various
partnerships is to seek the convergence of their common
interests. He noted that the readjustments in relations conform
with the historical trend of peace and development.

<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa has said he will not resign from cabinet
unless the people, and not the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
(ZCTU), want him to, "The Herald" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to calls by ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda for him
and Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri to resign, Dabengwa
told the herald Wednesday that he would resign any day if the
people supported Sibanda's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda Tuesday demanded the immediate resignation of Dabengwa
and Chihuri, warning that another mass demonstration would be
organized to back this demand.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU accuses the two men of hampering last week's
demonstrations in Harare and of being behind the assault of ZCTU
Secretary-general Morgan Tsvangirai by about eight unidentified
assailants last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "it looks like the ZCTU wants the
government to collapse so they can take over as has happened
elsewhere on this continent because they have no basis for even
threatening another mass demonstration."
</P>
<P>
He said the demonstration in Harare was only dispersed because
some hooligans had started looting shops as early as 7 a.m. The
police had the support of the people to stop the demonstration,
he added.

<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Some one million Chinese
policemen will be tested and undergo appraisals of their
professional and physical capabilities over the next two years,
according to a notice recently issued by the Ministry of Public
Security.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the notice, which will be implemented in 36
major cities, is to improve the basic quality of the national
police force, according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police authorities have pledged to offer periodical
organized in-service training courses to help all police officers
pass the test and appraisals in order to form a truly professional
force.
</P>
<P>
"Those who fail the test or the appraisal will be
temporarily relieved and will undergo a six month training
course," according to the notice. "Those who fail after taking
training courses will be dismissed from their posts."
</P>
<P>
The ministry also has plans to test and appraise directors of
public security bureaus at county level, "with the dismissal of
officials unqualified for their positions," according to the
notice.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Public Security pointed out
that the fundamental means for improving the basic quality of the
national police force centers on encouraging competition and

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Cooperation in Southern Africa Enters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa, a
region which has suffered from frequent civil wars, reportedly has
some 20 million mines scattered and that has become a great
impediment to post-war reconstruction in countries like Mozambique
and Angola.
</P>
<P>
To solve this critical problem, SADC leaders to the Blantyre
summit signed a landmark declaration, calling for Southern Africa
free of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, South Africa, a political, economical and
military power in Africa, took the lead in announcing in February
to impose a comprehensive and immediate ban on anti-personnel
landmines.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria's attitude towards mines prompted representatives of
SADC countries to meet in Harare, Zimbabwe, in April to discuss
regional and international cooperation in mine clearance on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"The gathering marked a turning point in efforts to free the
Southern African region of landmines," said Cornelio Sommaruga,
President of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The southern African countries also tried to join hands to
curb increasing crimes in the region. On October 1, an agreement
was signed by SADC countries to promote cooperation and
integration in fight against cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the signatory countries will cooperate
one another and offer all convenience in the process of
investigating suspects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SADC posed to become important partners in the
world economy. Its cooperation with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the fields of trade and investment is
one of the examples.
</P>
<P>
Following inaugural talks between ASEAN and SADC ministers at
last year's meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore,
a second meeting was held in Kuala Lumpur in mid-October this
year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from steps to promote trade and investment between the
two regions, the meeting also discussed cooperation in technical
assistance, education and human resouces development.
</P>
<P>
Currently, South Africa has become a major recipient of direct
investment from Malaysia, which has poured an estimated three
U.S. billion dollars into the country, making it the second
largest foreign investor for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The SADC's trade with Middle East countries, especially Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates has also been
on increase in the past few year.
</P>
<P>
The SADC is also looking forward to enhancing its
economic and trading ties with the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) in Latin America, which groups Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile and Bolivia being associate
members.
</P>
<P>
While the SADC is making headway in the political and economic
fields, one must realize the regional group is also facing some
thorny problems.
</P>
<P>
One of the most critical problems facing it is trade
imbalance. Some countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Mauritius are accused of being protectionists, trying to dominate
the region by placing high tariffs on imports, thus making
exports from other SADC members uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
What is more, social problems like poverty, unemployment,
crime and political democracy remained to be solved in many
Southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that economic backwardness and
poverty are the hotbed of all unstable elements. In this sense,
SADC member states can never succeed unless each of them spares
no efforts to develop its own economy while maintaining close
ties with other nations in the SADC framework.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the economic development disparity among member
states and disputes on trade and economic integration, analysts
said that the SADC, as a rising regional leader, will ultimately
overcome problems facing it and lead the nations into political
stability and economic prosperity.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Three Major Issues Related to Return of Macao to Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The three major issues related
to the return of Macao to the motherland, namely the localization
of civil servants and laws and the status of Chinese as an
official language, have become more urgent for solution as the
return of Macao approaches.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that these issues are important for the
implementation of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the
principles of "one country, two systems", "Macao people governing
Macao" and "high-degree of autonomy" set forth in the Basic Law
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The issues are also closely related to the practical interests
of the people of Macao and a smooth transition, they say.
</P>
<P>
There has been some progress in solving the three issues in
recent years, thanks to the efforts made by China and Portugal,
but it is still not enough.
</P>
<P>
Because there are only two years left until Macao returns
to the motherland, there is still much work to do, the media
report.
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil servants is regarded the most urgent
of the three issues, observers say. According to the Basic Law of
the Macao SAR, major officials of Macao should be Chinese citizens
who are permanent residents of the region.
</P>
<P>
They say that it is only when more Chinese residents of Macao
serve as senior civil servants can the principle of "Macao
people governing Macao" be realized after Macao returns to the
motherland on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have agreed to accomplish the localization
of civil servants above the director level by the end of 1998, and
the Chinese government hopes that the Portuguese side will
accelerate the process.
</P>
<P>
At present, directors and vice-directors of Chinese origin in
the Macao government account for only 13.5 percent of the total,
and the first director of Chinese origin took office only in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese is still the most frequently used language in
government operations, although Chinese is being used in many
government departments. Documents issued by some government
departments are only in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
In the localization of laws, only two of the five local codes
-- the criminal code and criminal procedure code -- have so far
been adapted to Macao.
</P>
<P>
The localization of the three others -- the civil code, the
civil procedure code and the commercial code -- should also be
accelerated, and Macao should train a judiciary to serve the
future SAR.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Die of Cholera in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- With nine more reported
dead in the last 24 hours, death toll of cholera victims in
Zanzibar has surpassed 100, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said that six cholera patients died at hospital
yesterday, while three more bodies were brought to hospital from
outside for burial arrangements in accordance with cholera
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the situation is still serious with children and
women being the most affected.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has deployed two
medical donors, two vehicles, a large shipment of supplies,
including much needed ringers lactate, oral rehydration salts and

</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government has obtained 100 tons of medical

</P>
<P>
A study, done by the Ministry for Health, has revealed that
the source of the epidemic was the lack of latrines and waste

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cholera had killed a total of 1,780 people by
December 6, the Principal Secretary in the Health Ministry, Ray
Mrope, told the Guardian on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Asian Downturn Lowers Australian Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello Thursday conceded the expected downturn in Asia had
lowered Australia's short-term prospects for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the federal government's mid-year economic and fiscal
outlook, Costello said he expected the effect of the financial
instability in Asia would be felt more in next 1998-99 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
"Financial instability in several Asian economies has lowered
short-term growth prospects for the region," Costello said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The effect in Australia is likely to be felt more in 1998-99
than in 1997-98."
</P>
<P>
Costello said the preliminary forecasts for 1998-99 indicate
that economic growth is expected to be about 3.25 percent, "weaker
than the anticipated outcome for 1997-98".
</P>
<P>
"Australia's strong and improving fiscal position has been
important in helping to shield the economy from the instability
experienced in some other countries in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mid-year review maintained the growth forecast for 1997-98
of 3.75 percent, with stronger domestic demand offsetting the
weaker external picture caused by the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the slower growth resulting from a weaker international
environment was expected to impact on employment growth, though
not until later in the financial year.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, employment growth through 1998-99 is likely to be
similar to that through 1997-98," the outlook said.
</P>
<P>
On the budget position, the review showed the underlying
deficit for 1997-98 narrowed to 2.8 billion Australian dollars
(1.87 billion U.S. dollars) from the preliminary forecast of 3.9
billion Australian dollars (2.61 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Due to the greater-than-expected proceeds of asset sales,
including the one-third privatization of Telstra
(Telecommunication Company), the headline surplus almost doubled
to 11.782 billion Australian dollars (7.89 Billion U.S. dollars)
from 6.4 billion Australian dollars (4.28 billion U.S. dollars) on
budget night.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- About 70,000 to 100,000
Nepalese women and children are working in Indian brothels, The
Kathmandu Post newspaper Thursday quoted a survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of them are under the age of 18 and 70 percent
illiterate, said the survey sponsored by the Central Social
Welfare Board.
</P>
<P>
The major factors contributing to the commercial sexual
exploitation of women and children are poverty and unemployment or
lack of appropriate rehabilitation, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent of them want to be rescued from the
brothels, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
Trafficking in women and girls across the 1,750-kilometre-long
open Indo-Nepal border is one of the most pressing issues in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 5,000 to 7,000 Nepalese women and
girls are trafficked every year for flesh trade in India and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Cooperation in Southern Africa Enters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
which witnessed encouraging achievements in regional cooperation
in the past few years have come to realize that economic development
and political stability are of most importance in promoting cooperation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Africa has been frequented by conflicts, coups and waves of
refugee for decades, but positive changes have taken place in the
passing year in this part of the world, especially in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to an official survey, gross domestic product in
Southern Africa has increased by more than six percent since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in southern Africa covered the fields of energy,
transport and communication, culture and information, agriculture,
fisheries and human resources development.
</P>
<P>
Three development corridors -- Maputo, Beira, and Nacala
jointly undertaken by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique are
widely regarded as good examples of regional cooperations, which
will greatly benefit the national economic development of the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) stands out
as a strong flagship in regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, born in 1992 with 10 member states at the beginning,
has been devoting itself to the establishment of a free trade
zone in Southern Africa by 2004, and has become one of the most
effective and efficient regional groups in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Although the magnificent plan of the SADC is yet to be
realized, more and more African countries have come to realize
that the SADC will be a strong force in promoting economic
integration, cooperation and regional stability.
</P>
<P>
At its 17th annual summit, held in Blantyre, Malawi, on
September 8, the SADC accepted two new members -- the Democratic
Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, and the Seychelles,
making the 12 member grouping 14. They are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and the two new comers.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the organization shows its growing attraction
and influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, two important protocols on trade and mining
were signed. Economically speaking, the summit has paved way for
further economic cooperation since the mining industry is an
important employment channel and a major foreign exchange
earner for many member states.
</P>
<P>
While attaching great importance to economic development,
the SADC also took an active part in political affairs in the
region and the continent as a whole. ( to be continued )

<HEADLINE> NZ to Remove Car Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
announced today it will scrap the tariff on imported cars from
December 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister John Luxton said removing the tariff would
lead to cheaper cars and light commercial vehicles for families
and businesses, and removing it was an essential element in the
Government's strategy for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the tariff would be reduced by 2.5 percent a year from
the current 22.5 percent to 15 percent on July 1, 2000, and would
go altogether at the end of that year.
</P>
<P>
"Tariffs not only increase the price of new cars by around
3,000 NZ dollars to 4,000 NZ dollars (1,750 to 2,300 US dollars)
but are also a significant component in the price of a used
vehicle," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The move will cost the Government 300 million dollars (1.75
million US dollars) a year in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Economists, car dealers and unions are all predicting that the
move will kill the local car assembly industry, which employs
1,500 workers and hundreds of others in related industries. Even
Luxton acknowledged on Thursday the local motor industry was
likely to close.

<HEADLINE> KLM, Alitalia Form Strategic Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian carrier Alitalia
announced today it has formed an alliance with Dutch airline KLM
and will consider a possible merger after a period of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued today, the two sides
will rearrange the routes and booking systems, making Amsterdam,
Milan, Malpensa and the Rome airport the bases of their
cooperation. The alliance, however, involves no exchange of stock
and no immediate merger is planned.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia made the choice in its effort to enhance profits and
sharpen its competitive edge before moving toward privatization
next year.
</P>
<P>
The choice of KLM instead of Air France had been expected,
despite reports that the Italian government was keen to
consolidate an industrial axis with Paris.
</P>
<P>
The French government had also pressed diplomatically for the
alliance with Alitalia, but the airlines managing director,
Domenico Cempella, was known to favor the Dutch option because it
would guarantee Alitalia's independence and further privatization.
</P>
<P>
The press here published figures showing that the KLM, with 27
fewer planes and transporting just over half of Alitalia's
passengers, managed to fly to more places and turned a healthy
profit.
</P>
<P>
The KLM had net profits of 205 billion Lire (119 million
U.S. dollars) in the year to March 1997, while Alitalia recorded
losses of 1.2 trillion Lire (579 million U.S. dollars) during 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch flag-carrier, KLM, the 10th largest airline in the
world, was privatized in 1986. At present only 25 percent of its
stock is in the hands of public authorities, while the remainder
is quoted on stock markets in Amsterdam, New York, Brussels and
Frankfurt.

<HEADLINE> 5,300-Year-Old Mummy to Be Returned to Italy for Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The 5,300-year-old remains of a
prehistoric man, found on the Italian-Austrian border, will be
returned from Austria to Italy for permanent exhibition by January
20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In Bolzano, a museum with a refrigerated cell has been set up
to house the mummy. Objects found beside the body, including
leather clothes and shoes, an axe, a quiver for arrows and a
flint, will also be on display in March next year.
</P>
<P>
The mummy was found on September 19, 1991 by an Austrian
couple, who, during a mountain excursion, accidentally stumbled on
the frozen body at an altitude of 3,200 meters in the Similaun
Glacier in Italy's Alto Adige region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists had to be called in, however, to determine on which
side of the Italian-Austrian border the body was found, as the two
countries both claimed ownership of the mummy.
</P>
<P>
Italy won the dispute. The Austrians, who had whisked the
mummy off for studies at the Prehistory Institute of the
University of Innsbruck, finally agreed to return the mummy later.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown the man, which the Italians called the
Similaun Man, was 45 years old when he died of cold and
suffocation about 5,300 years ago. It was the oldest human
remains found in Europe until the fall of 1996, when the bodies of
two children living some 6,500 years ago were discovered.

<HEADLINE> Thai Lower House Passes Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives
of Thailand has passed a relaxed bankruptcy bill to allow debtors
and creditors more flexibility in negotiating their debt payment
and reorganizing businesses instead of immediate closure.
</P>
<P>
The house on Wednesday approved in its third reading the bill
proposed by the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh government in August this
year to amend the present one to reflect the existing economic
troubles in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, debtors and creditors are allowed to find
alternatives to settle debt problems instead of filing suit in
court and liquidating assets, which can cause substantial losses
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The new bill sets a more strict timetable for bankruptcy cases
and it requires a company to submit a rehabilitation plan to the
court within three months after the bankruptcy case is filed, with
only two revisions allowed before the court approves the plan
within five months.
</P>
<P>
The court also can appoint an independent agent or creditor to
oversee business rehabilitation process which is allowed for five
years.
</P>
<P>
If the rehabilitation plan fails after five years, the assets
of the company will be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
The local media said that the bill will be sent to the Upper
House for review and approval and then it will become a law after
it is published in a royal gazette.

<HEADLINE> India Identifies New Areas to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
identified six more areas that will help it formulate an action
plan for the next 10 years in the tourism sector, official sources
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new areas are: infrastructure, taxation, facilitation at
airports, human resource development, effective marketing and
incorporating information technology in the accounting system.
</P>
<P>
The new tourism policy is yet to be approved by the cabinet.
The Tourism Ministry will start work in areas that will lay the
foundation for development of tourism in India once the new policy
is approved.
</P>
<P>
A supervisory agency in international airports is imperative to
woo tourists. The new body will co-ordinate the agencies involved
in clearing passengers, especially foreign tourists, at
international airports.
</P>
<P>
Attracting tourists is as important as creating an impression
which will make them return to India, starting from the airport
itself, with facilities like good, clean taxis and quick clearance
at the immigration counters, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Tourism Ministry said that India must start
offering adventure tourism to promote tourism as a whole in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Rectify Defense Ministry Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Special
Commission on Taxation and Budget resolved Wednesday to rectify
the financial system within the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian government's press secretary Igor
Shabdurasulov, the commission had a meeting Wednesday presided
over by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The commission decided
to rectify the methods for regulating the defense budget, and the
soldiers' pay and provisions expenses.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin described the financial regulation of the army as
"very bad." He said strict measures should be taken to prevent
behavior leading to the misappropriation of funds, including
personnel management measures.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin pointed out that his remarks were not directed
against the Minister of Defense Igor Sergeyev because he has held
the post for only a short time.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told the press that the commission's decision includes
improving the financial system of the more powerful departments,
to manage the financial affairs of these departments through state
financial institutions and to enhance mutual supervision among
these departments.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the military supervision institute has been
authorized to rectify the financial work of the army, and the
Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the reform of the
army's financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev stressed that squandering money, embezzlement and
misappropriation of public funds are all destructive to the combat
effectiveness of the army.
</P>
<P>
Reports say pecuniary losses occurring as the result of illegal
and criminal cases in the army in 1996 amounted to 100 billion
rubles (approximately 18 million US dollars). In 1997 the amount
of money squandered and embezzled in the army rose 26.8 percent,
while the amount misappropriated was up 48.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Announce U.S. Keeps Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will announce Wednesday that U.S. troops will continue to be
deployed in Bosnia when the mandate of the current Stabilization
Force (SFOR) expires next June, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The size of the follow-on force and its American contingent
will depend on arrangements to be worked out with NATO allies,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Clinton said he
would announce his plans before his flight to Bosnia, where he is
to visit the U.S. troops and meet Bosnian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is caught between pressure from
Congress asking for a complete pullout of all the 8,000 U.S.
troops and its allies who insist that peace will collapse if the
peacekeepers withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and other European countries have indicated
that they would withdraw their troops from Bosnia if the U.S.
does.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the administration's lack of an exit strategy on
the peacekeeping mission, many lawmakers in the U.S. Congress fear
that the U.S. troops may be caught up in any flare-up of the
conflict in Bosnia if they stay longer.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has postponed two previous deadlines for the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Any further deployment of U.S. troops beyond next June will
need to be approved by the Senate and Clinton needs to explain why
it is necessary in Congress.

the polls Thursday, an official holiday, to elect a new president
who will lead the country through its current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,407 polling stations opened at 6 a.m. and will
close at 6 p.m. for the 32.29 million eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
Ballot counting will start at about 7 p.m., and the results of
the election are expected to be released by Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The three major presidential candidates -- Lee Hoi-chang of the
Grand National Party, Kim Dae-jung of the National Congress for
New Politics, and Rhee In-je voted in their respective
constituencies this morning for the single five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Lee and Kim are running neck-and-neck, while Rhee
is trailing not far behind in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Lee, a former prime minister of the ruling
party, reportedly enjoys strong support in Taegu and the
surrounding North Kyongsang Province, while Kim, a 72-year-old
veteran opposition leader, holds an overwhelming lead in his power
base in Cholla region and Kwangju city.
</P>
<P>
The contest in Seoul is the most intense, in which voters
account for a quarter of the total.
</P>
<P>
Election officials predict that voter turnout, as a result of
the influence of the current financial crisis ailing the country,
will be lower than the previous election. And one of the
campaigners could likely become president with only 39-41 percent
of the vote.

<P>
PRAGUE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Josef Tosovsky was appointed as
the prime minister of the Czech Republic on Wednesday as the
second head of government after the independence of the republic
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Tosovsky, an economist and financial expert, was born on
September 28, 1950 in the city of Nachod close to the border of
Poland.

Czech Economic College in 1973, Tosovsky has been enaged in
financial business.

<P>
He worked for the National Bank of the former Czechslovakia
during 1973-1984, and then the Czechslovak Commercial Bank London
Branch from 1984 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1989, Tosovsky served as a consultant to the
President of the Czechslovak National Bank and assumed the post of
the bank's president in 1992 after the division of the
Czechslovakia into two independent states in 1993. He transferred

<P>
For days, the Civic Democratic Party, Christian Democratic
Union-Czechslovak and Civic Democratic Alliance have undergone
many rounds of arduous negotiations on the formation of the new
cabinet and, particularly, the selection of a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the appointment of Tosovsky was the result of
the combined concession made by the various parties.
</P>
<P>
They said the Tosovsky government will possibly be a
transitional one and it it likely that an early election will be
held next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Discover Herbal Treatment For Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a herbal medicine which they say can be used to treat
diabetes II, which affects at least 25 million Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the China Academy of Traditional Medicines
made the medicine, "Tangmaikang", but the Ministry of Health will
not disclose the names of most of them, to protect the formula.
</P>
<P>
"'Tangmaikang' has a noticeable effect in treating
complications of diabetes by reducing cholesterol and glycerin in
the blood," Professor Fu Shiyuan, president of the academy, told a
symposium on diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes complications include heart disease, cerebral vascular
disease, kidney disease, loss of eyesight, and other serious
problems. "But, almost all the sugar-reducing drugs are no help in
treating the complications," Fu explained.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder related to insulin, a hormone
controlling the passage of sugar from the blood to the tissue,
where excessive amounts of sugar occur in the blood and in the
urine, and are associated with loss of weight and excessive thirst.
</P>
<P>
With improved standards of living and the gradual increase in
the amount of Western-style food in the diet over the past decade,
an increasing number of people in China, India and other
developing countries are suffering from diabetes. There are at
least 750,000 new cases of diabetes in China each year, according
to a Ministry of Health official.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese researchers should do further studies on insulin
levels in patients who use Tangmaikang so that it can be accepted
by the Western medical community and be sold on the international
market," Professor Chen Keji, an advisor to the WHO and a member
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says.
</P>
<P>
The China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine's Zhonghui
Pharmaceutical Co. recently built a plant to produce five billion
yuan worth of Tangmaikang annually, along with other Chinese
medicines, in Chengdu, Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
International sales of herbal medicines amount to 15 billion US
dollars annually, but Chinese traditional medicine only accounts
for 600 million US dollars of that. "The marketing of Tangmaikang
internationally will help boost exports of Chinese medicine,"
Prof. Fu comments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Electronics Export Target for 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
set a target of electronic export at 35 billion U.S. dollars in
2004, the final year of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan
(1999-2004), a government official said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the nation's electronics industry is mainly
the result of foreign and domestic investments, which are
continuing to pour into the industry, Director of Electronics
Industry at the Ministry of Industry and Trade Ardiansyah said
Wednesday in Bandung, West Java, reports reaching here Thursday
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on an industrial vision in the
development of national information infrastructure, Ardiansyah
said that 10 billion U.S. dollars worth of additional investments
will be needed in the next seven years to realize the target in
2004.
</P>
<P>
"If everything runs as planned, the total export value in 2006
may even reach 40 billion U.S. dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the 40 billion U.S. dollars will come from the exports
of information technology equipment, wireless telecommunication
equipment, consumer electronics, semiconductors, electronic
household equipment and electronic components as well as modules.
</P>
<P>
Electronic companies in Indonesia have grown rapidly since the
beginning the 90s mainly because they are supported by
liberalization in tariffs and the reduction of bureaucratic
requirements to obtain operational licenses, he said, adding that
most of the nation's electronics companies are export oriented.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that the exported electronic goods
still contain a limited amount of local contents. The local
contents, I believe, only total around 5 percent," he added.

<HEADLINE> Income Disparities Widen in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 17 (Xinhua) -- California's poor and
middle-class families have experienced sharp income falls over the
past two decades while the richest enjoys soaring gains.
</P>
<P>
According to a new state-to-state study by the Washington-based
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a national nonpartisan
research organization, the incomes of Californian wealthest
families which are comprised of one-fifth state population were up
30 percent since 1978, while the poorest, making up one-fifth of
the population, had lost 27 percent of the incomes they once had.
</P>
<P>
California is not the only U.S. state experiencing the widening
income disparities. In fact, the study on income trends shows that
income disparities between the richest families and families at
the bottom and middle of the income scale have grown substantially
in almost every state over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The study also finds that despite the strong economic growth in
recent years, income disparities are significantly greater than
they were at the comparable point in the business cycle during the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The richest families have gained their incomes by investing
their money in stock markets and financial products.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, there was no state in the country where the
richest families had average incomes 10 or more times larger than
those of the poorest. But by the mid-1990s, 30 states had
"top-to-bottom" ratios of 10 or greater.
</P>
<P>
The study said that fundamental changes in the U.S. economy are
responsible for much of the growth in income disparities.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Unemployment Still High: ECLAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Urban unemployment rate
in Latin America and the Caribbean dropped slightly to 7.5 percent
in 1997 compared to 7.7 percent in 1996, but in historical terms,
it is still high, said the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report "Preliminary Balance of Latin America and
the Caribbean Economy - 1997," released Wednesday in Santiago, the
institution said the decline was not due to the lack of jobs but
to an increase of irregular economic activities by laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions were Mexico and Argentina, where economic growth
contributed to the creation of new jobs, the report added.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay experienced a rise in the
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
In most regions of the countries, economic reforms over recent
years that could not be assimilated led to a major loss of jobs,
explained the ECLAC.

NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has further bolstered the defenses of the country's currency
rupee as it hovered within striking distance of all-time lows.
</P>
<P>
The RBI increased the interest charged on overdue export bills
by five percentage points to 20 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It also imposed a 15 percent surcharge on the lending rate on
import credit for select goods and commodities.
</P>
<P>
The steps taken by the RBI are aimed at persuading exporters to
bring home earnings faster and making non-essential imports
dearer, a government official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government's latest moves came after the rupee closed at
39.36/39 per U.S. dollar, much lower than before. The dealers said
the RBI spent up to 200 million dollars intervening on Tuesday to
pull the rupee away from an imminent strike at the 40 rupee per
U.S. dollar level.

BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said on Wednesday that Thailand's economy would start to
recover after four to five months.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on revision of the Eight National Development Plan
(1997-2001), he indicated that the worst times for the economy are
anticipated in the next four to five months, adding that matters
would remain critical for five to six months, particularly if the
country fell short of revenue targets.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation has changed dramatically since the Eighth
National Development Plan was made and now it is a good
opportunity to review strategy and the direction of development
and adopt appropriate guidelines for the rest of the plan period.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to accept that the path to recovery would
be long and rough and that there was no miracle cure for the
economy, according to the Bangkok Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although three cuts have been made in the budget, the
government would still fall short of the targeted 800 billion baht
(16.5 billion U.S. dollars) revenue collection in fiscal 1998,
which ends in September next year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for the promotion of tourism and
exports to pull in foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> IDB to Inject 100 Million Dollars into Indonesia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Development Bank
(IDB), together with other Islamic banks from the Middle East and
Malaysia, are planning to inject 100 million U.S. dollars into
Indonesia's capital market, IDB portfolio director B.M. Qureshy
said.
</P>
<P>
Qureshy, who led a group of commercial bankers from Kuwait,
Qatar, Bahrain and Malaysia on a visit here, said Wednesday after
meeting with Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad that he
believed that Indonesia's economic fundamentals remained strong.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, it was agreed that IDB and some Islamic
commercial banks would help Indonesia get out of the current
monetary crisis by investing in Indonesian stocks, Thursday's
local press quoted officials at the Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian stock market has nosedived alongside a sharp
fall in the value of the rupiah (national currency) since July
this year. The main market barometer closed trading Wednesday at
368.685 points compared to above 720 levels before July.
</P>
<P>
Minister Mar'ie said after the meeting that the capital
injection into Indonesian companies through the capital market was
part of the government's efforts to prop up the ailing stock
market amid the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by more than 100 percent
following the monetary crisis in the Southeast Asian region since
July. The exchange rate of rupiah in early July was 2,360 per
dollar and it fell to 5,600 per dollar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation. About 90
percent of its 200 million people are Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees 27 Bln Baht Trade Surplus in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand recorded a trade
surplus of 27.3 billion baht (675 million U.S. dollars) in
November, the third consecutive month it saw a trade surplus this
year.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports reached 181.493 billion baht (4.5 billion dollars)
in value in the month, while Thai import value posted 154.205
billion baht (3.8 billion dollars), according to the latest
statistics from the Thai Commerce Ministry.

<P>
Thailand posted its first monthly trade surplus in September,
which was about 5.3 billion baht. It also reported a trade surplus
of 16.40 billion baht in October.
</P>
<P>
However, during the first 11 months of this year, Thailand
still faced a trade deficit of 147.4 billion baht with imports
totaling 1,727.3 billion baht in value.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the baht plunge contributed to the
export growth in the past months, but it did not give the figures
in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted that Thai exports are expected to hit
1,700 billion baht this year, a jump of 21.4 percent from last
year in baht terms.
</P>

In addition, the ministry said that the country's economic
growth this year is likely to fall to 0.3 percent before it

The same day the bidding went public, however, the government

So, the scope of their work, administrative procedures, and

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A county in China's Anhui
Province that is known as the "cradle of China's rural reform" is
becoming a new place for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang County pioneered the household contract responsibility
system with remuneration linked to output in the late 1970s, at the
beginning of China's reforms, but it wasn't thought of as a
tourist spot until recently.
</P>
<P>
It is also the home of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and has the Minghuang (Ming Emperor)
Mausoleum of Zhu's parents. Although the site at one time had the
largest imperial tombs in China, they were partly destroyed over
the years, but magnificent roads, exquisite stone tablets, and a
tablet inscription of the emperor remain intact.
</P>
<P>
Although Minghuang City, which was 10,000 sq.m. larger than the
Forbidden City in Beijing, was destroyed, its Wu Gate is protected.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang is known for its 'hua gu' (local singing and dancing)
and the folklore of the Huaihe River. It also has natural lakes
and mountain resorts.
</P>
<P>
To help entice tourists, the county has spent 40 million yuan
(4.8 million US dollars) on its scenic spots and hotels.

<HEADLINE> Tosovsky Appointed as Czech Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
formally appointed National Bank President Josef Tosovsky as new
prime minister of the republic Wednesday at the Prague Palace and
authorized him to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
This event represents the first change of a head of government
in the Czech Republic after the separation of the Czech and Slovak
Republics into two independent states in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory in the election of the Chamber of
Deputies held last June, the Civic Democratic party won the right
to form the cabinet. Vaclav Klaus was appointed prime minister
last July.
</P>
<P>
The Klaus-led government was forced to resign on November 30.
</P>
<P>
For days the Civic Democratic Party, Christian Democratic
Union-Czechoslovak and Civic Democratic Alliance underwent many
rounds of arduous negotiations on the formation of the new cabinet
and, in particular, the selection of a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the appointment of Tosovsky, who is not
affiliated with any party, was the result of a combined concession
made by the various parties.
</P>
<P>
They said the Tosovsky-led government would possibly serve as a
transitional government. It is probable that it may hold a
parliamentary election ahead of schedule next year.
</P>
<P>
Tosovsky, an economist and financial expert, was born on
September 28, 1950, in the city of Nachod close to the border of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
After graduation from the Department of Foreign Trade of the
Czech Economic College in 1973, Tosovsky has been enaged in the
financial business.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank and the
Bankers Association of the Philippines have agreed on two measures
aimed at easing the unrest in the country's currency market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has approved the sale of non-deliverable
short-term dollar forward contracts (NDFs) through commercial
banks to pacify corporate borrowers with unhedged
dollar-denominated obligations, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NDFs are agreements to buy and sell dollars at a prearranged
price for settlement at a future date and will allow the central
bank to preserve its 9.7 billion US dollar in gross international
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The central bank and the association also agreed to raise 150
million dollars on a daily basis to ensure liquidity in the
Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic currencies
exchange, and meet the requirements of large dollar users such as
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has agreed to supply two dollars for every one
dollar the association raises to boost the volume of dollars
available for sale in the exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the central bank plans to sell 100 million
dollars while commercial banks under the association will put in
50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both central bank governor Gabriel Singson and the association
president Deogracias Vistan expressed confidence that the measures
will ease the panic-buying and cause the peso to strengthen in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso Wednesday closed at 39.77 pesos to a dollar
after falling to a historic low of 41.60 pesos against the dollar.
It ended the day at an average of 40.024 pesos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso has fallen about 53 percent against the dollar since
the currency crisis hit the country in early July.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Increases in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries
received 73 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment this year,
a considerable increase over previous years, a U.N study said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC) said that investment increased markedly in the
last quarter due to financial turbulence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report issued in Santiago, ECLAC said that direct
investment reached an unprecedented 44 billion U.S. dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The influx of Foreign capital hit historic records in Brazil,
Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
ECLAC said the increase was also stimulated by the countries'
liberalization of laws that regulate the flow of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
This year foreign investment spread rather evenly across the
region, which allowed nine South and Central American countries to
finance their current account deficits, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Developing More Efficient Irrigation Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A new irrigation technique
has been approved by the Ministry of Water Resources and the Henan
Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and University of
Agriculture as a means of saving water and energy, increasing crop
output, and preventing silting.
</P>
<P>
It uses a pipe made of polyethylene and recycled rubber, with
layers that filter and leak and an outer cover, says one of the
developers. When water pressure is applied, it seeps out of the
tiny holes like sweat.
</P>
<P>
Tests in 17 greenhouses in Jiyuan city, in Henan province,
showed that the technique could increase cucumber output by 67
percent and reduce water use by 50 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has some serious water shortage problems, and the
principal form of irrigation is flood waters, or overhead
sprinklers and canal irrigation, all of which mean an immense
waste of water.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese agronomist has called the new irrigation technique
a revolution in water technology and one that should be used all
over the country.

BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A loan of 6.2 billion yuan
(747 million U.S.dollars) will be invested in the construction of

<HEADLINE> Eco-Agriculture Pays off in Three Gorges Reservoir Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results have been
achieved in developing eco-agriculture in five villages in the
reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project after three years of
experiment.
</P>
<P>
The villages in central China's Hubei Province and rural areas
of Chongqing municipality suffered from serious soil erosion and
had large tracts of hilly land.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, the farmers in the
villages began to grow wheat, maize, sweet potatoes and vegetable
on hills with a slope of less than 25 degrees in 1993. They
interplanted peanuts, vegetables and soy beans on mountain sides
with a slope of more than 25 degrees and raise fish and shrimps in
ponds.
</P>
<P>
In courtyards, farmers grow vegetables with manure from
methane-generating pits which use pig's dung as raw material.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the villages' gross output value is estimated at
24.38 million yuan this year, up 15.7 percent from last year. The
per-capita net income of villagers is expected to increase 340
yuan this year to 1,675 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng has described eco-agriculture as an
effective measure to develop the rural economy and protect
environment.

<P>
SAN JOSE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- European airlines plan to
reduce the number of flights to Costa Rica in the coming months
due to the small number of tourists that want to visit that
Central American country, sources reported today.

<HEADLINE> Awards Push Family Planning Through Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-two theatrical
programs, featuring Chinese family planning policy, have been
awarded, and three of them will be put on stage in the capital
city this weekend, according to China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The China Population Culture Award, one of the highest honors
in the areas of population and culture, aims to heighten public
awareness of the family planning and stress the concepts of
sustainable population growth and social and economic development,
Wang Futang, deputy director of the Chinese Population Culture
Promotion Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 72 award-winning programs, including dramas, songs and a
variety of folk art forms, expound family planning practices, as
well as charity projects such as Project Hope, and appraise the
good ethics of contemporary Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development of the environment and resources is
also one of the hot topics in these programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, in the five years since the annual award was
wet up, a total of 376 theatrical programs have won the award,
including dramas, songs, folk art forms, novels, photographs nd
other art works.
</P>
<P>
The booming of literary and artistic programs for family
planning work has played an important role in helping popularize
the concept of late marriage and fewer and better births, said
Yang Kuifu, vice-minister of the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The country started a family planning policy 17 years ago,
bringing about a 300 million reduction in the number of births.
</P>
<P>
Data from the State Family Planning Commission suggest that the
natural population growth rate in China declined to 10.24 per
thousand last year, one per thousand lower than targeted.

<HEADLINE> Nongovernmental Organizations Responsible for Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China has begun to change the practice in which the government is
responsible for poverty relief, and is encouraging nongovernmental
organizations to take over the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Association for Promoting Economic Development
of Poor Townships and Villages, a non-governmental organization,
was founded to push forward the poverty-relief campaign by extending
small loans to poor households.
</P>
<P>
The association has begun to aid the needy in 24 counties, and
plans to do so in all the 63 poor counties of the province in the
coming two years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the UN Development Program (UNDP) has been
undertaking a project of this kind in four counties of Sichuan by
providing small loans directly to poor families.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, which still has more than five million rural
residents below the poverty line, is following suit. Its new
poverty relief method enables farmers to choose projects and use
funds independently.
</P>
<P>
The association is responsible for extending and recovering the
loans, and providing technical services.
</P>
<P>
The funding mainly comes from government appropriations, bank
loans for poverty relief, donations and earnings of the
association.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Sinotrans, China's top foreign
trade transportation agent, announced a massive asset
restructuring Wednesday to modernize tis corporate structure,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It will reorganize its subsidiary companies into a group to
bring their operations in line with China's corporate law.
</P>
<P>
These branches have been under heavy operational and personnel
interference from local government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China National Foreign Trade Transportation Corp.(Sinotrans)
also announced at a press conference that it will change its name
to China National Foreign Trade Transportation (Group) Corp.
(Sinotrans Group).
</P>
<P>
The group will close some of its outlets to avoid
self-competition, said group Chairman and President Luo Kaifu. In
principle, only one foreign trade transportation outlet will
remain in each of the provinces, municipalities, autonomous
regions and open port cities.
</P>
<P>
Under the new moves, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation(Moftec)will be defined as the owner of this wholly
State-owned company, with the power to make important business
decisions and choose business executives for the group. Moftec, as
the investor, will enjoy the business yield of the group.
</P>
<P>
Sinotrans, set up in 1950 as a specialized trade transportation
company under the foreign trade ministry, was designated in April
by the State council as one of 120 pilot business groups to
pioneer corporate system reforms.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sinotrans handles 100 million tons of freight. Its
business turnover in China alone hit 6 billion yuan (about 725.5
million U.S. dollars), generating a pre-tax profit of 340 million
yuan (about 41.4 million U.S.dollars).

<HEADLINE> US Threatens to Block Honduran Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
reiterated its threat to block Honduran exports worth 5 million
U.S. dollars before Christmas and the new year.
</P>
<P>
Honduran Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Sergio Nunez denounced
the action Wednesday. He said the "Christmas sanctions" may be
enforced because U.S. authorities claim Honduras has not taken the
correct action to protect intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the National Commission of Telecommunication
took sanctions against the owner of TV station Channel 6 based in
San Pedro Sula, in the north of the country, in violations of copyright
laws.
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities claim the 150,000 U.S. dollar fine was not
enough to punish the transgression of an international law.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has told us that we have to take energetic
action to protect property rights before Christmas if we want to
avoid sanctions on our exports, and if we are to continue to
operate under the regime of commercial preferences to Central
American and Caribbean countries," explained Nunez.

He said it was unfair of the United States to try and correct
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
A better way to solve those issues would be to sign a free trade
agreement with the United States instead of depending upon a
unilateral system of preferences granted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the same sense, the Honduran Council of Private Businesses
said the United States uses Honduras as a "scapegoat" before the
world, boasting how hard its measures are when other nations allow
trading in counterfeit intellectual goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China's auto sector is
working with General Motors (GM) on possible technical advances to
improve the environment, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases
and prevent the oil crunch, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Jincheng, vice-minister of the Machine-Building Industry
(MMBI), said that the development of energy conserving vehicles
and invention of new substitutes for traditional fuel are crucial
for the survival of the automotive sector.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made at the on-going automotive fuel economy
seminar, which was hosted jointly by General Motors China and
China Automotive Technology and Research Centre under MMBI. It is
the fifth such technology conference held during the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, GM and MMBI have jointly held four technology
seminars on automotive safety, emissions, testing and unleaded
fuel.
</P>
<P>
"We are formulating policies on fuel economy standards, and
even some rigorous measures, as the necessary means to encourage
application of new technology and expertise," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
GM will localize the production of engine management systems
until State authorities enforce regulations on the use of clean
fuel sources nationwide. Currently, it plans to supply some engine
parts to the 1.6 billion US dollars Buick project already set up
in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Economy Up 5.3 Percent in 1997: U.N. Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin America and the
Caribbean will enjoy an average economic growth of 5.3 percent in
1997, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin American
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported today.
</P>
<P>
At its annual report "Preliminary Balance of Latin America and
the Caribbean Economy" distributed in Santiago, the ECLAC said
that the region's per capita product in 1997 will rise 3.6 percent
over the previous year and 13 percent over the beginning of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
The document explained that the better current situation is due
essentially to significant improvements in seven countries --
Argentina, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela -- and to the outstanding dynamism of Chile and the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
It said that no country this year will suffer a setback in its
economic activity, while six countries -- Argentina, Chile,
Mexico, Peru, Dominical Republic and Uruguay -- will have a growth
of 6 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only three nations -- Haiti, Jamaica and Santa Lucia -- will
endure stagnation or poor growth in the year, according the
document.
</P>
<P>
The ECLAC indicated that the 1996-1997 growth, in general, was
fed by investment dynamism, which outstripped considerably the
expansion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the region.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the region will account for 24 percent of the
GDP, the highest rate for the decade, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital inflows were particularly high this year in
Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Dominican
Republic and Venezuela, it said.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Closes 1997 With 11-Percent Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin America and the
Caribbean will close the year with an average inflation rate of 11
percent, the lowest in 50 years, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In an annual report entitled "Preliminary Balance of Latin
America and the Caribbean Economy in 1997," the U.N. agency said
that 13 out of 22 Latin American nations registered this year an
inflation rate below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In most countries, the rate of price increases slowed down. In
Barbados, Ecuador, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, inflation
boosted in the year, but only by less than 10 percent, the ECLAC
said in the report, which was distributed in Santiago today.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Venezuela reduced considerably its
inflation rate in 1997 to 38 percent, from a previous high of 103
percent. Venezuela still has the highest inflation of the region.
</P>
<P>
The best results were from Argentina, which did not register
any inflation in the year, according to the ECLAC.

<HEADLINE> Czechs Rout UAE 6-1 in Confederations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Smicer scored three
times to lead the Czech Republic's 6-1 victory over the United
Arab Emirates in the Confederations Cup soccer tournament in
Riyadh on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs have got four points and a plus-four goal
difference. Only a six-goal victory by South Africa over Uruguay,
which already have qualified for the semi-finals, in Wednesday's
second game would keep the Czechs from advancing.
</P>
<P>
Emirates defender Hasan Saeed gave the Czechs the lead in the
11th minute, inadvertenly knocking the ball into his own net as he
tried to clear a cross.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Kuka set up Lazio's Pavel Nedved in the 22st minute for
the second and nine minutes later, Smicer cashed in on a defensive
lapse to score for the third.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes before halftime, Nedved dribbled through and
slotted home the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Smicer got his second goal in the 68th minute and completed his
hat-trick three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates scored their consolation goal in the 78th minute
when Adnan Al Talyani caught Czech goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek off
his line to clear a ball.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Affects NZ Business Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand still remains marginally positive this month, although it
"withered" because of the deepening Asian crisis, a latest survey
found.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the National Bank showed that those
expecting conditions to improve in next year still outnumbered
pessimists by a net 6 percent, a local press report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the margin was down dramatically from a net 26 percent only
a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The fall in confidence is widespread. "Every sector feels less
confident," said National Bank chief economist Brendan O'Donovan.
</P>
<P>
He said confidence held up surprisingly well in November
despite bad news. However, the situation turned around when South
Korea, NZ's fifth biggest export market, "went broke," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the Asian slowdown would mean lower commodity
prices rather than lower volumes. Survey respondents said that
their planned exports for next year were only down slightly, but
profit expectations had been hit.

<P>
CHENGDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A Thailand company will spend
800,000 to one million yuan to help a poor Chinese village shake
off poverty in three years.
</P>
<P>
The Chia Tai Group of Thailand has sent two technicians to
Miaoziwan Village of Puge County, southwest China's Sichuan
Province. Located in a mountain more than 2,000 meters above sea
level, the village has 286 households. Last year, farmers' per
capita income was only 400 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In April, an investigation group from the Thai company visited
the village and decided to start some poverty relief projects,
according to the provincial poverty relief office.
</P>
<P>
Now four projects are already underway. The group has provided
500,000 yuan in interest-free loans to finance a hydropower
station with a capacity of 100 KW, and to help the village develop
chicken and pig raising.
</P>
<P>
The group also aims to help expand the application of
high-yield maize, to improve farmers' houses, and rebuild roads,
the office said.

<HEADLINE> IDB Okays $240 Mln for Bolivia- Brazil Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today approved a 240 million U.S. dollar
loan to help build the 3,146-km natural gas pipeline that will
promote the integration of the Brazilian and Bolivian economies.
</P>
<P>
When the entire project is completed, the pipeline will bring
natural gas from Rio Grande in Bolivia to Porto Alegre in southern
Brazil, with intermediate distribution points in Sao Paulo,
Curitiba, Flurianopolis and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The resources bring total IDB loans to Brazil this year to a
record of over 2 billion dollars including 1.7 billion dollars in
loans from ordinary capital and 319 million dollars in syndicated
funds. It is the third straight year that the IDB lending to
Brazil has been at record levels.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 1.67 billion dollars.
Other sources of financing include the World Bank, the Andean
Development Corporation, European Investment Bank and others.
</P>
<P>
The project will enable Brazil to achieve its strategic plan of
diversifying energy sources to include the cleanest of fossil
fuels, helping to meet the expanding needs of its industrial south
and reducing the use of high-sulfur fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
For Bolivia, the project represents important new source of
national income and an impulse to economic growth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Plunges on Japanese Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar suffered its
sharpest drop in nearly seven years Wednesday after Japan took a
surprising steps aimed at reviving Japan's troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency dropped nearly 6 yen from an intraday high of
131.53 after the Bank of Japan intervened in the market by a rare
sale of dollars for yen for the first time since August 1992 and
in reaction to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's huge proposed
income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
The dollar regained some of its losses later in the session,
but its intraday plunge was the biggest since January 1991.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 127.08 yen,
down from 130.78 late Tuesday, its lowest level in about three
weeks. The dollar also was changing hands at 1.7735 marks, down
from 1.7822.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop, the dollar is still up 11 percent against the
yen since July 1, when it traded at 114.88.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell sharply against the British pound, due to
the dollar-yen plunge and stronger than expected British retail
sales data. The British pound was quoted at 1.6521 U.S. dollars,
up from 1.6353 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.4360 Swiss francs, down from 1.4403; 5.9380 French francs, down
from 5.9645; 1,741.25 Italian lire, down from 1,746.50; and 1.4222
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4224.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Loans for Low-Income Housing in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of two loans
totaling 62 million U.S. dollars equivalent to Ecuador to support
greater access to housing for low-income populations.
</P>
<P>
The project will increase the efficiency and equity of public
investments in the housing sector and promote greater private
sector participation through the modernization of the legal and
institutional framework. A system of direct subsidies for
low-income housing will be established to help finance either
improvement or construction of new units.
</P>
<P>
The program will also promote deepening of the housing credit
market through technical assistance to intermediary financial
institutions and credit technologies designed to benefit housing
for low-income groups.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a 32 million dollars loan from
the Bank's ordinary capital and a second loan of 30 million
dollars in local currency from the Fund for Special Operations.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is about 68.6 million dollars.
Apart from the IDB loans, local counterpart funds total 6.6
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Iran's Nuanced Change in Mideast Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday called the Iranian President's remark on the Middle
East peace process a "nuanced change" in a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
"It may be a nuanced change in a positive direction," State
Department spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's
comment at a news conference on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reiterated Iran's stand on the Middle East peace
process at the news conference, saying it was "not just."
</P>
<P>
But he went on to say: "Of course, we have vigorously stated
that we never seek to impose the Islamic Republic of Iran's views
on others. They have their own understanding and going ahead."
</P>
<P>
Foley said it was "a rhetorical nuance that represents
language that we haven't heard ... and in that sense, it is
positive."
</P>
<P>
However, Foley accused Iran of taking actions in "support for
terrorism and violent opposition to the Middle East peace
process," and he said the United States was looking for Iran's
"change in actions."

<HEADLINE> Report: Young Workers Face Peril in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Every five days in America,
a child is killed on the job.
</P>
<P>
For 14-year-old Alexis Jaimes, that day was June 7, 1997. On a
construction site in a Gulf Coast town, as Alexis bent over to
move hydraulic lines for the pile-driving crane he worked beneath,
its 5,000-pound hammer broke loose and fell on him.
</P>
<P>
His death, like those of 70 other children who the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) says are
killed each year at work, resulted from factors long in the
making, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
A total of 200,000 children are injured on the job annually,
and a third of the injuries are serious enough to require
emergency room treatment, according to the NIOSH.
</P>
<P>
Children are injured or killed because they are inexperienced
in their work, or because employers don't provide safety or skills
training, don't know child labor law or don't check the ages of
their youngest laborers.
</P>
<P>
Children are injured or killed because they are determined to
prove themselves, to demonstrate independence.
</P>
<P>
They are injured or killed because parents, despite
reservations, give in to kids' pleading, then never suspect
on-the-job danger until too late. Sometimes, as with accidents
that kill and cripple children across the nation's farm belt,
tradition and the law's exemption for work on family farms share
the blame.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Department officials say policing child labor
hazards is a priority, but they say their enforcement staff is
small.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had good enforcement for years," complains Jeffrey
Newman of the National Child Labor Committee. "If government would
take the role that the law requires of it, youth worker injuries
and fatalities would be cut in half."
</P>
<P>
America's more than 4 million working children, legal and
illegal, encounter many dangers. Of those treated in emergency
rooms, 54 percent are injured working in retail jobs, 20 percent
in service jobs, and 7 percent in agriculture with the rest
occurring in a variety of different industries, a recent study
showed.
</P>
<P>
They are crushed by forklifts, burned while cooking or sliced
by machetes they swing for hours as migrant field workers.
</P>
<P>
Power-saw use is illegal for workers under 18, as are 16 other
types of hazardous jobs, including mining, roofing, sawmill work,
most vehicle driving, manufacturing of explosives, demolition, and
working near radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
Violations persist in virtually every prohibited category.
Businesses were cited 1,655 times last year, Labor Department
figures show. Of 7,700 minors involved, 400 were 13 or younger.
</P>
<P>
A Centers for Disease Control study of emergency room visits
found that boys aged 16 to 17 were two times more likely than
workers as a whole to suffer job-related injuries, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> US Companies Have More Job Cutting Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Boeing will reduce employment
by 12,000 jobs over the next year although it is running against
time to catch up from production delays.
</P>
<P>
On the job cutting list are a number of more U.S. companies,
who take the similar measures to improve efficiency, according to
a USA Today report today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that many companies are reacting to an economy
that's peaking. They don't want to be caught with excess capacity
or inefficient factories later.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has increased employment by 100,000 since buying
Rockwell's defense business in 1996 and then buying the military
jet and airliner maker McDonnell Douglas this year. Boeing employs
235,000, including 118,000 in its airliner group.
</P>
<P>
With all the hiring, "we have been about as inefficient as you
could be this year," said Boeing president Harry Stonecipher.
</P>
<P>
Polaroid, the U.S. major instant and digital camera maker, said
it will lay off about 10 percent of its work force worldwide, or
1,500 people, and sell manufacturing plants in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Cabletron Systems said it will cut about 600 jobs, less than
10 percent of its workforce. And RJR Nabisco will cut nearly
2,800 jobs, about 190 in the U.S., in a bid to bolster cigarette
profits outside the USA.
</P>
<P>
General Motors said it intends to lay off 42,000 workers over
five years as it streamlines factories and sells others.
</P>
<P>
Levi Strauss, the leading blue jeans producer, said it will
shut 11 plants in four states and cut 6,395 workers, about 34
percent of its manufacturing workforce in the USA and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Toymaker Hasbro will lay off 2,500 workers, about 20 percent
of its worldwide workforce.
</P>
<P>
Film giant Kodak will cut about 10 percent of its workforce,
10,000 people, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's commercial banks
raised their mortgage rates by 0.30 of a percentage point today,
which will go into effect tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in less than a month that the banks
increased their mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce led the pack today by
announcing a rate hike of 0.30 percentage point on terms from six
months to three years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the six-month open rate goes up to 6.50 percent
and three-year to 7.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its four-year rate rose by 0.20 percentage point to 7.05
percent, while longer-term rates remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The move was quickly followed by the Royal Bank, the Bank of
Montreal and other commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent rate increases, Canada's mortgage rates are
still quite low compared with few years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Aid to Go to Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it will try to ensure that a World Bank loan to
Bosnia's Serb Republic goes mostly to people who support the
Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
"What we are proposing now is to target assistance to those who
have demonstrated a willingness to implement Dayton, and we
believe that it is vital that cooperation of this sort be
rewarded," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of the 17 million U.S. dollars would go to the
town of Brcko and the western part of the Serb Republic, which is
mostly under the control of President Biljana Plavsic, the Bosnian
Serb favored by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that only 15 percent would go to the east of the
republic, where hard-liner Radovan Karadzic and other opponents of
Dayton exert influence from their base in the town of Pale.
</P>
<P>
"In some cases (it will go to) the cities that are under Pale's
influence," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be for humanitarian support to repair water and
sewer systems in areas where there are large numbers of refugees,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Department has told Congress that the United
States is likely to vote for this loan, according to Foley. The
vote has been postponed by the World Bank until December 23.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank originally set a vote on the loan for December
2, but postponed it until Bosnia settled some arrears to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges to Continue Efforts on N.Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair pledged today to stand by the troubled Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Talking not fighting is the only way to achieve a settlement,"
said Blair, who was on a brief Christmas goodwill visit to the
British province.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would do everything he possibly could to bring
about a lasting political settlement to the Northern Ireland
problems.
</P>
<P>
"The only way we are going to get a lasting political
settlement is if people are talking to one another rather than
fighting one another. We will do whatever we can to move it (the
peace process) forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure to reach an agreement Tuesday by the two
major rival parties in Northern Ireland, Blair said he was still
optimistic that progress would be achieved in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the New Year, perhaps after we have had the
Christmas break, that we are able to move the thing on to get
progress, not just on an agenda but heads of agreement.... I still
remain cautiously, very cautiously optimistic that we can do it,"
he said.
