ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ecstasy Pakistan celebrated
their first victory at the six-nation field hockey tournament as
they ousted world and Olympic champions the Netherlands 5-3
Wednesday in the Champions Trophy in Lahore, Pakistan.

<P>
Mohammad Anis scored twice and set up another to hand the
Dutch the first lose in the competition so far.

<P>
The Dutch, who maintain their nine points leading on the
table, scored their first goal in the 25th minute after Atif
Bashir and Anis put the hosts a 2-0 lead.

<P>
But Pakistan, who won the tournament in 1994, kept their
two-goals lead on Mohammad Sarwar and Sohail Abbas after the
Dutch shortened the gap twice.

<P>
Anis sealed the victory in the 61st minutes though the Dutch

"I am happy that the team has finally clicked," Pakistan
manager Khanwaja Zakauddin said. "We switched the players around
and this paid off."
</P>

Dutch coach Roelant Oltsman said his side missed too many

KAMPALA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A major suspect believed to
have been involved in the killing of an American lady and some
other serious offences has been arrested by Ugandan police.
</P>
<P>
Director of Uganda's Criminal Investigations Department (CID)
Chris J. Bakiza told reporters Wednesday that Richard Arinaitwe,
a 21-year-old law student in Makerere University, was arrested in
his home in Kololo Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The strongly-built suspect was said to have killed Cecilia
Marie Goetz in Hotel Equatoria on July 28, who had been working
for a non-governmental organization in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Police recovered three pistols and some knives in the
suspect's home. One of the knives is believed to have been used

<P>
The suspect also confessed having committed eight murders and
several robberies, the officer said, adding that the culprit
began to commit serious crimes at the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to establish whether this suspect is simply a
normal serial killer or just an ordinary criminal. We shall also
establish whether he acts under the influence od alcohol or
drugs," Bakiza said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the general public to report to the police what
they happen to know about the criminal and urged hoteliers to
tighten security for the sake of customers.

Meanwhile, he promised that Ugandan police will do everything
possible to protect the image of the country's emerging tourism
industry.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Bank Governor Explains Performance to MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Bank of Uganda
(BOU) Charles N. Kikonyogo explained performance of the central
bank to a parliamentary committee Wednesday morning and promised
to strengthen supervision over commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The governor answered some questions raised to him by MPs of
the committee on natinal economy, finance and planning.
</P>
<P>
In response to fears of some MPs over the falling currency of
the country, the governor said the central bank is doing its best
to rescue the depreciating Shilling.
</P>
<P>
He said a committee within the bank is observing the
performance of Shilling each day and the bank will inject more
foreign exchange into the market if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators blamed BOU for failing to supervise the
performance of some commercial banks, which results in the
closure of three commericial banks in the land-locked east
African country.
</P>
<P>
Another focus of attention is inside lending.
</P>
<P>
"Inside lending is a common practice among many banking
systems and is in most cases a failure," Kikonyogo said.
</P>
<P>
On the failure of some commercial banks, he said there are
many causes leading to the closure of a bank. The central bank
should not take all the responsibility as some MPs claimed.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ugandan Shilling is in a free fall because many
people rush to buy Dollars. The exchange rate between Shilling
and Dollar was 1: 1140 five months ago and now it shot up to
1:1350.
</P>
<P>
The continued falling of Shilling is affecting the foreign
exchange market and foreign investment in the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is said to have put some 48 million Dollars
into the market to stabilize the Shilling but to no avail.

BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State
Council Information Office today reiterated China's policy on the
Dalai Lama and stressed that the central government has
consistently followed a clear-cut policy in terms of contacts and
negotiations.
</P>

The Dalai Lama must sincerely abandon calls for the

The spokesman said that Tibet quelled an armed rebillion
launched by a few upper class reactionaries in 1959, and noted
that the State Council issued a decree to dismantle the former
local government.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China led the people of Tibet to
successfully dismantle the reactionary, theocratic feudal serf
system, and freed well over a million serfs and slaves.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region was established in 1965 with
political power in the hands of the people and the introduction of
the system of regional autonomy for minority nationalities,
according to the spokesman. He stressed that the central
government does not recognize the illegal "government-in-exile."
</P>
<P>
So-called "Tibet independence" is a result of the aggression
China has suffered at the hands of imperialists in the past, said
the spokesman, adding that the essence of the fact that at present
some anti-China forces in the international community are still
trying to use the Dalai Lama to put pressure on the Chinese
government is quite obvious.
</P>
<P>
He said that contacts and negotiations between the central
government and the Dalai Lama are an internal affair, and noted
that the central government maintains unimpeded channels to
contact the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Dalai Lama is using contacts and negotiations
with the central government as a pretext to launch propaganda and
sway public opinion can only demonstrate his lack of sincerity,
according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Policy on Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State
Council Information Office today reiterated China's policy on the
Dalai Lama and stressed that the central government has
consistently followed a clear-cut policy in terms of contacts and
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama must sincerely abandon calls for the
independence of Tibet and cease activities designed to split the
motherland, according to the spokesman. He made the assertion when
asked to comment on a foreign media report that the Dalai Lama
plans to make a statement on the political status of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told the Xinhua News Agency that the Dalai Lama
must openly admit that Tibet is an inalienable part of China, that
Taiwan is a Chinese province, and that the People's Republic of
China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of
China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Tibet quelled an armed rebillion
launched by a few upper class reactionaries in 1959, and noted
that the State Council issued a decree to dismantle the former
local government.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned Over Tajik Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Worried over the deteriorating
situation in Tajikistan, Russia said Wednesday it was ready to
provide support to the Tajik government to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the
Interfax news agency that it resolutely backs the steps taken by
the Tajik leadership to install constitutional order in Khudzhant.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, over 1,000 armed persons led by former
Soviet Colonel Makhmud Khudoiberdyev broke into Leninabad region,
northern Tajikistan, seized the police department and attacked the
presidential guard and regional security units in Khudzhant.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of casualties and hostage-taking incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government and the National Reconciliation Commission
agreed that the development in Khudzhant "is aimed at thwarting
the peace process in the country" and that such attempts should be
stopped, said the Tajik president's spokesman Zafar Saidov.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Tajik Security Council, the head of the
U.N. mission of observers in Tajikistan, the command of the CIS
peacekeeping troops in the Central Asian country and Russian
Ambassador in Dushanbe Yevgeny Belov met in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The government said the members of the armed opposition group
should give themselves up to the police, or they may face "all
means available" against them, including lethal forces.
</P>
<P>
Russia's 201st motorized division, apart of the CIS
peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, has been placed on full alert.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presidents of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, Islam
Karimov and Nursultan Nazarbayev, also condemned the activities of
anti-government forces in the north of Tajikistan and expressed
support for the present course of the republic's leadership.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Calls For First Securities Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
ongoing meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee are examining the nation's first securities law agree to
the urgent need to promulgate a law governing the development of
China's securities market.
</P>
<P>
Members of the NPC Standing Committee attending this morning's
session echoed the view that China's immature securities market
has reached a crucial stage calling for a law to guide the healthy
development in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing a perfect law at this point in time is
unrealistic," said Tong Zhiguan. adding that "it would be equally
unrealistic to let the market grow without a law to standardize
relevant activities."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiao stressed that China needs to develop a capital market
with its own characteristics and noted that a well-developed
securities market will in turn promote development of the former.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China's securities market has expanded to such a
high scale in such a short time is remarkable," said Zhang, a
highly respected banker.
</P>
<P>
However, the rapid expansion has been accompanied by a number
of problems such as deceiving information, excessive speculation,
illegal trading and various types frauds perpetrated by securities
companies and listed enterprises, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that a securities law will help to solve
problems and remove irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Economist Wu Shuqing said a securities law will help to ensure
the transparency of all market activities, a factor which he noted
is one of the pre-conditions for building an open, fair and stable
market.
</P>
<P>
Securities legislation should proceed from actual conditions in
China, in conjunction with learning from other countries. The
primary task centers on enhancing the quality of listed companies
and informing people of market risks, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 million Chinese have invested in the nation's
securities market. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have
827 listed companies with total assets over over 2,000 billion
yuan, accounting for 23.4 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers has had heated debates over the securities law over
the past week and have reached consensus on certain major
issues. Informed sources expect the law to win legislative
approval within the year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Preparing to Cope With Payment in Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- As the Euro will become the
common currency of much of Europe in just two months, U.S. firms
are preparing to cope with payment in the new currency.
</P>
<P>
Some 68 percent of U.S. corporations are dealing with Europe in
one way or another, the Journal of Commerce reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In you are exporting to a company in Europe, you will notice
that the importer is asking different contractual questions,"
Charles Mallis, managing director and European Union project
coordinator at U.S. BankBoston Corp., told the paper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies need to prepare for payment in either currency
and be able to reconcile their accounts receivables, Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
The new currency may start weakly, but it will become stronger
as the resolve to maintain strict policies is tested, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. financial experts believe that in the long term, the Euro
could be a strong currency, similar to the Deutsche mark, with
downward pressure on the British and Swedish currencies.
</P>
<P>
The European single market, with more than 290 million
consumers vs. 267 million in the United States, will not only have
substantial global trading power, but investment market power as
well, Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that BankBoston is putting 50 man-years of effort
into preparing for the Euro.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Democrats Narrow Margin with Republicans in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republicans retained
control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in
Congress, but lost strength as Democrats picked up a handful of
seats in Tuesday's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
In the 100-seat Senate, the power distribution remained
unchanged with Republicans holding a 55-to-45 majority over the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
In the 435-seat House, Republicans won 223 seats, down five
from their 228 in the current Congress. Democrats, who now hold
206 seats, won 211, while the other one seat remained to be held
by an Independent.
</P>
<P>
With the loss of five seats, the Republicans' majority in the
House will be narrowed from a 22-seat advantage to about a 12-seat
lead.
</P>
<P>
Also in the elections, the Republicans' governor-seats were
shrunk by one to 31, but the Democrats retained 17, while the
Independents added one more to two seats.
</P>
<P>
That drop marked the first time since 1934 that the party
controlling the White House also picked up seats in the House of
Representatives in a midterm election.
</P>
<P>
Democrats defeated GOP incumbents in Kansas, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Washington and claimed six open
seats. Those gains were only partially offset by Republican
pick-ups.
</P>
<P>
Democratic politicians interpreted the results of the House
voting as a signal from voters that impeachment hearings against
President Bill Clinton, scheduled to get under way next week,
should be wrapped up as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The House voted last month to open an impeachment inquiry into
the scandal surrounding Clinton's sexual relationship with a young
White House intern and his subsequent testimony about it under
oath.
</P>
<P>
Some in the GOP immediately questioned the party's election
strategy, putting House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said the
election was "a loud message that people want us to return to
their issues, their problems. Health care, education, and social
security."
</P>
<P>
Exit polls indicated that only 5 percent of voters called the
Lewinsky matter the most important issue, and some results
indicated a backlash against the Republican focus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Incumbents were overwhelmingly successful this year. Of the 401
incumbents running, all but six won a new another term. In the
previous four elections, an average of 24 incumbents have lost
their seats. And most of the defeated incumbents were junior
members.

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced Wednesday night that the
government has agreed to a proposal to merge the Stock Exchange of
Singapore (SES) and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange
(SIMEX) into a single integrated privately-held stock company.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the stock exchange's 25th anniversary celebration
dinner, the deputy prime minister said the present structure of
SES and SIMEX is not ideal for the future development of local
capital market and combining the cash and derivatives exchanges
will yield significant advantages.
</P>
<P>
Lee billed it as the first advantage of combination to align
cash and derivatives business strategies more closely.
</P>
<P>
He also said the combined entity will have more bargaining
power to deal with prospective strategic partners and will also be
financially stronger to make the heavy capital investments
necessary in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It will enable us to build one strong management team... to
compete against other international exchanges," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee expects the process to take three years, completing by
January 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to him, SES and SIMEX will initially be separate
legal entities under the combined exchange and operate their
trading and clearing functions substantially as they do now.
</P>
<P>
Lee said SES and SIMEX's existing assets and cash reserves will
be transferred to the new company.
</P>
<P>
In return, existing members of SES and SIMEX will be allocated
shares in the new combined entity and the government will sell its
remaining shares in the new entity to new investors, he added.

<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Harare, Zimbabwe's capital,
Wednesday morning was thrown into turmoil as thousands of angry
commuters reacted violently to commuter bus fare hikes and blocked
traffic into the city center.
</P>
<P>
Commuter bus operators in the populous suburbs of Mabvuku,
Highfield, Epworth, Budiriro, Clen View, Tafara and Dzivaresekwa
and the dormitory town of Chitungwize refused to ply their routes
for fear that vehicles would be torched, overturned or attacked
by the angry stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
Commuter bus operators Wednesday raised fares in response to
fuel price hikes up to almost 68 percent, which were effected on
october 31.
</P>
<P>
Main roads from the troubled areas were barricaded with
stones, concrete bins, and litter resulting in may failing to get
to work in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Riot police had to be deployed to disperse angry crowds at bus
stops who stoned any commuter bus operators.
</P>
<P>
A number of subdued workers had to go back home this morning
after failing to find transport to work.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of riots in some suburbs which turned
violent with a service station reportedly burnt down in middle
density suburb of Msasa by a group of people.
</P>
<P>
The city centre was calm by mid-morning although traffic
coming into town had thinned out while some shops closed fearing
the riots could turn violent.

<HEADLINE> UNDP: Poverty Deepens Tragedy in Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Poverty and nature are equally
to blame for this week's tragedy in Central America, the
administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
James Gustave Speth, said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was shocked and saddened by the enormous loss of
life and suffering of families throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"Hurricanes, torrential rains and mudslides are familiar
occurrences in this part of the world, but when they strikes poor
communities they can be devastating," he said. "Generations of
poverty and deforestation for fuel and farms have exposed vast
areas of Central America to erosion and washways."
</P>
<P>
Speth said that when people are poor they have limited choices
as to where they live. "When you are poor, you are forced to farm
and to build on barren hillsides, and the poorer you are, the
future up the hill you go," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has left people extremely vulnerable in urban as well as
rural areas. It was poverty that forced so many thousands of
families to build their houses in harm's way in El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua and other affected countries in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is supporting coordination of international relief
efforts throughout Central America in the wake of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
In Honduras, where the UNDP has poverty eradication projects
totaling more than 100 million U.S. dollars, Speth has ordered
funds to be re-channeled to support relief efforts. The UNDP has
helped establish an information unit with the National Committee
for Natural Disasters and is helping fund the repair of broken
water pipes in five years.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP's resident representative in Honduras, Zoraida Mesa,
said Honduras had lost its banana export crop although the coffee
crop might be rescued if harvested within the month.
</P>
<P>
"The human dimension of the disaster is worse," she said. "The
social impact of this calamity may be felt for years. The
education system was precarious before the hurricane, but now with
schools destroyed, damaged or closed, who knows when the children
will be able to return," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Honduras estimates that per capita income
in the nation this year will fall by 8 percent as a direct result
of hurricane Mitch, an enormous loss for a country where real GDP
per capita was less than 2,000 U.S. dollars a year in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Honduras struggled Tuesday with meager resources to deal with
catastrophic damage from torrential rains and floods spawned by
Hurricane Mitch, as the official death toll for Honduras climbed
to 583. Experts expect that figure to go far higher.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran national emergency commission estimated that at
least 7,000 people have died, news reports said. However,
estimates of the death toll varied widely, and some officials
acknowledged that they have little or no contact with areas where
the death toll is likely to be highest.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane has left 10,000 Hondurans dead in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Romania Appeals Iraq to Cooperate With U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania on Wednesday called
for Baghdad to work with the United Nations and avoid undesirable
and counter-productive consequences for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry, through spokeswoman Carmen Podgorean,
said it is concerned over the October 31 decision by the Iraqi
government to stop cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The only way to lift U.N. embargos is Baghdad's full compliance
with U.N. Security Council resolutions, said Podgorean.
</P>
<P>
In suspending cooperation with U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), Iraqi leaders said their decision will stay until the
U.N. Security Council considers ending eight-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions it set forth include removing UNSCOM Chairman
Richard Butler and restructuring the regime designed to check up
and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long blamed the United States and "its agents" in the
UNSCOM for blocking the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned the
Iraqi move and urged Baghdad to rescind "immediately and
unconditionally" its decision.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors verify
that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction, the
Security Council said.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Suggests Military Action Over Angola's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) should take military action over
Angola's opposition UNITA, which is bringing instability to the
region, a senior Namibian official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kandy Nehova, Chairman of Namibian National Committee (the
Namibian Senate) made the remark at the end of his 10-day visit
to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Nehova said that SADC's Defense and Security Committee should
come out with a good solution to fight the military forces of
Jonas Savimbi'S National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) and destroy the organization in the end.
</P>
<P>
UNITA issue should be put on the agenda of SADC's common
defense system, and be solved with coordination among Angola,
Namibia, Zambia, Congo (K) and Botswana, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian official said that the Namibian National
Committee does not agree on the idea held by some countries that
another chance be given to UNITA, saying that experience has
proven that Savimbi is not interested in peace process in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nehova said that UNITA has been training some small military
groups in Namibia aiming to sabotage the Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan refugees staying in Nambia, tens of thousand in
number, have posed as a heavy financial burden to Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Retain Majority of Governorships, Lose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Republicans have maintained
an advantage in governorships but lost the big prize of
California.
</P>
<P>
Of the 36 governors' seats contested in the mid-term elections
Tuesday, Republicans won 23, Democrats, 11, and independents, two.
The Republican Party suffered a net loss of one while the
Democrats stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
After swearing-in ceremonies next year, there will be 31
Republican governors, 17 Democrats and two independents.
</P>
<P>
The newest independent, Reform Party candidate Jesse "The Body"
Ventura, defeated two political professionals who vastly outspent
him. As a result, Minnesota is suddenly looking a little less
buttoned up.
</P>
<P>
Democrats scored the biggest victory in California, where
Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis became the first Democratic
governor in 16 years. The win is significant because it gives
Democrats a hand in redrawing California's congressional
districts, which could influence the balance of power in Congress
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Concern about education also boosted Democrats to victory on
Republican turf in South Carolina and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, Governor George W. Bush easily became the
first Texas governor to be elected to a second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
Jeb Bush's win in Florida marks the first time this century
that Republicans will control the state's legislative and
executive branches.
</P>
<P>
Republicans also filled open Democratic seats in Nebraska,
Nevada and Colorado with victories by Lincoln Mayor Mike Johanns,
businessman Kenny Guinn and Colorado state treasurer Bill Owens
respectively. Owens will be the first Republican governor in
Colorado in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Democrats cruised to re-election in Alaska, New
Hampshire, Oregon and Vermont, while incumbent Governors Ben
Cayetano of Hawaii and Parris Glendening of Maryland beat back
strong Republican challengers to win second terms.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party also maintained its 126-year lock on the
Georgia governor's mansion with the election of Roy Barnes, a
state lawmaker, over Republican Guy Millner, a millionaire
businessman who lost his third straight bid for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
Voters re-elected Republican incumbents in Arizona, Arkansas,
Connecticut, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New
York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Maine's independent Governor
Angus King also was re-elected.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Increase 0.4 Pct in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The orders to U.S. factories
and plants picked up 0.4 percent in September, the fourth
consecutive month of increases, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This reflected higher demand from the military and for
industrial machinery and communications equipment. Orders totaled
a seasonally adjusted 339.2 billion U.S. dollars, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Demand for industrial machinery and equipment was up 4.6
percent, with orders for engines and turbines leading the way.
Orders for electronics were up 5.5 percent, boosted by strong
demand for communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding orders from the military, U.S. factories saw
a 0.2 percent decrease in demand in September, the first drop
since May.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders were down 4.9 percent, with declining
demand for aircraft more than offsetting increased orders for
automobile equipment, ships and tanks.
</P>
<P>
In August, factory orders rose 0.9 percent, mainly reflecting a
rebound in auto manufacturing following the mid-summer General
Motors strikes and a surge in demand for aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In September, orders for durable goods, big-ticket items,
expected to last three or more years, rose 0.8 percent, a bit less
than the 0.9 percent previously reported.
</P>
<P>
Orders for computer and office equipment declined for the
second straight month, by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Demand for nondurable goods fell 0.1 percent, with slipping
orders for paper and textile products canceling out increases in
demand for food, chemicals, and petroleum and coal products.
</P>
<P>
Factory shipments, a barometer of current production, increased
1.7 percent in September.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Super-Pure Semiconductors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed the world's purest semiconductor gallium arsenide,
according to a report by Tomorrow's Technology.
</P>
<P>
This achievement will have important implications on the speed
of electronic devices such as computer, cellular phones and disc
players. Currently, apart from being size-small of the devices,
the other factor is to have purest material, because the purer the
material is, the faster it can carry electronic signals.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vladimir Umansky and his colleagues at the Weizmann
Institute of Science have succeeded in growing the world's purest
crystal of gallium arsenide, the semiconductor that is gradually
replacing silicon in high-speed electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
The Weizmann team's crystal is so pure that it has only one
foreign atom per 5 billion gallium and arsenide atoms. As for
speed, the new crystal beat the world record set by Bell
Laboratories in 1989. In Bell's material, electrons logged 11.7
million centimeters per second in an electric field of one volt
per centimeter. But under the same conditions, electrons zoom
through the Weizmann crystal at 14.4 million centimeters per
second. That's a speed of 324,000 miles an hour.

<HEADLINE> Britain Criticizes Israel's Settlement Expansions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain criticized Wednesday
Israel's settlement expansions in the occupied territories,
terming such activities as illegal.
</P>
<P>
"The U.K. government's position on Israel' settlement expansion
is clear and well-known. Settlements in the occupied territories
and East Jerusalem are illegal under international law and an
obstacle to peace," said a statement issued by British
consulate-general in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement also criticized a fence that has been erected
around the Ras Al-Amud site in East Jerusalem by a group of
Jewish people and Israel's announcement of increased investment at
the Kiryat Arab settlement near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"These projects are both highly controversial and risk
undermining the new spirit of cooperation forged at Wye," the
statement said, referring to the peace agreement reached by the
Palestinians and Israel in the Wye plantation near Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
"We note Sunday's statement by Prime Minister Netanyahu's
office that no new building permits have been issued in
Jerusalem. We call on the Israeli government to continue to
refrain from granting such permits," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged the Israeli government to take actions
to prevent illegal activities by Jewish settlers and to refrain
from all unilateral acts contrary to the letter or the spirit of
the Wye agreement signed in Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
The British consulate-general also announced here Wednesday
that George Foulkes, parliamentary undersecretary of state at
the Department for International Development, will spend one night
Wednesday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Foulkes, who began a three-day visit to the Palestinian
territories on Tuesday, will be the first British minister to
spend night in Gaza since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Foulkes will also pledge Britain's continued support for the
Palestinians by announcing four new projects with a total cost of
about 16 million U.S. dollars, the consulate-general said.
</P>
<P>
The four projects include water and sanitation projects,
training for members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and
other legislation development projects.
</P>
<P>
Britain's total assistance to the Palestinians reached 42
million dollars so far in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: U.S. Continues Antagonistic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said here Wednesday that despite adopting a softened tone,
the United States is continuing its antagonistic policies towards
Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remarks at the inauguration ceremony of a
vocational school for girls on the National Students Day, which
was named to mark the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by
Iranian students in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only when this change of tones is translated
into deeds can it be taken as a fundamental change in the
U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this is not the case and instead of a change in
the (U.S.) behavior, we see the continuation of the same old
slanders, unfair pressures and old policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami cited the recent launching of Persian-language radio
programs by the U.S. in the Czech Republic as a measure aimed at
harming the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
"Although our revolution cannot be harmed by such measures,
the (U.S.) action itself is an ugly and antagonistic move, which
is indicative of the continuation of the old behavior and lack of
understanding of Iran and the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy was a
protest to the host of U.S. policies which resulted in violating
the rights and national sovereignty of the Iranian people and
preventing the nation from reaching independence and running its
own affairs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dismay that the takeover did not prompt the
American politicians to reconsider their policies and to
apologize to the Iranian nation for the past.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, tens of thousands of Iranian students held
a massive rally in front of the former U.S. embassy to mark the
1979 takeover. The demonstrators rejected talks and ties with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also criticized the U.S. for its opposition to the
piping of Central Asian oil through the Iranian territory, saying
it is not only against the European and Central Asian interests,
but collides with the American national interest as well.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the U.S. policy actually stems from the
pressures by the Israeli lobby.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on its people and youth,
will preserve its independence and will work for a peace based on
justice in the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> OAU Committee to Meet Over Ethio-Eritrean Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, left here
Wednesday for Burkina Faso to prepare for an OAU committee
meeting to seek a peaceful solution to the Ethio-Eritrean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti as well as
leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea will hold a two-day summit in
Ouagadougou Saturday and Sunday to seek a peaceful solution to
the six-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Salim said shortly before his departure at the Bole Airport
that the OAU Committee of Leaders will present their peace
proposal at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee will hold separate talks with leaders of
Ethiopia and Eritrea, adding that the OAU will do its best to
peacefully resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The committee was designated at the OAU Summit held in
Ouagadougou in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation of religious leaders led by Patriarch
of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abune Paulos, left here
Wednesday for Norway to consult ways for the peaceful settlement
of the Ethio-Eritrean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abune said the delegation will discuss the issue with its
Eritrean counterpart during its three-day stay in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the up-coming Ouagadougou meeting
will be the latest mediation effort of the OAU to seek a peaceful
solution to the six-month border dispute between the two
countries. The peaceful solution, if accept by the both sides,
will avoid a new conflict in the border area of the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz Takes Full Control of Smart Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz AG said
Wednesday that it had taken full control of the joint venture that
produces the micro-compact Smart car after buying a 19 percent
stake in the company from its Swiss partner SMH.
</P>
<P>
The SMH, a company best known for making trendy Swatch
wristwatches, also confirmed the deal and said that it would use
the proceeds from the transaction to finance a planned joint
venture with another carmaker to build a four-seat hybrid engine
car which combines electrical engine with the conventional
internal combustion one.
</P>
<P>
Neither companies disclosed the price for the deal.
</P>
<P>
German press reports said that the cooperation between Daimler
and the SMH had been apparently soured by their differences in
developing a hybrid variant of the Smart car as well as the
quality problems which have delayed the launch of the Smart car
for about a year.
</P>
<P>
Daimler said that after the decision to postpone a hybrid
variant of the Smart car, the Swiss company offered to sell its 19
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
The German company also said that it was planning to produce
20,000 Smart cars this year and 120,000 next year.

<HEADLINE> Former Security Agent Faces Charges of Failing to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein decided Wednesday to prosecute a former Israeli
security agent for failing to prevent the assassination of former
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Avishai Raviv, former agent in Israel's General Security
Service, or Shin Bet, will also face other charges including
encouraging incitement among right-wing Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
Raviv, who had succeeded in penetrating into extremist Jewish
groups before the assassination of Rabin on November 4, 1995, was
charged of knowing the plan of Yigal Amir, a Jewish extremist, to
murder Rabin but failing to take any actions to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
But Rubinstein, while announcing his decision to prosecute
Raviv at a news conference in Tel Aviv, said Raviv did not know
the exact details of Amir's plan.
</P>
<P>
Amir, a former law student, was serving a life sentence in an
Israeli jail for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Margalit Har-Shefi, a classmate of Amir, was sentenced to nine
months in jail in September after being indicted of failing to
prevent the murder.
</P>
<P>
She had acknowledged that Yigal had boasted to her of his
intention to murder Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein's decision caused controversy among Israelis. Some
warned the decision would jeopardize future actions of the Shin
Bet.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Send Unmanned Planes for Kosovo Surveillance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The German government Wednesday
decided to send the German air force's unmanned surveillance
drones to help monitor Yugoslavia's troop withdrawal from its
troubled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 German soldiers would be sent to Macedonia to operate
the surveillance flights of the unmanned small planes over Kosovo,
said German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping Wednesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The German government also offered to contribute about 100
German soldiers to a planned NATO "extraction force" to protect
and, if necessary, withdraw some 2,000 Kosovo observers to be sent
under the auspices of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The government decisions however have still to get an approval
from the German parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting, German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer spoke positively of the current proceedings of
Yugoslavia's troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the troop withdrawal and the
international security arrangements for the return of refugees,
Belgrade should start the political process aimed at an autonomous
status for Kosovo, including free elections and installation of
local authorities, Fischer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 4 (Xinhua) -- In fight against corruption,
Lebanese cabinet Wednesday approved a draft bill against illicit
accumulation of wealth by civil servants, especially top
officials, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill, drafted by Minister of Justice Bahij Tabbara,
requires all public employees including president and parliament
members, to report in sealed envelopes their assets to the
chairman of the Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
These envelopes will be opened only if and when illegal wealth
charges are pressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the assets of offenders will be
confiscated and they will have to pay a fine ranging from about
16,000 U.S. dollars to 66,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if endorsed by parliament, will replace the outdated
1953 and 1954 laws on the illegal accumulation wealth which the
local press said had never been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the parliament will convene next week to vote
for the endorsement of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Sends Message to Saddam on Iraq-U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has sent a message to his Iraqi counterpart Saddam Hussein on the
latest Iraq-U.N. standoff over weapons inspections, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was quoted as telling
reporters that contacts are underway between Egypt and Iraq in
this regard, adding that he discussed the issue with the Iraqi
ambassador in Cairo Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa did not disclose the details of Mubarak's message.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is watching "with great concern" the developments of the
crisis, Moussa said, expressing the hope the tension would be
defused to secure the implementation of the U.N. resolutions and
restore cooperation between Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Saturday announced a decision to suspend all dealings
with UNSCOM, charged with eliminating the country's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision followed a U.N. Security Council decision
Friday to review its compliance with U.N. resolutions, but without
the guarantee demanded by Iraq that the review must lead to the
lifting of the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the economic sanctions on
Iraq, barring export of oil, its main revenue earner, in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt is concerned with the harsh conditions
facing the Iraqi people due to the lack of food and medicine,
which Iraq has said was caused by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He called for Iraq's cooperation with UNSCOM to settle the
standoff in an effort to seek lifting of the eight-year-old
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit by United States Defense Secretary
William Cohen to Egypt Thursday, Moussa said that it is
"important" to listen to the U.S. view about the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is currently on a Gulf and European tour to consult with
U.S. allies on Iraq's defiance.

<HEADLINE> Business Paralyzed at Nigeria's Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The business activities at the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in capital Abuja were paralyzed
Wednesday as workers of the bank joined the on-going industrial
action by its Lagos branch.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that customers who
came to transact normal business were turned back while
security guards cordoned off the bank area.
</P>
<P>
Most of the workers who came to collect their October salary
were told that the current strike by workers of the CBN had
affected the clearing house, hence their checks could not be
honored.
</P>
<P>
The striking workers who joined their Lagos counterparts from
Tuesday are asking for a minimum wage of 5,600 Naira (about 62
U.S. Dollars) a month, which the management of the bank says it
has no authority to grant.
</P>
<P>
The workers at the Lagos Liaison Office of the CBN started
their "work-to-rule" action last Thursday. They said Wednesday
that unless their demands for the 250 percent increment of their
salary were met, they would resist all appeals to go back to
work.
</P>
<P>
The striking workers in Lagos Tuesday shunned the federal
government delegation sent from capital Abuja to negotiate with
them in connection with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to contain the strike which had paralyzed
activities in Lagos office, the CBN headquarters in Abuja Tuesday
dispatched all its directors to its offices in all states in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
The directors left the Abuja headquarters of the bank on
Tuesday morning to explain the CBN management's position to bank
workers in the country so as to prevent the strike from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
The CBN workers' strike is the result of the recent increment
in salaries of the federal government workers announced earlier
this year by Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar,
fixing the new minimum wage at 5,200 Naira (about 58 Dollars) per
month.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the management of the CBN and the
workers reached an agreement on a new salary scale, in which the
bank promised to act whenever the federal government makes any
pronouncement on it.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Economy Runs Well in 1996/97: Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan economy continued to
perform well in the 1996-1997 financial year despite the lower
than expected growth in real gross domestic product (GDP), the
Ugandan central bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda (BOU) released an annual report to the
members of parliament (MPs) when BOU Governor Charles N.
Kikonyogo explained the bank's performance to a parliamentary
committee on finance and economy.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the reduction of GDP is a result of
the adverse drought-induced effects on the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The real GDP growth rate in 1996-1997 was five percent
compared with a growth rate of 8.5 percent achieved in the
preceding financial year while the non-monetary component shrank
by 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenue to GDP rose from 11.3 percent in 1995-1996 to 11.6
percent in 1996-1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The external sector performance in the mentioned financial
year was marked by a significant improvement with the current
account deficit falling from 232 million U.S. Dollars in
1995-1996 to 221 million Dollars in 1996-1997, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the net foreign assets of the banking system
increased by 112.9 percent while the overall balance recorded a
surplus equivalent of 1.8 percent of GDP and foreign exchange
reserves of the BOU were recorded at 622 million Dollars by the
end of June 1997, equivalent of about 4.7 months of imports of
goods and non-factor services.
</P>
<P>
Important progress was made in reforms in the financial sector
in the financial year and the BOU successfully completed
restructuring of the two banks in which it intervened.
</P>
<P>
Many achievements were made in the key structural reforms with
government divesting 20 enterprises during this period.

<HEADLINE> UK Chancellor Hopes to See Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor Gordon Brown
Wednesday defended his "refined" pre-Budget report, saying that
they were made on "cautious assumptions."
</P>
<P>
Brown forecast that the UK economic growth would slow next year
to 1-1.5 percent but said it would rebound in 2000 and 2001 to
2.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of his confidence, Brown promised an extra 250
million pounds (some 150 million U.S. dollars) to help the health
service through this wenter.
</P>
<P>
However, the chancellor called on employers to keep wages down
to help his predictions of economic growth come true.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that Brown needs a run of interest rate
cuts from the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in the months ahead
if he is to meet his new forecasts.
</P>
<P>
A Treasury paper published Tuesday along with his pre-Budget
announcement said explicitly that it hoped interest rates would
fall even as borrowing rose.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's MPC is now having a crucial two-day
meeting to consider whether to cut interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
At its last meeting, the committee cut rates by 0.25 percent to
7.25 percent, and many are hoping that it will make an even larger
cut this month.
</P>
<P>
All the central bank governors and finance ministers from the
big industrial countries agreed last weekend that the balance of
risk in the world economy had shifted from inflation to recession.
</P>
<P>
So most observers in the City believe that it is not a question
of whether, but by how much, the MPC cuts interest rates.

At the same time, the council remained concerned by a continued
pattern of human rights violations, the harboring of terrorists,
drug trafficking, and the lack of security for human rights and
humanitarian workers and issues in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The council said it will remain seized of this issue to seek
fulfillment of the relevant U.N. resolution and of the Six Plus
Two points of common understanding of September 21.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Keep Over One Million Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia will maintain 1.2 million
of its army and navy and has no plan to cut its armed forces less
than the figure, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Yuri Baluyevsky, head of the Mainoperations
Directorate of the General Staff, said that "the plan of the
Russian armed forces development in 2001-2005 says that the army
and navy will maintain their current size of 1.2 million."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "this figure is most likely to remain the same in
the subsequent years as well," at least until 2010.
</P>
<P>
Baluyevsky said this number was determined on the basis of
thorough analysis conducted together with military scientists and
experts from other power structures.
</P>
<P>
It should ensure the protection of Russia's interests and
fulfillment of tasks assigned to its armed forces, the general
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Baluyevsky did not rule out that Russia cannot afford
to reduce its armed forces to 1.2 million troops by January 1,
1999, as was planned.
</P>
<P>
The officer also noted that Russian President Boris Yeltsin
assured Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev at their meeting Tuesday
that he will do everything possible to ensure the planned cuts of
the army.

<HEADLINE> South African and Rwandan Leaders to Meet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South African and Rwandan
leaders will meet again in Pretoria Friday to step up the
international efforts to bring peace to the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The coming talks are a continuation of the October 22 meeting
between South African President Nelson Mandela and Rwandan Deputy
President Paul Kagame, aimed at "giving further impetus to the
peace process," South Africa's presidential aide Parks Mankahlana
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has steadfastly refused to acknowledge that its troops
are backing DRC rebels. It also rejects to a draft peace accord
referring to it as a belligerent in the three-month war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela apparently hopes to persuade the Rwandan government to
change its attitude in the Friday talks, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the latest in a hectic round of consultations
which last week took Mandela to Windhoek, Namibia, for a meeting
with Namibian President Sam Nujoma, and to Abuja, Nigeria, where
he discussed the Congo crisis with Nigerian military ruler
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also met Secretary-General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
While Mandela concentrates on Rwanda, Salim and his United
Nations' counterpart Kofi Annan were reportedly focusing on DRC
President Laurent Kabila's allies.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, which have sent troops to
support Kabila, are being prevailed upon to persuade him to
accept direct talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who took DRC power in May 1997 after the downfall of
former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's regime, has been refusing to
acknowledge the rebels, claiming that his country has in fact
been invaded by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Kabila met Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Wednesday, while
United States Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice was in
Rwanda as part of an initiative to persuade Kagame to disengage
from the war against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kagame apparently denied again that Rwanda had troops in the
DRC.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Envoy Nods Tanzania's Role in Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's neutral
position in the conflicts of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) has won esteem.
</P>
<P>
DRC Ambassador to Tanzania, Kyungu Nyemba, told a press
conference in Dar es Salaam Wednesday that the non-alignment
ideology being adopted by Tanzania in the DRC conflicts should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
Nyemba said they also appreciated the repeated calls for a
cease-fire in the DRC by Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and
other Tanzanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the wars, which began on August 2 in the eastern town
of Goma, have stagnated national development and made prices
skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the situation is bad in the DRC and
the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops from their country
is one of workable solutions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops will give us a
chance of solving the remaining problems internally," he said,
adding that the DRC government troops will strive to remove the
rebels and restore peace.
</P>
<P>
Nyemba acknowledged that the country is getting assistance
from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe in fighting the rebels, which
is a "brotherhood spirit" demonstrated by Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) members.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the rebel leaders are recruiting soldiers from
late Mobutu Sese Seko's army who are in exile in Congo, Cameroon,
Chad, Central Africa, Niger, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and
Tanzania.

<P>
ANKARA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov arrived here Wednesday for a three-day official visit to
Turkey in a bid to boost ties between the two Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
Kostov is expected to hold talks with his Turkish counterpart
Mesut Yilmaz, Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and will pay a
courtesy visit to President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
During Kostov's visit, the two sides will sign agreements on
bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, culture and trade.
</P>
<P>
Kostov will travel to Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, on
Thursday where he will meet the Bulgarian community there, open an
exhibition titled "Ataturk's Traces on the Balkans" and meet
Turkish businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Bulgaria and Turkey have been enjoying
productive bilateral relations. Ankara cites the state of
Turco-Bulgarian relations as an example of how a tense
relationship can be converted into one of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two neighbors soured in the late 1980s
when the then Bulgarian government inaugurated an assimilation
campaign against the Turkish minority in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, some 300,000 Turks living in Bulgaria were forced to
migrate to Turkey.

CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Development
Association (IDA), a World Bank subsidiary organ, has agreed to
grant Egypt a soft loan of 145 million U.S. dollars, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under two agreements signed here in the day between Egypt and
IDA, the loan will be used to finance projects in the country's
irrigation and drainage systems, and a rural development project
in Upper Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and International
Cooperation Zafer el-Beshri said after the signing ceremony that
120 million dollars are for a project to refurbish Egypt's 1,500
irrigation and pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 25 million dollars will be devoted to a project
on rural development in Suhag, provincial capital of Suhag, about
400 kilometers south of Cairo, el-Beshri said.
</P>
<P>
The Suhag project, part of al Shorouk national project for
rural development in Egypt, is aimed at carrying out a number of
productive and infrastructure projects in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, the interest-free loan will be
refunded over a 35-year period, including a grace period of 10
years.

<P>
ATHENS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday welcomed the
result of the parliamentary elections in the neighboring Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the operation of democratic institutions
in FYROM as "positive development."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new government in the
neighboring country would better its relations with Greece by
displaying a spirit of cooperation with Athens.
</P>
<P>
FYROM's opposition coalition, which is made up of the
Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (IMRO-DPMNU) and
the Democratic Alternative, has won the third parliamentary
elections since the country became independent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighboring countries have been
strained for years over their disputes on Macedonia's name. Greece
has disputed Skopje's right to use the name of Macedonia, saying
that it implies that the Macedonian government has territorial
designs on the Greek Macedonia, which is the name of Greece's
largest province.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Closes Arab Satellite TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan revoked Wednesday the
press credentials of the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera television station
and its employees, effectively closing its Amman bureau, Jordan's
official news agency, the Petra, reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has stopped all cooperation with the satellite station
as a result of its continuous reports which attacked Jordan
"viciously," Minister of Information Nasir Judeh was quoted by the
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Al-Jazeera station intended to harm Jordan's
dignity and deform its history and political life by repeatedly
attacking Jordan in its programs.
</P>
<P>
No news organizations or journalists can function in Jordan
without press credentials issued by the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Revoking the TV station's credentials was in response to its
repeated and intentional insult against Jordan, a senior official
at the Information Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The television station' attack on Jordan has provoked the
Jordanians' rage and prompted the government to terminate
cooperation with it, Judeh said.
</P>
<P>
Judeh especially criticized anchorman Faisal El-Qasem, who
"regularly, deliberately, malignantly and unobjectively" attacked
Jordan in his program entitled "The Opposite Direction."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the decision to stop cooperation with the
Al-Jazeera station did not harm Jordan's brotherly ties with
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the staff members of the Al-Jazeera's office in
Amman have been ordered by the Jordanian government to leave
the kingdom, according to the Petra.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Jazeera television station is based in Qatar and
broadcasts programs over the region via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Jordan established a new press and publication law earlier
this year to regulate the press and punish media that carries
anti-Jordanian reports.

LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- European shares finished the day
close to session highs on Wednesday, buoyed by gains on Wall
Street and in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
London shares closed sharply higher on hopes that the Bank of
England will move to cut interest rates on Thursday. The FTSE
index closed up more than 2 percent, or 119 points, at 5622.9,
while the FTSE 250 ended 59.7 ahead at 4971.4.
</P>
<P>
Most traders expect a 0.25 percent cut in base rates, although
some are looking for a half a percentage point reduction.
</P>
<P>
A better-than-expected opening on Wall Street, aided by a good
showing from the Democrats in the U.S. mid-term election results,
also buoyed UK share prices. Market watchers believe the U.S.
election results reduced the chances of President Bill Clinton
being forced from office.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Dax finished 136.64 higher at 4841.72.

"There's too much cash in the market," said Joerg Schreiweis,

Since Friday, when G7 finance ministers agreed to back a new
International Monetary Fund rescue package for ailing economies
and hinted at international supervision of hedge funds, investor
confidence has blossomed. As a result, the popularity of safer

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe and President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
Laurent Kabila Wednesday discussed economic cooperation between
their countries in Harare, Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, Mugabe told journalists that the
meeting was a sequel to the meeting held last Sunday in the DRC
city of Lubumbashi which culminated with the signing of an
agreement for economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we should proceed from here to concretize in
terms of specific programs of cooperation. There are various
areas where we can interact across the sectors in agriculture,
mining, manufacturing, commerce and in infrastructural
development," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent troops to the DRC to
help the DRC government crush a three-month-old Tutsi rebellion
following an invitation from Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We want to play quite a role to help Congo (K) rehabilitate
itself as we are helping to bring peace and stability there,"
said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president also dismissed reports that Angola
was considering slowly pulling out its troops from the DRC,
saying this was not true.
</P>
<P>
He added a settlement to the conflict in the DRC could only
come from a real commitment by Rwanda and Uganda to pull out
their forces.
</P>
<P>
"If they have the will to pull out, then there will be peace.
If they do not have the will to pull out then we will have the
will to drive them out," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading his
country and giving military support to the minority ethnic
Congolese Tutsis who started an armed rebellion in the DRC on
August 2.
</P>
<P>
He said the Congolese people were facing serious shortages of
food and other basic commodities.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Determined to Meet Deadline for Tariff Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is determined to catch up
with the schedule of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) for reduction of tariffs on the intra-regional
trade to zero by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry
Jazzman Chikwakwa said here Wednesday that his country has
already achieved a 60 percent tariff reduction and is aware of
the COMESA schedule.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement one day after COMESA senior program
analyst Alick Tembo warned here that Zambia risks being booted
out of the regional trade grouping for continued non-compliance
with the tariff reduction time-table.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said that Zambia should have reduced tariffs by 90
percent by last month but had not done so.
</P>
<P>
But Chikwakwa said his country is not being threatened with
sanctions but is merely reminded that time is running out for
reducing tariffs to zero.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that all member countries will have
to maintain zero tariffs on goods traded within COMESA, making
those countries which are not implementing the time-table find
difficulties in adjusting their tariffs to zero.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Payment Just Sufficient to Save GA Vote,  Connor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking U.N.
official Wednesday said that the United States on Tuesday paid the
world body 197 million U.S. dollars in arrears, "just sufficient
to avoid" the loss of vote in the General Assembly (GA) next year.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, under-secretary-general for management, told a
press conference here that "a payment of approximately 197 million
U.S. dollars has been paid by the United States Government to the
(U.N.) regular budget, bringing the total 1998 payment for the
regular budget, international tribunals and peacekeeping budgets
to 586 million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
However, the amount still outstanding from the United States
stands at 1,280 million U.S. dollars, he said. The U.S. arrears
account for some 64 percent of a total of about 2 billion U.S.
dollars owed to the United Nations by some members.
</P>
<P>
Washington has to pay 347 million U.S. dollars before December
31, or it will automatically lose its vote in the 185-member
General Assembly beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Article 19" of the U.N. Charter, "A member of the
United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial
contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the
General Assembly if its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of
the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years."
</P>
<P>
At present, there are eight countries who are risking the
exercise of the Article 19 if they fail to pay their back dues
enough to save the vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Connor said that "a total of 107 Member States have
so far paid their regular budget assessments in full, a record
high."
</P>
<P>
As a result of the U.S. payment, the need to cross-borrow from
peacekeeping cash to fund regular budget needs during the last
quarter of 1998 will be reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, the previous year-end projection of cash
available for regular budget purposes has been revised from the
original forecast of a negative 247 million U.S. dollars to a
negative 50 million U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, a non-profit body, totally relies on the
contributions from its members to finance its various programs.
Any delayment or unwillingness in making compulsory payments and
honoring their legal obligations will surely plunge the world body
into a serious financial crisis, thus keeping it from meeting the
needs of upholding peace and security and promoting development in
the world.

<HEADLINE> All Conflicts Should Be Settled Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Yemen and Eritrea
have said all conflicts wherever they are should be settled in the
way pursued in the peaceful and successful settlement of border
disputes between their countries.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in Aden, Yemen's southern port city, Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his Eritrean counterpart Isayas
Aferworki hailed the settlement of their countries' dispute on the
Hanish islands in the Red Sea, expressing their willingness to
develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Aferworki said his country is committed to the arbitration
decision by an international committee.
</P>
<P>
The method Yemen and Eritrea followed in resolving their
dispute is very elevated and can be traced wherever conflicts
erupt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Disputes of sovereignty over the strategically important Hanish
islands sparked an armed conflict between Yemen and Eritrea in
December 1995, in which Eritrea captured most of the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
But they later agreed to an arbitration over the issue. On
October 9, the London-based five-member International Arbitration
Committee ruled that Yemen has sovereignty over most of the Hanish
Islands, a decision accepted by the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni troops took over the control of the Greater Hanish
island on November 1 from the Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Yemeni president reiterated that settling the
Yemeni-Eritrean dispute through dialog and political means spared
the two countries grave consequences and removed tension and
instability from the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that all border disputes should be resolved through
negotiations as early as possible in order to avoid any conflict
or bloody confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed various aspects of economic,
cultural and political cooperation as well as maritime security in
the Red Sea. They exchanged views and opinions over a number of
regional and international developments, particularly those of the
Horn of Africa, the Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute and the
situation in Somali.
</P>
<P>
Aferworki arrived in Aden earlier in the day for a three-day
visit to Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Yilmaz's Visit to Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday criticized a
visit by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to northern Cyprus,
saying that such a visit was illegal.
</P>
<P>
With his presence there and statements about incorporating the
occupied part of Cyprus in Turkey, Yimaz was dynamiting security
and stability in the region of the southeast Mediterranean, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said on Tuesday that the integration process, initiated
following the European Union (EU) summit in Luxemburg last
December, was being carried out successfully and would be
continued.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Yilmaz's such remarks, Reppas said that this
could not be done because even the Turkish-Cypriots were
categorically opposed to such a move.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that Turkey would have to pay the price
for the normalization of its relations with Greece and charged
that Turkey had adopted the same policy of aggression and imposing
its views with respect to both the Cyprus problem and
Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a major supporter of Nicosia, has a joint defense pact
with Cyprus and has called for the peaceful solution to the Cyprus
problem.

WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday it has received strong support from key Gulf countries
for a unified front against Iraq's decision to halt cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that Defense
Secretary William Cohen visited Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar on
Wednesday and had "productive meetings" there.
</P>
<P>
"We are sensing strong support from them for taking a united
stand against (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, reports reaching here said that Saudi and Kuwaiti
officials offered no hint on their stand over the possible use of
force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At issue are not only possible military attacks against Iraq,
but also American access to military facilities in nearby
countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd had told Cohen in Riyadh that he would not let
his kingdom be used as a "springboard" for attacks on Iraq,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is traveling with Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering and General Anthony Zinni, the top commander of U.S.
forces in the Middle East, will go to Egypt on Thursday.

telephone contact with foreign leaders in recent days to test
international sentiment on the Iraq situation.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, the Security Council has been discussing
a new resolution on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States expects "a clear, straightforward
resolution which sends an unambiguous message to Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he hoped it would mirror a council press
statement last Saturday, which affirmed the council's rejection of
Iraq's escalation of the situation and called Iraq's suspension of
cooperation with the U.N. inspectors a flagrant violation of
council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that no new resolution calling for the use of force
is needed because a previous resolution dealt with that issue.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also rejected the suggestion that Iraq has used the
hiatus in U.N. inspections to rebuild its ability to produce
weapons barred under U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"If we believed that they were reconstituting their weapons of
mass destruction, we would act," he said. "We have no evidence of
that at this time."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urged to Maintain Support for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
called on Egypt Wednesday to maintain support for the Palestinians
and lead in the Arab efforts to force Israel to implement the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath praised Egypt's firm support for the Palestinian
people and their cause.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinian leadership is aware of Egypt's role
in helping advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Egypt for being keen on making the world
understand that the key to an agreement lies in the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu signed on October 23 in Washington the accord
on Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for the Palestinians' crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Shaath criticized Israel for delaying the ratification of the
agreement, terming the move as a "foolish maneuver."
</P>
<P>
For a second time in two days, Netanyahu on Wednesday postponed
a cabinet meeting during which the accord was to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu argued that his order was prompted by Palestinians'
failure to submit a plan for fighting Islamic extremists,
particularly a timetable for the arrest of 30 fugitives wanted by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians said they have handed a work plan on
fighting terrorism to the United States, which is to brief Israel
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shaath accused Netanyahu of trying to find a pretext to destroy
the accord and called on the U.S. to live up to its obligations to
put forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will not be carried out until it is ratified by
the Israeli cabinet and Knesset (parliament). The Palestinians
have approved the deal.

immigration and quarantine facilities at Tanjong Pagar Railway
Station within Singapore although no agreement was reached, the
TCS said.

difference," TCS quoted Goh Chok Tong as saying.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Management of Mass Organizations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
cabinet, recently adopted and issued three regulations to
improve government management of nongovernmental organizations and
social institutions, according to council's Legislative Affairs
Office.
</P>
<P>
The State Council approved the three regulations -- Regulations
on the Registration and Management of Mass Organizations;
Provisional Regulations on the Registration and Management of
Nonenterprise Units With Nongovernmental Funding; and Provisional
Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social
Institutions -- on October 25.
</P>
<P>
China has over 200,000 registered mass organizations, including
over 1,800 national and more than 19,000 provincial
organization. Related organizations have mushroomed over the past
two decades of reform and opening up, with an especially large number
emerging in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of nonenterprise units with
nongovernmental funding such privately funded schools, hospitals,
research centers, survey institutions and welfare centers, has
jumped to well over 700,000.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the government
department responsible for registering and managing the nation's
mass organizations, said the Regulations on the Registration and
Management of Mass Organizations is a revised version of the
regulations promulgated in October 1989.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry has acted in accordance with a 1996
central government order and basically completed reviews of the
qualifications and performance of all registered mass
organizations in China.

"The new regulations stipulate that all existing mass
organizations must reregister with civil affairs departments upon
passing our reexamination," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jiaqi, deputy director of the Office under the Committee for
Central Organizational Structure, said that establishing a special
system for the registration and management of institutions is a
requirement of China's effort to establish a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Institutions operating under the planned economy were all
affiliated with government and Communist Party departments at
various levels and were not required to shoulder any civil
liabilities," said Gu. "Now, however, they are forced to go
directly to the market and society, and thus must be granted
status as independent legal entities."
</P>
<P>
Song Dahan, deputy director of the State Council Legislative
Affairs Office, said that certain social organizations and
institutions have been involved in inappropriate and in some cases
illegal activities due to lax government control.
</P>
<P>
"Certain organizations have engaged in illegal activities which
have disrupted China's political and social stability, while
others have exceeded their original business scope and conducted
illicit operations which have disrupted the normal order of market
competition," said Gu.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations explicitly define the nature, function and
liabilities of three major types of social organizations and
establish a strict supervisory and management system governing
related activities, said Gu. He added that the regulations will
help resolve the aforementioned problems and ensure a brighter
future for China's social organizations.

SHENYANG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The crane collapsing accident
occurred at a construction site in Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, on Wednesday was caused by the improper

The accident killed four people and injuried three others when
the crane suddenly collapsed at about 2:00 on Wednesday afternoon.

or measure before it was put into use, and no engineer was on the
site to direct the operation, according to an official with the
Yingkou construction company.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches National Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria plans to launch a
nationwide mobilization against illicit cultivation, sale and
consumption of cannabis or Indian hemp, a Nigerian official
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Musa Bamaiyi, Chairman and Chief Executive of the National
Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), said Wednesday that over the
past five years the Indian hemp accounted for more than 90
percent of the drug seizure made by the NDLEA.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper New Nigerian Thursday quoted Bamaiyi as saying
that out of the total amount of 85,024 tons of drugs seized by
his agency from 1994 to August this year, 79,000 tons are Indian
hemp.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi announced that 7,063 people were arrested for various
drug-related offenses during the past four years and 2,823 of
them convicted.
</P>
<P>
He noted with dismay the rising wave of drug abuses among
young Nigerians, disclosing that persons of between 15 and 35
years of age constitute 70 percent of those who are deeply
involved in drug use.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Nigerian youths of between 11 and 35 years
of age account for 63 percent of those arrested for drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued last June by the African Council of
Narcotics expressed concern over the alarming increase of drug
trade in West Africa, especially in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
West African drug traffickers transship cocaine from South
America and heroin from Asia to the United States, Canada and
European countries through West African countries, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
West African countries including Nigeria have become transit
centers of drug trafficking and drug abuse areas.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Nigerian government introduced drug education
into curriculum of the country's schools and took the anti-drug
war to institutions of higher learning as a part of the war
against drug abuse and trafficking in the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Set Asiad Gold Medals Hope in Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines are hoping for
more gold medals besides boxing in the Asian Games when sports
officials announced Thursday a 378-member delegation for the
Asian biggest tournament next month.
</P>
<P>
Pocholo Veguillas, head of the Philippine delegation, told a
press conference that the Filipinos raises more medals hopes
than that of their teams in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago,
where they garnered 13 medals -- three golds, two silvers and
eight bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Philippines teamed up as many as 27 shooters, 24 basketball
players and seven boxers for the tournament where they won all
the three gold medals from boxing in the last edition.
</P>
<P>
Veguillas said 96 athletes have applied for the POC's policy
of "have-money-will-travel," while 172 athletes and 110 officials
will be funded by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC).
</P>
<P>
"We allowed them (the 96 athletes) to go because the main
objective of the POC is to provide the main official
international competitions for the good Filipino athletes despite
the economic hardships we're facing right now," said Veguillas.
</P>
<P>
PSC chairman Carlos Tuason, however, assured that the
commission will reimburse all the expenses of the athletes under
the "have-money-will-travel" policy if they can bring home medals
in the country during the event.
</P>
<P>
Tuason also revealed that the PSC board is trying its best to
come out with 500,000 pesos (12,500 U.S. dollars) of incentives
for a gold medal in the Bangkok event, which is slated from
December 6-20.
</P>
<P>
The PSC granted the same amount to the gold medalist in the
1994 Hiroshima Asian Games.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Botswana authorities have
launched a search for two prominent members of Namibia's
opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) after being tipped
off that they were in the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
The two men are Caprivi Governor John Mabuku and Francis
Sizimbo, an outspoken member of the National Council.
</P>
<P>
The two men's illegal presence was confirmed Wednesday
afternoon by Gaborone police who said they were looking for them,
who were in possession of expired passports, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to have joined others who fled the Caprivi
Strip after Namibian authorities claimed they had unearthed an
armed secession plot.
</P>
<P>
The office of Botswana President Festus Mogae confirmed
Wednesday that another group of 25 people from the Caprivi, the
fourth group so far known to have entered Botswana since last
week, crossed the border Monday and said that they are now in
custody.
</P>
<P>
Some 104 Namibians, including former DTA leader Mishake
Muyongo and Mafwe tribe chief Boniface Mamili, crossed into
Botswana last Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So far 103 people have appeared in a Botswana court, most of
them charged with unlawful possession of weapons of war and with
unlawful entering Botswana, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The groups were allegedly found in possession of hand
grenades, firearms, ammunition, AK47 assault rifles, bombs,
anti-personnel mines, and mortars.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Leads in Announcing Plans for Agricultual Modernization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
took the lead in announcing plans to modernize its agricultural
section by 2010 in line with the targets set during the recent
Third Plenum of the 15th Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Various other coastal provinces quickly followed suit and have
enjoyed rapid economic growth during the ongoing reform and
opening.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin conducted a fact-finding tour of Jiangsu
shortly after the plenum and pointed out that the developed coastal
areas enjoy good natural environments, strong economic strength,
solid scientific and technological foundations and a tradition of
intensive farming.
</P>
<P>
He said that the advantages combined with close ties to the
international market form the foundation and conditions for
accelerated agricultural development and noted that the coastal
areas should take the lead in agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's basic targets for agricultural modernization include
four percent annual growth for the sector's valued-added, a 6,000
kg grain output per hectare, the commercialization of 80 percent
of products and five percent annual growth in the net income of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu provincial committee of
the CPC, said that Jiangsu has substantially raised its
comprehensive agricultural production capacity and ensured grain
harvests in all seasons during the past 20-odd years of reform and
opening.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that 1997 grain output grew by 48
percent on the 1978 level to 35.63 million tons, with cotton
output growing by 0.7 percent to 508,000 tons and the output of
oil-bearing seeds rising 280 percent to 1.41 million tons.

<P>
Chen attributed the achievements to the implementation of the
household contract responsibility system and the improvement of
mechanization level.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises in Jiangsu have greatly altered industrial
and employment structures in its rural areas. About half of the
labor force in Jiangsu's countryside are currently engaged in
activities other than farming.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 nonagricultural output value in Jiangsu's rural areas
hit 935.71 billion yuan (some 116 billion US dollars) and
accounted for 83.74 percent of the total output value for its
countryside.
</P>
<P>
The per capita annual net income in the rural areas grew from
155 yuan in 1978 to 3,269.85 yuan in 1997, an annual growth rate
of 17.4 percent. Per capita living space jumped from 12.48
sq.m. in 1980 to 30.8 square meters. All villages in the province
have had access to electricity, telephone services and highways.
</P>
<P>
Wang Rong, president of the Jiangsu Academy of Agriculture, said
the provincial government will adopt a series of measures to fully
realizie agricultural modernization within the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Related measures include strengthening the market orientation,
deepening rural reform, accelerating the industrialization of
agriculture and increasing rural income levels.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Jiangsu plans to establish 100 key enterprises
with annual sales of over 100 million yuan each, including 30
enterprises with sales of over one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that Jiangsu will depend science and technology to
create an agricultural revolution, further improve the basic
construction of the sector and accelerate the construction of
towns and township enterprises in order to provide job
opportunities for the surplus rural labourers.
</P>
<P>
Acting Governor Ji Yunshi pointed out that Jiangsu has vast
agriculture and is fully capable of becoming the first province in
China to achieve agricultural modernization.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Says Legal Basis Exists for Air Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Thursday there was adequate legal basis to launch air
strikes against Iraq if Baghdad refuses to reverse its decision to
end cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council reached broad agreement Wednesday on
a draft resolution condemning Iraq's decision to stop cooperating
with U.N. arms inspectors, but the document did not authorize any
military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need that authority. We are quite confident that if
it came to that, there is adequate legal basis for us to proceed,"
Cook, whose country is in favor of military intervention in the
latest arms inspection dispute, told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take military action. What we have said is
that all options are open and if (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein
does not respond he must recognize what that resolution warned
him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Britain is trying "through intense and
coordinated diplomatic pressure to make sure we do get a change of
Iraq's approach."
</P>
<P>
"All the permanent members of the Security Council do share our
concern and those who were prepared to put in a good word for Iraq
at the beginning of the year have been actually very loud in their
denunciation this time round," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection team was in Iraq to check up and
destroy the country's weapons of mass destruction capabilities but
Iraq on October 31 suspended cooperation with the team, requesting
the lift of the eight-year-old sanction as a precondition for
resuming the inspection.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Urges Repatriation of Mainland Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Association
For Relations Across the Strait (ARATS) today urged the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), its Taiwan counterpart, to work for the
timely repatriation of detained hijackers to the mainland,
including the husband and wife responsible for the October 28
hijacking of an Air China airliner.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS letter noted past cross-Straits cooperation which set
a precedent for the repatriation of hijackers. The letter
specifically pointed out that the mainland completed a timely
investigation and repatriated hijacker Liu Shanzhong to Taiwan on
May 14, 1997. Liu hijacked an aircraft on March 10 that same year.
</P>
<P>
The letter also noted that Taiwan authorities have repatriated two
hijackers to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
It also cited the historic October meeting between ARATS
President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairmen Koo Chen-fu, and noted that
the two sides agreed to cooperate on a case by case basis in
order to safeguard the rights and interests of compatriots on
either side of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that SEF and Taiwan authorities will
coordinate efforts to repatriate Yuan Bin and other mainland
hijackers in order to ensure air safety and prevent hijackings in
the future," according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Bin, captain of Air China flight CA-905, hijacked the
aircraft on an October 28 flight from Beijing to Kunming.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Renews AIDS Awareness Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
will host a major exhibition in December highlighting the critical
situation China faces in terms of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will mark the beginning of a nationwide campaign
to inform ordinary Chinese citizens how to protect themselves
against infection of AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health
(MOH).
</P>
<P>
The MOH Dept. of Disease Control announced today that a total
of 11,170 HIV positive cases, the virus which causes AIDS, had
been officially reported by the end of September, including 338
patients suffering from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the actual figure for HIV positive cases
tops 300,000 due to rampant intravenous drugs and unprotected
sexual contact, as well as transfusions using contaminated blood
obtained illegally.
</P>
<P>
Health officials acknowledge that most ordinary citizens lack
even a remote understanding of the disease which has existed in
China for the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for people with little or no knowledge to
develop a proper attitude and take preventive measures," according
to Prof. Zeng Yi from the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The free exhibition will feature more than 200 displays and
some 2,000 photographs and paintings focusing on both the global
and national situation concerning AIDS, prevention information and
recent research results.
</P>
<P>
The most important goal of the event is to provide the general
public with basic information about HIV/AIDS, including how the
virus is transmitted and clinic symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The organizers hope the exhibition will achieve the same
success in increasing public awareness as similar events in south
China's Guangzhou and Nanning cities.
</P>
<P>
Health departments, educational institutions and the mass media
will join in a concerted effort to publicize related activities
and disseminate information. Endithem

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived in Abu Dhabi Thursday afternoon on a brief
visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), within the framework of
his current regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is due to meet with senior UAE officials to exchange
views on the developments of the new crisis between Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 31 to suspend all relations with the
United Nation Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) and
freeze all its activities in Iraq, creating a new stand-off with
the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of defense will brief the UAE side on the
attitude of the U.S. Administration towards the crisis and the
prospective use of force against Iraq should it persist on
suspending cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has already visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and
Qatar. He is also reportedly scheduled to visit Egypt and Turkey
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
But Public opinion in the region does not support a military
solution to the current Iraq-U.N. crisis. Regional leaders also
prefer a diplomatic resolution rather than resorting to force, on
the grounds that military action will further cause damages and
catastrophes to the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Nothing But Goal Satisfies Li in Nancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Nancy' Chinese forward Li Jinyu
will go all out for his first goal in Saturday's French league
match against Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest goal by now is to score," the 21-year-old striker
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
As the first Chinese footballer in French league, Li said, "I
feel embarrassed for not scoring a goal yet. I'm not just
playing for Nancy, but also for my country."
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of a Chinese Olympic team, played his first full
league match last Friday against Bastia where they lost 2-1. Li
scored Nancy's first goal but it was called a off-side by the
referee.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very well," Li said after the game. "I'm not tired at
all."
</P>
<P>
Leaving Chinese second-division side Liaoning Tianrun for
Nancy when the league was four rounds on, Li played five league
matches as substitute in the past two months before making his
first starting for Nancy last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I was not happy at first on the bench, but I told myself it's
kind of experience," said the Chinese striker, who never played
more than 35 minutes per match as substitute.
</P>
<P>
Nancy were in the mid-stream of the French league table as the
13th place on ten points from 11 matches.
</P>
<P>
Li was a select of a Chinese junior team for a-year training
in Brazil, a program sponsored by a Chinese soft drink company in
name of Li Ning, the former Chinese gymnastic star, in a hope to
supply players for the national team.
</P>
<P>
He played in the first-choice team in Liaoning, who finished
second in the past season and were promoted into the first
division next season.
</P>
<P>
Li was one of the four Chinese players play abroad right now
after China began this year to set their players free for signing
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Asia Strategist Raises HK's Weighting Within Model Portfolio (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a
global financial services firm, has reconsidered its roughly 18
month-old bearish prognosis for the Asia-Pacific stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The firm has reduced the cash weighting in its mixed asset
model portfolio to 10 percent from 24 percent and has raised Hong
Kong's weighting to overweight from underweight, Markus Rosgen,
vice president and Asia strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It has also made Singapore overweight from neutral and Thailand
overweight from underweight, Rosgen told a press briefing at the
JW Moriott Hotel Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Rosgen said that a 20 to 30 percent upside exists for investors
in each of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Thai markets to the end of
the first quarter of 1999. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has been
bearish on Asia for about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"After a thorough review of recent events, we believe there is
a great window of opportunity through which investors can
capitalize on the Asian markets, particularly Hong Kong, Singapore
and Thailand," Rosgen said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the closing months of 1998 and into the first quarter
of 1999, we will see steady climbs in each of these markets," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a change in the perception of the Asian crisis by
investors. It appears there is no longer a pervading feeling of
negativity, and a small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel
has appeared for the fist time since the problems started 18
months ago," said Rosgen.

<HEADLINE> Asia Strategist Raises HK's Weighting Within Model Portfolio (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The return of bullish sentiment has seen markets rise 34.1
percent since their troughs, predominately generated from events
outside the region, such as news of U.S. interest rate cuts, the
weakening of the U.S. dollar, and good news from Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to Rosgen, there may be further good news on the
horizon. He said that the Hang Seng Index is expected to rise to
13,000 points at the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We think this positive investor attitude will continue. Our
chief economist Stephen Roach believes the United States will cut
rates by another 100 basis points between now and the middle of
next year," Rosgen said.
</P>
<P>
This will help the stock markets of Hong Kong, Singapore and
Thailand, which are very interest rate sensitive.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help keep the yen strong, adding further support
to Asian markets. All in all, this news will keep markets
buoyant," said Rosgen.
</P>
<P>
In light of this, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has amended its
model portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has a long-standing presence in Asia
in terms of both capital and resources.
</P>
<P>
Through its major regional offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo and 11
other Asian centers, the firm provides investment banking,
secondary markets and a range of other institutional and private
client financial services.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Leo O'Neill, president and chief rating
officer of Standard &AMP; Poor's Rating Services, said that overseas
investors view Hong Kong more favorable compared with other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a luncheon organized by the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce, O'Neill said that Hong Kong has
probably passed its worst time but that does not mean it has been
back to its best time. "I think the worst is over," O'Neill said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Foreign Troops to Withdraw From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has called for a negotiated withdrawal of all
belligerent foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), said a statement reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that a political solution to the ever-worsening
crisis in the DRC should be reached by peaceful means, taking
into account security concerns of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We do not support a decision of any country to take part in a
war to remove from power another government of a neighboring
country," Mkapa said in his address to the National Assembly in
central city of Dodoma Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the neighboring countries, mainly Angola, Rwanda and
Uganda, "were motivated not only by the desire to help the
Congolese people realize good governance, democracy and economic
reform but also by the pursuit of their own national interests."
</P>
<P>
He said these neighbors helped put President Laurent Kabila in
power in different ways and with different interests,
particularly security among their borders.
</P>
<P>
"We are building in this (Great Lakes) region the culture of
changing governments through the ballot box not the barrel of the
gun," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded with all the warring parties in the DRC to accept a
ceasefire and the Organization of African Unity and the United
Nations to send a peace-keeping force until the security
situation is guaranteed there.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Tanzania is not ready to witness another genocide
and influx of refugees as in 1994 when it received more that
700,000 refugees during the genocide in Rwanda which claimed
500,000 lives, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the fanning of tribal and racial hatreds for
political and economic ends should not be ignored because they
could expose countries to genocide.

DALI, China, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Last year, they finished
sixth. Could this be the year Team China wins the Mild Seven
Outdoor Quest?
</P>
<P>
Against long odds, these plucky Chinese athletes finished
second in today's opening stage of the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest.
Team Polar Spirit of Finland was first, a mere three minutes
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Though three tough days of racing remain, China has served
notice that it is a team to be reckoned with. "This isn't a
fluke," said a smiling Don Baker, their coach. "They're not gonna
back down for anyone. They'be in the hunt all the way."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three teams from around the world have converged on
this quaint hamlet for four days of multisport stage racing.
</P>
<P>
Team Polar Spirit surprised everybody but themselves with thei
r victory after clocking five hours, 38 minutes and five seconds.
</P>
<P>
"It was hard, and the altitude was unpleasant at first," said
team captain Liro Kakko of the day's competition, which began
with a 5km trail run, then included a 10km kayak, 25km mountain
bike ride, another 10km paddle, and concluded with that same
trail run.
</P>
<P>
But the most shocking result was the performance of crowd
favorite Team China. Led by competitive runner and race walker
Zang Haibo, Team China showed dominating running ability to go
with superior paddling and they finished in 5:41:32.
</P>
<P>
Peak Performance, a Swedish team, came third in 5:45:10.
</P>
<P>
Day Two will be a good test. Fifteen kilometers of trail
running through the Cangshan Mountain Range will be followed by
60 kilometers of mountaineering, then 15 more kilometers of trail
running.

Tuesday for a six-day visit. Milo made the comments during
Thursday afternoon interview with local reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The series of major industrial projects built with Chinese
assistance in Albania are awaiting the return of Chinese experts,"
according to the Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
Milo was referring to the fact that China helped Albania build
a number of steel plants, textile mills and fertilizer, glass
and cement plants during the 1960s and 1970s..
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that Chinese investors will come to Albania
and play an active role in the economic cooperation between our
two countries," said the foreign minister. "We should continue to
carry forward the fine tradition of Sino-Albanian friendship," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Milo expressed familiarity with Chinese tradition and culture,
and pledged to help promote bilateral relations. He said the
current trip to China will provide him with greater insight into
the country.
</P>
<P>
China gaining greater political and economic power in the
international arena, said Milo. What has happened in China over
the past 20 years will serve as a good example for nations that
have similar experience over the past 50 years, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Albania is playing an increasingly
important role in stabilizing the Balkans and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the Albanian Government highly appreciates China's
stand on solving the Kosovo issue through peaceful means, and
specifically cited the fact that China's "constructive proposal
for resolving the issue through dialog and bilateral negotiations
created a favorable atmosphere for the settlement of the issue."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister concluded that bilateral relations between
China and Albania should be promoted to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Milo also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and
various other Chinese leaders. The two side reached understanding
to upgrade the level of high-level exchanges and to conduct a
second round of economic cooperation and trade talks in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a Sino-Albanian Cultural and Education
Cooperation Plan for 1998-2000 on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Fail to Make Breakthrough on Navigation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan Thursday
failed to make any breakthrough on the dispute over the Tulbul
navigation project (Pakistan calls it Wular Barrage) on the Jhelum
river.
</P>
<P>
Secretaries of water resources and power from the two
countries, however, agreed to continue their talks to find an
amicable solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued here after over four hours of talks
said that the discussions were held in a "frank and constructive
atmosphere." It said that both sides "exchanged views and took
note of the discussions on the subject held between October 1987
and August 1992."
</P>
<P>
The two sides would meet again at a mutually convenient time"
with a view to finding a solution to the issue."
</P>
<P>
The Jhelum river flows through the two countries. The dispute
started from India's proposed construction of a barrage on the
Jhelum river in 1984, downstream from the Wular Lake.
</P>
<P>
India wants to control the flow of water in the lean season to
make it navigable.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan opposed to it as it maintains that the building of a
barrage on the Jhelum at the mouth of the Wular amounts to storage
of water in contravention of the Indus Water Treaty signed between
the two countries in 1960.
</P>
<P>
They have held eight rounds of talks over the issue, but no
agreement has been reached so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has urged the international community to take immediate
action to protect children physically, mentally and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the call in his message to a two-day
conference, called Children's Rights and Wrongs, which opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the Nicosia-based Center for
World Dialog with the cooperation of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), aims to evaluate the implementation of the
U.N. Convention on Rights of Children, adopted by the U.N. General
Assembly 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The convention is a powerful instrument on behalf of the
world's children. The international community needs to act now and
on many fronts to honor concepts contained in the convention of
rights of the child," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure this meeting will make a meaningful contribution" in
efforts to improve the conditions of children throughout the
world, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides inaugurated the conference.
He said the adoption of the convention on children's rights marked
"the first step toward addressing one of the greatest tragedies of
our time."
</P>
<P>
He called on the participants to put forward proposals to
alleviate the sufferings of children.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics showed that 12 million children die each year
of malnutrition, 100 million child labors are working in
exploitative and hazardous conditions, 130 million are denied
education and 100 million live in the streets.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 participants, including seven child
representatives from India, Zambia, Cambodia, Guatemala and the
Philippines, from around the world attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> China Taking Measures To Reduce Financial Hazards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese central bank
official said here today that China has taken measures to
prevent financial hazards, especially with the financial turmoil
in many parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wenkai, director of the Laws and Regulations Department of
the People's Bank of China, described the countermeasures at an
international symposium on financial laws which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, China has been working to improve financial
services, increased the money supply, and adopted an active
financial policy to reach the year's growth target.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have paid off, he said, with loans increasing by
over 15 percent, and the central government has sold 100 billion
yuan in long-term state bonds in addition to 100 billion yuan
loans to state-owned commercial banks to encourage banks to help
build infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
And, a greater effort has been made to boost imports and
exports, improve the investment environment, and guard the
stability of the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has allowed more foreign banks to do
yuan-based business and they will be allowed to expand their scope
of business.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will dismantle all its provincial branches and
set up regional branches to avoid interference in bank business by
provincial governments, and state-owned commercial banks have been
ordered to merge provincial branches and money-losing branches
will have to close.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, all commercial banks have to get rid
of financial or industrial enterprises they are operating and from
now on, the Ministry of Finance and the central bank will work
side by side in checking up on the bad loan situation at
commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Zone Planned in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- An industrial zone centered on
petrochemical processing industry is planned for the year 2000 in
Angola's Cabinda Province.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the construction of the zone, named Futila
International Development Zone, has been put into full swing
recently.
</P>
<P>
The zone, covering an area of 2,500 hectares, will take about
five to 15 years for construction.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the zone will embrace industries which will
utilize the local resources, such as timber processing, building
material and soap making.
</P>
<P>
Basic infrastructure facilities like water supply, office
building and banks will be built in the first phase of the
project.
</P>
<P>
At the second phase of the project, a pipe for natural gas
will be laid there linking the gas field in the sea to the zone,
and a gas processing center will be built for the natural gas
which is being flared.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment will be absorbed in developing oil
refining, and fertilizer and metal-producing industries during
the second phase of construction, which are expected to offer
about 14,000 jobs for local people.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda Province, which is rich in oil resource, is an
enclave surrounded by Atlantic Ocean, Congo (K) and Congo (B).

<HEADLINE> Africa on Brink of Major War: S. African Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Africa is on the brink of
a major continental war unless the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) could be stopped, South African
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If this conflict is not stopped, the danger of a major
African war is real," South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted Pahad as saying in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
This would have huge political and economic consequences for
the continent, and destroy any chance of an African renaissance,
he warned.
</P>
<P>
"A major war on our continent will set us back many years."
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Chad have sent troops to help
DRC President Laurent Kabila while Uganda and Rwanda have been
accused of backing rebel forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the situation was made more dangerous because of
the involvement of non-statutory armies, including the UNITA
movement of Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi, the
genocidal forces of Rwanda responsible for the 1994 massacre, and
soldiers loyal to the late Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Referring to ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker peace, Pahad
said: "We shouldn't have any illusion that this problem can be
resolved quickly."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic initiatives to broker a political solution, under
the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity, were, however, on track.
</P>
<P>
On South Africa's role in securing peace, Pahad confirmed that
South African President Nelson Mandela would hold a second
meeting with Rwandan strongman Paul Kagame Friday, and would also
hold talks with DRC Foreign Minister Jean Claude Okoto next week.
</P>
<P>
Okoto earlier this week criticized Mandela for meeting rebel
leader Ernst Wamba dia Wamba, and accused Mandela of taking sides
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
A major stumbling block to a peace deal in the DRC remains
Kagame's refusal to acknowledge that Rwanda is a belligerent in
the conflict, and his refusal to sign a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The other is Kabila's steadfast refusal to negotiate face to
face with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Should these be overcome, it is believed that a cease-fire,
followed by a troop standstill, multi-party negotiations and the
withdrawal of all foreign troops from the DRC, will finally be
possible.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said it is hoped that if this is achieved then the
Congolese will begin multi-party talks among themselves on their
country's political future.
</P>
<P>
On whether he could see a situation where South Africa might
sent troops to the DRC, he said: "I don't think we are in a
position to get involved in any fighting or shooting war. "

showcasing their latest eyewear collections at Asia's largest
optical fair which was opened Thursday at the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Optical Fair '98 is organized by the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council (TDC) and co-organized by the Hong Kong
Optical Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
A wide spectrum of the latest optical products are displayed in
the fair, ranging from spectacles, sunglasses, frames, lenses, and
packaging materials to laboratory and manufacturing equipment,
optometry instruments and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Optical Fair, now in its sixth edition, provides
an ideal opportunity for exhibitors and buyers to build up
contacts, conduct business and exchange market information," said
Benjamin Chau, TDC's senior manager of exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The fair also serves as an effective channel for optical
companies to penetrate the markets in the region, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong offers the perfect setting for staging
such an event because it is not only Asia's trading hub for
optical products but also a springboard to China's mainland and
other markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports of optical goods have recorded steady
growth in recent years. Despite the Asian economic adjustment,
Hong Kong's total exports of optical goods grew by 11 percent to
3.86 billion HK dollars (495 million U.S. dollars) in the first
half of 1998, after a 20-percent increase in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Refrain from Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi has appealed for peace and calm, saying violence
and vandalism are not good for the nation, the Daily Herald
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the appeal Wednesday after the country's
capital of Harare was thrown into turmoil as thousands of angry
commuters from various high density reacted violently to commuter
bus fare hikes and blocked traffic into the city center.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the public should demonstrate peacefully and
refrain from engaging in acts of violence, intimidation and
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
The army has been placed on full alert, ready to swing into
action should rowdy crowds overwhelm police in trouble spots.
This deployment has been implemented as a precautionary
contingent measure.
</P>
<P>
"Violence leads to anarchy. And anarchy can burn down the
country in minutes. Violence does not resolve anything. I
sincerely appeal to all people intending to stage protests, to do
so peacefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the defense forces would never allow anarchy
to prevail.
</P>
<P>
Police managed to contain the situation during Wednesday
disturbances. Mahachi said the standby arrangement would remain
in force until the situation has normalized.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen people were arrested Tuesday night when the riots
began in Chitungwiza near Harare. Further arrests were made
Wednesday, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Hydro-electric Power Project Benefits Tibetan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German project that has
been helping Tibetan farmers build small hydro-electric power
stations has benefited over 40,000 people in the Tibet Autonomous
Region in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the German government agreed to provide 7 million
German marks by the year 2002 and equipment and technical
assistance to repair small hydro-electric power stations in
Lhasa, Nyingchi and Shannan prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The regional government is allocating a million yuan (125,000
U.S. dollars) each year in matching funds for the project, which
has brought 17 power stations back to life, giving 9 of them a
generating capacity of 1,575 KW. Another 8 will be operational by
the end of the year, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency, the power stations will be run by
farmers under contract, who can then sell the power.
</P>
<P>
The project also provides small interest-free loans to farms to
help them purchase farm machinery.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Urged to Strengthen Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A signed article carried by the
official newspaper New Nigeria Thursday urged the Nigerian
government to strengthen its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The article written by Chiles Onunauu said "from the point of
real-politics and long term interest, Nigeria must improve and
strengthen her relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"No country that aspires to enter the twenty-first century
with a self enlightened nation of economic viability and growth
can afford to ignore China," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the author, the tasks of placing the
Nigeria-China relation in its proper focus have become imperative
given the ground-swell of enthusiasm that is greeting the
normalization of Nigeria's relations with western countries.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that "From 1978, when the late Mr. Deng
Xiaoping unchained the country's economic potential through wide
ranging economic reforms, China has not only come to the notice
of the world, but has even 'moved the world.'"
</P>
<P>
Modern China has consistently identified with the peoples of
the Third World and in numerous fora. China has stood by the
countries of Africa in the just struggle for a fair international
economic order, it added.
</P>
<P>
The author quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying at the U.N. General
Assembly on April 10, 1974, that "if one day China should change
her color and turn into a superpower, if she too should play the
tyrant the world and everywhere subject others to her bullying,
aggression and exploitation, the people of the world should
identify her as social imperialism, exposed it, oppose it and
work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it."
</P>
<P>
This essentially defines the theoretical foundation of China's
independent foreign policy which among others is to strengthen
solidarity and cooperation with developing countries of the Third
World, he added.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that last June, U.S. President Bill Clinton
traveled to China and spent unprecedented nine days there to the
envy of America's traditional friends in the region, Japan, South
Korea, etc.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hasn't gone to China to play golf or his favorite
trumpet. He went there to assure the Chinese leadership that
America seeks strategic partnership with China for constructive
dialog on numerous global and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The article continued that the responsible conduct of China in
the face of the Southeast Asian economic meltdown did not escape
the world that the country is a responsible global player.
</P>
<P>
With the currency free fall and stock exchanges collapse in
the sub-region, China from a pure economic rationality would have
simply devalued her currency to maintain competitive export
prices, but she held back in order not to worsen the already bad
situation.
</P>
<P>
Most western media speculated intensively that China was
definitely going to devalue her currency, but Chinese leadership
assured otherwise, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the article said, "If humanity is to survive,
China is certainly fully awaken and it does not seem that she
will go back to sleep again."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Regulate Clearing Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The government has been urged
to regulate the activities of all clearing agents in Zambia since
it is losing billions of Kwacha in revenue from import duty every
year due to the increasing number of unregulated clearing agents.
</P>
<P>
This call was made by Valerie Sesia, chairperson of Zambia
Customs and Forwarding Agents Association here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Thursday quoted Sesia as saying that the
government should immediately establish a national industrial
association to regulate the activities of all clearing agents.
</P>
<P>
Currently, she noted, there is a major problem in the
collection of revenue by Zambia Revenue Authority because of a
large number of small and big clearing agents whose conduct is
not regulated.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Zambia is losing revenue from import duty
through "under-collection" of duty.
</P>
<P>
She further disclosed that only 20 clearing agents belong to
her association and are collecting 46 percent of the government
revenue from importers while 60 clearing agents operate without
joining any association.
</P>
<P>
It is time for the government to enact a law to facilitate the
establishment of a national industrial association to monitor and
regulate the activities of all clearing agents to arrest the
current under-collection of duty, she said.

BONN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Dutch side PSV Eindhoven coach
Bobby Robson was angry with controversial referees' rulings in
their European Champions' League matches against Germany's
Kaiserslautern on Thursday in Kaiserslautern, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Robson said his side was slain by referees and was angry with
Eindhoven's fate as they have been virtually eliminated from the

</P>
<P>
Robson saw his side lost 3-1 to the German side after they
scored the first one in Wednesday's group F away match in which
his goalkeeper Patrick Lodewijks was sent off in the 26th minute
by English referee David Elleray.
</P>
<P>
But it was left unclear that Lodewijks, who collated with Uwe
Roesler, was expelled for challenging Roesler or was thought to
handle the ball outside the penalty box.
</P>

Eindhoven lost to Kaiserslautern 2-1 two weeks before when
French referee Alain Sars ruled Juergen Rische's header crossed

<HEADLINE> Russian Constitutional Court Rules on Presidential Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin is
serving the second presidential term and can not run for the
presidency in the year 2000, Russian Constitutional Court ruled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The court announced that in compliance with Article 81 of the
Russian Constitution, the Russian president exercised his powers
during the first term before the 1996 elections and was re-elected
to his office for the second time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, had requested
the examination of the presidential term by the Constitutional
Court because some lawyers from the president's office had
discussed a possibility of Yeltsin's participation in the next
elections, considering that the 1996 polls had been the start of
the first presidential term under the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Duma adopted amendments to the law on presidential
elections late in September, under which the same person "can not
be elected president more than two times."
</P>
<P>
These amendments were also approved by the Federal Council, or
the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin, the
president is satisfied with the decision passed by the
Constitutional Court Thursday since "he has already given himself
an answer to the main question -- that he will not take part in
the presidential elections in 2000."

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 5 (xinhua) --Three South Korean female
athletes were tested positive for the banned furosemide and have
been banned from the Asian Games in Thailand next month,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They are expected to be suspended for two years by related
sports organizations in the near future," said Kim Tae-young, a
spokesman for the South Korea Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
The three female athletes, identified only by their initials,
were two gymnasts and one swimmer. The furosemide is a banned
diuretic that promotes weight loss.
</P>
<P>
The doping test was conducted on 210 national athletes two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, fresh tests were conducted on six female
gymnasts, including the two who failed the initial test.
Officials plan to test South Korea's other 500 athletes soon.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time that South Korean athletes have failed
drug tests. A female weight lifter and a male sprinter were
suspended for using banned drugs in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
South Korea plans to send 710 athletes to the 13th Asian Games
to compete in all but three of the 36 events.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Start Second Phase Talks in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan started
their second phase talks here Thursday with their secretaries of
water resource and power ministries commencing discussions over
the Tulbul navigation project.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's offer to sell surplus power to India is likely to be
discussed during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Jhelum river flows through the two countries. The dispute is
over India's proposed construction of a barrage on the Jhelum,
downstream from the Wular Lake to control the flow of water in the
river in the lean season to make it navigable.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's argument is that building a barrage on the Jhelum at
the mouth of the Wular amounts to storage of water in
contravention of the Indus Water Treaty signed by the two
countries in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held talks over the issue eight times in the
past, but no agreement has been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
Work on the project, therefore, has been kept in abeyance since
1987.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached between India and Pakistan,
officials from the two sides would hold various talks here on
November 5-13 on issues such as the Tulbul navigation project
(Pakistan calls it the Wular Barrage), Siachen, Sir Creek maritime
boundary dispute, economic and commercial cooperation, terrorism
and drug trafficking and promotion of friendly exchanges in
various fields between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase talks, stalled in the past 13 months since
September last year, foreign secretaries of the two countries
resumed their talks in Islamabad on issues of "peace and security,
as well as Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the talks expressed their desire to make efforts
to keep peace and security in the region. Although they did not
make any progress on the Kashmir issue, they agreed to continue
their talks over the issue in February next year.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Regulate Clearing Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The government has been urged
to regulate the activities of all clearing agents in Zambia since
it is losing billions of Kwacha in revenue from import duty every
year due to the increasing number of unregulated clearing agents.
</P>
<P>
This call was made by Valerie Sesia, chairperson of Zambia
Customs and Forwarding Agents Association here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Thursday quoted Sesia as saying that the
government should immediately establish a national industrial
association to regulate the activities of all clearing agents.
</P>
<P>
Currently, she noted, there is a major problem in the
collection of revenue by Zambia Revenue Authority because of a
large number of small and big clearing agents whose conduct is
not regulated.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Zambia is losing revenue from import duty
through "under-collection" of duty.
</P>
<P>
She further disclosed that only 20 clearing agents belong to
her association and are collecting 46 percent of the government
revenue from importers while 60 clearing agents operate without
joining any association.
</P>
<P>
It is time for the government to enact a law to facilitate the
establishment of a national industrial association to monitor and
regulate the activities of all clearing agents to arrest the
current under-collection of duty, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Begins 11th Session Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's 7th parliament, the
Jatiya Sangsad, began its 11th session Thursday afternoon amid a
tense political atmosphere across the country.
</P>
<P>
Five bills, such as the Upazila Parishad (sub-district council)
Bill, would come up for discussion at the 15-day session, which
will continue through November 19.
</P>
<P>
The recent ordinance imposing surcharge on services and
imports, and bills on the remuneration and privileges of the
President and Judges of the Supreme Court are expected to be taken
up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
The session was scheduled to start at 4:00 p.m. local time, but
was delayed till 4:30 p.m., with the absence of many opposition
members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the parliament's Business Advisory Committee
Wednesday, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
proposed general discussion on law and order, the prices of
essentials and on the overall economic situation during the
session.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion was rejected outright," an opposition member of
the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Acting Secretary General of the BNP Ashraf Hossain
Wednesday urged the people and all "patriotic forces" to unite for
a massive anti-government movement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a rally in the capital, he said the rule of law
couldn't be established in the country without the removal of the
government. "It has become imperative to change the government in
order to protect the country and its people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led seven-party alliance observed a country-wide
protest day Wednesday against what they said misrule, repression
and corruption of the government.
</P>
<P>
Hossain rejected the claim of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that
her government was trying the killers to establish the rule of law
in the country, as "hundreds of opposition activists were killed
by the goons of the ruling party and none of them was tried."
</P>
<P>
BNP leaders also accused Hasina of "giving shelter" to the
killers of her father inside her own party, a report in Thursday's
edition of The New Nation newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hasina Wednesday called on "pro-liberation and
democratic forces to get united against any conspiracy designed to
destabilize political situation in the country."
</P>
<P>
"The conspirators are out to disrupt democracy and rule of
law," she told leaders of different political parties.
</P>
<P>
And the government has tightened security measures throughout
the country, particularly around the capital city, ahead of the
scheduled announcement on November 8 of the verdict of the murder
case of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Mujib Rahman, the first prime minister of independent
Bangladesh and father of incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
along with most of his family members, was killed on August 15,
1975 in a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were accused in the murder case of Mujib
Rahman, and the trial began in January 1997, half a year after the
Awami League, led by Hasina, came to power following its victory
in the country's 1996 general elections.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM on EU Report on Candidate Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said Thursday that it is a positive step to include Turkey in
the candidate list in the European Commission report.
</P>
<P>
"Even though some mistaken evaluations of the European Union
(EU) continue, the definition of the EU Commission for Turkey as
one of the 12 candidates for full membership opens a way for
improvement in our relations," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
Cem's comment came after the European Commission Foreign
Affairs commissioner Hans Van den Broek, former Dutch foreign
minister, presented a report on the progress toward accession by
each of the candidate countries to the European Parliament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that the EU seemed to be distancing itself from the
discrimination a little bit and this is pleasing.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is evaluated as the actual candidate of full
membership. When the EU brings into life this approach on the
level of the heads of state or government, the relations (between
the EU and Turkey) will gain momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders excluded Ankara from the ranks of the candidate
countries for the EU enlargement process at the Luxembourg summit
last December.
</P>
<P>
Turkey halted its political dialog with the EU to protest the
European body's "discrimination" against the Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
Cem continued, "some baseless claims and expressions in the
section related with the political situation in Turkey
constitutes a misleading aspect of the report."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is eligible as a candidate, but it is also true that
its political situation leaves much to be desired," said the Van
den Broek report.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the absence of real civilian control over the
Turkish army and persistent violations of human rights and
important deficiencies in the treatment of minorities were still
blocking Turkey's integration with the EU.

Tough measures will be imposed on these countries and regions,

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Urged to Strengthen Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A signed article carried by the
official newspaper New Nigeria Thursday urged the Nigerian
government to strengthen its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The article written by Chiles Onunauu said "from the point of
real-politics and long term interest, Nigeria must improve and
strengthen her relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"No country that aspires to enter the twenty-first century
with a self enlightened nation of economic viability and growth
can afford to ignore China," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the author, the tasks of placing the
Nigeria-China relation in its proper focus have become imperative
given the ground-swell of enthusiasm that is greeting the
normalization of Nigeria's relations with western countries.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that "From 1978, when the late Mr. Deng
Xiaoping unchained the country's economic potential through wide
ranging economic reforms, China has not only come to the notice
of the world, but has even 'moved the world.'"
</P>
<P>
Modern China has consistently identified with the peoples of
the Third World and in numerous fora. China has stood by the
countries of Africa in the just struggle for a fair international
economic order, it added.
</P>
<P>
The author quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying at the U.N. General
Assembly on April 10, 1974, that "if one day China should change
her color and turn into a superpower, if she too should play the
tyrant the world and everywhere subject others to her bullying,
aggression and exploitation, the people of the world should
identify her as social imperialism, exposed it, oppose it and
work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it."
</P>
<P>
This essentially defines the theoretical foundation of China's
independent foreign policy which among others is to strengthen
solidarity and cooperation with developing countries of the Third
World, he added.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that last June, U.S. President Bill Clinton
traveled to China and spent unprecedented nine days there to the
envy of America's traditional friends in the region, Japan, South
Korea, etc.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hasn't gone to China to play golf or his favorite
trumpet. He went there to assure the Chinese leadership that
America seeks strategic partnership with China for constructive
dialog on numerous global and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The article continued that the responsible conduct of China in
the face of the Southeast Asian economic meltdown did not escape
the world that the country is a responsible global player.
</P>
<P>
With the currency free fall and stock exchanges collapse in
the sub-region, China from a pure economic rationality would have
simply devalued her currency to maintain competitive export
prices, but she held back in order not to worsen the already bad
situation.
</P>
<P>
Most western media speculated intensively that China was
definitely going to devalue her currency, but Chinese leadership
assured otherwise, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the article said, "If humanity is to survive,
China is certainly fully awaken and it does not seem that she
will go back to sleep again."

ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia increased their
chances of a place in Sunday's final of the 20th Champions Trophy
hockey tournament after outplaying Spain 3-1 for their second
victory on Thursday in Lahore, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
They have now eight points from four matches and meet the
world and Olympic champions the Netherlands in their final league
match on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Playing with fluency and adroitness, the Aussies grabbed the
lead in the 12th minute when Vivian Taylor took advantage of a
penalty corner rebound following initial attempts by Jay Stacy
and Adam Commens, and pushed the ball past Spanish goalkeeper
Ramon Jufresa.
</P>
<P>
Australia which has won the Trophy six times dominated the
exchanges with their intelligent game and secured the second goal
in the 30th minute through Scott Webster after being set up by
Ben Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Spain, going down to their second defeat, retaliated strongly
and were able to reduce the lead in the 32nd minute from their
second penalty corner which was pushed home by Javier Arnau who
got hold of the ball after Victor Pujol feigned a drive but
instead passed the ball to Arnau.
</P>
<P>
Moving into the second period with 2-1 lead, Australia further
consolidated their position with the third goal in the 48th
minute through their captain Jay Stacy who received an excellent
pass from Daniel Sproule.

<HEADLINE> Stuffed Panda Kindles Warm Memories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- "Shasha", a panda that died
three months ago, finally returned to the city of Taiyuan last
weekend to join the many people who enjoyed her during her 17-year
stay at the city's zoo.
</P>
<P>
People crowded the zoo's walkway to get a glimpse of the
stuffed animal as she was carried to the reception room. Shasha
was believed to be China's oldest female giant panda. She lived to
the age of 33 before succumbing to heart failure and cerebral
blockage in July, when she was sent to Beijing to be stuffed.
</P>
<P>
The 1.4-meter tall Shasha almost looks better than in life with
her glistening fur and bright artificial eyes, which give no
indication of just how advanced she was in age or that she was
blind because of cataracts years before her death. She looks just
like a 10-year-old, zoo workers say.
</P>
<P>
Shasha will stay in the reception room while a large glass case
is prepared for her, and if there is no pollution or moisture, she
could last for a hundred years, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
Shasha came to the Taiyuan Zoo in 1981 and was much enjoyed by
local people, with about 700,000 visiting the panda house each
year. Many people even offered medical help after she lost her
sight.
</P>
<P>
She stopped breathing on July 2 and local veterinarians and
zookeepers tried frantically with some modern equipment and
constant care to keep her alive, but couldn't save her.
</P>
<P>
The zoo's deputy-director Wei Zezhen says that he's happy to
have Shasha back because the people loved her so much.
</P>
<P>
China has about 1,000 of the rare giant pandas living in the
wild in the southwestern part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Two Opposition Parties Link Pardon With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Formation of Government
</P>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A joint statement issued by
the FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) hinted that amnesty must
be given to their supporters convicted in political cases before
the coalition partners can go to work together in the next
government.
</P>
<P>
The eight-page release, titled "a political platform for a
coalition government in Cambodia for 1998-2003", obtained here
Thursday is divided to two major parts, one about "immediate
tasks" and other "the program for a new direction".
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed, "The issue of amnesty must be
addressed. No one can envision a situation in which a party allows
its loyal generals and other politicians be labeled as criminals
while it enters into a partnership with the party which condemns
them."
</P>
<P>
Though it did not specify the persons to pardon, it is believed
to be the top FUNCINPEC generals such as Nhiek Bun Chhay and Serey
Kosal who were loyal to Prince Ranariddh and were convicted in
absentia earlier this year of threatening national stability in
mid-1997. The two men are commanding bands of resistance troops at
the border.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC and the SRP also claimed that the underlying
cause of the current deadlock is "the lack of trust between the
CPP (Cambodian People's Party) and the opposition parties". "Trust
and confidence-building measures should be seriously considered if
the negotiation is to be successful and the coalition government
to last," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement asked to resume and speed up the negotiations of
reintegration of Nhiek Bun Chhay's troops near the Thai border. It
said General Nhiek Bun Chhay and his troops are part of the Royal
Cambodian Armed Forces, and are recognized as such by the Japanese
Peace Plan.
</P>
<P>
"Without reintegration, the formation of the coalition
government cannot be successful," it warned.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Kanharith, information secretary of state and the CPP's
spokesman, told Xinhua Thursday that he maintained the
preconditions put forward by the opposition are unacceptable. "It
is their delaying tactics," he said. "Their aim is to continue the
current political deadlock and to reduce the international
pressure upon them."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that three months have past since the election
and the opposition's attempt to ask the international community
not to accept the results of the election has also failed. "The
international community began to attribute the deadlock to the
opposition parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, we should make the National Assembly functioning
and discuss the formation of the government," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
So far, three working group sessions and one high-level summit
between the CPP, SRP and FUNCINPEC have failed to form a coalition
government and end deadlock that started with the July 26
election.
</P>
<P>
The statement came nearly two weeks after Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen outlined a seven-point plan in an October 22 speech for
heightened security and reform measures designed to restore
international aid and recognition lost when last July's factional
fighting brought down the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
While the aim of both plans is similar, analysts said political
will is needed to carry out the proposals.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Up Slightly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate in the
Philippines climbed slightly to 10.2 percent in October from 10.0
percent in September, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said in
a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average of the year-on-year inflation rate for each of the
first 10 months reached 9.5 percent, the NSO said in its monthly
Consumer Price Index report.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the October inflation rate for food, beverages
and tobacco as a group was considered a major contributor to the
overall rise.
</P>
<P>
The group registered an inflation rate of 9.9 percent in
October from 9.4 percent in September, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The rate of the group went up due to two recent typhoons which
wrecked damage to wide areas of farmland and had an effect on
prices of commodities, particularly food items, analysts here
said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the rate for clothing declined to 7.9
percent in October from 8.5 percent in September while the rate
for housing and repairs was down to 10.7 percent from 11.1
percent, that for fuel, light and water to 6.3 percent from 6.6
percent, and that for service to 13.6 percent from 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month inflation rate in October increased to 0.6
percent, 0.2 percentage points higher than a month earlier, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
A senior Central Bank official said last month that the
inflation this year might hit the lower end of the target of
between 9.25 percent and 9.75 percent set by the government
despite the typhoons.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosion Near Kremlin Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A car explosion near the
Kremlin wall in Moscow Wednesday night was a terrorist act, police
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb was a home-made bomb, whose capacity was equal to
400-600 grams of trinitrotoluene, according to preliminary
estimates of experts.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at 19:05 Moscow time (1405 GMT)
Wednesday not far from the Kremlin's Spasskiye Gate, injuring
three people -- two Kremlin security guards and one serviceman of
the presidential regiment.
</P>
<P>
It did not cause any serious damage either to the Kremlin or
other buildings.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Moskvish car has been identified as
65-year-old Ivan Orlov from Podolsk, near Moscow. He drove his
car from Staraya Ploshchad along Ilyinka Street and into Red
Square, ignoring stop signs and traffic police orders, then headed
for the Spasskiye Gate where the car exploded.
</P>
<P>
The driver jumped out of the automobile when it was 20 meters
away from the place of explosion and was not hurt. He was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said his documents showed he is a
correspondent of the magazine Russkaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
A joint investigation group -- set up by the Federal Security
Service, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Guard Service -- is
looking into the incident.

PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The mid-term election in the United States, held on Tuesday
under the shadow of Monicagate, did not profit the Republican
Party. The election results were a draw and therefore a victory
for the Democrats. This failure of the Republicans has made more
unlikely the impeachment of President Bill Clinton by the Senate
or his resignation.
</P>
<P>
-- The current casualties from the passing of hurricane Mitch
in Central America could number 25,000 victims. Honduras has
reported 7,000 deaths with at least 14,000 missing, while 1,817
bodies have been found in Nicaragua and 2,000 people could still
be in the water and the rubbles. Two million people in Honduras,
or one third of the country's population, as well as 400,000 in
Nicaragua and 60,000 in Salvador are now homeless.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Clinton has saved his presidency, because
although the Republicans have conserved their majority at the
Congress, its was the Democrats who celebrated on Wednesday the
result of the mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
-- As German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder arrived in Warsaw on
Thursday for a visit, Poland is worried about a take-over of land
and other immobile properties by its powerful neighbor. A
majority of the Polish wish to see a restriction of the purchase
of the country's lands by foreigners, especially by their German
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> PM: Turkey Must Be Involved in Northern Iraq Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz has said that Turkey should be included in any talks aimed
at resolving problems in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper reported Thursday that Yilmaz made the
statement following a meeting with visiting Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) leader Massoud Barzani Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey's exclusion from the Washington talks
was a diplomatic mistake. "Turkey is the country which is most
sensitive to the developments in northern Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by
Jalal Talabani signed a peace accord in mid-September in
Washington under the auspices of the U.S. State Department,
trying to end armed conflicts in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This greatly annoyed Ankara which initiated the Ankara Peace
Process jointly with the United States and Britain to solve the
Kurd problems in northern Iraq. The area became a power vacuum
following the 1991 Gulf War and Turkey has repeatedly sent troops
there to wipe out its separatist Kurdish militants.
</P>
<P>
Turkey fears that the Washington accord would lead to an
independent Kurdish homeland in northern Iraq which could further
encourage Turkish Kurds to fight for their own independence in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), outlawed in Turkey, have
taken shelter in northern Iraq and launched hit-and-run attacks
against Turkish targets in 14-year-old armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that one of the major aims of Barzani's
visit to Ankara is to ease Turkey's concerns over the future of
northern Iraq after the signing of Washington peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who has defined the KDP-PUK agreement as a "diplomatic
gaffe," seemed to be satisfied with Barzani's explanations and
said "steps are now being taken to ease misunderstandings."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has suggested that a joint statement be released by
Turkey, the United States and Britain to clarify the nature of
the Washington peace accord. However, no response has been
received from Washington and London so far.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz stressed the importance of security cooperation between
Turkey and Iraqi Kurdish groups against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Turkish KDP has been joining hands with Ankara in
fighting PKK militants, but the PUK, which is allegedly backed by
Iran, keeps closer ties with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Barzani arrived here Tuesday night to brief the Turkish
government on the situation in northern Iraq and to meet with
Talabani who is expected here this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Starts Peace Agreement Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday presented the Wye peace agreement to
his cabinet for approval, raising the hope that this peace accord
with the Palestinians could not be further delayed for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet ministers met at 10:00 AM (local time) Thursday
morning and Netanyahu presented copies of the agreement to them
all along with six letters sent to Netanyahu by U.S. Secretary of
State Madaleine Albright and U.S. ambassador to Israel Edward
Walker concerning the U.S. promise about Israel's security and
other matters need for the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet debate on the agreement would last for one or two
days before ratifying it because all ministers would make clear
their stance on the agreement, said a senior Israeli government
official.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had postponed the cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians failed to present a time table for
the arrests of 30 Palestinian suspects accused of killing nearly
100 Israelis in the past.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, namely the Wye River Memorandum, was signed
by Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on October 23 in
Washington after nine days of hard negotiations at the Wye
Plantation outside Washington. Under this accord, Israel has to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank territories
in 12 weeks with the Palestinians taking steps against Islamic
militants during each phase of the pullback.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the Wanted men had
already been detained, thus paving the way for Netanyahu to
present the agreement for cabinet approval Thursday.

<HEADLINE> France Expects European Airspace Groups to Merge in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said Thursday that all the conditions are met for reaching
an agreement on the merger of the French airspace group
Aerospatiale-Matra, the British Aerospace and the German airspace
group DASA within six months.
</P>
<P>
"All the conditions are there for finding a balanced
agreement," Richard said on Europe 1 television channel,
estimating that such a merger will be made in the first half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the first half of the year 1999 is a period in
which one can meet all the conditions for a new, very great
European enterprise of aeronautics and space," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the idea that the British Aerospace and DASA will
merge by themselves, because such a move will put what he called
two biggest European airspace groups -- the other being
Aerospatiale-Matra -- in rivalry.
</P>
<P>
As for the future European airspace group, he said that the
three original groups will maintain separate management and
separate geographical distribution of means and financial
capacities.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Protests Over Qatari TV Station's Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Ministry has
protested to the Qatari Embassy in Jordan over the anti-Jordanian
contents aired by the Doha-based Al-Jazeera television station.
</P>
<P>
The protest was made late Wednesday right after the government
revoked the press credentials of all the six staff of the Qatari
satellite TV bureau in Amman, thus effectively closing the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The ministry asked for "concrete changes" of the station's
policy, local media quoted a letter of protest of the ministry as
saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We want the Al-Jazeera to stop its pattern of targeting
Jordan, just like it does not target other countries," the
semi-official Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible must apologize officially and publicly, if
the station wants to resume cooperation with the Jordanian
government, the Jordan Times quoted Information Minister Nasir
Judeh as saying late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Embassy has not made response to the Jordanian
Government's protest until Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Jordanian government closes a
foreign media office. Judeh said that the government made the
decision because the Qatari TV station had been attacking Jordan
and intended to harm Jordan's dignity and deform its history and
political life.
</P>
<P>
Judeh especially criticized the TV's program entitled "The
Opposition Direction" accusing Jordan of conspiring with Israel
since its foundation in 1948. It said that the Jordanian army
surrendered Palestinian land to Israel without any resistance.
</P>
<P>
The program also said that the Jordanian leaders were rewarded
for siding with Israel with the establishment of the Hashmite
Kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan established a new press and publication law earlier this
year to strictly regulate the press and punish media that carries
anti-Jordanian reports. Wednesday's decision was made in
accordance with Article 9 of the law, which governs the actions of
reporters from foreign media.

<HEADLINE> French Envoy Leaves amid Iraq-U.N. Standoff </HEADLINE>

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- French charge d'affaires to
Iraq left here Thursday morning for Paris for consultations after
Iraq announced last Saturday to suspend relations with U.N. arms
inspectors, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Yves Aubin de la Messuziere had informed the
Iraqi government of the French government's decision to recall him
for consultations.
</P>
<P>
Messuziere on Tuesday delivered a letter from French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine to the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, in which Vedrine stressed the seriousness of the possible
consequences from Baghdad's decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some allies have called Iraq to reverse its ban on
weapons inspections and threatened to use military force to press
compliance.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said in the letter the Iraq's suspension of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq
will surely not help in having the U.N. sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions can only be removed after U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has been free of prohibited weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad announced last Saturday that it was halting all forms
of cooperation with UNSCOM, including the commission's monitoring
activities in Iraq, until the U.N. Security Council moves toward
easing and lifting the eight-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously condemned the Iraqi
decision and demanded it be rescinded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Implementation of Macao Nationality Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that it is within China's sovereignty to explain the
implementation of the Nationality Law of China in Macao in
accordance with the actual situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, made the remarks to counter the words
of Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira who said that "issues
concerning the implementation of the Nationality Law of China in
Macao should not be decided by the Preparatory Committee of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)."
</P>
<P>
Chen, also secretary general of the Macao SAR Preparatory
Committee, pointed out that implementation of the Nationality Law
in Macao is a matter of implementing China's national laws in the
region, so it is China's internal affairs to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that a working group of the Macao SAR Preparatory
Committee has discussed the issue under the principle of the
Nationality Law, and took into consideration the actual situation in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that the Working Group of Legal Affairs has
created a draft on the issue and expects to hand it over to the
upcoming Fourth Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for
discussion, and then submit it to the National People's Congress
Standing Committee for examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
He described the draft as valid, and one which safeguards the
basic principles of the Nationality Law and considers the actual
situation in Macao, and interests of the Portuguese born in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is convinced that the draft will be welcomed by
many segments of society in Macao upon approval.

CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>

Washington last month and urged both sides to honor the accord.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:

Mubarak has sent a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over
the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
He did not give the content of the message, but expressed the
hope that the tension will be defused soon to secure the
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and restore
the confidence between Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen is due in Cairo
Thursday, the five leg of his six-nation Middle East tour, to
lobby support for possible military actions against Iraq in view
of its move to suspend all relations with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, and
he will travel on to Turkey Friday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- After his return from a lightning visit to Libya, Moussa
briefed Mubarak Wednesday on his talks with Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi over the latest developments in the Lockerbie crisis, the
U.S.-British position and Tripoli's demands for guarantee before
handing over two wanted suspects for a trial.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has said that the sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992
will be suspended once it turns over the Libyans suspected of
bombing the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Dismisses Fears of Higher Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it can keep the country's inflation rate this year
within its range target despite the slight uptick in October.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office reported Thursday that the
year-on-year inflation rate for October went up slightly to 10.2
percent in October from 10 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation rate for the first 10 months of this
year increased by 9.5 percent, just within the government's range
target of 9.25 percent to 9.75 percent, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing fears of higher inflation, Economic Planning
Secretary Felipe Medalla said that the uptick in October was due
to typhoons and increases in sugar prices.
</P>
<P>
"We are still going to achieve our target," he said.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson also said that the
increase in the October inflation rate was due mainly to the
9-percent rise in the average prices of the food, beverages and
tobacco commodity group.
</P>
<P>
"This slight uptick is at worst, short-lived, and does not
affect the continued stabilization of consumer prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that supply constraints can easily normalize after the
La Nina phenomenon and in many cases can be addressed by timely
and sufficient importation.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, he said, the monetary authorities' prudent
policy stance will sustain the efforts to tame inflationary
pressures in the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Criticizes Syria's Hostile Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh has criticized Syria for being hostile towards Jordan and
called its government to put an end to this attitude and prevent a
possible crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian hostility is manifested in its refusal to cooperate
with Jordan mainly on security, trade and prisoner matters, the
semi-official Jordan Times Thursday quoted Tarawneh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein referred a detailed file about the
terrorist acts carried out or planned by some Syrians in Jordan to
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in 1996, but Jordan never received
a reply from Damascus about the file, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned over this issue, especially as the file
contains details of serious cases that should not be allowed to
continue and because security relations among nations are of
paramount importance," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the field of trade and economic cooperation, Syria froze the
work of the Jordanian-Syrian joint committee in 1990 and has not
appointed an ambassador to serve in Jordan since 1993, said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Jordan can not understand the reasons behind these two acts,
Tarawneh said, since both of them happened before the 1994
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, a major basis on which Syria
established its long-time accusations against Jordan.
</P>
<P>
A third point of Syrian hostility is that Syria detains 500
Jordanians and still harasses other Jordanians entering or passing
its territory, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
"Why are Jordanians held up at the border by the Syrian
authorities and accused of being agents of the (Israeli
intelligence) Mossad and the (United States intelligence) CIA?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh urged Syria to end the Jordanian-Syrian crisis and
maintain good relations with the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been attacking Jordan for years over its peace
treaty with Israel. It alleged that Jordan tries to form a
military alliance with Turkey and Israel, one of whose main
enemies was Syria.

<HEADLINE> Australia Records First Fall in Exports to SE Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian exports to
Southeast Asia fell for the first time in at least a decade during
the past financial year, in a further sign of the impact of the
Asian crisis on Australia's trade performance, official figures
released here Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, imports from seven Southeast Asian countries
soared by over 25 percent, contributing to the blowout in
Australia's trade deficit in the financial year of 1997-1998
ending June 30, 1998, according to a report issued Thursday by the
Australian government.
</P>
<P>
The report on trade and investment in the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) region, which was released by the Australian
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), said a 6.2 percent
fall in Australia's exports to Southeast Asian countries during
the past financial year was the first on record, and dramatically
reversed a trend which had seen exports to the region grow at 14.5
percent a year over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia is collectively Australia's second biggest
export market after Japan, but the Asian crisis saw exports fall
to all but two of the seven countries last year.
</P>
<P>
But the collapse in the region's economies and currencies also
flooded Australia with imports from Southeast Asia, which soared
26.3 percent, almost twice the trend rate of the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
Australia still maintained a surplus with the region but it
plunged from 3.9 billion Australian dollars (2.34 billion U.S.
dollars) to 1.0 billion Australian dollars (600 million U.S.
dollars), the lowest level in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Despite the collapse in exports to Southeast Asia, the report
found exports to the entire Asia Pacific region remained resilient
in the face of the Asian downturn.
</P>
<P>
Record levels of exports to Japan, the United States, the
Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Canada helped offset the downturn
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Exports to APEC economies grew 7.6 percent, including a
staggering 36.2 percent growth in exports to North American Free
Trade Area (NAFTA) members the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However the surge in imports again outweighed the growth in
exports and slashed Australia's trade surplus with the region from
6.7 billion Australian dollars (4.02 billion U.S. dollars) to 1.9
billion Australian dollars (1.14 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report reveals that APEC now accounts for 73.2 percent of
Australia's exports and contains Australia's eight biggest export
markets and 12 of the top 15.
</P>
<P>
It also provides 68.7 percent of Australia's imports and eight
of its top 10 sources of imports.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Firm Above 63 U.S. Cent Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar took a
firm hold on the 63-U.S.-cent barrier Thursday and spent most of
the session over the mark to close higher.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust Australia Deputy President International Matt
Gilmour said it had been a "pretty firm" trading day, with the
local currency hitting a high of 63.28 U.S. cents Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 63.20 U.S. cents from 63.05
U.S. cents Wednesday after trading between 62.87 U.S. cents and
63.28 U.S. cents in the day.
</P>
<P>
The main factor keeping the Australian dollar up was the
absence of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA), Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
The market had widely tipped a cut Wednesday morning, after the
RBA board held its monthly meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cut failed to materialize Wednesday and again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there's no action by the RBA certainly makes
them feel more comfortable about buying the Australian dollar than
they did perhaps a week ago," Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 74.40
Japanese yen from 73.06 yen and 1.0537 German marks from 1.0455
marks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
lost its momentum Thursday as falls on overseas markets,
disappointment with banking stocks and the diminishing prospect of
a near-term cut in interest rates combined to dampen sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index slipped 7.5 points to
2,672.4, after reaching a peak of 2,702.0 points earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stockbroking client adviser Kim Ferrier said there were
a number of factors behind the fall on the local bourse Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said a correction in Nikkei in Japan had put a "bit of a
dampener" on the market.
</P>
<P>
"The NAB's (National Australia Bank's) mooted takeover of ANZ
(Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.) didn't eventuate and
the NAB results didn't set the market alight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"People had also factored in a cut of rates and that
disappointment is still running through the market," he added.
</P>
<P>
The RBA failed to cut rates so far after its board meeting
Tuesday. Lower interest rates benefit the share market because
they reduce company's borrowing costs and attract funds into
equity markets from fixed interest markets.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian equity market, the all resources index added
13.1 points to 1,068.8, while the all industrials index slumped
29.0 points to 4,667.0.
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks were mostly lower, with the industry sub-index
tumbling 84 points to 5,721.9.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank, which reported a 10 percent fall in
full year profit to 2.014 billion Australian dollars (1.272
billion U.S. dollars), slipped 19 cents to 21.85 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ, which market rumors had suggested the NAB could
announce a takeover play for Thursday, dropped 23 cents to 9.61
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Westpac bank fell 29 cents to 9.60 Australian dollars,
Commonwealth Bank of Australia retreated 10 cents to 9.90
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the resource sector, Australia's leading company BHP surged
13 cents to 13.28 Australian dollars. Fellow diversified miner Rio
Tinto stacked on 36 cents to 20.68 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index surged 36.7 points to 1,171.0. The spot price of
gold bullion in Sydney Thursday afternoon was 291.25 U.S. dollars
an ounce, up from Wednesday's close of 289.35 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary national turnover was 311.19 million stocks traded
for 604.71 million U.S. dollars, with rising stocks outnumbering
falling stocks 543 to 538 and 359 stocks remaining steady.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo on
Thursday as investors took profits following the big point-gains
in the previous trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 186.44 points, or 1.28
percent, to end at 14,341.37, after surging by 960 points from the
previous two days and posting its highest finish in nearly two
months on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped by 2.79 points or 0.25 percent to
1,104.57.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section remained heavy at an estimated
number of 569 million shares, but down from 687.85 million shares
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Construction and home builder shares fell after Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka hinted that an extra session of
the Diet (parliament) later this month might not include talks on
cutting housing, income and corporate taxes to stimulate domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that Wednesday's sharp rise may have been an
overreaction to news that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a major
U.S. investment bank, has decided to raise its global weighting in
Japanese stocks due to their relatively low prices.
</P>
<P>
Many traders said the Morgan Stanley news gave a strong
psychological boost to the market, but they are also still looking
for signs of an improvement in Japan's economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, losers
surpassed gainers by 668 to 463, with 162 issues ending
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Garment Exports to Hit 1.35B U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's garment export turnover
this year may reach 1.35 billion U.S. dollars, a little higher
than last year, but still lower than this year's target, the
Saigon Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily said the profit margin earned from
garment exports is "very low and unstable" as most enterprises
only rely on the export of subcontracted goods to the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The export of subcontracted garments to the quota-controlled
markets in 1998 may earn 650 million dollars, a 35-percent
increase over 1997, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It said garment exports to the quota-free markets such as
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have shown a drop of about 200
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official of the import-export division under the Trade
Ministry said garment orders placed by quota-free markets still
tend to decrease sharply due to the regional financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Indian Peacekeepers to Replace Norwegians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The first 165 Indian
peacekeepers arrived here Thursday to replace Norwegians serving
in the United Nations force in south Lebanon, the Orient radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 625-strong Indian army battalion will arrive
soon to take over the security positions inside the Israeli
occupied south Lebanon that have been manned by Norwegians for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government announced earlier this year that it
would be pulling 625 peacekeepers out of south Lebanon by the end
of this year, due to problems in attracting new recruits.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon had since been seeking replacement troops from a
western state, especially France, which enjoys good relations with
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
However, no Western countries seemed willing to send their
troops to such a hostile area where Lebanon's resistance movements
are fighting a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and their
allied militia.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 1,200-square-kilometer, self-styled
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border attack
by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) was established in 1978 after Israel's first invasion, in
a bid to restore the Lebanese government's authority over south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Norwegian battalion, the UNIFIL consists of
troops from Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal
and Poland.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has managed to eliminate illiteracy among people aged 20
to 50 after several years of work.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has spent 193 million yuan (23
million U.S. dollars) on the task and set up many literacy classes
and courses on childhood education, health care, and knitting or
sewing to meet basic needs and to inspire people. A lot of
teachers and high school students have also gone to people's homes
to teach them.
</P>
<P>
The number of illiterate people in the province has dropped by
6.51 million since 1979, and the 1.2 million illiterate and
semiliterate people account for only 2.2 percent of the
province's 51.1 million people between the ages of 20 and 50.
</P>
<P>
Henan has more than 93 million people, the largest province in
China in terms of population, and 8.55 percent, or 3.48 million,
of the 40.76 million people between 20 and 50 were illiterate or
semiliterate, in the fourth national census in 1990, which meant
that the job was a rather arduous one.

<HEADLINE> Praises for Zakopane from IOC Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Zakopane, one of six
cities bidding to host the 2006 Winter Olympics, got a thumb-up
from the visiting 16-member International Olympics Committee
(IOC) delegation headed by Japanese member Chiharulgaya.
</P>
<P>
Chiharulgaya declined to evaluate the 18 facilities after
inspection, but said he thinks the city is completely capable of
hosting the Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Zakopane was the fifth stop by an IOC evaluation delegation
who is reponsible of reviewing the proposals and visiting all the
candidate venues before filing a report to the IOC executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
Besides Zakopane, the other bidders for the 2006 Games are
Sion of Switzerland, Turin of Italy, the Finnish capital Helsinki
in combination with Lillehammer in Norway, Slovakia's Poprad
Tatry and Austria's Klagenfurt.
</P>
<P>
The Polish city, with its under-developed sports
infrastructure, is considered to have little chance of competing
for the games against other bidders such as Sion in Switzerland,
which is widely seen as the early front-runner for 2006.
</P>
<P>
A final decision will be taken by the IOC in Seoul on June 19
next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Involved in New Hunt for Human Origins (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archaeologists have found many anthropoid ape fossils dating
back 4 to 8 million years at Yuanmou and Lufeng in Yunnan
Province. The oldest relic sites of human beings in China are near
Yuanmou, where archaeologists have found human fossils dating back
at least 1.6 million years.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are now focusing on a fossil site near Chongqing's
Wushan County northeast of Yunnan Province, where a human tooth
and stone artifacts were found in the 2-million-year-old layer.
</P>
<P>
Results suggest that the stone tools are not the most primitive
and that there may even be earlier human traces in this area, says
Hou Yamei, a specialist in paleolithic stone artifacts at the
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Scientists point out that the origin and evolution of human
beings in southwestern and central China was a direct result of
the fast rise of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which affected the
climate in that area. The colder climate caused an eventual change
in manner of walking and the body structure of apes, which then
evolved into homo erectus, and ultimately modern man, Huang says.
</P>
<P>
Another team from the Institute has discovered a large number
of fossilized mammals, bones with hand-chipped marks, and several
stone artifacts in a cave at Fanchang in Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
They are not any younger than the Wushan findings and may even
be an earlier piece of human evolution in East Asia, according to
Prof. Jin Changlin, head of the team.

<HEADLINE> Fixed-Asset Investment to Continue Momentum in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The latest report from the
China State Information Center says that in 1999, China's
investment in fixed assets will continue to maintain its growing
momentum, with the growth rate expected to be slightly higher than
this year's level.
</P>
<P>
Driven by policies to expand domestic demand and stimulate
economic growth, China's state-sector investment in fixed assets
has been steadily growing this year, with a growth rate of 20
percent for the first nine months, 8.8 percentage points higher
than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report explains that with growing support from fiscal
expenditure and banking credit, the state-sector investment in
fixed assets is expected to grow by over 20 percent in the
remaining months of this year, while the total amount of
investment in fixed assets this year is expected to reach 2.89
trillion yuan, up 16 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The report projects that in 1999 the total amount of
investment in fixed assets will be about 3.4 trillion yuan,
an increase of some 17.5 percent from this year.
</P>
<P>
It also says that next year the foreign trade environment is
unlikely to improve, and domestic demand will remain a major
contributor to the national economy, and concludes that next
year's economic growth will largely depend on investment.
</P>
<P>
The report holds that China must maintain a fairly high
economic growth rate next year, and that as a result, the state's
macroeconomic policies are expected to focus on expanding domestic
demand, so the necessary fiscal and financial policies will be
adopted to support and encourage investment projects with good
market prospects.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Big Dollar Inflows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) said Thursday that the local financial market
will help boost the economy with millions of U.S. dollar
remittance inflows from Filipino overseas workers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Thursday morning, BAP President Deogracias
Vistan said that big dollar remittances are expected in the second
half of this month in time for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
Member banks are now gearing up for the efficient facilitation
of the overseas workers' dollar remittances for the country's
millions of beneficiaries, Vistan said.
</P>
<P>
For many years now, Filipino overseas workers have been among
the biggest sources of foreign exchange earnings for the country.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that about 4.5 million Filipinos are
working abroad.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said that another factor that will push the country's
economy is the renewed confidence of foreign fund managers in the
country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
This can be manifested by a week-long rally of the stock market
index which resulted in the strengthening once again of the
country's portfolio investments, Vistan said.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said that this development translated the foreign fund
managers' confidence in more dollar inflows into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stock market index has got close to the
1,800-point level, compared to only 1,300 points previously.

BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale hunt for human
fossils and stone artifacts is underway in southwestern and
central parts of China, where paleontologists hope to find
evidence to back a long-debated theory on human origins.
</P>
<P>
Several archaeology teams are working in an area east of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in Yunnan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces and
the city of Chongqing, looking for fossilized evidence dating back

What they are looking for specifically is a missing link in the

between ape and man, is to some extent to pose a challenge to the
accepted theory that human beings originated in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A great number of Chinese scholars prefer a theory of multiple
human origins, because they believe the environment in East Asia
was conducive to the survival of early man. They do admit however
that the argument is far from convincing because of a lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Huang and some of his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology are optimistic about finding of new evidence and
they think it possible that there are early human fossils in the
geological layer containing fossils of anthropoid apes because the
environment conducive to apes would also be suitable for early
man, according to Prof. Wu Xinzhi.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Financial Aid to Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied the claim by
some Palestinian officials that Tehran financially helps a secret
circle within the Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA Thursday quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying that such baseless charges
are a futile attempt to divert public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official charged the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) of having surrendered to the Zionists (Israelis) by signing
an accord which is not in line with the interests of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Some PNA officials recently alleged members of the secret
circle within Hamas, who enjoy Iranian support, have tried in
recent months to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
members of his government.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi noted that the liberation of the holy Qods
(Jerusalem) and the Palestinian land are among lofty aspirations
of the Muslim world and a major goal of the Palestinian people,
and no one is able to eradicate such efforts through attributing
them to foreign factors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian officials can not escape the
disastrous consequences of the recent compromising accord by
bringing unfounded charges.
</P>
<P>
Such propaganda scandals are used by the PNA, among other
things, as a pretext for arresting and suppressing Palestinian
militants and thus pleasing the Zionist leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran lashed out at Arafat after the Palestinian leader signed
an interim accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Washington last month, breaking the 19-month deadlock of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will step
up its efforts to fight against anti-Israeli activities and will
convene the Palestinian National Council to revoke anti-Israeli
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials believed that the accord was totally in favor
of Israel and "Arafat has become a policeman charged with ensuring
the security of Israel as a result of the accord."

<HEADLINE> Crocodiles Facing Extinction in Bangladesh: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- All the three species of
crocodiles, once available in abundance at different canals and
rivers in Bangladesh, are now facing extinction due allegedly to
an unfriendly environment, according to a survey conducted by
zoologists and wildlife specialists.
</P>
<P>
The unfriendly environment has mainly threatened existence of
the species, said the findings of the survey as reported by The
New Nation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Crocodiles, which can survive for about 80 to 100 years on an
average, are said to be the essential element for the environment
and maintenance of ecological equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
Breeding of all the three species, namely, Gavial, Mud
Crocodile and Salt Water Crocodile, has also become almost
impossible, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Both the gavials and the mud crocodiles are quite harmless
while the salt water crocodiles are ferocious in nature and can
attack anybody at any moment, zoologists and wildlife experts
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that out of the three mud crocodiles found at
the Khan Zahan Ali Dargah Lake, two are fertile female, who are
able to take part in breeding but the other one is an old and
sterilized male, and this particular species of crocodiles is no
longer available anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
The zoologists found two other mud crocodiles in the National
Zoo, but their presence was not taken into consideration as they
are not in a natural environment and not in a position to take
part in breeding.
</P>
<P>
The salt water crocodiles were once largely found at the
country's southern regions, mainly in the river Pashur along the
Sundarbans, the largest mangroves in the world. But the wildlife
specialists found only 20 to 25 salt water crocodiles in the
river.
</P>
<P>
The salt water crocodiles are facing extinction as the hunters
frequently kill them for their costly skin and sometimes destroy
their eggs out of ignorance.
</P>
<P>
Conservation of different species of crocodiles and their
commercial cultivation have already become the important issues in
various countries, the specialists observed. But they alleged,
"our government seems to be very reluctant about wildlife
conservation and commercial cultivation of crocodiles."
</P>
<P>
"We have golden prospects for a commercial cultivation of
crocodiles and earning a huge amount of foreign currency
annually," zoologists said, adding that different international
organizations are eager to invest in the field.
</P>
<P>
But they regretted that the prospect has been "neglected by the
government". "If we want to maintain the ecological equilibrium,
we can easily import crocodile-sperm from the sperm bank in Madras
(India) and save the most vital species from extinction," they
said.
</P>
<P>
The survey report has been submitted to the Ministry of
Environment and Forest for necessary action.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Using Force against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has said it opposes any
resort to force against Iraq following the recent dispute between
Baghdad with the United Nations over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA Thursday, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammad said on Wednesday that using
force against Iraq would bring about further tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States has warned that "all options are open" in
dealing with Iraq unless it agrees to allow U.N. inspectors to
finish their job of eliminating all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week decided to suspend all relations with
U.N. inspectors after the U.N. Security Council refused to lift
economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions can not be lifted until U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has scrapped all its nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen is currently visiting the
Gulf states to rally their support for possible U.S. military
strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also voiced Tehran's opposition to any
effort which would intensify the presence of the alien forces in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also underlined the necessity for a complete
implementation of the relevant U.N. resolutions by the Iraqi
government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Refrain from Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi has appealed for peace and calm, saying violence
and vandalism are not good for the nation, the Daily Herald
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the appeal Wednesday after the country's
capital of Harare was thrown into turmoil as thousands of angry
commuters from various high density reacted violently to commuter
bus fare hikes and blocked traffic into the city center.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the public should demonstrate peacefully and
refrain from engaging in acts of violence, intimidation and
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
The army has been placed on full alert, ready to swing into
action should rowdy crowds overwhelm police in trouble spots.
This deployment has been implemented as a precautionary
contingent measure.
</P>
<P>
"Violence leads to anarchy. And anarchy can burn down the
country in minutes. Violence does not resolve anything. I
sincerely appeal to all people intending to stage protests, to do
so peacefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the defense forces would never allow anarchy
to prevail.
</P>
<P>
Police managed to contain the situation during Wednesday
disturbances. Mahachi said the standby arrangement would remain
in force until the situation has normalized.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen people were arrested Tuesday night when the riots
began in Chitungwiza near Harare. Further arrests were made
Wednesday, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Largest U.S. Automakers Report Higher Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday reported higher sales of light
vehicles in the United States in October, pushing the industry's
growth to one of its highest rates this year.
</P>
<P>
General Motors continued to rebound from two summer strikes and
beat analyst expectation with a 6-percent increase in sales of all
light vehicles to 406,543.
</P>
<P>
Cars rose by 5.7 percent to 225,881 while sales of pickup
trucks, sport utilities and minivans grew by 6.3 percent to
180,662, said the auto giant, whose share was about 30 percent in
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Ford, the No. 2 automaker with a share of 24 percent in the
U.S. market, said its total sales in October increased by 2.4
percent to 335,432. Its profitable new 1999 Super Duty F-series
full-size pickup trucks rose by 10.4 percent to 206,620 while
other cars fell by 8.2 percent to 128,812, including a 340-percent
decline in sales to rental car companies.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Chrysler Corp., the third biggest automakers with a
share of 16.5 percent, as well as major Japanese and German
automakers, all reported broken records in sales in October.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that automakers sold 1,371,981 cars
and light trucks in October 1998, a 9.8-percent gain from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
"An economic environment that provides job growth and wage
increases with low inflation and interest rates doesn't hurt,"
said Bob Rewey, Ford sales and marketing chief.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts also attribute the unusual strong October sales
to the generous rebates on many models to lure customers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Singapore Agree to Improve Relations </HEADLINE>

KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Singapore
agreed Thursday to set aside their differences and work towards
improving their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came out of the talks between Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok
Tong at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, some 50
kilometers south of here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told a press conference after his talks with Goh, who

agreed on resolving their outstanding issues such as water supply
by Malaysia to Singapore and Malaysia's customs, immigration and
quarantine facilities at the Tanjung Pagar railway station in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Singapore also agreed to help Malaysia overcome
its financial problems.
</P>

Goh, who was also present at the press conference, said
Singapore agreed to assist Malaysia in overcoming its financial
problems and "the details will be worked out by the officials of
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Goh said that differences between the two neighboring countries
might arise, but the important thing is to narrow the gap between
the differences and work towards maximizing the common areas.

<HEADLINE> Bleak Employment Picture Needs Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- More attention should be given
to the bleak employment prospects in China to keep down growing
unemployment and avoid social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Economist Niu Renliang, in an article titled "Next Year's
Economic Situation and Policies that Should be Taken" published in
today's China Securities News, said that last year China had 5.7
million unemployed and around five million laid-off workers, and
that the unemployment rate stood at 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the unemployment rate is expected to reach 3.3 percent this
year, with well over five million jobless and an additional three
million new laid-off workers, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
If China maintains the present employment situation into 1999,
there will be about six million jobless people and an increase of
more than two million new laid-off workers, said the article.
</P>
<P>
According to the current reemployment rate of 60 percent, the
aggregate number of laid-off workers who cannot find jobs will
amount to six million in 1999, and together with the six million
unemployed, China will then have a total of 12 million people out
of work.
</P>
<P>
Towns and cities have been capable of producing only around
seven million new jobs annually since 1993. It is calculated that
the number of this year's newly re-employed people will not be
higher than 7.1 million, and that next year's newly re-employment
will be the same as this year, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article suggested three ways to effectively deal with the
current growing unemployment pressure.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, increasing employment opportunities should
be realized by adjusting the employment structure and through
expanding medium-sized and small enterprises, most of which are
privately owned or self-employed economic entities.
</P>
<P>
Though employment opportunities are largely decided by economic
growth and employment structure, there is some room for economic
growth to spur employment next year, so increasing employment
opportunities by adjusting the employment structure is possible.
</P>
<P>
In the second place, reducing employment pressure can be
accomplished by slowing down the labor-force supply. This can be
realized by such methods as introducing employment training
programs among young first-time workers, and by phased employment
for most already-employed workers.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, laid-off workers who cannot find reemployment can be
aided by opening up new funding channels, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China to Grow Rice in Highlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Agrotechnicians have succeeded
in planting rice on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a place formerly
deemed impossible for growing rice by some agronomists.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has introduced
new technology for planting rice in Ledu County in eastern
Qinghai. Thirteen species of rice grown on an experimental
one-third hectare of land has now been harvested.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in Qinghai is below minus six degrees
Centigrade due to its high altitude of more than 3,000 meters on
average. The sharp contrast in temperature between night and day
and the inability of the land to hold water make rice growing
there extremely difficult, experts say, adding that local
agronomists tried in vain to grow rice in elevated areas in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
The academy has been committed to this project since 1995, and
solved several major technical problems this year. Some 44,000
hectares of land are now available for rice planting up there in
the highlands, and earnings from this crop will be three times
that of wheat, experts predict.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils 822-Member Delegation for Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) --- China will send an 822-member
delegation including 596 athletes to take part in the
biggest-ever Asian Games to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, on
December 6-20, chef de mission Yuan Weimin announced here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, also vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
said the Chinese athletes, who will compete in all the 36 sports
but karate, squash, rugby and kabadi, are expected to win around
100 gold medals in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive for the top place in the gold standings and
keep the leading position in the Asian sports arena," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Of all the athletes, 125 took part in the 1994 Asian Games
held in Hiroshima, Japan, while 121 competed in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Four-time Olympian Wang Yifu, 38, shooting gold medallist in

years ago, far ahead of South Korea's 63 and Japan's 59 before
its 11 atheltes failed drug tests.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that China has stepped up drug tests this year and
vowed to carry out strict drug tests ahead of the Asian Games to
avoid scandals in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"China is very concerned about this problem," Yuan said. "We
had conducted 2,412 random drugs tests on the athletes by the end
of October this year. Eight offenders have been dealt with
severely.
</P>
<P>
"Before they go to Bangkok, the athletes will have to receive
random tests," Yuan said.

<HEADLINE> `Millennium Bug' News Site Lists Frequently Asked Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- "What will happen to my
money?" is the most frequently asked question concerning the year
2000 computer problem, according to a U.S. Y2K news Web site
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Y2KNEWSWIRE, the news and analysis site reporting research
results and latest developments on the issue, listed 18 most
common questions covering issues such as banking, money,
compliance of personal computers and why the `millennium bug' is
difficult to fix.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K site said the problem, by its very nature, poses
important questions that desperately need answers from informed
people. Good answers are not forthcoming from either the federal
government or most large companies, it says.
</P>
<P>
"The Y2K threat is real and major disruptions are not only
possible, they are bound to affect everyone in one way or
another," said the site editors, who meanwhile support positive,
action-oriented solutions. In an effort to rebut accusations of
fear-mongering, the news site has issued a new slogan "Prepare,
Don't Despair."
</P>
<P>
According to the editors, a very small percentage of the
American population is currently aware of the Y2K
problem. Although nearly all of those in the computer industry are
aware of it, overall awareness is still quite low.
</P>
<P>
There are U.S. companies who are well along in making Y2K
adjustments, the editors say, including several of the
largest banks and a few government agencies.
</P>
<P>
No company or government however has yet declared and verified
compliance, "So when peophe U.S. is well ahead of
everybody else, what they really mean is the U.S. just isn't as
far behind."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the most frequently asked question, "Will Y2K
affect my money, and should I pull my deposits out of the bank?"
the editors explained why the threat to banks is actually a
self-fulfilling prophecy that depends entirely on the behavior of
banking customers, citing the thin reserve ratios that makes the
banking crisis a possibility.
</P>
<P>
According to the editors, the U.S. banks owe depositors
approximately 3.7 trillion dollars in deposits. The banking system
as a whole only has about 1.17 percent of the money available at
any given time. This ratio would be disturbing in any Y2K-induced
bank run panic.

<HEADLINE> India's Estimated Agricultural Growth Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- India's Associated Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (ASSOCHAM), one of the three major
commerce and industry groups in the country, has revised its
estimate of agricultural growth in the current year from 2.5
percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit is likely to exceed the targeted 6.5 percent
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) mainly due to a shortfall in
revenue collection, ASSOCHAM sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in the country is unlikely to exceed 5.5
percent of the GDP in 1998-99 due to Union coalition government
politics which has delayed "progressive initiatives."
</P>
<P>
"We need a policy on agriculture to stabilize the performance
of this segment of the economy," said ASSOCHAM President L.
Lakshman on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish exports are also unlikely to improve due to shrinking
world trade and the East Asian currency meltdown, while trade
deficit will widen to 8.5 billion U.S. dollars from 6.8 billion
dollars last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The long-term fiscal policy should aim at reducing the fiscal
deficit to three percent of the GDP through steps like a
legislative cap on government borrowings, enforcing financial
discipline on State governments and investment in social sector,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Unable to Reach Asiad Ticket Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Asian Games organisers
admitted they are unable to reach the target of 330 million baht
(nine million US dollars) for ticket sales at the quandrennial
sports gala slated for December 6-20.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime minister Bhichai Rattakul, chairman of the
organizing committee, said late Wednesday that "we will not be
able to reach the target and we hope to get 250 million baht" as
Thailand is fighting its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said only 40 percent of the tickets for the opening and
closing ceremonies in the new stadium in Bangkok had so far been
sold although tickets have been on sale since last month for the
Bangkok games featuring 38 sports.
</P>
<P>
However, Bhichai said the Thai government still hopes to turn
a profit from the Games with the participation of 43 countries
and regions, saying "we hope that we will probably make a profit
from these games."
</P>
<P>
Bhichai admitted that two main sponsors failed to deliver
their promised 14 million dollars so far and he will have
meetings with both local companies in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Thai cabinet approved a 500 million baht (13
million dollar) extra budget for the Games.

<HEADLINE>   Malaysian PM Meets Singapore Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong met
Thursday on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur to discuss outstanding
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir met Goh, who is in Malaysia for a one-day visit, at
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, the fifth
meeting this year between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Malaysia and Singapore have been strained in
recent months over several issues including a quarrel over the
relocation of Malaysia's immigration and customs facilities at
the Tanjong Pagar railway station in Singapore, the future of
water supply from Malaysia to Singapore and the status of pension
savings of Peninsular Malaysians working in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Defense Ministry has also complained of
intrusions by Singapore air force planes into Malaysian territory,
which were all denied by Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, last week, both sides indicated their readiness to
patch up their relations.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said in a recent interview with the Malaysian Chinese
press that bilateral relations between Malaysia and Singapore had
taken a turn for the better and Malaysians did not have any
quarrel with their Singapore counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Mahathir's remarks, Goh said was quoted by press
reports as saying in Singapore last Sunday that Singapore wanted
good relations with Malaysia and that it was not in the interests
of either country to have poor relations.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Goh last met in April to jointly open a second
crossing between the two neighbors. Before that, they already met
trice this year, with their first meeting in Johor, southern
Malaysia, in January, followed by two meetings a month later, each
in Singapore and in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Goh, who will be in Malaysia to attend the informal meeting of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in Kuala Lumpur
later this month, is expected to meet Mahathir again.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar on Wednesday gave the nod
to two women swimmers and four horse riders to compete in the
13th Asian Games in Bangkok next month, the Jakarta Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Calling his decision a special policy, Wismoyo said the
athletes deserved places in the Asiad-bound national team for
undergoing months of overseas training and trials without relying
on the council's financial support.
</P>
<P>
"Their respective sports organizations have spent so much
money that we must appreciate their labours. Hopefully, the
athletes will finish among the top four at the Asiad," Wismoyo
said.
</P>
<P>
The new entries take the Indonesian team to 125 athletes who
will compete in 20 of 36 sports in the quandrennial sports gala
slated for December 6 to 20 in Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Recalls Beef in Bacteria Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. company said
Wednesday that it was recalling all ground beef it produced on
October 22 because it may contain the potentially deadly E.coli
O157:H7 bacteria.
</P>
<P>
IBP, the world's largest processor of fresh beef, said in a
report the recall involved 556,226 pounds of ground beef produced
at its plant in Dakota City, Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
Retailers, food service operations and distributors in a total
of 33 states have been identified as having received the ground
beef, said the company, adding that much of it is believed to have
been consumed already.
</P>
<P>
But no illnesses have been reported in connection to the beef
produced on that day and the company said it had notified the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which was testing the product.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, IBP recalled a shipment of 282,129 pounds of
beef after a sample was found to be tainted by the same bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said E.coli O157:H7 accounts for more than 20,000
infections and 200 deaths annually in the United States.

Urine samples were taken from 16 women athletes, with six

<HEADLINE> Corporate Crisis in India Deepens as Profits Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The corporate results for the
first half of the 1998-99 fiscal year in India suggest a deepening
of the recession, the Business Standard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A study of 563 companies' results for the first half of the
current fiscal year reveals a sales growth rate of 8.2 percent but
with cumulative net profit declining by 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the eight refineries and five telecom firms, which had made
more profits, are excluded, the net profit of the remaining 550
companies would be down by a whopping 20.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the plunging profit, the corporate sector's
performance has been worsened by the rising cost of production.
For the 563 companies, their total expenditure excluding interest
cost rose by 9.1 percent. With input costs rising and a decline in
price realization, all the profitability parameters showed a
decline in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Operating profit margins declined to 17.1 percent from 17.8
percent in the same period of last fiscal year, gross profit
margins to 12.5 percent from 13.4 percent and net profit margins
to 6.1 percent from 6.9 percent. Out of the 563 companies, the
number of loss-making companies increased to 98 from 70 in the
first half of last fiscal year.

and French President Jacques Chirac Wednesday talked on the phone
about a possible U.N. resolution condemning Iraq for halting
cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley told
reporters Clinton and Chirac spoke for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed our collaboration within the Security Council
on a clear resolution condemning Iraq's lack of cooperation with
UNSCOM," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was hoped the resolution could be approved later in
the week. The spokesman declined to comment on possible military
options in dealing with Iraq's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government last week decided to suspend all
cooperation with the U.N. inspectors until the sanctions against
Baghdad was canceled.
</P>
<P>
Despite its threat of military options to force Iraq to comply,
the United States has said it hopes the new crisis could be
resolved through diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislators Welcome Riot Team Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The findings of the Indonesian
government-sponsored fact-finding team on the country's May riots
were welcomed by legislators, while the military tried to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post Thursday, legislators urged the
Armed Forces (ABRI) and government to heed the team's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly, the government should act immediately to
follow up on the findings of the team," said Abu Hasan Sazili,
deputy of the ruling Golkar (Functional Group) organization.
</P>
<P>
Zarkasih Nur of the United Development Party faction concurred
that the report was a significant progress in the effort to
resolve the lingering issues from the riots.
</P>
<P>
"The government should show political will to act firmly on the
findings of the team," he said.
</P>
<P>
The team, chaired by Marzuki Darusman, deputy of the National
Commission on Human Rights, presented its findings to the media on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said the team concluded that the riots, triggered by
the shooting of four Trisakti University students on May 12, were
a culmination of violent events, including kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
The team confirmed 66 rapes which took place during the riots.
It cited data from the Volunteers for Humanity which said 1,190
people died in fires in Jakarta, 27 were killed by weapons and 33
others perished in riots outside Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The team's final report contained eight recommendations to the
government, which include the publication of a white paper
detailing the roles and responsibilities of "everyone," military
and civilian, connected when the riots took place, investigation
of a May 14 meeting of the Army's Strategic Reserve Command
(Kostrad) to uncover the roles of then Kostrad commander Lieut.
Gen. Prabowo Subiyanto and other individuals in the process
leading up to the riots.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of Defense and Security/ABRI Commander Gen.
Wiranto said an investigation already conducted showed "it was an
ordinary meeting."
</P>
<P>
Noted businessman Hashim S. Djojohadikusumo, the younger
brother of Prabowo, claimed on Wednesday that there was nothing
secret about the meeting held at the Kostrad, saying it was a
"very normal meeting among friends."
</P>
<P>
Hashim also denied allegations that Prabowo, former president
Soeharto's son-in-law, played a role in orchestrating the May
riots.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Fact-Finding Team was formed on July 23 under a joint
decree of the Defense and Security Ministry, Justice Ministry,
Attorney General's Office, and the ministries of women affairs,
home affairs and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mandated to report to the government on October 23, the team
had twice delayed the announcement of its findings due to a
conflict in the schedule for a final meeting of the six government
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Appeals for Swift Implementation of Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that the Palestinian
Authority was "putting a hundred percent effort into protecting
the peace accord."
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow a single act of terrorism," he said in
Madrid after briefing Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on
the Wye Accord.
</P>
<P>
He voiced "surprise" over new demand by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the arrest of 30 Palestinian terrorist
suspects.
</P>
<P>
However, it would not throw up "new obstacles" to the peace
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat disclosed that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had asked him to postpone the implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this will be limited to a few days," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
saying the Oslo Peace Accord was "the accord of brave people".
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Aznar agreed with Arafat that the
Israel's new demand would not influence the peace process, and
Israel would implement its promises in the Wye Accord.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government announced that Netanyahu will also visit
Madrid in the near future. Spain has good relations with both the
Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov on Wednesday approved the controversial Administration
Act, which bans former communist apparatchiks from taking
important government positions for a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Apparatchiks are those who had served in sensitive government
departments during the Bulgarian Communist Party's rule.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov approved the act in a presidential decree.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party Chairman Georgi
Parvanov said that he was shocked by the president's failure to
veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
Politicians, the press and the public, were equally astounded
at what was seen as a purging of official posts, Parvanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist-dominated Democratic Left and the Euro-Left had
opposed the bill which bars apparatchiks from senior positions in
the state administration until 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists had threatened to take the matter to the
Constitutional Court and the Euro-Left is likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Euro-Left leader Alexander Tomov said it is inadmissible for a
head of state to change his position in such a way and that
Stoyanov had earlier declared himself against such a purge.

<HEADLINE> Thai Firms Keen to Build Ties with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's small and
medium-scale businesses firms are keen to have Japanese firms as
their partners and learn new technology from them.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, Thai state agencies want to promote closer
ties with the Japanese industry, according to Chakramon
Phasukavanich, deputy secretary-general of the Board of Investment
of Thailand (BOI).
</P>
<P>
Thai companies needed help in aspects ranging from technology
to finding markets and low-cost funds, chakramon was quoted
Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the initiative of Japanese companies, the BOI had
established programs to boost ties between Thai and Japanese small
and medium enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
The first is called Vendors Meet Customers, a scheme under
which supplies of product parts are introduced to potential
buyers.
</P>
<P>
The second is called local-to-Local Meetings, under which the
BOI introduces Thai SMEs in certain industries to counterparts in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chakramon said the BOI hoped the Japanese would transfer
improved technology to Thai firms with which they did business.
</P>
<P>
Thai SMEs would benefit as a result but had to improve their
operations to attract Japanese partners, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Wants to Improve Ties with Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria expects the stagnation
in its relations with Macedonia to end soon, Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Radko Vlaikov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It will be good for both countries if a new democratic
government is quickly formed in Macedonia and establishs contacts
with Bulgaria, Vlaikov said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the new government would "cut the Gordian knot" which
has led to stagnation in the two countries' relations as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry expects a clear explanation
from the Macedonian authorities about their refusal to allow entry
to Bulgarian journalists, who were accredited to cover the second
round of elections (in Macedonia)," Vlaikov said.
</P>
<P>
Vlaikov noted that "Bulgaria did not start polemics about the
ridiculous accusations made against it because it did not want to
obstruct the elections.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to express the hope that the most difficult
period of Bulgarian-Macedonian relations has already passed," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian-Macedonian relations soured after the Macedonian
border authorities allegedly rejected Bulgarian journalists' entry
into the country to cover its second round of parliamentary
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) defense
ministers held an informal meeting in Vienna Wednesday to discuss
the EU's ability to deal with easing crises.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time defense ministers of the 15-member EU have
met at a Europe-wide level.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Austrian Defense Minister Werner
Fasslabend said the member states vowed to strengthen the EU's
capacity of easing crises by reacting more quickly and decisively.
</P>
<P>
However, the motive is not to establish ultra-national troops,
but to improve planning, transportation and reconnaissance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Fasslabend, the majority of the participants still
acknowledge the irreplaceable character of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) as the key organization for safety in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
British Secretary of State for Defense George Robertson warned
that the integration of safety in Europe can not be gained by
weakening NATO, which remains the cornerstone of European safety.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard also appealed for quicker
reactions from the EU and Western European Union (WEU) in response
to expanding crises. He said the EU has experience in
diplomatically resolving crises. However, diplomacy can be
effective only if military strength is viable.
</P>
<P>
The EU is mainly an economic organization and its defense
ministry is the only ministry that does not hold regular
meetings.

<HEADLINE> American Countries Call For Anti-Corruption Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States (OAS) has called for the creation of a continental
anti-corruption network.
</P>
<P>
"All the nations opposing corruption should organize themselves
and unite to counter it with drastic measures, " OAS Secretary
General Cesar Gaviria said Wednesday during the opening of a
Latin American meeting dubbed "Probity-Strengthening in the
Hemisphere."
</P>
<P>
Let the commitment of American nations to prosecute criminals
be real wherever they are. It should also require that authorities
act so that crimes (of corruption) do not remain unpunished, and
the people involved are severely punished to set an example, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The former Colombian President expressed his believe that anti-
corruption efforts would fail if they were not backed by
international and private groups.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria pointed out that corruption could only be eradicated
through the establishment of a modern state with a strengthened
and independent legislative branch with political control
capacities and an improved justice system.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the 21st century could start with a statement
signed and ratified (to crack down on corruption) by all Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chile's Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza
attributed much higher public investments and low-quality
infrastructure in the region to widespread corruption, referring
to a recent study conducted by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence also shows that (corruption) reduces productivity
and leads to huge financial losses which affect the most
vulnerable classes. This is why the fight against corruption is a
key issue in regional relations," Insulza added.

<HEADLINE> Wild Grey Wolf Protected in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The fierce-looking wild grey
wolves now enjoys top state protection in east China's Zhejiang
Province to maintain ecological balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Weishan, head of the provincial forestry bureau, said the
killing of grey wolves, which are notorious, especially in
Chinese fairy tales, is totally forbidden, and as a result not a
single wild tiger has been seen in the province since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
At the same, wild boars and some other wild animals
also have top protection in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Zhuge Yang, professor of life sciences at Zhejiang University
who participated in the drafting of the wild animal protection
list, said each wild animal has its particular function in nature.
</P>
<P>
The extinction of any one animal inevitably leads to its being
replaced by another animal in the food-chain, balancing the
ecological system.
</P>
<P>
He said the meat-eating tiger, the so-call "king of the
mountains" has been playing the role of curbing the excessive
spreading of small animals. As tigers have already disappeared in
the forests of his province, the wild grey wolf has become the
only predator capable of preventing the spread of smaller animals.
</P>
<P>
After intensive research, the experts agreed that the grey wolf
should be at the top of the wild animal protection list in
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Weishan added that those injured by wild animals, or
suffer property loss because of wild animals protection, can
receive some compensation.

<P>
SHENZHEN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The current dull Chinese A
share market was freshened Wednesday when share price of a
Beijing-based agriculture company bulled its way up on the first
day of trading on the Shenzhen Stock market.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were quoted at 5.9 yuan at issue but surged by 134
percent to close at 13.81 yuan on the first trading day, with
nearly 60 percent of the shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Shunxin Agriculture Co Ltd offered 56 million A shares to
the public in early September and raised four billion yuan (480
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Proceeds through the issue will be used to set up a seed
research center and expand existing operations including distilled
spirits, animal husbandry and grain-growing, according to a
company official.
</P>
<P>
Despite agriculture's significance in China's economy,
agricultural shares are rare on China's stock market as the
country's agriculture is still far from being industrialized.
</P>
<P>
However, agricultural shares are increasingly popular among
stock investors as the central government has promised to step up
its efforts in the sector, market insiders said.

<HEADLINE> Finland to Push Ahead EU-Russia Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Finland will vigorously push
forward a "northern reaches" initiative to strengthen the
cooperation of the European Union with Russia in developing the
northwestern part of that country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Finnish Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen said the "northern reaches" initiative would be one
of the central issues to be discussed during his visit to Russia
next week.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the initiative would make some headway at the
upcoming EU summit to be held in Vienna next month and become a
concrete EU policy in the second half of next year when Finland
takes up the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The "northern reaches" initiative was first put forward by
Lipponen in 1997. It calls for the formulation of a policy on
northern Europe within the framework of the EU because the EU will
depend more on northwestern Russia for energy supply in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The policy will cover the joint exploitation of northwestern
Russia and the strengthening of cooperation among the countries
concerned in energy, transport, communication, environmental
protection and the fight against international crimes.

<HEADLINE> Solution to Agricultural Issues Vital to State Interest (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The proper handling of issues
concerning farmers and agriculture is vital to the fundamental
interest of the state, according to Tian Jiyun, a high-ranking
state leader.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article published in today's People's Daily, Tian,
currently a vice-chairman of the National People's Congress,
observes that historical experiences have constantly demonstrated
that the country's economic stability can be maintained only when
there is stable agriculture; only when there is economic
stability, can the country be stablized; and only when the country
is stable, can reform and opening-up be smoothly carried forward
and development accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Tian, a long-time financial and agricultural expert, proposes
five principles for promoting the rural economy for the long run
into the future.
</P>
<P>
First, the family-based contractual responsibility system
should be unwaveringly upheld.
</P>
<P>
It was the introduction of this system 20 years ago that gave
decision-making power to farmers in China in matters concerning
the land and handling agricultural products under socialist
ownership. This has brought substantial economic benefits and
aroused the initiative of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Calling it a great creation of the Chinese farmers, Tian says
that the family responsibility system has not only guaranteed
enough food and clothing for China's 1.2 billion people, but also
provided an adequate material base and sound social environment
for China's economic reform.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asian Currencies Continue to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian currencies have
rebounded sharply in the past few weeks due to the appreciation of
the Japanese yen and new capital inflows into the region. However,
the momentum for continued gains may be slowly waning as the
fundamentals of the region's economy remain weak.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, almost all Southeast Asian currencies
regained their strengthen on the back of a stronger yen, which was
traded at around 117 against the greenback Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippine peso lagged behind for some time, amid
fears that the closure of Philippine Airlines would be followed by
other corporate failures, it caught up with other currencies after
the airlines resumed operations last month.
</P>
<P>
The peso rose strongly in the past two weeks, and Tuesday
pushed the dollar below the key 40-peso level for the first time
over four months. It gained further Wednesday, closing at 39.30 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Driving the peso's recent rally are expectations of increased
dollar remittances by Filipino workers overseas in the Christmas
season and direct foreign investments in Philippine enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Like the Philippine peso, other Southeast Asian currencies have
been lifted by sharp inflows to stock markets and other
instruments in the region, as well as overall improved sentiment
toward the region, currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The baht, which was traded at 36.52 to the dollar Wednesday,
also benefited from fund inflows.
</P>
<P>
"The major reason for gains in currencies is that sentiment has
improved. In some cases, especially Thailand, things have improved
earlier than people expected," said Chian Woon Kien, a regional
economist.
</P>
<P>
The dollar should stay below 40 baht in the short term, she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Southeast Asian currencies are unlikely to continue
their quick recovery as the region's economic fundamentals have
continued to show weakness.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, industrial production, domestic investment and
consumption continue to fall. Its gross domestic product (GDP) is
expected to decline by about 8 percent this year, and most
economists expect contraction next year.
</P>
<P>
The country's banking system still needs over 20 billion
dollars to recapitalize itself, while restructuring of
money-losing companies has proceeded very slowly.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) sees the GDP to decline by 16
percent in Indonesia in 1998, and by around 6-7 percent in
Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia. GDP in the Philippines will be
almost flat, it says.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the economy is relatively sound compared with
that of its neighbors. But the country's GDP declined by 1.5
percent in the third quarter of this year and contraction could be
seen in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong predicted
earlier that his country may show no growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian economy is expected to contract 1.4 percent
in 1999 after a 7.8-percent fall this year, according to ADB's
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Because of the weak economy, investors will not put too much
money into the region in the near future as they did before the
financial crisis, and the regional currencies will not gain
continuously, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, political uncertainties in some Southeast
countries, like Indonesia, could contain the continued rise of
their currencies.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the rupiah fell back steeply in the past few
days. The rupiah, which rose to 7,550 against the dollar last
Friday, reversed its rising trend this week and declined to 8,500
Wednesday, due to mounting political tension ahead of the special
meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly scheduled for next
week.
</P>
<P>
Besides, economists said, Southeast Asian countries do not want
to see their currencies rise too quickly as sharp rebound could
hamper their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Raul Fabella, dean of University of the Philippine School of
Economics, said Wednesday that exports, which are currently
accounting for the inflow of dollars, will be affected by an
exchange rate lower than 40 pesos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"I think as we have seen some three to four months ago, our
comfort zone is in the 42 peso to 43 peso level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other economists in the Philippines also said that the
appreciation of the peso so far is too fast and sowing
uncertainties rather than confidence.
</P>
<P>
The central bank of the Philippines said Wednesday that it will
not intervene in the currency market because of the quick rise of
the peso. But analysts said that the central bank would do so if
the peso rises to 36 to the dollar.

BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of the
1990s, Chinese people have had multiple choices when seeking jobs,
compared to 20 years ago when more than 90 percent of urban
workers had employment arranged by the State.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried in today's China Youth Daily says this is one
result of the development of the market economy which has changed
people's concepts about chosing jobs.

The survey of 1,356 residents in Beijing, Dalian, Qingdao,
Shanghai, Wuhan and Guangzhou reveals that nearly 50 percent of
the respondents have changed jobs since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Introductions from friends and relatives, state arrangements,
advertisements, and job-seeking on their own are some of the ways
people now go about finding work.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 55 percent of the respondents put high
pay at the top of the list when seeking jobs, 19 percent want jobs
which guarantee a stable income, and seven percent desire jobs with
high prestige.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that 51 percent of the respondents want to

U.S. dollars in the market," he said on the sideline of a seminar
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia has been intervening in the market for some time
through state banks. Such intervention, using the incoming
billions of U.S. dollars in foreign loans, helped boost the rupiah
to 7,000 against the greenback last week from 12,000 in early
September.
</P>
<P>
However, political tensions surrounding the MPR session has
undermined the rupiah. The rupiah dropped passing the 8,800 level
on Monday and continued to fall to 8,800 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin acknowledged that the special session of MPR could pose
another big threat for the rupiah's standing, "but hopefully it
will be only temporary."
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-people-strong MPR would convene here on November
10-13 to pave the way for elections in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers warned that the central bank's planned
intervention would be futile as U.S. dollar demand would be on the
rise in the lead-up to the MPR's special session.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Information Muhammad Yunus said that
Habibie asked the public not to get panic and ensured that in a
worse scenario, the rupiah would not reach 20,000 to the U.S.
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador To Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador will increase its oil
production from 390,000 to 700,000 barrels a day in the next three
years, the state-run oil company Petroecuador said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This will greatly reactivate the country's economy," said
Petroecuador director Ramiro Gordillo.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador ranks fourth among Latin American oil exporters and
is the region's sixth largest producer. Petroecuador currently
produces 80 percent of the country's petroleum through its
branch company Petroproduction.
</P>
<P>
Gordillo said that private oil companies producing heavy crude
will have to invest about 800 million U.S. dollars to raise their
current output from 425,000 to 430,000 barrels a day and send it
through the trans-ecuadoran oil duct.
</P>
<P>
The output increase will be carried out through joint venture
contracts that are now allowed under new oil production laws.
</P>
<P>
Oil is one of Ecuador's main export products, amounting
to nearly 50 percent of government revenues.

<HEADLINE> China's Gansu Enjoys Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- In the first nine months this
year, the GDP of northwest China's Gansu Province reached 54.2
billion yuan (6.54 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 8.6 percent
compare with the same period last year and 1.4 percentage point
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Acting Governor Song Zhaosu attributed Gansu's high economic
growth to rising investment in basic industries and
infrastructure. He expects that Gansu's GDP will hit 85.9 billion
yuan by the end of this year, which would be up 9.2 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that to meet this year's eight percent economic growth
target, Gansu has added four billion yuan to the 29 billion yuan
investment program established earlier this year, a record amount
for Gansu investment.
</P>
<P>
Song added that the new investment will focus on agriculture,
forest, water conservation, infrastructure, environmental
protection and affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters, Gansu invested 19.1 billion yuan
in fixed assets, up 43 percent. The expansion of the scale of
investment has led to the development of related industries
including metallurgy and building.
</P>
<P>
According to local statistics, the first nine months witnessed
19 percent growth in the added value of the building industry, which
contributed 1.4 percentage point to Gansu's GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
With a good grain harvest, the total grain output of Gansu in
1998 is expected to reach 8.7 billion kilograms, up 1.04 billion
kilograms over 1997, and 800 million kilograms higher than the record
registered in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Center Established to Develop Quality Potatoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- An agricultural research center
devoted to developing quality potatoes was established in Beijing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PepsiCo-CAAS Agriculture Development Center, located at the
Institute of Vegetables and Flowers of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), will focus expertise on potato
plantation and production.
</P>
<P>
The US-based PepsiCo has donated 700,000 U.S. dollars to the
center's activities.
</P>
<P>
The center is designed to provide research and training
facilities to improve quality potato seeds and varieties.
</P>
<P>
China ranks first in potato production in the world with a
cultivation area of 4 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
However, its single variety and poor quality can't meet the
manufacturer's requirement or need for potatoes as a raw material
to be processed. Development of quality potatoes has become an
important goal capable of increasing farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
President of CAAS Lu Feijie said that it is important for the
center to integrate new technology in potato production as a major
axis for mutual cooperation between PepsiCo and CAAS.

SAN JOSE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of victims killed
or reported missing in Central America due to mudslides and floods
caused by Hurricane Mitch has grown to an estimated 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,000 people were believed to have been killed in
Honduras and Nicaragua -- two countries most affected by the rains,
while tens of thousands more were still missing in remote regions
cut off from cities.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Wednesday called for restoring dialogue and keeping a common
United Nations front in the lastest stand-off with Iraq over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Military options are always bad options," Dini told reporters
as he went into a Senate foreign affairs committee session.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N.-Iraq stand-off is a "complicated problem" that
requires careful attention.
</P>
<P>
He also called for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to
personally intervene to resolve the stand-off as the U.N. chief
did in the previous crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It will be up to him (Annan) to take on the job of restoring
dialogue with Iraq in order to achieve full compliance with
U.N. resolutions so that sanctions can be lifted," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Senate committee, Dini underlined the
importance of "cohesion" among U.N. members in order to "impose
compliance with agreed systems of verification, so that Iraq will
reverse its position."
</P>
<P>
He added that the European Union defense ministers had warned
Iraq of the severe consequences of failure to comply with the
U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iraq sparked the crisis by breaking off
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, demanding a lifting of
U.N. sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the
restructuring of the weapons inspection team.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened military actions unless Iraq
resumes cooperation. But Baghdad vowed it would not to back down
even if in the face of military strikes.

<P>
XI'AN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The non-public sector has played
an increasingly important role in spurring economic growth in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi's provincial economy grew 8.4 percent on a yearly basis
in the first three quarters of this year, with 2.3 percentage

in 1997, instituted a set of policies to encourage and support the
growth of the non-public sector at the end of last year.
</P>

elected directly by the electorate instead of being picked up by
the parliament, Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda announced
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Climate changes provoked by a
warming of Pacific waters have caused 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of losses in the past two years in Peru.
</P>
<P>
The periodic weather changes known as El Nino mainly affected
the transport, communications and housing sectors, according to a
report issued on Wednesday by a reconstruction agency headed by
Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi Arbulu.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the droughts and floods due to El Nino had
damaged over 107,000 homes, affecting about 548,000 people.
</P>
<P>
It said that the damage caused by El Nino in 1997 and 1998 was
more serious than that in the 1983 warming of Pacific waters.
</P>
<P>
The water levels of the rivers Tumbes, Piura, La Leche and
Chancay were 50 percent above the level reached 10 years ago,
thus causing floods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agency has a budget of 439 million dollars, including 253
millions of foreign loans and 186 millions in government funds,
for reconstruction programs including the rebuilding of 2,600
kilometers of roads and 12 bridges, mainly in northern
Peru.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Tibetan Helps Explorers in World's Largest Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of about 20 scientists and
rock climbers who are exploring a canyon in the southeastern part
of the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau say they believe that it is the
world's largest and deepest canyon.
</P>
<P>
Deqen, a 76-year-old Tibetan who lives in a village at the foot
of Mount Namjagbarwa near the entrance of the canyon, the Yarlung
Zangbo, has offered them his best food and items for daily-use.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yichou, a geographer on the team, in turn says that
Deqen's experiences provide a living record for research on
geological structure and movement in the canyon that the team
members are doing because he's been a witness to many changes
there.
</P>
<P>
When he was only nine years old, Deqen's parents moved here to
pray to the sacred Mount Namjagbarwa, and Deqen never left.
</P>
<P>
He can recall the earthquake that measured 8.5 on the Richter
Scale that hit the area in 1950, and has seen the flow of the
Yarlung Zangbo River interrupted.
</P>
<P>
Deqen has established a close friendship with many team
members. Zhang Wenjing, a glaciologist, has grown rather fond of
the old man. In fact, Deqen saved his life. When Zhang was
studying a glacier on Mount Namjagbarwa one day in 1984, Deqen and
his daughter came and told him to return immediately because the
glacier was going to start shaking.
</P>
<P>
When they reached Deqen's home, the glacier began to shake
violently and the spot where they had been working was soon buried
in ice. Their friendship, Zhang says simply but poignantly, is
higher than Mount Namjagbarwa and longer than the Yarlung Zangbo
River.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Chief of Defence

the use of force in the war over the Falklands islands.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 1982 war between Argentina and Britain over

forces was not justified."

After a meeting with President Carlos Menem, General Guthrie
said joint army and navy maneuvers should be carried out in the
southern Atlantic ocean, where the two countries have started
search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said that President Menem's recent trip to Britain had
been very productive.
</P>
<P>
He invited Argentina's Defense Minister Jorge Dominguez to send
army officers to British military academies.

<HEADLINE> Stability Needed for Growth in Vietnam: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam needs stability to
develop its economy, but economic development, in turn, requires
stability, a Vietnamese senior official told Saigon Times Daily.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in an
interview with the English-language daily recently that "in the
current situation, if stability cannot be maintained, the country
will be exposed to dangers, such as failing to realize major
economic targets."
</P>
<P>
He said the proportion of investment in agriculture is now some
8 percent. The government expected to adopt policies within the
next one or two years to gradually raise this proportion to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is a hard target", he said, adding "but i believe that
with new policies that will be issued soon, we can realize it.
Some measures will be taken to carry it out."
</P>
<P>
Dung said the government will continue administrative reform to
create the most favorable conditions for everyone to do business.
Investors will be offered bank loans if their projects are
efficient, he added.

<HEADLINE> NBA Meeting Break off Early After Acrimonious Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- With the NBA lockout
beginning to take full effect with missed regular-season games,
the owners and players met briefly today in New York, where talks
broke down quickly as the two sides argued from the get-go.
</P>
<P>
After Monday's meeting to discuss economic issues, today's
session did not last long and was marked by frustration from both
sides before reaching the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The owners' side, led by NBA commissioner David Stern and
deputy commmissioner Russ Granik, reportedly was upset with
comments made by union's executive director Billy Hunter Monday,
and the two sides began to argue before sitting down for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no lecture, we're just sitting around a
table, "Hunter said today outside the Manhattan law office where
the two sides met. "But we're both stymied and don't know which
way to move next. We thought maybe it would be better if we went
back to our offices, look at where we were and if we thought it
appropriate, get back together in private."
</P>
<P>
There's not a lot to talk about," Stern said. "We estimate
that we will pay out over a billion dollars in player salaries.
And the representatives that sat in the room with us on behalf of
those 400 players seem intent to have that billion dollars, along
with the sand in the hourglass, just drip away."
</P>
<P>
The 53rd NBA season was to start Tuesday with 10 games and
another 11 games were scheduled to be played today.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said Monday rumors of an agreement in the 127-day NBA
lockout have been greatly exaggerated. Hunter refuted a series of
reports over the last several days that an agreement could come
within the next two weeks. In fact, he indicated there may not be
one for two months.
</P>
<P>
With the optimism of last week dampened, Hunter has a sense
that no NBA games will be played until 1999, which would mean
wiping out a minimum of 400 games. The league already has
conaceled 194 games through November.
</P>
<P>
Stern said:"There's something going on that doesn't involve
us,something internally in the union. As I stand here today, I
don't know exactly what it was, but it's clear to me what's
coming. Watch the process. You'll see."
</P>
<P>
The sour moods were a new twist in the lockout fight that
forced the league to cancel games for the first time in its
history.

<HEADLINE> Stigma Keeps Millions of Americans from Treating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Anxiety disorders,
America's most common mental illness, largely go untreated because
of shame, fear and embarrassment, according to a nationwide poll
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll release by the National Mental Health Association
found more than half of Americans believe that stigma prevents
individuals with anxiety disorders from seeking treatment, despite
a surprisingly high recognition of the illness.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, 19 million Americans suffer from
anxiety disorders, and fewer than one third receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
"These findings account for the wide occurrence between the
common accurrance of anxiety disorders and the low numbers in
treatment," the association president Michael Faenza said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The shame associated with anxiety disorder is "completely
unfounded," he said. "Anxiety disorders are real illnesses that
deserve the same level of understanding and treatment as diabetes,
arthritis or heart disease."
</P>
<P>
Stigma, such as the fear of being perceived as weak, appears to
be based on misinformation, the association said. Though 81
percent of those polled were aware of anxiety disorders, 61
percent wrongly believe that they occur in people who lack the
will power to cope with everyday life stress, are usually caused
by underlying guilt, or will go away if ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
But the association said that the study also yielded one
hopeful conclusion. The more people recognized that anxiety
disorders are real illnesses, the less likely they were to have
misperceptions about the their root causes and more likely they
were to believe that medical and psychological treatments work.
</P>
<P>
"Education is still vital," Faenza said. "Americans need to
know the real deal about anxiety disorders, their signs and
symptoms and their causes. Since people with anxiety disorders are
at high risk of suicide, eradicating misunderstanding and stigma
with a good dose of the facts can really save lives."
</P>
<P>
The National Mental Health Association has launched an anxiety
disorders public education campaign, which will target both the
general public and primary care physicians. Many doctors are not
trained to detect or treat anxiety disorders and frequently
individuals go misdiagnosed or untreated, said the organization.

<P>
According to the association, the illness includes panic,
obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety
disorders and phobia such as social phobia. Symptoms of these
disorders include panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks,
nightmares and frightening physical symptoms. Each anxiety
disorder has emotional, psychological and biological underpinnings
and can be treated through targeted psychotherapy, medications or
a combination of the two.

<P>
Anxiety disorders cost the United States 46.6 billion dollars
each year, nearly one-third of the nation's total mental health
bill of 146 billion dollars, according to the association.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rebounded on
Wednesday following the announcement of mid-term election results
which raised hope that the impeachment process against President
Bill Clinton will lose momentum and the business environment will
be better.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 76.99 points higher to
8,783.14. In early trading it gained as much as 148.30 and stood
above 8,800 for the first time since Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators also rose. Gains were led by
technology and financial shares, including Intel, Micron
Technology, J.P. Morgan and American express.
</P>
<P>
The rally was the fifth in six days, with a sluggish session
Tuesday. The blue-chip indicator had gained 417 points in the five
winning session streak, extending the mid-October rebound from an
early October slide to about 1,200 points, or over 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Republicans retained control of both the Senate and the
House of Representatives in Congress, but lost six seats to the

environment, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Star Mourning Still Recovering from Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- NBA Miami Heat center
Alonzo Mourning, recovering from a knee operation, could miss the
start of the season - depending when that is.
</P>
<P>
Mourning recently underwent surgery for a bone spur in his
right knee. Under a normal rehabilitation schedule, he should
return around on December 25.
</P>
<P>
Depending on progress in negotiations to end the NBA lockout,
the Heat still could have Mourning healthy by the start of the
season. But regardless of his recovery, Mourning will miss the
opener to complete a two-game suspension imposed in the wake of
last season playoff fracas with New York's Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
While players aren't allowed contact with management during
the lockout, they are permitted to consult team physicians. The He
at front office is aware of Mourning's surgery.
</P>
<P>
Mourning missed the first 22 games last season following
surgery on his left knee. He missed 12 and 14 games in his first
two seasons with Miami because of foot injuries.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Vows to be Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
in its newly adopted work program for 1999 that it attaches great
importance to its own modernization, one of the top priorities of
its work plan in the new year, because the European Union's
executive body is to "pursue the consolidation of recent progress
in European integration and the preparations for the 21st
century".
</P>
<P>
The commission said it must modernize, adapt its structure,
rethink its working methods, decentralize, assign
responsibilities, control matters more closely and simplify its
management, so that it can play its role effectively.
</P>
<P>
The objective for 1999 will be to push forward the preparation
of "Tomorrow's Commission", it said. Modernization is vital if the
European Union is to realize its ambitions and meet public
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The commission's other priorities for 1999 are: to put into
effect the measures proposed in Agenda 2000, to implement the
Amsterdam Treaty, to ensure the success of economic and monetary
union and create the conditions for sustainable growth and
employment, and to promote a strong Europe that is open to the
world.

Ninth Annual Arete Awards for Courage in Sports in Chicago, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Cook, 29, has a rare genetic disorder called Voigte-Carnegie

Born healthy, he awoke to complete darkness at age 9. At 16,
he lost his hearing.
</P>
<P>
However, Cook's genetic disorder hasn't stopped him from being
active and entering triathlons.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a regualr guy like everybody else," said Cook, who races
with training partners. "I have a few physical quirks. I am
mystified why others see what I do as a big deal."

<HEADLINE> Dynamo Kiev Beat Arsenal in Champion's League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine had a
stuning 3-1 victory over injury-hit English champion Arsenal in a
Group E match of the European Champions' League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kiev, who came desperately close to beating Arsenal in a 1-1 d
raw in London two weeks ago but who went into Wednesday's game
without a win from their opening three matches, led 3-0 after 72
minutes thanks to goals from Serhiy Rebrov, Olexander Golovko and
Andriy Shevchenko.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hughes scored the lone goal for Arsenal seven minutes
from time but it was too little to save the Gunners, playing
without Dennis Bergkamp, Tony Adams, Nicholas Anelka and Marc
Overmars, from plunging from first to last place in the group.
</P>
<P>
Panathinaikos, whose victory was marred by the last-minute
sending off of Vladen Milojevic, defeated RC Lens 1-0 in Athens
to go top of the group by a point. The Greeks have six points,
with Kiev, Lens and Arsenal all on five.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's English rivals Manchester United scored the biggest
win of the night, crushing Brondby of Denmark 5-0 at Old Trafford
after racing into a 3-0 lead with goals from David Beckham, Andy
Cole and Phil Neville in the first 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
United, who beat Brondby 6-2 two weeks ago, top Group D with
eight points, but what would have been a perfect night for them
was marginally spoilt by Bayern Munich, who scored a late goal to
force a 2-1 win at Barcelona after trailing to a first-half
Giovanni penalty.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zickler (48) and Hasan Salihamidzic (86) gave Bayern
the victory that lifted them to seven points in the section, with
Barcelona on four points and Brondby on three at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
The group winner is likely to be decided when Manchester
United host Bayern on December 9.
</P>
<P>
With two rounds of matches still to play after Wednesday's
games, no team has yet qualified for the quarter-finals, but
Kaiserslautern look set to do so from Group F after coming from
behind to defeat PSV Eindhoven 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern have 10 points, five clear of the never-say-die
Finns from HJK Helsinki who drew 2-2 at once-mighty Benfica.
</P>
<P>
Ajax Amsterdam overtook Olympiakos Piraeus at the top of Group
A after beating the Greeks 2-0 at home, while Turkish champions
Galatasaray went to the top of Group B after thumping Rosenborg
Trondheim 3-0 in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
But the nightmare continues for Juventus who drew their fourth
successive match in that section, 1-1 at home against Athletic
Bilbao leaving those two clubs without a win.
</P>
<P>
Juventus now look unlikely to qualify for the last eight while
last-placed Bilbao had defender Jose Maria Lacruz sent off five
minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
The only other club without a win are Sturm Graz, whose Group
C match against champions Real Madrid was postponed until
Thursday because of a waterlogged pitch.
</P>
<P>
But neither Spartak Moscow or Inter Milan took full advantage
of Real's inactivity when they drew 1-1 in Moscow, with Inter
equalising a minute from time to go top of the very tight group
-- for 24 hours at least.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Swoop for Batty and Dublin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Leeds United launched a 10 million pound bank-busting raid to
bring Dion Dublin and David Batty to Elland Road.
</P>
<P>
The club is determined to back new boss David O'Leary in the
transfer market by smashing the club's record fee, not once - but
twice.
</P>
<P>
The club have confirmed it is now in the running for
Coventry's wantaway striker Dublin, who has already turned down a
6.75 million pounds move to Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
Club chairman Peter Ridsdale said on Wednesday: "We made an
official bid yesterday afternoon to Coventry for Dion Dublin. We
are now waiting for a response from the Coventry chairman which
we hope to get sometime today."
</P>
<P>
Leeds have joined Aston Villa in the hunt for the England
international's signature after City chairman Bryan Richardson
revealed Dublin has a clause in his contract allowing him to
speak to any club who offer more than 5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale faxed Coventry with his bid ahead of last night's
UEFA Cup second round defeat to Italian Serie A side Roma, with
Leeds believed to have offered the Highfield Road club 5.5
million pounds in an effort to overshadow Villa, who have simply
matched the price required to start talks with Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The fee shatters the United club record of 4.5 million spent
in recruiting former Swedish international Tomas Brolin from
Parma three years ago and Lee Sharpe from Manchester United in
the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Brolin was an expensive flop and was released on a
free transfer after two unhappy years, while Sharpe is struggling
to recapture the form that earned him England honours at Old
Trafford after missing the whole of last season with knee
ligament damage.
</P>
<P>
But Ridsdale pledged to O'Leary that money would be made
available for new signings when the 40-year-old Irishman took
over the job on a permanent basis, and he is now proving as good
as his word.
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale said: "We have made three offers in the last week and
we are awaiting the outcome of bids for two of the three players
. Certainly, they would create new club records.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the players we are chasing would add value to
the squad. They are players the manager wants and I think the
fans will be excited if we get two of the three.
</P>
<P>
"I would be disappointed if one or two do not come off in the
next week to 10 days."
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale has also tempted Newcastle with an apparent offer of
5 million for former United midfielder Batty, despite United's
reluctance to let the England international leave St James'
Park.

<HEADLINE> EU Stress Euro Zone's Single Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
emphasized the euro zone's single voice in international economic
and monetary affairs considering the new opportunity created by
the emergence of euro, the new world currency alongside the US
dollar and the Japanese Yen.
</P>
<P>
With the euro, the EU will have a monetary presence which
corresponds to its leading economic and commercial role in the
world economy, the European Commission said in a statement on its
newly proposed arrangements for the future external representation
of the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
To take full advantage of this new reality, the commission
said, the euro zone will need to speak with a single voice in a
broad range of international discussions affecting economic and
monetary union. This is the aim of the proposed Council Decision
adopted by the commission today, it said.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of the euro, the commission said in its
proposal, the EU should be represented by a delegation involving
the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank, given
their respective Treaty responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The proposal covers international meetings in formal bodies
like the IMF and the OECD as well as less formal gatherings such
as the G7 Finance or the G10. And similar arrangements would apply
by analogy to bilateral relations between the euro zone and third
countries, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, which takes form of a draft decision to enter
into force on January 1, 1999, also deals with the question of
coordination in advance of international meetings to allow a clear
and coherent EU position to be defined.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Court in
Manhattan announced on Wednesday an indictment against Saudi-born
Osama bin Laden, charging him with bombing U.S. embassies in
Africa and plotting to kill Americans outside the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Fugitive bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, identified as military
commander of his terrorist organization, and four others indicted
before are charged with participating in a worldwide terrorist
organization led by bin Laden in a conspiracy to murder Americans.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the alleged plot include members of the U.S.
military in Saudi Arabia and Somalia and Americans working at the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
The August blasts of the two embassies killed more than 220
people, including 12 Americans, and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, born to a wealthy Saudi family, had lived in exile
in Yemen and Sudan before moving to Afghanistan, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department announced rewards of up to 5 million U.S.
dollars for the arrests and convictions of bin Laden and Muhammad
Atef.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Reports on Progress by Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 4 (Xinhua) The European Commission today
adopted its first regular reports on progress by 10 candidate
countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus and Turkey in
meeting the the European Union (EU)'s membership criteria.
</P>
<P>
The 12 reports show that the candidates have done much to
prepare for enlargement and that they face a huge task in readying
themselves for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The commission has decided not to recommend the opening of
negotiations with any additional countries at this stage, but
decided, if the momentum of change is maintained, it would propose
the opening of negotiations with Latvia before the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
After the reports were adopted, Foreign Affairs Commissioner
Hans Van Den Broek said: "the commission's assessment reveal that
the inclusive enlargement process, which involves all candidates,
remains broadly on track, and that the momentum in the candidates
towards enlargement is being maintained."
</P>
<P>
Noting with concern a worrying slow down in the rhythm of
transposition and application in certain countries with which
negotiations have already been opened, in particular the case for
the Czech Republic and Slovenia, van den Broek said: "If the
stagnation observed in these countries continue, they could have a
problem in the medium term in meeting their obligations as future
member states."

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Internet Services Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide spending on
Internet services will grow to 43.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2002,
according to the new forecast by an American market analysis firm
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
International Data Corporation (IDC) said that the Internet
services market will be one of the fastest growing information
technology (IT) service market segments over the next five years.
In 1997, it was a market of just 4.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rapid growth of the market, IDC said that
companies moving from using Internet technologies as a publishing
medium to using them for e-commerce are finding themselves
strapped for the necessary resources. "Increased technical
demands, higher profile projects, and a desire to focus on core
competencies are driving companies to turn to external service
providers for deployment of some or all parts of their e-commerce
project," said the analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
The United States represents the largest part of the worldwide
Internet services market opportunity throughout the forecast
period. With 2.9 billion dollars in spending in 1997, IDC expects
it to grow to 22 billion dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
IDC's report on worldwide Internet and e-commerce services
market and trends forecast between 1998 and 2002 analyzes U.S.
market opportunities, as well as Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific,
Canada and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"The move to deploy e-commerce sites is putting increased
demands on companies to raise their sophistication in Internet
technologies and to rethink how the Internet ties in with
business' strategies and processes," the IDC report said. "Growth
potentials exist for service providers seeking to capitalize on
these market opportunities."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Slovenia is Best NATO Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday assured Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek that
Slovenia was the best candidate for next enlargement of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to hear that President Clinton considers Slovenia
as the best candidate for next enlargement of NATO, and that he
also confirmed that the open-door policy of NATO will continue as
it was declared in the last summit in Madrid," said Drnovsek after
meeting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Drnovsek met in the Oval Office to discuss the
NATO, the civil strife in Kosovo and ways to increase
U.S.-Slovenian trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"We also consider that this meeting and talks were quite
positive with regard to Slovenia's prospect to join very soon NATO
as a full member," said Drnovsek.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with this meeting, which confirmed the
very high level of political, economic and other relations between
Slovenia and the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the two leaders
discussed preparations for NATO's meeting to be held in Washington
in April to mark the alliance's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The session also will mark the official entry into the alliance
by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Slovenia and Romania
lobbied hard to be included in the expansion but were told they
must wait.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton reaffirmed NATO's commitment to keep the
door open to additional members and the U.S. government's
willingness to work with Slovenia to make it as strong a candidate
as possible for future membership," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, formerly part of Yugoslavia, gained its independence
before the outbreak of civil war in neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly on Wednesday adopted by consensus a resolution, on the
initiative of Iran, to designate 2001 as the U.N. Year of Dialogue
among Civilizations, said a spokesperson for the President of the
53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Jadranka Mihalic, the spokesperson, told a press conference
that the resolution, sponsored by some 50 countries, asked
governments, the U.N. system and other international organizations
to arrange appropriate cultural, educational and social programs.
</P>
<P>
The item was placed on the General Assembly's agenda following
a proposal by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami in his speech in
September to the 53rd General Assembly session on his first visit
to the United Nations since his election last year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president told the General Assembly he hoped that
through a dialogue among civilizations "the realization of
universal justice and liberty may be initiated."
</P>
<P>
"If humanity at the threshold of the new century and
millennium devotes all efforts to institutionalize dialogue,
replacing hostility and confrontation with discourse and
understanding, it would leave an invaluable legacy for the
benefit of future generations," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly resolution recognizes the "diverse
civilizational achievements of mankind, crystallizing cultural
pluralism and creative human diversity."
</P>
<P>
The resolution emphasizes the "importance of tolerance in
international relations and the significant role of dialogue as a
means to reach understanding, remove threats to peace and
strengthen interaction and exchange among civilizations."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the resolution also reaffirms that "civilizational
achievements constitute the collective heritage of mankind,
providing a source of inspiration and progress for humanity at
large."

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs Susan Rice have expressed full support for all
efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said that they
held talks in Entebbe, some 45 km south of the Ugandan capital,
Wednesday evening shortly after the U.S. official arrived in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Rice told Museveni that she and her team had not come to the
region with any pre-conceived formula but intended to listen to
all the groups and countries concerned in order to understand
clearly the nature of the three-month-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
She also briefed the president on her discussions with various
leaders in the region, saying that she was happy to note that
there was a strong desire for peace from all concerned, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government sincerely wishes to promote a peaceful
resolution of the armed conflict in DRC and fully supports a
ceasefire, a stance Museveni agrees to.
</P>
<P>
The territorial integrity of the DRC must be respected while
the security concerns of its neighbors must be recognized, the
U.S. official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the real solution to the problem lies in direct
dialog between various groups involved in the DRC crisis and that
his country will do all it can to promote such dialog in order to
see peace in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy had visited Zimbabwe, the DRC, Angola and
Rwanda before coming to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption of the crisis on August 2, there have been
a lot of efforts aimed at its peaceful solution. The widening of
the conflict has hit headlines. The regional tour of the U.S.
envoy has been highly expected to bring more chances of peace to
the region.

<HEADLINE> UN Names Five New Judges for Rwanda Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly has appointed five new judges to serve the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They were elected from a list of 18 candidates earlier
established by the U.N. Security Council, taking into account the
adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the
world, said sources from Arusha, northern Tanzania where the ICTR
sits.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Dolenc (Slovenia), Mehmet Guney (Turkey), Dionysois
Kondylis (Greece), Erik Mose (Norway) and Lloyd George Williams
(Jamaica) will begin their four-year term in May next year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will also designate three judges to the
newly established Trial Chamber 3 as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four judges were retained in their places,
including Laity Kama of Senegal (the present President of the
U.N. court), William Sekule of Tanzania, Navanethem Pillary of
South Africa and Yakov Ostrovsky of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal was established by the U.N. Security Council on
November 8, 1994 to prosecute persons responsible for serious
violations of international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda
and Rwandan citizens responsible for such violations committed in
the neighboring states, between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
As the first international body charged specifically with
prosecuting crimes of genocide, the ICTR has so far tried and
sentenced former mayor of Taba Jean-Paul Akayesu and former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda life imprisonment, the maximum sentence
the tribunal can impose.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
massacred in central African state of Rwanda in a period of three
months soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died
when his plane was shot down over the capital Kigali in April
1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Russia $500 Million in Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
on Wednesday that it will send 500 million U.S. dollars in food
aid to Russia to stave off a severe shortage and the two countries
will finalize an agreement on the aid.
</P>
<P>
The 3.1 million metric tons of food could make it to Russia
next month if an agreement is reached by the end of the week,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This program will help sustain Russians through a serious food
shortage this winter, as well as their country's continuing
economic distress," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a
regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million metric tons is being provided for free. The
rest is being sold to Russia under a 20-year loan.
</P>
<P>
"We're coming to the aid of a country in need of food aid,"
Lockhart added. "We...have said that if additional food is
required, we will stand ready to work with them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The initial aid agreement is awaiting assurances from Russia
that the food will go to people who need it and not be siphoned
off by officials, Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States also wants Russia's promise that the
food won't face customs duties or other taxes.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate receiving prompt assurances from the government
of Russia on those two matters," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen 50 percent
due to the financial crisis, prompting worries that the poor won't
be able to afford food.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian officials said that the country has an
emergency reserve of only two to three weeks worth of food.
</P>
<P>
Glickman called the aid package a plus not only for the
Russians but for American farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This program will help Russians weather a serious food
shortage this winter and help American farmers and ranchers who
have been hit hard by an agricultural crisis here," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
The aid package includes 100,000 tons of donated commodities to
be distributed by private organizations in Russia to the needy,
such as the elderly and orphans.
</P>
<P>
The other three million metric tons comprise 1.5 million tons
of wheat donated by the U.S. government and 1.5 million tons
bought by the Russians with a U.S. loan.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said specific products included in the package are
still being determined, but it likely will be meats and grains.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The U.S. provided food aid
in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's industrial group Siemens
AG Wednesday announced a major restructuring program to dispose of
businesses with heavy losses.

which have annual sales of 17 billion German marks (10 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The focus of the disposals would be a Siemens entire withdrawal
from its components business and a floatation of the troubled
semiconductor unit on the stock markets.

The latest restructuring program would result in a strong
increase in future earnings, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned About Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 4 (Xinhua) - Spokesman for the
Belgrade-based U.N. liaison office Jay Carter said Wednesday the
U.N. was concerned about ethnic Albanian terrorist activity in
Kosovo because it could have a negative effect on the
normalization of the situation in the province.
</P>
<P>
Carter told a news conference in Belgrade that the United
Nations was concerned about ethnic Albanian terrorists' seizing of
checkpoints whence Serbian police had withdrawn and their refusal
to release two Tanjug reporters abducted on October 18.
</P>
<P>
The two reporters, Nebojsa Radosevic and Vladimir Dobricic,
were sentenced to 60 days each to imprisonment by the outlawed
Kosovo Guerrilla group the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Carter said this could badly affect the normalization of the
situation in Serbia's southern province, especially the return of
Serbs to their homes, and could trigger their exodus from the
province.
</P>
<P>
He also said the United Nations condemned the ruling of the KLA
concerning the two Tanjug reporters, and that the KLA's refusal to
allow officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) to visit them.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had called on KLA spokesman Adem
Demaci and other ethnic Albanian representatives to help ICRC
officials visit the two reporters and to release them immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had welcomed Yugoslav authorities'
compliance with an accord recently reached by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and with
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, which he said had made
possible relief aid deliveries and free movement of international
organizations in the province.
</P>
<P>
Carter said he believed the United Nations would soon play a
positive role in the matter and that pressure on ethnic Albanians
to release the two reporters would soon be stepped up.

JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Three major South African
banks announced Wednesday that they would cut their prime lending
rate by one percentage point to 23.5 percent, South African SABC
television reported.
</P>
<P>
Nedcor took the lead and Standard Bank and ABSA soon followed,
South African Broadcasting Corporation said.
</P>
<P>
Nedcor also lowered its mortgage rate by 0.75 percentage
points to 23.25 percent, bringing it more in line with those of
other banks.
</P>
<P>
The mortgage rate of Standard Bank and ABSA was unchanged at
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
First National Bank is now the only major bank which has not
come up with a similar decision.
</P>
<P>
The banks' move came after the Reserve Bank, central bank of
South Africa, eased its monetary policy by lowering the repo
rate, the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the interest rates might be further
cut pending the improvement of the global financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's rate cut was the second in about three weeks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Palestine Has Met Requirement of Wye Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that the Palestinians have met the requirements of the
Wye accords and Israel's demand for an arrests timetable from the
Palestinians went beyond the deal.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin at a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed last month, already lays out
the procedure to follow if the Israelis want the Palestinians to
make arrests, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke to Netanyahu
about the dispute for the third time in three days on Wednesday.
Dennis Ross, the U.S. special coordinator for Middle East peace
talks, is about to leave for the region, maybe late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a mechanism to deal with that issue (requests for
arrests). It is being dealt with. And we do not believe that the
Palestinians are failing to act in conformity with the agreement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration, trying to mediate in the dispute,
refers to Israel's demands as requests for clarifications.
</P>
<P>
"Clarifications can be sought and may or may not be achieved.
And that doesn't change the fact that in general they (the
Palestinians) have met the requirements of the agreement," the
State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israel put off a cabinet meeting to approve the
Wye deal, saying the Palestinians had failed to give a written
undertaking to arrest 30 Palestinians alleged to have killed
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, denying reports that the United States was moving toward
the Israeli point of view in the dispute, gave a detailed
explanation of the arrest procedure.
</P>
<P>
"The request for arrest and transfer of suspects and
defendants... will be submitted through the mechanism of the joint
Israeli-Palestinian Legal Committee and will be responded...
within the 12-week period," he said, reading from a text of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Requests submitted after the eighth week will be responded to
in conformity -- et cetera, et cetera -- within four weeks of
their submission," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Palestinians will act against these people in a
way that is consistent with the agreement and that will meet the
needs of the prime minister of Israel and the security needs of
</P>
<P>
"We still see no reason... why that need hold up in any way the
implementation of this agreement -- at most by a day or two, but
not in any significant way," he added.

Israel believes that the agreement will only take effect after
being approved by its cabinet meeting.
